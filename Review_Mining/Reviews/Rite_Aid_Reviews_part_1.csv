rating,review
bad,The manager actually pretty laid back and a hard worker it’s the upper management they’re so disrespectful I’m glad they never addressed me while working there because I would’ve told them some stuff
bad,This company didn't offer proper training. Overworked shift leads. Pushed associates and leads to beyond exhausted. Understaffed during peak hours. No flexibility in hours.
bad,"This place sucks and the people are a pain in the rear  I would never recommend this place to anyone who needs a job  "
bad,I would not recommend this place to work the managers have favorites. They talk down to there employees and treat them like they don’t matter while other employees get the nice side. They don’t know how to manage a store and thinks the other people that has been there don’t know what’s they are doing
bad,"They will work you to death. The work week is Sunday - Saturday to them so I ended up working 6 days a week M-F."
bad,Rite Aid is a terrible place to work for. I would never work for them again. The employees treat you like garbage and will stab you in the back. Rite Aid has taught me that there are no heroes in pharmacy.
bad,When i transferred my last year of work was not as fulfilling  . I was always  a floater  . I was trained by the best and would float from many different  stores but the job description was the same not everyone seemed to love there job thats when it gets difficult to work as a team . Just smile and give the customer the best you can give . I loved my job.   I guess 5 years was plenty. Time for a different job.
bad,"I worked there for a year and a half. I moved states, as required by the board of pharmacy in the new state, I had to have a letter from my previous employer stating that i worked there and that I had worked over a thousand hours as a technician. I called and got the secretary and corporate who threatened to withhold that from me and I almost lost my new job in the new state. Management is not worth it. They do not help you."
bad,Corporation based they do not care about you. They weed you out if you ask too many questions. Management are all women and they are bullies. Watch out....
bad,"This was by far the worst company I have ever worked for, I would work over 55 hours a week and told that it was “just the way it had to be” I had to take on many extra responsibilities to make up for lazy management. I worked ten days straight at times because again that was “just the way it had to be” the theft is horrible, the management didn’t listen to any complaints, nothing was handled professionally and there were so many “promises” for advancement that never happened"
bad,I was hired as a store manager and trained at a great location. I was then moved to a horrible neighborhood that was robbed and frequently shoplifted. I did not feel safe there. When voicing concerns with upper management they sent over rent a cops that were unarmed. After dealing with this nonsense and thwarting multiple robbery attempts I was never given a raise or anything. It was just expected. I was always short staffed and often had to unload the entire truck by myself. I was told by my district manager that she was going to move me to a better location because my talents were being wasted. That move did not happen. In fact they gave it to someone that wasn't even tested as a qualified candidate. I left that job as quickly as I possible could. After I worked out my notice they tried to not pay me for my time off. A few months after I left I found out the location actually got closed down for good. I talked to the pharmacist that had been at the location and she left the company as well and is much happier and safer. Absolutely awful company to work for.
bad,I hate it there. Terrible management.  Terrible management.  Terrible management hours terrible.  Pay terrible.  No room for advancing.  Poor training..
bad,"Rite Aide could be a good place to work if it was not closing but the never knowing what time you get off the supervision want even greet you always playing people up against each employees,the supervisors are one of the reason why Riteaid have a big turnover."
bad,I would never go back corporate and management are bad..they do not pay what the job is worth employees are becoming very rude  and plain ghetto... pharmacy is un sanitary the pick pills up off the floor and still give them to patients
bad,"you go home beat up and exhausted and the pay is garbage, no raise "
bad,"This place absolutely SUCKED to work st. The people were arrogant and unhelpful and the work was repetative and grueling."
bad,They pick n choose who they like. And the first time they get wind of your political background if it doesn’t match theirs they turn against you and make up things about u. They do not care about u . Only themselves . Horrible bad juju.
bad,Zero work-life balance with almost impossible goals from district managers that treat you less than a human being. Under paided to do the work of three people.
bad,Every day at Rite Aid was like working with a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off. The staff were incompetent and upper management did not seem to know how to manage at all.
bad,They don’t really appreciate new workers. The union didn’t return my money back and didn’t protect my rights as a worker. Seniority and power is abused.
bad,"When I worked at Rite Aid, hard work was not rewarded it was expected. Supervisor and District Manager rode the backs of Store Managers for their own gain. When promotion offered by vice president, District Manager felt threatened and did his best to discredit manager."
bad,"I would not encourage anyone to apply there for a position.  There was never enough employees to cover all the tasks needed to be completed in this company.  You were held responsible for credit card fraud, even though it was mentioned in CBTs to let the individual walk out the door without interacting with them."
bad,"They tell you they'll  train you to become a picker using an electric pallet Jack but wont one guys been there for 3 years and only got 1 raise, still they never thought him how to use an electric pallet Jack and do the easy work. So basicailly they want new people to do the dirty work while everyone else drives around doing meager work. Not worth anyones time."
bad,"Rite Aid is a corporation. All they care about is numbers. Do more with less is their motto for employees (unless you are in corporate). If you do go for a job, get everything in writing, they will tell you anything."
bad,"By Far the worst company i ever worked for.  Stay away. They dont care about anybody just money.  No work life balance, abused and lied too.   employees are unionized and run the store"
bad,"Worked there for almost 8 years and gave it everything I had, to just be used and abused. And then screwed over. Worthless. I will never work for that company again and I don’t recommend it to anyone."
bad,this job is very easy but very tedious its always something that needs to be done but there is also so much room and opportunity to move up the ladder
bad,The job sucked management sucked they don’t care about their employees Some of the people in management had very nasty attitudes made the work environment very uncomfortable to even ask for help
bad,Very poor management threw out the entire store I wouldnt recommend working here any on the job training they promise never happens your expected to do an online pharmacy schooling that they never give you time to complete so you don't ever get the training you need to get your pharmacy licences
bad,Worst company ever they will not hire security they get robbed on regular basis they open the store with one person they hire children  they left me in the store by myself we constantly have to call district manager to get help
bad,I learned how to manage in the retail store and how to handle customers' concern. the daily task as a supervisor(manager) was basically making sure that customers found what they need. and the hardest part was how to handle customers with obnoxious behavior.
bad,There are favorites and bulling and not enough pay no time off and if you get hurt and on fmla you loose your job they suck as a company they won’t even try to work with you if you have family if your working 7 days a week nobody cares it’s not fair work environment at all
bad,This is by far the worst place i have ever worked at. The management sucks they right you up for anything and they always are puching you to work harder but never get any credit for it.
bad,"Nothing against Rite Aid itself, it's just another corporate blunder than underpays and underappriciates their employees. They don't give enough budget to the stores to hire the appropriate amount of staff so they are constantly overworked and underpaid."
bad,"I worked as a pharmacy technician.  I was supposed to start the online certification to be completed in 6 months.  Instead I was positioned in the cashier mode of the job evertime i worked my shift.  the pharmacy manager was a tyrant. Talking very loud and rude to me in front of customers.. and the other staff ignoring my requests for help.  The actual store manager when i turned my resignation in wished I had told him about the manager before resigning.  I told him it was a race to resign before she fired no apparent reason. I was still interested in working there but not in pharmacy.  he also voiced his concern that  an emmployee. long term had just quit due to the same issues.  Sadly to say i was leaving on the assumption I am rehirable. but I have been applying to this rite aid, but no cals."
bad,They do a poor job at training you. I applied to be a cashier in the front of the store and they put me in the pharmacy with no experience. They got mad if I asked them to re-explain things and expected me to answer customer's questions about their medications even though the managers knew I didn't have any pharmacy experience and didn't know anything about different medications.
bad,I did not enjoy working at this job nor did I like the environment. I would not refer any one to this job it is not work the pay rate that provided this company is not beneficial.
bad,"Just stay away from this company. Constant changes in leadership, broken promises, misuse of corporate workers (unable to resolve problems). Horrible horrible horrible."
bad,"This was absolutely the worst company I ever worked for, mainly because of management, but the company itself wasn’t the best either. No morals. No compassion. My grandfather passed away and I had asked off for a Monday to attend his funeral, and my GM scheduled herself off and scheduled me to open the store. I would request off for family events, birthdays, vacations, etc weeks and even months in advance and my boss would ignore every request, not to mention they work you like a dog for bare minimum pay  terrible workplace"
bad,Not only was the pay minimum wage but you run multiple departments at once and the hours are not consistent. The manager I had was embezzling and stealing and another manager verbally assaulted me in front of customers and then they both filed false reports to get me a write up to be terminated.
bad,"Working at rite aid was the worst working environments  ever had to work in all my many years of career. Sad to say but "" happier  and a lot stress stressed now that no longer there"
bad,"This place does not value their people. they treat you like garbage, over work you with horrible pay. and no room for advancement. and management is rude..."
bad,"This was one of my worst jobs, management was horrible. I hated working in the pharmacy with mean people and customers were not nice either. Would not recommend anyone to work here"
bad,"-I would normally work a noon to close shift, either customer service or stocking items throughout the store, halfway though the shift i would count all the tills in the store and close up the Pharmacy. At the end of the evening i would walk the store finishing up any tasks(backroom stock, freshness, RF unit counts, facing, price changes) Then at closing time i would recount the safe and tills and then gather up all the employees and leave for the evening and lock the front door."
bad,Not organized lack of knowledge for there duty short staffed rude managers not enough hours dirty pharmacy manager rude and disrespectful talk behind people's back
bad,"I have worked in the pharmacy for over 10 years, and I can honestly say I am embarrassed to be here.  Prescriptions are rarely completed on time, leaving cashiers to face angry customers all day. The current management continually gives poor employee performance evaluations, with no motivation to do anything beyond keeping your job. It is a very high stress environment that very few people can function in for long. I don't know about the front end, but STAY AWAY from the pharmacy!"
bad,Upon being hired I was told that I would be schduled for 32hrs per week. I was scheduled for less than 10 hours. Pharmacist other than the manager constantly ask me if I wanted more hours. The managing pharmacist was  extremely difficult to work with. She would stand behind me at times and snap her fingers when I was filling prescriptions. Not ideal place to work.
bad,The best part of working there were my coworkers. They helped pass the time. The duties that were assigned to me didn’t really have to do with my actual job description. The lines at the pharmacy at times were super long. I liked the front store staff better then the pharmacy manager/ pharmacists.
bad,I applied at rite aid to find a job which I thought would work much better with my schedule for school and having kids. I've been there for a few months and its been a night mare. I asked for extra hours when I was on break from school and they kept me at my lower range for hours. I was told if i cant work a certain schedule i would not receive any hours. When I come to work I already want to leave. They have scheduled me to work on the floor so i know the store better but they seem to have their favorites and put me back on the cash register
bad,years ago rite aid cared about employees now they are survival mode to keep doors open and closing stores. I was left alone because I knew what I was doing but talking to store managers and seeing the way they are treated we are just numbers in the system. rite aid doesn't treat employees fairly
bad,This person has never worked at the store level.  She has no idea how retail works. She leads with threats and intimidation. She literally threated to fire anyone who could not make it to work during a snowstorm.  She wanted us to walk.
bad,"You can't have a family and work for this company. It really does depends on your manager how the store is ran. Pay raises are annually and extremely horrible no matter how hard you work. Plan to work all holidays, nights and weekends. Not enough employee on each shift. Very high turnover. They don't offer good to little benefits. Training is horrible as well. This company doesn't value their employees."
bad,Rite Aid is a very low paying job. I went to the interview preparing for it and looked very nice for the interview. the interview was disappointing n I remember it being my first one and was only asked like 2 questions. I ended up working for rite aid for 2 and a half years and I did more than my fair share of work I did lots of manger jobs to a point where I was asked to move up and got employee of the month I did not take the position  because of the low pay and the fact that I was already doing everything the shift supervisors were but I wasn't gonna get my days off taken away because of their lack of flexibility. I'm thankful for everything I learned while I was there but its not the best company to work for .
bad,"Drug stores are supposed to have some sort of safety to them."
bad,First off when hired I let the manager know I had a few restrictions to my schedule and was told that would be no problem. Then a couple weeks in I started being harassed because I was the bitten of the totem and should not have been allowed to have restrictions the manager even went so far as to say if my restrictions stayed I would be put to working weekends only. The stress and demand put on all employees is the wors.
bad,You pay for union but they don't follow union rules. Union does nothing to help. Do not routinely give breaks and lunch. Do not follow seniority rules. Boss plays favorites. Bullies and gossip. Very unprofessional.
bad,No amount of money is worth working for a company like this. They verbally abuse you and the district manager would curse and belittle employees in front of customers.
bad,"Constantly working 10 hour day, horrible management, don't fix problems, unsafe, no understanding of the expectations of the work the workers are expected to do, prorep system is a joke and is setup for failure"
bad,"Minimum wage"
bad,"As a cashier, they expect you to do everything, not just taking care of customers, but restocking front half of the store and most of the time you are all alone up front at the register."
bad,"As for retail, most aren't worth the time beyond seasonal. Not the worst to work for, but definitely top 5 worst. I wouldn't recommend this company unless you urgently need something quick and have little to no other options. Look elsewhere."
bad,"Very low pay, work overload, company shows no value to its employees, corporate does little as far as safety of its employees, no accountability, very few work incentives, especially if you are not assistant manager or higher"
bad,"Management told me they'd give me 90 days to bring up my productivity numbers but fired me the next day.One day, I passed out at while working and had to go to the hospital and had to stay home the next day. The day I came back to work, management gave me an absent point and said ""Remember the day you passed out at at.work? You have a point for that"" so if I died they'd give me a point"
bad,"POD teams don't listen to enployees, only to the SM and all they care about is you look good in numbers and quotas. Work and personal life does not go well as a manager. SM doesn't do anything but work by pointing fingers."
bad,Staff does not work well with others. They promise pay rates that they don’t actually give. There is no room to move up in pharmacy beside a technician.
bad,"Union is of no use, 2% raise every year, big deal.  Minimum wage to start, never merit based increase in wage. Overworked to the point of exhaustion, no breaks, terrible conditions, hours cut, staff cut, extra work piled on, premiums for insurance go up 10% every year meaning your paycheck gets smaller because your pay raise is less than the increase.  Someone doesn't know basic math skills at corporate and unions headquarters."
bad,"Way too many chiefs who do absolutely nothing and not enough indians who  honestly handle all the workload.  More stress than it should be. There is alot of favoritism and unless youre willing to kiss some serious butt, dont even think about getting any type of promotion.  Do yourself a favor and steer clear.  Wished I would have left years ago"
bad,Everyone who is management does not care about your mental or physical health. If you are desperate for a job apply somewhere else in town. It's a petty and toxic enviorment. You will not want to stay. The store manager sees you as replaceable.
bad,"I worked for rite aid for 5 plus years and I really enjoyed working with almost all the staff, the problem was definitely the store mngr and her lack of care for the store and staff. The gossip truly started with mngr and all staff was talked about in such a negative and extremely insulting way on a daily basis."
bad,Never had a worse job my life everyone was horrible I'm glad that the company went under because I would never want anyone on you to ever work there under any circumstances
bad,"They don't have the sense God gave a Billy Goat to even figure out how to keep the garbage emptied; this from a company supposedly putting ""Health & Safety"" first, with a Pharmacy, no less.  VERY shocking."
bad,"There were frequent personality conflicts between store manager and employees."
bad,Don’t waste you time with this low paying job! You have to work 40-60 hours per week and you only get paid for 40.  There is no help available because no one wants to work here!!! So that means management has to but you also have to get your work done.   It’s not a good system for work life balance at all. The DM has unrealistic expectations as to what can get done!!! If you don’t believe just walk into any store and ask any associate what they thinkme ask anyone in any storeme you can walk into ants
bad,Do not get paid enough. Barely any hours. Front staff was great but pharmacy manager was horrible. Only worked night because i started as a high school student would not allow any change once graduated.
bad,"No direction. Always short staffed constantly chasing your tail. Never a straight answer from rvp  Shelly meanest woman I ever met ,her nose is so high in the air she's ugly too ,has no idea what retail is about"
bad,"This company offers peanuts to their employees and does not approve overtime when necessary. They work the employees to death, which is not properly compensated."
bad,"I was treated unfairly, discrimination and harassment from co-workers  as well as management. My district leader was also a total buffoon, and was discriminating against me due to my socioeconomic status."
bad,"Avoid at all costs, the details that leads me to this conclusion are as follows. My number one issue with working for them is how the in store managers treat there employees. I have never worked in such a dysfunctional and hate mongering environment in my entire life. No one ever had a good thing to say about anyone or anything, pay was for sure messed with by the managers shaving off hours on paychecks. Retail comes with its own set of challenges with pros and cons just like any other job, however, Rite Aid somehow always had ways to spread mutual discontentment and suffering."
bad,Working for Rite Aide was a fraud. You poured yourself into your work only to be disrespected. The management is awful. No wonder the stores are closing and up for sale!
bad,"This company is horrible, lowest wages out of the major 3, and they have dummied down the field of Pharmacy Technician so far that they will hire just anyone and trust them with patient's safety and information. The RPH's spend more time on their cell phones than helping with patient's then complain about how much work didn't get done."
bad,"You could tell that rite aid was scrambling to find out a way to refrain from going bankrupt. Vaccines became more of a focus rather than customer service. Not only did they keep adding to the work load everyday but  there is no incentive for doing so. I had to learn how to do everything myself and had no good managment to teach me anything."
bad,Lied to about jobs many many times and liars about promotions.  All they wanted was you to work all the time while cutting hours and do meaningless tasks to get more sales
bad,"I got tired of working there because they dont treat their employees well nor do they give us good benefit, the union has to literally fight for any type of benifits"
bad,Being a pharmacist and having bosses that are not is insulting. They are jealous of your salary and have no idea what a pharmacy should do for its patients. When they are out to get you they manufacture issues which are lies. Which is why they will be bankrupt by the end of the year
bad,didn’t enjoy it at all I just really needed a steady job . Prolly would never go back the area I worked in was also horrible under the management I had
bad,"No one has a clue what is going on! There is no stability at the corporate level. I went into this job thinking that I could do this for a while. All of the sudden, my efforts were no longer recognized."
bad,"The upper management is ruining this company. They do not care about employees, they make so many changes that nothing runs smoothly because as soon as staff gets used to it, they change it, Do not recommend."
bad,"This is the warehouse, it is hard labor. You stand on your feet all day and sweat all day. If you would like this job, just make sure it is the right one for you."
bad,Runaway!! This place is total kaoss! Management changes by the day and everyone is busy running over each other by the minute.  Run the other way!! This is a toxic place to work!
bad,"You must meet a quota. It's fast pace. Frequent Injuries. Poor commucation, and they dont give full break times. If you have never worked in a factory/fulliment center it will be challenging."
bad,Besides the low pay the working environment is fast paced and enjoyable. Management works with your availability. The customers are mainly regulars. The pay needs to be increased
bad,"Riteaid has very poor management. Only interested in bottom line."
bad,Customers are often rude and mean other employees as well paid the bareminum to be treated terribly all day long and expected smile while being completely stressed out
bad,I took a job at my local Rite Aid out of convenience.  This was the most demoralizing job I have ever had.  Woefully underpaid as they do not care one bit for expendable employees.
bad,"Super stressful, the manger expects you to do job for 4 people because they do not hire anyone. You always run around in a stress. And they do not pay you enough at all !!!!"
bad,"If you're happy being stuck in one position then go for it but, if you want to advance this isn't the place for you. They'll lead you on then pull the rug out from under you at the last minute. None of the stores are staffed sufficiently  so they always want people to travel sometimes over an hour away."
bad,"Terrible manager that is never at her own store.  No recognition for work well done. Lousy pay, lack of trust, poor work environment. Would not recommend working at Rite Aid."
bad,"The work is very Stressful, they require 100% and plus but they never recognize your work and effort. Management plays favorites. "
bad,"Don't expect any benefits if you're part time. Don't get sick either, you're only allowed personal time and even when you use that its held against you. You better work at 100% all the time too, that's the minimum for productivity. Management is terrible, a lot of unqualified people in positions of power for no reasons. You need your manager for something? Good luck finding them they disappear a lot. They seem to get a paycheck to smoke outside and eat in their offices. There's regular workers on the floor that know more than most management. Common sense doesn't rule here. There's a lot of rules ask someone that's been there a long time they can help you out. The hiring process doesn't really go over them and how they are held against you."
bad,"I worked for Rite Aid for 4.5 years. In general I loved my job. My favorite part was customer service. I really enjoyed talking to my customers and getting to know them. However, I did a lot of work for this company and never felt that my work was appreciated. I was only getting $11 per hour, while a Rite Aid store down the street was paying their employees a lot more even the cashiers. Sometimes we would have cashier from that store come and help us. It was not fair that I had to train them and they were getting paid more then I was."
bad,When I first started there everyone was like family...very friendly environment! Lunches were only 30 minutes which was awful. The pay was awful 8.45 an hour for cashier. No holidays off no sick time no vacations. You literally have to put in years to get any type of benefits. Part time workers get nothing just a lunch break. When new manager came in she was awful and rude ...literally everybody quit eventually the place closed down
bad,Sucks! Rite Aide only thinks about the upper management that are not in the store. They could care less about the employees that work in the stores. There is nothing enjoyable about the job.
bad,"In the beginning, it was okay. I liked it. Staff was nice, customers were okay. But then new management came along and everything went to the doghouse. Worst experience in my life. I was stressed daily. A lot of the staff wanted to leave. Nothing was changing even though we asked for it."
bad,Horrible place to work. No one talks to you unless you SPEAK spanish. PEOPLE SHOOT UP dope in the parking lots. Management is lazy. Everyone tries to get everyone in trouble. Not a good environment for a place if you want to move up. Only good for kids 18-21.
bad,The management is terrible and you get told what to do even if you are doing it correctly you aren’t doing it correctly enough. I can honestly say that this was one of the worst jobs I’ve ever had.
bad,"Understaffed, overworked and underfunded. Customers mean and nasty to you and your manager does care. Most pharmacists are entitled and rude. Reasonable with scheduling."
bad,Worked as Pharmacy technician. Assisted the pharmacist in  completing  the task.  pharmacist was very nice and enjoyed working and talking to customers.
bad,It sucks to work at Rite Aid they don't care about you. you get paid for 45 hours eventhough you work 60. Run away from any offer they give you. Run fast
bad,"If your a picker at Rite Aid  you have to get good with the leads, they definitely play favoritism, if your new coming on board, & your not quick at picking , they will outcast you(theemployees)! See the leads already have their own crew they can depend on & know the stuff will get picked on time, they don’t like it when new people come on & believe me they let you know!!! The management really needs"
bad,They gave and did nothing for part time workers they change the rules without telling anyone I was there for over a year with no vacation time at all!! I worked 5 days a week 5 hr days.....I think I should of gotten some time off
bad,"400 + Layoffs Announced 3/13/19"
bad,"There was nothing good about this job. They keep you at 34.5 hours a week in order to avoid offering benefits, the scheduling situation is a mess, and they continually demand more from their employees without meaningful compensation. As a member of management I was barely getting $9/hour."
bad,After 7 years I wasn't even making 10 an hour the managers expect so much from you  it's inpossible to do the work they give you while running the register. The benefits are horrible it's basically a discount you can expect a bill Everytime but they won't give you time off to see a doctor they give you 20% off which is the employee discount but they also give that discount to anyone who spends enough in a year to earn it so basically they give you nothing they don't care about you if you have a problem good luck calling hr or the district manager they all suck and just want money
bad,Rite Aid doesn't care about there employees your are worked hard long hours because your always short staff and underpaid  I have worked for Rite Aid for many years and never could accumulate vacation sick or personal time they don't beleive in promoting or giving proper training then expect you to make the impossible possible even when them in corporate knows it is impossible themselves they good part about the job was the costumers
bad,"Exceedingly high demands are now being forced upon store management with no compensation in payroll, training, or wage rates. Unrealistic and unattainable goals being set at corporate which prevent wage increases for every level of employment"
bad,"The Rite Aid I worked at was very unfair with their promotions. Management promoted their friends instead of by seniority or the ability to do the job. "
bad,"they sucked, they lied, i would never tell anyone to work there, if i could i would go back in time so i could not work there, worst thing   i ever did was work there"
bad,"I worked all 8 of my hours standing at a computer, ate my lunch standing, only had a few 15 min breaks. Not a great company to work for as a pharmacy tech. At least not in Cape May, NJ."
bad,I would not recommend them to anyone I cared about! All about numbers and no thanks to the employees and we have the most micro manager I have ever worked for! Many reasons why this man should not be in this Pharmacy Manager position but Rite Aid doesn’t seem to care until a law suit happens.
bad,"Very bad company, very abusive. They have in writing about anti abuse and anti retaliation policies but they do not follow it. I got fired for standing up for a safe work environment."
bad,"This company is not a good company to work for. They don’t like to pay, they will pay a wellness ambassador $10 or $11 an hour and pay the techs $7 or $8 an hour like we are in the 90s. This job is designed for people in high school honestly"
bad,"Management does not care about employees. Too much stress for not enough pay. empty promises though, plenty of them. Leaving there was the best decision ive ever made. on to bigger and better things!"
bad,"A typical day at work was consistently the same. I worked as a cashier. I was responsible for providing excellent customer service by assisting customers, assessing needs, answering inquiries, and resolving complaints in a calm and professional manner, engaging with customers in a friendly and efficient manner while completing sales transactions"
bad,I have been a pharmacist for 25 years... They fired me... wage was too high... they do not care about their employees at all... All focus is the bottoms line
bad,"I felt like a slave when I worked for Rite Aid. I was a cashier in the front but literally had to do everything like be the stock person, clean and sometimes work in the pharmacy even though my job was actually to be in the front end. The supervisors leave all the real work for the cashiers to do and they mostly do bare minimum."
bad,"I went to work at Rite Aid under a different manager to start with. She was very comprehensive, and never wanted us to feel as though our work was our life. "
bad,This workplace was to much drama. No room for advancement. They had mandatory overtime. Very stressful. Very demanding. Shifts start at 5 days a week then 6 days then 7 days. No set end time!!!!
bad,Working as a staff pharmacist was very difficult. Minimal staff with no support from upper management. 12 hrs shifts are difficult. Coworkers are wonderful though!
bad,"Working for Rite Aid Corporation was a challenge due to a stressful environment and minimal staffing. In addition, support from management was not provided."
bad,No direction or purpose. Upper management is always trying to pass the blame. Rite Aid shows no loyalty and tries to get people fired for the most asinine of reasons.
bad,Over worked and underpaid and treated like garbage. Horrible mgmt....Usually only 2 people working at closing and it's busy. No raises.....Dead end job really.
bad,The worse company to work for. no work life balance. no team work. if i didn't need the paycheck to live I would have left already. Really not what i expected.
bad,If you are looking to make money while in high school then go for this job. Do not waste your time unless you are going for pharmacy school in the future.
bad,Truly productive workplace and I truly learned professional training I have truly developed as a pharmacy technician working in this environment the retail aspect has truly helped me learn to know the community as well
bad,I was grossly under appreciated and I was given just under the hours needed to be allowed benefits. I was there for 3 years and never earned a single vacation hour
bad,"Some of the management were nice and good at there position. But the store manager was terrible. All i learned was how to not get stressed when its busy. I would have a line going to the back of the store and be the only cashier. Typically i would ring up customers all day, clean ice cream after we close and do go backs. Occasionally i would have to clean the restrooms and stock ice cream and the beer."
bad,We gave alot of years to this company and when push came to shove they shoved us all out the door- an entire department. Very talented people but they didn’t care bc this company loves mediocrity.
bad,If a regular associate fine but as manager not good at all. Supervisors and managers cannot do required duties with limited staff on hand. No coverage for holidays nor long weekends
bad,Hours change weekly.  Disrespectful management.  Everyone hates working here and it shows.  The pharmacist will often go off on tirates if she is having a bad day.  Management won;t do anything about her because they can't keep a pharmacist working here.
bad,I did not enjoy working here. On the first day I was scrutinized by my boss for my shirt being too bright blue and not navy enough. It was a navy blue shirt.
bad,More than enough I had to bring my kid to work because the next employee would be 2 hours late. Management was weak and there was no consideration for availability change. I worked night shift and there would be no security so we were constantly threatened by shoplifters. Even the managers hated working here and the store would be in horrible conditions EXCEPT when there was a visit. Whenever we had one of these famous visits they would double our responsibilities and get angry when we wouldn't be able to finish. Hope this place fires all the management and gets the change it needs.
bad,"Place was filthy, always busy, little pay, management sucks... time management sucks, people tend to slack, they give u a $0.50 cent raise I think every year or so. They’re really bad."
bad,My experience with this company was not very good at all. now i do recommend this job to anyone who enjoys loss prevention or needs a job that doesn't require a security license. no room for moving up and sell you dreams. terrible managers and district leaders. no HELP apprehending shoplifters be very careful.
bad,"The job is very unprofessional with the irony of my district leader coming from the back ground of HR. I would partner Up with the store manager, but he doesn't even know how to run his own store with his own associates complaining about his his work methods."
bad,"The upper management in rite aid has recently change and it is horrible. Many times it feel as if the store employees are on their own; with little to no help from the corporate team members. Pay is not competitive and most if not all stores seem to be grossly under staffed. Leaving store level associates scrambling. While upper management does nothing to fill positions. "
bad,"Management doesn't work together, this make it very difficult because the work culture is negative and selfish. Very hot and difficult to work there. No appreciation at all."
bad,"bad place to work, poor management, they don't care about their employees only about what the employees can do for them. No regard to personal life, No help once they see you are a great worker they abuse it to save money."
bad,"I have been with the company for many years and its getting worse. They preach a culture of caring for customers and associates. However, corporate only wants sales and it doesn't matter how much pressure it builds on a store manager. They truly don't care because district leaders and regional leaders truly don't care about anyone underneath their roles. They look for acceptance from higher management and do not like to bring up problems. So what happens? Nothing. No one says a thing because they can make your life hard. So everyone becomes a puppet. We just nod our heads and say yes no matter what. I once brought up many issues and it went up to regional and I essentially was told to stop complaining in the nicest and most educated way possible. There are no resources for our stores. There is NO on-boarding process. DO NOT expect to get trained properly. It is sink or swim."
bad,Management is horrible and the hours wasn't enough for employees.  Rules always changed when new managers came in . When we needed help it was never given
bad,I wish I didn't leave it was close to home. The discounts were the best I liked working at night some of the managers were great .they did not train you on learning the way you had to learn on your own . You have to pay union dues every two weeks that part was very expensive
bad,Felt like the big guys did not care for the hard working employees who fill the big wigs pockets. when you had problems your voice was never heard and nothing was solved
bad,A lot of hours to work management salaries based no overtime pay they were days you worked 14-16 hours shifts and needed to open in 4-6 again back at the end the stafff made more a hour then management.
bad,"I don;t want to fill this out indeed why are you making me actually do this. I worked here very briefly and they just stopped scheduling me. The pharmacy manager didn't like me. There indeed, are you happy?"
bad,"This place is the ultimate in not caring about their employees. I didn't last there very long, and everyone there seems unhappy. Wouldn't recommend working there, ever."
bad,I didn't like the work environment. I loved being around others and making people feel good. I think the management was a good department but some of the staff wasn't pleasant. I learned how to be a better team leader.
bad,"No teamwork effort was never applied and no shown appreciation in no way, Working for that company was a nightmare. Disrespectful from management as well."
bad,"the structure of rite aid and management style can only be described as terrible. personal preferences and opinions are the way your work is determined. does not provide you with any tools to perform your job, no training, no staffing. i worked in a pharmacy with no pharmacy technicians for almost 6 moths and my superiors were ok putting my license at risk and putting the public health at risk ."
bad,"The worst example of an American employer that there could possibly be. It was actually a relief for the community of Rome, NY when the Distribution Center went out of business."
bad,"rulely.not a good experience for me."
bad,"As an employee, I was hired during a time when about five employees quit because of management and how the customers treated the employees. The manager at the time was ok, but never really helped with the customers. Currently, the technicians do whatever they want while there's really no one back there managing the team, even if there is a manager on duty."
bad,"They care more about profits then their own employees working for them.  At the time that I worked for them they would always do something different then what they said.  Anyone, who worked for them more than a couple years, they tried figuring ways to make them quit or fire them so they can hire lower paying employees."
bad,"Hired six months ago only to find out that the company is going out of business due to bankruptcy. Poor pay, no chance of promotions, poor training, and poor processes."
bad,No one in my entire store liked the manager. I will never work at this particular Rite Aid again. All of my coworkers and even the Pharmacy workers did not like our front end manager
bad,"This company is not the best employer to work for as a pharmacy technician or any other position. There is no growth for technicians, management is terrible, employees that slack are not held responsible for their lack of duties, the workplace can be unpleasant, and the saddest part of this behind the scene horror story is that the patients suffer."
bad,"long hours, no staffing bad pay and scheduling.  Upper management is no help.  Overall people were good but hard to keep due to poor compensation.  Too much work too little time and help.  Expect to do everything yourself."
bad,Wasn't a very satisfying job. No way to move up in the company. No training or improvements on systems. Job was very mundane and became boring really fast.
bad,"At Walmart, we believe that quality healthcare is the foundation to a better life. To do this we provide our Pharmacists the tools and resources needed to deliver quality healthcare every day. For over 27 years, we’ve maintained our spot at the forefront of the industry’s technological advancements. Between our locations, offers of training and the chance for advancement, we provide opportunity for Pharmacists like no one else. At the end of the day, we’re simply a team dedicated to helping others save money, so that they can live better, healthier lives."
bad,"They hire you only as a temp till they find someone cheaper. There is no opportunities for advancement as they want managers to be the warehouse workers and pull loads of shipment. Every week, you have to remove and hang the same discount tags on the same goods with different dates. It is ridiculous and could be done as a brand, instead it is done per item. Huge waste of resources and bad for the environment. Store manager plays double accounting and makes supervisors and assistant to do the same. He pulls money from the evening to balance deposits for the morning, switching it from front end to the pharmacy. He doesn't know his customers or care about their needs and keeps items in the store that arent sellable and doesn't order ones that sell well in our area. Nail polish in his nail counter sits for ears and separates and he doesn't want to process it to damage, even though it is bad advertisement for those brands."
bad,A typical day at work can either go really well or really south. I've learned its best to rely on yourself than others. In terms of management its based on the company if they can't find anyone else and they give it to anyone whether they are skilled or not since the state will fine the store within 30 days.
bad,There isn't a lot of payroll for stores in Maryland so this means you work twice as hard to make sure tasks are 100% complete while still trying to help customers and make sure they are happy and content and making are the Store is running smoothly. Some managers are great while others can be very vocal and mean right in front of customers.  The Districts are a mess they have no structure or foundation and the stores are completely a mess
bad,"stressful environment. employer talks down to employees and if they can't work one day they won't get worked for weeks at a time, speaking from a personal experience. employees can't defend themselves when getting cussed out by cuustomers"
bad,"I worked here while in college. I was there for 9 years and when I left I was only making 8.25 after 9 long years working there. Crazy, they didn't provide any water we had to pay for everything."
bad,Did not enjoy working with this company cooperate was rude majority of the time and did not care for their employees at all. The hours about drive you crazy and you work almost every holiday.
bad,"this company is defunct  long time  goner they cheated  every  body f their  precious time they invested in them I ma glad  that they  went  under and got bought over  by walgreens and alberston they  are cheating employers they cheated almost  every   10 x I n u s a  plus suppliers plus insurance  companies , it is time that   some  cover  their chaisty  like  women ,    some   one had to marry  them to    so they pay the  suppliers what they owed the  public and the suppliers ,they re  bad luck to them themselves  ,  to  the employees and their families  and their investors they ex presidents  have  been jailed for frauds , I am   glad  that I   did  some   whisle blowing to  cost them  millions in penalties soon their   names  will disappear  for allthe  frauds they  created   for themselves and  their investrs  they made them loose teir   investing  mney fmr   55,00$ /  stock to  l,57 $  per stock"
bad,"SUPER LOW pay rates, and you will barely get any hours. Its a great starter job for kids, but adults you need to look somewhere else and grow in a better company."
bad,over worked and under paid they expect you to run a multi-million dollar company with a pay rate of 9.25 barely enough to make ends meet.the pharmacist are lazy and rude and disrespectful to customers.
bad,"pay was good but upper management did not appreciate the employees one bit, you were watched like a criminal more than half of the managers we related in some way"
bad,"Rite Aid treats employees very poorly. Low pay, low hours and a complete lack of any company support at the store level. Very unprofessional place. "
bad,I had very few days that I enjoyed going to work. The store manager was unproductive and very reluctant to help assist with any problems that the pharmacy had.
bad,"The pay is extremely low, they don't appreciate their workers. Rite Aid has the most ridiculous rules ever and they just suck honestly. I wouldn't recommend it."
bad,the managers are rude and talk about you behind your back. they use your personal information as references on how bad someone else is doing with their work and if anything goes wrong the pharmacist will automatically blame as an excuse on why things aren't done properly
bad,"Rite Aid pays their front end clerks $4 more than they do their pharmacy technicians who literally hold the life of the consumers in their hands. They do not value hard work, there is no reward system, and again the pay is nothing to raise a family on."
bad,poor management at the time
bad,Rude customers. Bias Manager. Area in which store was located was unsafe. Some days I close alone. All mornings I opened alone. Very dangerous if someone were to rob me.
bad,"Cooperate expected a certain number of rx a day and that expectation had to be met regardless, they made mistakes and blamed anyone, no respect from namangers"
bad,"it was extremely slow most days"
bad,Our management team did not work together as a team. Cooperate was not checking up on us to make sure everything is running the way its supposed to be ran. I do a lot for the little pay that they pay me.
bad,"only good for experience  or a  young student"
bad,"I was a cashier, but because of the lack of organization, I was given duties that a manager would usually have. The management was terrible and never got anything done which is why it was left on me and other cashiers."
bad,"Just don't! Just say ""no"" and keep walking. The Rite Aid company is not worth what little time you have on this Earth. Go to CVS, not sure if they will be worth it but i know whos not"
bad,"There is absolutely nothing good about this place. They are leaders in empty words. By that I mean they will tell you they will look into something and never get back to you again. If your looking to get into pharmacy, don't go to rite aid. Unless you like poor management, fake co-workers, and very low pay."
bad,"Didn't enjoy working with the crew at a particular location. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for them, there wasn't anything hard about the work it was the co workers."
bad,All I can say I now look at the employers differently since day one had such a bad experience. The managers are bullies and treat you badly! Can’t believe it
bad,I was in a bad situation that was not right and i had to use union and was a bunch of lies and just got pushed off i would never give them a time of day to work or shop here
bad,"bad management , very poor pay, team members were great but no one ended up staying there long. promised breaks and wouldn't get them. never out on time."
bad,"I worked as a cashier and put up stock when the truck came in. I closed up the store and cleaned up, straightened merchandise, sweep the floor and locked up the store."
bad,"I enjoyed working at Rite Aid because of the nice staff and the customers. A work day was generally busy with dealing with customers and also with the daily tasks that needed to be done. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co workers and having a good relationship with them, as well as seeing nice customers daily."
bad,Poor poor management! Brand new pharmacists do not need to be managing a pharmacy straight out of school!!! They do not have the skills to apply to that role so fresh from a classroom. There are exceptions to it however the majority of new graduates do not have any other experience in a pharmacy other than their rotations...that’s simply not enough. Coworkers are defeated...no great compensation...even with great experience. the only reason to stay here is if you have no other option or choice...
bad,Just bad management and the way they go at things and they pay very poorly for as much work as they want you to do.people are not very friendly. The hardest part of the job was working long hours and them not having a promising time off and not having a option on overtime.
bad,Don't do it. It's just a total FUBAR. I reget to the Pharmacy Manager as the Visiting Manager as they only stay 2-3 months each. On 4th manager in one year. This company is falling apart at the seams from headquarters down. Stay away. Run.
bad,Disorganized. Worst employees run the show due to ineffective store managers. Assistant Manager is title only. Have no real power. Bad job if you get a weak store manager.
bad,"Rite Aid is not a company you can advance with, they over work and under pay their employees. I would not recommend this company for anyone. I worked as a pharmacy technician and I loved doing my job, but never with this company again."
bad,"Management is horrible , don’t pay the loss prevention agents good. Dlpm as well as store managers treat workers unfairly. Rite aid is corrupt ! Run while you can , I was unfairly mistreated and fired. I would sue this company !!! Karma Got back to them, because that’s why employees such as management and loss prevention agent steal from the company !!"
bad,"- Stocking shelves, pricing items for future sales"
bad,Not worth the effort .might make a few more dollars for working holidays. Poor and immature management. Inconsistent hours. working days off but you could never call out.
bad,"it was one of the worst places i have ever worked at. little to no training, in the time i was there i was made to train 6 other people one of which was a manager and that was not my job, never got anything for that but yelled at when i refused to be responsible for others while only getting paid minimum wage and not having a title. every time i brought a simple problem that could have been fixed very easily to management i was always told ""its not your job"". caught multiple people stealing and got in trouble for doing something about it (i simply told the person i saw what they had done and ask them to leave the store and not come back) got into trouble almost everyday cause people who were friends with my ex would complain about something i had done in most cases whatever it was i had supposedly done couldn't be proven or more then a couple times i wasn't even working that day but still got reprimanded for it. no one follows the rules especially the management i was stuck up front on the register for 90% of my time at that place and promised advancement but was over looked for a raise and promotion twice and even trained the guy they hired instead of giving me the job to add insult to injury. all and all the company is run by people who clearly never leave there office or do real work they just sit around and do nothing all day but still get paid loads of money for it, must be nice to get paid to be useless. would never work at any company owned by them again and tell everyone about my time there to make sure no one i know goes to work there either"
bad,the San Diego locations are horrible places to work very unorganized and rude people. I was hired to replace someone they considered incompetent who was on leave I didn't find this out until the end of my time being there.Once they realized they couldn't fire her because she was covered by the union I was let go. I basically went in to work and and sighed people up for their rewards program and encouraged the elder community to get flu shots. Other than that there was no outreach or anything the ad implies. Honestly you might as well be a cashier. I have a degree in Public Health and accepted the position to further my experience . They didn't even want to pay me for having a degree or actual work experience I was making $12 an hour. I highly do not recommend work for them in any aspect!
bad,I felt this terribly ran company was holding me back so I am searching for a better and bigger job! I have been working here for almost 2 years and never really enjoyed the job.
bad,Inconsistent hours and bad wages. Expected too much out of a minimum wage employee and expected you to wear more hats than were initially told about at hire. Would not recommend anyone working for this company at all .
bad,"One of my worst job experiences. Poor management, cut throat associates, lack of teamwork and job advancement. Even corporate is unprofessional they make so many mistakes."
bad,"i loved most of the people i worked with, i enjoyed going to work on some days. i learned pharmacy tech work. the pharmacy manager was not good, she picked favorites, made me work full-time hours when i was part-time and gave me no benefits. knowing they screwed me over time after time was the hardest part of the job and led me to finally quit when really i was good at what i did and never wanted to leave, and i would love to work in a pharmacy again."
bad,"They pay terrible, train worse, and there is no advancement. Its a great part time temp job for a kid. I did way more than my position entailed and was never promoted or compensated correctly."
bad,RiteAid would be good for older people who need something very slow and not challenging its just very outdated and doesn't seem like much of a company anymore.
bad,"The job is awful and the hours are too, one day you could be working 5 hours then the next 12. One month you could be working 30 hours then 60 hours a week the management staff does bot care and nor do the people. Find somewhere smarter to work"
bad,i wouldn't recommend working there. employees don't have a good attitude and constantly complain about their jobs and wouldn't work and blame other for their problems or they would bring their personal problems to work.
bad,the pharmacist is a s8xual predator. i went to store management more than once and nothing was done! i found a new job as quickly as possible and left
bad,"it was not the best place to work at as the management do not care about the employees, they just cared of their slary and bonuses. they kept shifting me from store to store ."
bad,Very poor organization . Management leaves a lot to be desired . They do not train you properly to be able to complete your job in a timely manner . The people that work on the floor are very helpful but still does not help the fact that they do not give proper training
bad,This company is the absolute worse to work at they dont know pharmacy laws they go back and fourth they want to please the customers so much that it potentially endangers the staff. The district manager said well if somebody wants to steal let them. This company has no well trained management the district manager is very rude and spiteful and not professional. All the stores are short staffed and makes it that much harder to work.
bad,A good place to work just in my opinion for all the work they want a person to do they should pay way more exspecially for overnight. But its a good start off job for a person but i would not recommend working here if you use to getting paid 10 and up cause you wont last long.....
bad,"If you do not fit a certain mold, they try to find ways to fire you, make your days awful, and treat you differently. You could work as hard as you can and you would not make them happy. They will fire you if you do not meet a certain rate. And that rate is nearly impossible. So you could start there full time but you will be fired after a couple of months. It's the worst job I have ever had."
bad,"No one should have to work here. Too much screaming, yelling, demands and useless task.  Huge risk of being robbed/killed by being left alone for shifts.  No breaks."
bad,The workplace was horrible and very very uncomfortable. Managers was stealing money from vault and blaming cashiers. Corporate took so long to respond to issues all in all i would NEVER Recommend anybody working there
bad,I worked at rite aid in the pharmacy and it was the worst ever. Almost every one ended up quitting. Then it was  understaffed. Benefits don’t kick in till you work there a year and they do not tell you that. Mangers has there favorites and talked about everyone behind their backs. The schedule didn’t come out till two days before the next work week. People are rude and nasty. It’s all standing and sometimes didn’t even get breaks because there would be a pharmacist and a tech and that’s it. We were always behind on things. And it’s just horrible
bad,"Management is terrible and petty, if they don't like you they will mess with your hours. If your around people with a good vibe it will be a good experience. If not, the store and customers are a trip."
bad,most enjoyable was working with customers. management was hard to deal with because their lack of compassion and inability to communicate on a intellectual level.
bad,Worked for the company since 2009 no career advancements and a constant revolving door. Poor management and placement. Not big into to new ideas and they aren't a fan of women in their corporate.
bad,As soon as i'd unlock my register and immediately have to attack a long line of customers. After rush to go backs or stocking. Not enough time in my scheduled time to fill and clean the store. Consistent write ups because they don't give enough coverage and time.
bad,"OVerworked, underpaid, under appreciated, work too many hours, some days with no help. Very pushy company. Always wants more & more work from you without adding more tech help. They never care if you're stuck working by yourself, but God forgive you if you make an error. They keep track of errors & tio many (5) and they fire you. Extremely demanding company. They care nore about the almighty dollar than their employees. And forget about getting a day off. They always tell you they don't have anyone so you can take time off. No lunch breaks, not allowed to sit on a stool, and you're lucky if you get to run to the bathroom once in a 14 hour shift!!!"
bad,"very unprofessional, the managers had their favorites. medications were given to customers for free left and right, staff was rude, racist, and the pay was terrible"
bad,Rite Aid employs technicians as your boss??!!!  They are unfair in their hiring practices.  The district managers give you absolutely no support when you first start as a new pharmacist.  They regularly put you in a busy store by yourself without any technician help.
bad,"You are paid minimum wage, and if you get promoted to shift supervisor you are paid only 1 dollar more for all the extra stress you will have to deal with, So, no room for growth. 30 minute unpaid lunch, company is stingy with overtime because it cuts into the bonuses of those above you, your discount is the same as the customers' (and theirs is a little better because they get coupons and you don't), and corporate never has your back."
bad,"This place is rundown and looks like it has not been remodeled since the 1980's.  Management is alright, though it's always changing.  No benefits for part-time, insane customers, terrible prices.  If anything, Amazon will put Rite Aid out of business in the future or outright buy them."
bad,Benefits weren't good.  Scheduled times were inconsistent.  Had to do a lot of training and courses.  Supervisor there was not friendly.  Help were young and did not give you a lot of help.
bad,Rite Aid has a  state of the arts computer system. I was one of the most knowledgeable employees with great attitude. Over all because I am a dedicated employee & take pride in my work I had a pleasant experience.
bad,Worst job I ever work at. No vacation time. No set schedule. Management was always changing. Very unorganized. Some peer weren’t very friendly. Very inconvenient.
bad,It's really not a workplace for anybody the benefits aren't that good & the pay wage is unfair especially if you work on truck days it's draining & the manager isn't reasonable
bad,Low paying job that works you like a slave. I think it is a good job for people in high school but other than that I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone over the age of 18. You get worked like a slave for chump change.
bad,"they deserve what they got in the end of the company excistance "
bad,I did not like branch I worked for.  The Pharmacist in charge was not very nice.  The pay was slightly above minimum wage and the techs were rude to the customers.
bad,"Salaried for 50hrs per week, expected to work 70-80 hours per week. No holiday pay or time off. Management ran the company based on fear and intimidation."
bad,I'm not sure if it was more of my location or just the company in general but my experience with Rite Aid wasn't at all a good one. With the experience i had I feel like I could have been paid better and my store was majorly understaffed. I had plans on going back to school before i got hired which i told the hiring manager when that time came corporate called and told me i had to choose between either going to school or working full time because they needed me and school was going to be an issue.
bad,very under paid place. Management have no clue what they are doing. I would not even tell my worst enemies to work for them. There is a reason why walgreens bought them out. Maybe when it becomes walgreens it wont suck as a job.
bad,Rite Aid pharmacy is not very good with customer or employee services.  The store manager was on a power trip and miserable to work with.  The pharmacy staff was nice.
bad,Manager was not good. There was a harassment case and manager did not stick up for me. That place needs help with how the people all work there together.
bad,"Stuck as a cashier, different schedule every week, min wage and no raise, expected to do too many tasks at once for the pay received. Wouldn't allow full time because they didn't want to pay for benefits. No paid time off and met with resentment when any unpaid time off was taken for any reason."
bad,was good in the begining . But change in management to often.  Learned a lot had a wonderful dm  . Company has changed a lot and I was ready to get out of retail
bad,i would not recommend anyone to work here. it is terrible.0/10 would not recommend. at least not at the right aid in arlington smokey point. the customers are terrible
bad,"Alot of diversity , which is excellent but no room for advancement especially in management. The hours are long and can be repetitive. They need to make competitive pay across the board starting with cashiers and work they way on up."
bad,"Not a good place to work. Very unprofessional, manager was mean to employees. Never got anything done. Unhappy pace to go to work, co-workers were cold and mean to new people coming in."
bad,It was the worst place to work for barely got break was very under staffed and everyone liked to argue with customers as well as all the employees. Everyone there was just so miserable all the time.
bad,"The typical day is filled with many projects and there is no help. The store runs on bare minimum amount of payroll at all times. The upper management in the company, literally has no idea what needs to be done in a day on the amount of payroll that the store is given. It is frustrating that there is little to no support from anyone in upper management. I do enjoy the people that shop at the location that I am in."
bad,"My RiteAid experience was horrible. I hated my job and their wasn't any away to advance.  No matter how many times I went above and beyond my duties, I was never recognized for it. The pay is un-fair and so are the hours."
bad,"I didn't like working with my coworkers, the managment did not seem to care what was going on in the pharmacy. I would never work for the company again."
bad,Worst job to work for. Management was terrible and there was definitely favoritism going on. The amount of disrespect was surprising to me since we are all adults. never work there again.
bad,"Management did not relay information to each other. Blamed employees for their mistakes. Wrote me up for not being at work, during which I had told the manager and supervisor that I would not be able to work during those times. I had told them this repeatedly for months leading up to the semester. Rite Aid does not care about it's employees."
bad,"This place is no place to work, shows lack of respect for their employees... Didn't learn anything that was informative... Hardest part of the job was dealing with management... There was nothing enjoyable about working there... Rite Aid is one big joke...."
bad,"Work place culture overall is very poor and preferential treatment is extremely common. However, the best part of my work day was interacting and helping the customers."
bad,It is very hard and managers really do not care about your hard work. Everything is looked upon and you are basically on your own and the entire store is such a mess.
bad,"I would never recommend this organization to anyone.  The wage was ridiculously low, the mandatory union dues were excessively high, and the assistant pharmacist was vindictive and prejudiced."
bad,It was a very stressful job. Worked all the time and little to no pay. They worked on holidays and did noy pay well. They were opened long hours. I worked for a full year with no advancement. Did shift supervisor work with no pay increase
bad,Very disorganized place opinions did not matter much until the bridge was crossed them it was done. No place to reach a higher goal in the workplace.I stayed so long because of the customers i had that came in on a regular basis.They made my day. They still ask about me.
bad,"don't even think about it. You are not treated as a colleague. I did not find that they respect what they are doing as a Pharmacy. Non professionals making decisions for professionals , it is scary when you are dealing with people health and lives."
bad,"It was hard to work for someone who didn't have a personality or a sense of humor. It wasn't at all what I expected, but it was a job and I needed it at that time. I quit due to a family member going to the hospital and I needed to leave work only a couple of hours early, but my manager was very rude and disrespectful and did not care about my needs nor my feelings or the well-being of my family. So I left and never looked back."
bad,"hours consistently cut, you will see others dropped off the schedule completely. If it wasn't for the union, Rite Aid might drop you off the schedule also at some point. You will get written up if you work over time, but you are still required to stay and finish the work, which requires you to clock out and stay. You constantly have to fight to help customers, because you might get told you're talking to much, when you're trying to help your customer get their medication filled because even though we are open until 9pm, if a customer comes in after 5pm, it is a rule of thumb to tell them we do not have the medication in stock because there is just too much work and not enough staff or time to get it done, so you kind of have no choice."
bad,This job is dangerous. You get robbed. You work with only 2 people in the store. You are always working short and with lazy people. Managers doesn't work and it falls onto you.
bad,"I worked at Rite Aid while in undergrad, trying to obtain my Bachelor degree and I did not have the best experience. My pharmacy manager was very unprofessional, the work environment was very hostile, and they rarely acknowledge the employee's hard work. Should I add that the rest of the store was filthy?  I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"the management at the rite aid in smithfield Virginia is absolutely terrible. although i have learned alot working there, mostly because i have taught myself, they train their associates very well. the best part of my job was meeting and seeing new people coming in each day. i have learned how to do inventory and to put up stock when the truck comes in. i have excellent people skills and communication skills."
bad,Friendly customers staff is not to great lazy and pay is to low for all the hard work that we do jobs dont understand the employees make up the work place and if you treat the good ones bad you get a bad employee
bad,"You get to meet some good co-workers and some harsh workers. But you learn a lot working here as well. Get to see what it's like working for a busy pharmacy all day and how nice or nasty a customer can be. But you do have your days when it's always that 1-5 customers who walk in the store and put a smile on your face. It also can show u how u might like the job your first couple of months then u get to see how nasty your store manager can be towards u. in who also act as if u didn't say anything to them about college before you started working there and how important it was to not put u on a schedule after 4 pm. I've learned that some places can bring you down and some can uplift you to become a better employee to the company. One day I hope to become a manager and see what's its like to take on the daily task that Rite Aids store manager had to deal with everyday. Besides the laziness, thieving, lying. things she did every day before the district manager came to the store."
bad,"Horrible communication between management and employees."
bad,They don't care about their employees all they care about is making a dollar and saving a dollar. I've been a loyal employee for 15 years and they wouldn't give me a raise.
bad,this was a job I hated to get up and go to no one really trained you their you were pretty much on your own the hardest part of this job was standing on my feet for hours. and they didn't realize that it was gone be another day! the most enjoyable part of this job was clocking out!
bad,"retail setting, long hour , normally 12 hours per day mostly in remote area sometime in downtown baltimore , nice boss but later found better hospital job"
bad,"This position required that I actively worked with customers to keep them healthy through a vast knowledge of over-the-counter and homeopathic medicines, vitamins, minerals, supplements, nutritional aids, durable medical equipment, diabetic supplies, immunizations and private and governmental insurances. I trained Wellness Ambassadors on corporate standards, administrative procedures, as well as on internal and external sale techniques. I worked directly with doctors and medical facilities to establish contracts for immunization clinics and ongoing medicine therapy for patients. This position stimulated internal and external sales with an increase in the percentages of immunizations, prescriptions, over-the-counter medicines and contracts"
bad,Stressful due to frequent hardware and software issues in the distribution center.  Meetings and shift turnover was sometimes interrupted to resolve the frequent hardware and software issues.  The Manager would sometimes make contradictory statements and when asked about them made the situation worse.
bad,Compensation could use a lot of upgrades. Do not get paid enough to do all the things you have to do. Paid time off is also a joke. I would not recommend this place.
bad,Love the job/position but the staff and the organization(team) was very dysfunctional. No team effort and employees were very disrespectful. Benefits are bad and no room for advancement unless you know someone.
bad,"I have nothing good to say about this company. I've even stopped shopping at their stores. The people they hire are rude, warehouse managers are rude. Pay is terrible. They work you to death and then fire you if you don't get a certain percentage every week. Which is ridiculous for a new hire that has never worked in a place like that before."
bad,I worked for this company for 12 years and they never let me advance. Their trick is to hire from outside the company for management at a lower rate of what they pay their current employees so that they don't have to pay an existing employee more when they advance. That is very slimy and poor ethics.
bad,"Depending on location/manager it varies the overall general experience. As a Sales Associate you basically do everything in the store besides two things, opening/closing the store and depositing the money."
bad,"unprofessional no room to grow in this field . pay is very low for the required work, if you have a family ir life i wouldnt advise this would not be the job for u"
bad,"I didn't like it very much, again nic eout of highschool job but that's it, not a nice place to work, management hates themselves, just not a good job"
bad,"not a good place, I did a few internship programs here, it was in san leandro, it was pretty ghetto, I really hate this store, and its getting old and walgreens is going to buy them out"
bad,you are on your feet all day and no one works as a team. very hot in the building and they never have the heat on much during the winter. back hurts every day
bad,I've worked there for 5 years and it's a terrible place to work they don't care about how that you're a actual human with a life and responsibilities outside of he job will never recommend this job to anybody
bad,Payroll hours not sufficient for workload. The experience gained in order to move to another company was the only thing I got from the job besides a meager paycheck for a skilled position
bad,this was a good place to work my day would go good sometime the work was not hard hate they moved out of charlotte the building was dirty they tired to keep it clean
bad,The work load was too much for two women to do and wasn't compensated enough for the hard work. There was no room for advancement and opinions were not valued.
bad,"Terrible company to work for. Sometimes a decent place to shop. Other than that, avoid this place by all means! Prices high for no apparent reason. Corporate Rite Aid does not CARE about you or your well being at all."
bad,"not appreciated, stressful, hard, no breaks, mean workers, and customers. No time off, worked you until you cant work anymore. bad hours, no help on pharmacy test."
bad,This place only wants you to keep doing extra work. They don't compensate you for the work that you do. The benefits suck. Rite Aid don't have enough employees to help the customers. The management system suck at rite aid.
bad,"rite aid is not a good company period. the pay is insulting, just for you to do the managers job all day long. I would not work here again at all. just the worst."
bad,"This work place does not typically care for individual people, as long as they are driving sales. If a woman goes on maternity leave, they will replace her and therefore she would have to relocate to other stores. Employees are bounced around from store to store, whether they want to or not. The daily activities are tedious and most workers leave their work for other people. You're lucky if you get a good manager because most of who I have met, which is almost all of the managers in my district, they are petty, dramatic, and only care for themselves."
bad,"A typical day was spent stocking shelves and assisting customers.  I also over saw a few cashiers and had to balance two different safes and make bank deposits.  It was an ok job back when I was in college,  but my manager was terrible.  I went over his head about obtaining my insurance at the one year mark and he kept making up excuses and would conveniently forget to get me the papers.  Upper management was no better.  "
bad,"This job wasn't bad at first, however overtime things start to change. Management favors people and it creates an unequal environment. it is kind of relaxed and laid back at times, it keeps you busy but it does get very boring at times."
bad,"Rite Aid does not pay well or encourage you to advance. Does not give good hours. Worked by myself a lot. One person carries the work ,load. Benefits are expensive"
bad,A typical day was preparing prescriptions for the pharmacist final check. It is great deal of customer service and patients. I learned a lot about medications and their important role in society today. management was never a treat when corporate came but the managers in the store were always fun to work for. workplace culture really depends on the store you land in. the hardest part of the job was not being able to help patients further than filling a prescription. the most enjoyable part of the job was keeping our customers on time for the rest of their day with the speedy service we were able to provide.
bad,This was the worse job I ever had. I had medicine stolen out of my purse while employed there. Also the co-workers were always causing problems for others.
bad,I have been a pharmacy tech for 4 years almost and i still get paid next to minimum wage despite of having a national certificate they don't recognize it and you have to take the course which is never offered.
bad,This probably is a worst run company ever. District managers care about bonus not necessarily help improve work environment. No proper training for employees!
bad,they don't care about their employees or growing a business. they don't try to take care of the problems in the company. you are harassed and bullied at your job.
bad,"stressful, lot of duties daily, some over baring customers, barley take breaks, complaining co-workers, need to hire more people, computer system takes a long time to learn"
bad,very structured. learn how to manage employee daily duties.most enjoyable part is helping my staff to achieve store goals.great quality value. will love to work there again just in a closer setting.
bad,"Gained a lot of experience with public , learned a great deal from supervisors, stores have a family type atmosphere, you are challenged daily, never a boring moment. Always something to do. Management is good to work with, will always work with you. It was a good experience."
bad,this job will make false promises and makes you quit when you are doing better than who they like. management sucks. treats you like a slave. never work here again.
bad,"it is a ideal first job, for students and as a part time employee. no more comments about this job nothing good about it nice uniforms but you have to buy them"
bad,Not really a interesting job that I would look forward to going to everyday. Company policy and guidelines have a lot of holes and discrepancy.
bad,"horrible place to work. no consideration for their employees no life or work balance, very insecure place they do not care if you get hurt on the job it will always be your fault when things do not go as they wanted"
bad,"I do not recommend this job. Rite Aid does not care about their employees. Benefits suck, management was very messy and discussed confidential situations with other employees. I would only recommend if this was absolutely your last resort even from considering stripping and selling drugs."
bad,"Corporate culture is cut throat, trying to get every penny of their meager profit margins for shareholders at the expense of the employees. They work you just shy of 32 hours to deny you benefits."
bad,It could have been strictly because of my terrible boss and co workers but I hated working there. The uniform alone was enough to be torture.
bad,Not a very good company to work for if your are not very well liked. Do not get any recognition for job well done. Manager does very little to intervene  when a customer has a problem with an associate.
bad,"racist manager, would talk down to and ignore the minority population. constantly being kicked around an insulted by the manager. i did complain to the District Manager but to no avail"
bad,Overall this is not a good company to work for. Paid breaks are given however they are only fifteen minutes and they act like you are the devil for actually taking them. Do not do this to yourself.
bad,Management was rude and inconsiderate at times. No room for advancements. Not very flexible with associates schedules and not understanding of certain days off needed.
bad,Do not work here. everyone is miserable and only tries to spread that to others. Maybe if the bosses cared about their employees instead of bleeding them dry.
bad,"working for rite aid is a starter job in my opinion and it was my first job. Given that, i did not like working there because it was the same routine every day, nothing ever changed and the only things i learned there was how to operate a register and how to use a planogram basically. management was always around and my co-workers were non-verbal unless in front of a customer. the hardest part of working for rite aid was figuring out how to keep a customer happy when the registers went down or the scanners wouldnt work which was a constant thing when i worked there, most enjoyable part about working for rite aid is the smile on peoples faces when they leave the store satisfied."
bad,"short staffed, can never get sick and if you do get sick, you would feel obligated to work. It would have been nice to have a more help."
bad,"Co workers aren't bad, and the work isn't hard but poor mangement makes for a poor working experience. Could be alot better."
bad,"The Wellness Ambassador job description changes on a daily bases. The Wellness Ambassador position is the hardest position in the entire store, with no consideration from the Pharmacy Manager. Corporate is excellent. ..but the Pharmacy Manager and other staff needs to know how important the role of the Wellness Ambassador is and kindly let them do their job duties in a respective manner without pressure."
bad,Great place to work as long as you don't get comfortable. They will move you without any warning & under false pretenses. They will schedule at another store telling you that they need help then all of a sudden you are transferred.  If you have problems they are not willing to work with you or talk to you.
bad,"I would prefer not to give any information about my typical day, what I learned, management, co-workers, the hardest part of the job nor the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,The job as a wellness ambassador at the otisville location  is point less job all you do is sign people up for the plenti card and cashier in the pharmacy because they don't have enough techs to work the front end manager is rude and talks behind your back!
bad,"The rite aid pharmacy  I worked at is a joke!  You are treated with no respect by the pharmacy manager, she loves drama so she talks about all her employees,  records the people she works with and continues the drama that way, dressed up in a wig and scrubs to spy on employees etc.  Very unprofessional there!  The district manager does nothing about it, nor does HR because statements were wrote and faxed to district manager and nothing was ever done, nor was anyone spoke to about anything. Your hours are cut when the pharmacy manager doesn't like you, she gives hours to  other rite aid employees from other stores. I'm beyond shocked at how this pharmacy is ran. I would not recommend lawyers rd rite aid pharmacy to anyone."
bad,"When I first became and employee for Rite Aid I started out as an assistant manager. I felt that I was paid pretty good, I had to work 45 hours a week not to bad 5 hours over time. I decided to apply to take on my own store. I took that job and I was not paid much more then I was making as an Assistant. I did it to gain more knowledge. I was at my new store for only 2 months and then upper management started to cut my hours for my store on my hourly employees and that left me to pick up the extra shifts and I had to make my management team work as cashier. When you have an issue with an employee you have to go through the chain of commands which is understandable, however the wait time for you to get an answer in unbelievable. By the time you are answered the employee had already forgot what they did because you can not say anything to them until you get an answer. I had to deal with this with one of my employees for several months and it came down to the point where the said employee was to be let go. The answer I got back was no they have been with the company a long time let them stay. So with all that happening I was not backed up at all and made me fell like I was not respected as a manager so I made the decision to leave the company."
bad,"This place is horribly managed. They have big mice problems. The second they do not like you, guess what....you're gone. They do not give you a job well done. Short staffed because the management abuses its employees. No pros for this place at all."
bad,not enough pay or hours.  Pharmacy manager was not understanding. Not no place i would want to start a career unless I'm a pharmacist or pharmacy manager
bad,"Felt like I was just hired so everyone else could hide within the isles and hang out and talk. I'd ask a question to another employee but they didn't answer, just repeated what I just asked. Sold more cigarettes and booze than anything else in the store."
bad,"I was continually harassed and bullied by my manager.   She made her own rules, and ran the business by her own corrupt ways.  We were always understaffed and overworked for very little pay.  All the employees are unhappy because the manager is a bully.  I went to corporate 3 times to try to get transferred but was denied.  Its liks they don't care because Walgreen are taking over.  I hope they see this woman for who she is, and gets rid of her.   I have never worked in such a dysfunctional atmosphere before.  Go to college, get a degree, and dont waste your time at this store!"
bad,i hated working there they treat there workers bad they didnt give me my breaks and they all ways down talk on your work the union doesnt do anything for you so you pay them for nothing and also they have pharmacy cashiers working as pharmacy techs and they have techs working at cashiers they have techs counting cII and its just a stressful work enviorment
bad,You will never get paid the amount that you deserve.  And you will have to have a second job while working for this company in order to live comfortably.
bad,"A typical day at work is very fast paced and busy. I learned a lot of pharmacy knowledge. Management is very rude and likes to belittle employees, but other co workers were great to work with when they werent calling off. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the public and the grief you catch when they want their controlled substance medications before theyre due. They do not train as well as they should. Upon going for my PTCB certification for nationals, when I was asking questions of how to do things mathematically, I was told everything I needed to know was in my handbook. I failed my test and was made to feel like it was my fault. There were things on the test I had never even seen before and wasnt given any guidance to so what I should study."
bad,You never hear anything positive from the higher ups. Expected to do all tasks in a timely manner with such little payroll. Work life balance is non existant
bad,"the same thing was done every day at that place. nothing out of the ordinary, the co-workers would treat patients poorly and the pharmacist would allow it."
bad,I would have my days where its good days then its bad days. I learn how to stock up items on the shelf and how to cash out tickets and do money orders. Management wise is okay. My co workers were okay sometimes they would be rude and not willing to help so I had to do somethings on my own. The hardest part is when i had to learn where everything was at so when a customer ask me where a items at I was able to know unless we did a whole new set up and change the isle down. Most enjoyable part of the job was when I left the job and found another job opportunities.
bad,Racist greedy company. No privacy. Under paid. I don't recommend working for this company. The only good thing working for the company ae they are flexible but that's about it.
bad,"This work is very fast paced and physical. The mandatory company productivity goals are set too high, so you will always be racing the clock and pushed. The employee morale is very low, again, due to the overly high production goals and 5 or 6am start times. Production comes before people at this company."
bad,"The employee's were very difficult to work with. They were inappropriate, rude, and did not have good customer relation skills. One employee was out of line, and publicly attacked a co-worker."
bad,"Rite Aid is the worst company I have ever worked for. The management at the Enumclaw store is absolutely despicable. You are disrespected and belittled on a daily basis. Dirty work conditions and moral is at a zero level. I don't know one employee that likes working there except the pharmacy and front end manager on bonus pay day.  I wouldn't wish this place on my worst enemy. The employees are a wonderful group of people who deserve much better.  I worked every position in the store as well as Ambassador. I was pushed around the store all day due to lack of coverage. I was treated worse than a slave. My manager was negative and unwilling to support the Ambassador position. I was unable to follow any event guidelines or promote FLU shot sales. She tore down and threw away anything I put up and told no to any ideas i had to promote sales and events. there is no work space, phone or computer to work from. You are assigned to do telemarketing and cold calling a daily basis and door to door immunization sales."
bad,This was the worst job I ever had.  These people that I worked for are not good people and I am a good person.  These people that I worked for are least helpful in my career endeavors.  The Management here are horrible.
bad,It was a truly horrible company. They shorted hours and did not provide proper training. And their policies made it near impossible to do the job.
bad,pay checks were late no room to move up too many glass ceilings not enough pay no raises they throw u in a store and do not care about your safety
bad,if you have an injury at work they treat you like criminal and probably you'll be terminated. unfear company and difficult co-workers
bad,They don't care about their employees. Every holiday and weekend you're at work and watch the pharmacy people leave early while you sit there doing nothing until 10pm. They say team work but you're really working alone. At night you're basically the only one there and its scary and unsafe.
bad,They would blame sales or a short staff so they would make you work without breaks and sometimes packing out products while attending customers. Also dangerous people would steal in the store. Management made me work with the flu once. And bring their horrible children to work. I witnessed a customer get attack by a security guard. And a thief threaten me with a knife.
bad,I liked the job I no longer work there so I don't feel like I should have to talk about the past.I am trying  to find a better paying job so I loved the job but looking for something new
bad,"I helped all customers, very fast pace. Also i had to multitask all my work tasks. At end of the day i faced and stocked all product."
bad,"I liked my job at Rite Aid, until I was offered a manager position and then waited months for it to go through. The managers leave work when they feel like it and nothing gets done, unless the Cashiers do it. if you call out sick, they will call you back and say you have to come in. If you're sick while at work, they won't let you leave. New cashiers up and quit all the time because they aren't treated fair and one of the managers is older and hates everyone, so she's rude to employees and customers."
bad,Work 12 hours throughout the day. Persuade customers into buying items. Show them new things that the store has in stock. Help them find whatever it their looking for.
bad,"Although I enjoy working as a Pharmacy Tech it's been difficult to get the proper training needed.  I've had to reach out to other Rite Aide stores to get my training bit by bit,  I enjoy learning different things.  My goal is to make myself a valuable employee, in whatever job I possess."
bad,working at rite aid was the most pointless job ever. the aren't willing to pay you much at all. management leaves and runs personal errands all day and leaves the manager duties up to the cashiers then refuses to promote anyone to a supervisor position even when you've shown you have the drive and qualifications to do a great job as a manager
bad,i liked what i did loss prevention that is  but the area i was placed was not a safe area for my self or my former co-workers we had a manager transfer to another location due to a customer throwing a curlying iron at him and had previous problems with other items thrown at him as well i had a knife pulled on me once have been spit on twice and called names because of my nationality the community that this store is placed in is not a safe place i had to defend my self from physical attacks from shop lifters and customers that come into the store to steal stealing happened on a daily basis!! i hated where i worked and i am very happy to be out of this store and location west main rite aid rochester ny
bad,It was ok at first. The owner is very nasty at times and talks to you any kind of way. Other employees were very fun. I worked part time. Hours were very reasonable.
bad,"I absolutely hated that place.I was a certified pharm tech .I got fired 3 weeks after I showed a doctors note saying I couldn't come in.3 weeks. I worked in a huge 24 hour store and hated the fact that I was the only minority there in the WHOLE STORE. the front store manager tried to get me fired for being 2-3 minutes late now and then.he wasnt even suppoed to be in charge of my time sheets.my pharmacy manager was.anyhow,i contacted HR and they ended the front store situation,but fought venomosly against me getting unemployment.my boyfriend just bought a house and pays mortage.oh,and i forgot,he also works at another rite aid down the street and is an assistant manger who knows the district very well.they started basically giving him the cold shoulder because of me,especially when they found out this BLACK girl was dating this WHITE  star assistant manager.i hate that racist place.they care nothing about their employees and the pay is horrible.the most enjoyable thing about it is going home."
bad,After working at rite aid for over 10 years i made $8.50 an hour. There are absolutely no benefits to working here and the management is awful. If they don't like you they will stick you behind the cash register your entire shift.
bad,The worst job experience I ever had very unprofessional. Never want to give me hours had to work at multiple store just to see an $500 paycheck for two weeks. Always wanted me to work on my days off but didn't want me to have any hours and work around there schedule. Worked there for two years never received benefits at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Had a manger not approve my time correctly because she was jealous I was getting overtime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Trust me this is not a job its prison.
bad,Rite Aid sucks. There is no opportunity for advancement unless you have a bachelor's degree. They don't pay you enough to survive on your own even if you work full time hours. They demand way too much for such little pay and the stress is very high.
bad,"Rite Aid is a terrible company to work for. They do not value their employees or the safety of the employees/customers alike. There is usually zero coverage from 8 am to noon at most Detroit locations which gives dishonest customers a great opportunity to steal what they want before the APA arrives. The APA is still held accountable for what happens even before his shift. Rite Aid store's are robbed on a routine basis and corporate team members Andre Salter, Derren Short, Cindy Tomkowiak, Bob O, will be quick to rush you back into the line of fire. We are not permitted to carry any kinds of weapons for self defense purposes but customers open carry handguns on an every day basis. It is is very unsafe and potentially violent atmosphere, in the last 24 months, APA's have been sliced with box cutters, made to lay on the floor at gun point, even hit with guns and led to other areas of the store. And what does Rite Aid do in return? They expect you to report back to work like nothing ever happened. They are very slow to give out yearly raises, and they go out of their way to show you, the employee that you are only a number and that you are replaceable. If you are considering a job at Rite Aid, be careful, protect yourself, because they will not protect you. Do what you have to do, stay safe, and get yours."
bad,"In the time that I worked there as a pharmacy technician the management didn't know what they were doing, the area which should have been sterile was very filthy and nepotism was a reality.  I would not recommend working for them at all."
bad,"the pay sucks, the hours are terrible and you work hard for bus fare every two weeks. not worth the time. Training is ok that's about it"
bad,Such an awful company.  Do not work here if you can help it.  They are extremely disrespectful to their employees.  The wages are so low and they NEVER and I mean NEVER give raises.  The CEO and district manager expects so much and never gives any praise or anything in return to the people that work so hard. By far the worst company I have ever worked for.
bad,"Working for Rite Aid was difficult. Not only in terms of advancement opportunities but in terms of overall wellness of an employee...they genuinely did not care...both at a store and corporate level. "
bad,Management is very distant to employees. Does not take employees seriously and treats them as disposable. Does not listen at all or compensate adequately. Coworkers are friendly though.
bad,I only worked here through a contract. The people here very rude and nasty. They don't keep the store clean
bad,The pay is low and the company politics are very strong. The pay is also terrible but they do offer decent benefits. The pharmacy department is the only department worth working in.
bad,"If your a student it does not fit in with your schedule a lot of managers don't care and will have you working like a slave, they give you a little bit of time to do things they want you to be doing 5 different things at the same time but only schedule you for 4 or 5 hours to work."
bad,Its a great job if your 18 and just outta high school but don't expect to make and earn a living to support a family there... management is a joke there also..they constantly give you the run around about is your working 8hrs or 10hrs .. you usually don't find out until the last 30 minutes of work causing problems for people who have kids and need to pick them up from school or so forth..There is also a ton of adultery that goes on within the warehouse..also be prepared to work in every area of the warehouse because you will get forced.. oh and theres no refrigerators for employees lunches to stay cold.... they took them out and never replaced... oh and dont expect anything for christmas bonus or employee gifts.. usually you get a quarter of a sub or a slice of pizza merry christmas...
bad,cashier and stock clerk stocking shelves working with customer to find their every day need great job if you are a people person some chance to advance learning the inventory in the store
bad,"Not the best place to work right now, It was a fun, productive place of work years ago now upper management have made it very difficult to have a work / life balance due to excessive work loads and unfair scheduling"
bad,"If you would like to learn what not to do in LP, feel free to join the ranks of Rite Aid Loss Prevention. Going to work was  fun, no supervisor, structure, and very unsafe because you nearly always alone. Also, you have to travel store to store."
bad,"working hard  great job co-worker it was ok, if you like working hard 12hours that is company"
bad,"No benefits, No raises, No vacations, No breaks unless your a smoker."
bad,the company leaves store way understaffed and very unappreciated of its employees.
bad,I worked here for 4 years got a 10 cent raise the whole time. I worked hard but got discouraged because was told I wasn't able to better myself in the company when I could do any job In that place .
bad,The fortbragg store has poor management  and don't wanna help the loss prevention ....
bad,Rite Aid really launched my career as a security officer. I've learned a lot being in the security field from starting out as a Rite Aid security officer.
bad,"This was the worst place ive ever worked at. The Manager there had bad work ethic wasn't a good listener, and he talked down to everyone under him.. I worked here for the summer and I honestly couldn't wait to leave this job."
bad,"Had a good bunch of guys teach me the in's and out's of computers and networking, This is really how I started and learned when I was 19 years old."
bad,My typical day was me working as hard as I could while my coworkers did nothing and they still never got in trouble but if I messed up the smallest thing I was in trouble. The managers were okay sometimes but I definitely don't recommend working there.
bad,Rite aid is a great company to work for. I really enjoyed myself working for this company. Management was great.
bad,"Rite aid does not pay pharmacy technicians what they should. The amount of pay is equivalent to what a regular associate is paid.Not only is the technician required to do their regular duties in the pharmacy, but also work as a cashier for customers in the rest of the store. Rite Aid does not recognize PTCB certifications for Technicians. They also do not give breaks. So if  you're scheduled to work 8 hours, they expect 8 hours straight without any breaks."
bad,This company sucks...I was fired after 25 years of service because apparently I was at the top of the pharmacist wage scale with maxed out 5 weeks vacation. I had no disciplinary record at all....this was the thanks I received after so many years of loyal service. Watch your back and look for something better...this company is a train wreck waiting to happen.
bad,Managers have no respect for others who work below them. They know the store is under staff but still refuse to hire people. Some workers are treated differently than others.
bad,"Management was terrible. I had to ""quit"" because I couldn't relocate to Maryland! I lived an hour and a half from the store they tried to make me go to!"
bad,"the job was like any other grocorey store. lift this lift that cashier work, nothing soecial."
bad,"As a manager you have to do everything, schedule is very odd,"
bad,"horrible schedule, horrible pay,lack of consistency with management, a union that does nothing to help you  with any complaints or concerns or fight to keep your job"
bad,"Honestly, Rite aid is full of it. They pay low, make you do tons of work, make you do EVERYTHING FROM RINGING CUSTOMERS, to CLEANING TOILETS. Very poor management and very inconsistent. Do not and I repeat... Do not work at this awful place. I promise you will regret it."
bad,"Hours are cut regularly and yet our script count has been on the rise since I started. They regularly add additional tasks to your job without additional compensation. There are no breaks. I have been thrust into a leadership position, which I do enjoy, however I am asked to do more than my fellow technicians without any additional compensation."
bad,"serve customers in a fast paced pharmacy environment, file and retrieve prescriptions"
bad,"The most enjoyable about working at Rite Aid Pharmacy was learning about the side effects in medications, and learning how they affect the patients. Meeting new people is also an enjoyable part of the job. The most difficult part working at Rite Aid is lack of training.  The managers do not teach how to fill prescriptions effectively. Asking questions on issues that arise irritates the managers, and they do not provide adequate solutions to solve those issues. Training would be constantly interrupted which would make the employees confused and unknowledgeable. Some co-workers are very knowledgably and are willing to help. Some co-workers would not acknowledge you, and treat you as if they are better than you."
bad,I had lot of experience in Rite Aid but the fact is we needed lot of concentration and customer satisfaction .
bad,Rude customers and even ruder coworkers. Don't go here. dhwaukhdsuhdsaukdbxjsakdsajkz
bad,"Boring, never ending busy work hours. Literally the easiest job one can do and yet the most unsatisfying. You have no future in this company. They under staff every store, a typical day would be working as a cashier is putting away truck delivery back in isle 16 while having to run back and forth to ring out customers. And its company policy that we aren't allowed to have a bell because a customer shouldn't have to wait on you but if your half way across the store kneeling or crouched putting away merchandise off truck and rotating for freshness it's quite annoying. "
bad,After 16 yrs working for this company they set me up just because I wanted to get demoted because the management and DM wanted to go to bars and games and leave me running the store by myself without no breaks and people calling out left and right so they didn't like that I my mouth and put a stop to there con games. And union ha that's funny they charge you union dues but beware they are buddy buddy with corporate and your job is still at risk. listen to me I worked with this company for 16 years and the pay is no good and they want you to do so much your better off in a mc donalds or some other retail place.
bad,They expanded way too fast and accured tons of debt. This caused them to close a lot of stores and let people go. I am still amazed they are still around
bad,"enjoyed working with the customers. did not enjoy the fact that i never received a true raise, due to the state base rate being increased each year."
bad,"I worked from 7:00 am until 5:00 pm everyday w/ no short breaks nor lunch breaks. (you were targeted employee if you originally came from another company (thru a buy out) and had more than 15 yrs in and 3+ weeks vacation time. (I had 26 yrs in and 5 weeks vacation)The phone never stopped ringing the entire day-4 lines came into the office and if the bosses called on a line and you were helping someone on another line you were yelled at for not picking up their call immediatley."
bad,not a company you want to work for. They are true believers of under payed and over worked. And forget you outside life. I just worked 80 hours in 7 days. Complete BS!
bad,it is an ok place to work. although i wouldn't try to make a career out of it.
bad,"A typical work day is being worked like a slave and getting no recognition for anything you've done. You work a lot and get paid little to nothing. I was a Shift Supervisor getting paid close to minimum wage and working crazy hours and even illegal overtime. The management I worked for was very immature and not good with people at all and that went for corporate management also. A majority of corporate management were undercover racist and treated people accordingly. All management had no respects for any employee's. RiteAid is the worst place I ever worked for and wouldn't recommend it to anyone with common sense, maybe teenagers looking for a small gig but not adults. I don't even shop their anymore and would never especially knowing that they are ripping off their customers."
bad,"The job wasn't the problem, it was the pay rate and working that hard deserves more than $8 an hour."
bad,The customers treat you like your nothing. I learned how to count cash and how to give change back. Management was okay. My co- workers were okay. The hardest part was to make the customer happy no matter what but within the company policy. Most enjoyable part was that I got to see my friends when they came to visit me. 
bad,Management both store level and district were constrictive on allowing feedback and intimidating to employees.
bad,"I have worked at Rite Aid for a long time now. It was a good job when I started because it was a learning experience and thought I could make a career out of the position. Turns out I was wrong about the opportunities that Rite Aid said they offered. Health care was expensive, the job was extremely repetitive and stressful with little to no satisfaction. You received one break for 8 hours of work and customer were usually very rude. i am glad that I only work part time now and did not make a career out of this. I do not recommend people trying to make a career out of working at Rite Aid."
bad,"Rite Aid was a place i went to work as a security job. As a security guard in Rite Aid it was tiering and crazy mostly everyday. We had to chace people in and out the store, call the police to arrest the people that were stealing merchendice. You always had to walk out of work with your eyes all over the place due to people trying to harm you physicaly because you had them arrested or you stop them from stealing."
bad,"Well let's see...I was a 25 yr employee with a flawless disciplinary record. I was fired out of the blue for going to pick up a sandwich at Subway next door. I was the pharmacy manager making 130 k per year with 5 weeks vacation when ""poof"" it was all gone. They also denied me my unemployment and a bonus that I earned. Steer clear of this place....this company is 6.5 Billion in debt and their stock is worthless."
bad,"tedious work, employees are rude, management is rude, pay is low, has not increased since 1994,"
bad,A typical day at work was stressful I sometimes worked alone. I learned how to deal with dificult situations and customers. i liked some of the management at rite aid. Some ofmy co-workers was ok i got along with most of them. the hardest part of my job was working alone doing everyones job. I loved working with customers and helping people being employee of the quarter.
bad,Hard to advance in company and very stressful. Very high expectations.
bad,gained experience in stocking shelves and running the cash register. Everything else was just a nightmare.
bad,Hated it no hours mistreated...liked my employees and customers
bad,This company overworks and under pays me as an employee. Retail it self can be stressful but here is ten times worse. Do not work for this company.
bad,"typical day-full of tasks, associate shortage:-what I learned -to be accountable;-management, lack of support from district manager; - co-workers, good associates;-hardest part of job,-completing tasks timely from lack of help;- most enjoyable part of the job- customer service."
bad,"taking orders from management, dealing with angry customers, The management throws you under a bus any time they get a chance. the co-worker were ok for the most part. Dealing with customers, Looking at the photos people brought into One hour photo"
bad,"Aside from the universal complaints of retail jobs, Rite Aid stands out for treating its front end workers very poorly. Pay is lower than Walgreens and CVS. The benefits are nonexistent. The potential for promotion is a crapshoot, if you are not willing to travel/move. Upper management is utterly incompetent in how they handle the majority of issues presented to them. Some store policies are very unnecessary, but that may just apply to the middle TN district."
bad,"I hate it! I've had so many different managers throughout my time there and they were all Lazy good for nothings! And lets not talk about unfair promotions! People getting promotions for crazy reasons. ""Oh I got a baby on the way I need to make more money, wassup.with a promotion?"" Or oh! Im the store manager I'm gonna hire all my cousins and give them all the hours. Just ridiculous . Rite Aid, or at least my store doesn't recognize the associates on time every day, do whatever you ask them to without a problem, doesn't mind staying over time or doing a double b/c someone called out, comes in on their day off. Nope! No recognition! No raptar cards! No nothing! And its not fair! And the pay! Let me tell you how Rite Aid decided to sign some dumb contract stating that full time is only 70 hours! Ugh! I'm DONE!"
bad,"It is mostly very routine and easy work, customer service is the top priority. Working for Rite Aid I have perfected my customer service and time management skills. Management changed frequently. In my four years working there I worked under four different managers, each with different ways expectations and work ethic. Most of my co-workers were great, i enjoyed working with them and we worked well together. My co-workers and the customers were by far the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,great place to start a pharmacy career and get to learn the different new medications and insurances
bad,This employer takes advantage of thier employees. do not waste your time
bad,"No benefits, long hours, no compesensation, no job security."
bad,"Not enough employees to do the work. Too many tasks to complete in one day. Alot of the employees don't speak good English or understand English well. Store Manager sit in the office most of the day. And they get upset when you don""t finish all the work. It would be easier to get work done if the Store Manager would help. Also Store Managers don't work nights or weekend.They lie on the schedule and tell their boss they are working. Some Store Managers come in to punch in and then they leave early. The salary is bad and they do not give raises. You have to work for three years to get a two week vacation. The best part of the job is helping the customers.But it hard because there is so much work to do."
bad,I am a former employee of Rite Aid. I worked for this organization as a assistant mgr. for 5 yrs. I was injured on the job. One of the job duties of the mgr. is to unload delivery trucks. I was injured on the job & the demoted me to a cashier. After several week employed A's a cashier my hours were cut to one or two days a week. Then I was removed from the schedule. I filed for unemployment. Rite Aid contested my claim. The Human Resourcr mgr. & Store mgr. lied to the judge at my appeal hearing by claiming I quit the job.
bad,the company will change processes and culture just to have an excuse to it's board members for the reason the sales figures are in the tank. the company will boast how it is on the right track while claiming poverty when salaries are in question.
bad,they always fire people by the bunches although they do have alot of longtime workers and managers they tend to under staff they leave people alone alot that is scarry. Also depend on interns.
bad,"store management and pharmacy management is awful plus, the customers what their rx''s filled in less than 30 minutes. There is no work flow and there is 1 person who is lazy. Left and glad that I did and the location has since saw their business go down more than 50%. The pay is awful plus, they don't give you a good pay raise every year and you have to take this Rite Aid Tech' class and exam and you end up not making more money per hour"
bad,long hours and bad company neeed to update the systems find better ways to maintain stock room
bad,Bored the entire day. Very little customer traffic through store. Unable to do other tasks. I literally learned nothing at all from this job and it was useless.
bad,"we were a great team....Rome DC....to bad corp. didn't see this, hope they are sorry now...."
bad,"An average day at work consists of assisting customers, reconciling registers, stocking shelves, ordering product, merchandising, operating cash register, and office paper work."
bad,Please stay away from this imploding company. It is a good 'ole boys network and advancement and appreciation is non-existant!
bad,Although working at Rite Aid has both is pros and cons its wasnt for me. I dont want to deter others from being a part of Rite Aid try it out for yourself and make your own judgement to see if its right for you.
bad,"Get paid less, get respected less, and get more problematic customers than your other drug stores."
bad,"If you want to feel disrespected and worthless, and put up with intimidation and outright bullying by management and the corporate office, then go for it."
bad,"Not a growth opportunity, corporate is not supportive of those at “store level” positions- even pharmacy. If you need work go for it but keep looking and find better opportunities."
bad,"Stupid company,hr useless,stupid and ignorant.YOu complain for years about the same issue with no avail,then you will discover that the hr is fired mostly or quit,though the company will say that person is no longer with the company which is a polite way to say he or she was fired.The company change the hr managers more than I change socks!"
bad,Not a very professional place to work. Low budget pharmacy. No work life balance for nonunion employees. No direction from DM. Managers have no time to train with little budgeted weekly hours. To schedule new employees they have to cover a shift on their first or second day. Resulting in low productivity and a store full of employees who have never been completely trained.
bad,Helped in Pharmacy when needed a fill in. Worked when needed for call offs.  I really enjoyed my job and  the people I worked with. I however did not like the fact that the assistant manager and manager did not have to close or work weekends and holidays.
bad,"Bad place to work with ever decreasing technician hrs. Unsatisfied technicians due to low wage, short shifts & less hours to work mostly part-time hours only. What all you get is mear frustration whatever and however hard work you do to make your patients happy and district leader happy. Most non co-operative district leader with sadist mentality I have come across in my entire career as Pharmacist."
bad,"i worked security for Rite aid and the employees were constantly tired and overworked. multiple accidents and injuries, the warehouse was a constant disare and many people left within the first week of starting"
bad,It was an overall ok experience but the pharmacy manager is not a pleasant person to work with and he doesn't know how to communicate with people or talk to people.
bad,Management literally did not care about the well being of the employees and demanded extra work from them. Management would refuse the use of PTO and would penalize you for calling in sick. Job description did not match the duties assigned. Customers were verbally abusive and management treated them like old friends.
bad,"A typical day at my Rite Aid consisted of 1 or 2 employees working while the others do nothing. Sometimes it was overwhelming running the register, providing customer service and trying to pack out all at once. I learned very little from what I already learned prior to the job and the management was unfair, they would pick and choose who was punished and who was not, favoritism. The hardest part of the job was getting all the work done due to the lack of help. My favorite thing about this job was going home at the end of the day."
bad,Rite Aid was bought out by Walgreens and my position was eliminated after being told we would be kept on. The merger was full of lies and half truths. Walgreens lack of asset protection is a huge mistake
bad,Doest matter if you been there 20 years they will drop you like you we're nothing for that company all they care about you making your production even when your working 58 hrs week they still expect you work fast as possible not worth stress on your body very little sleep.
bad,"Management is racist and unfair."
bad,"Management is horrible! Most of them are preoccupied with personal issues, they don't have time to care about what their employees have to say. And favoritism is very big there. If you're not one of their favorites, you are screwed. They'll fire you without doing a fair evaluation of the situation. They will let you go in a heartbeat, even if you're not at fault. Don't waste your time there."
bad,"It’s a good place to work for a bit of money, but not a place you want to make a career out of. At least not in my district. Managers are not very good leaders, they take advantage of you, and never appreciate your hard work. Rite Aid does not enforce any good training routine. You’re trained for one day and then throw behind the registers. They give no thought and don’t care for there employees what so ever."
bad,Fixed hours 3-11 no overtime made it a hassle if u had to call out not very understanding. They dont pay well but at least they bumped me up from part time to full time after a week but that's the only benefits
bad,"The managers and staff are nice at first, but once you turn your back it's a different story. Counts were always off and scripts shorted, but nothing was done about it. There are A LOT of red flags.. I'd steer clear from this place."
bad,While the pharmacy manager was out on maturity leave the floater pharmacists a d the tech s that were there were not following her normal rules and the board of pharmacy regulations. Hence why I didn't stay.
bad,It was a pay check to pay the bills. High turnover. Managers work associate's long hard hours because of high volume at peak season and not enough help.
bad,Lack communication and poor management. No job security and broken promises. The workplace is very stressful and people are rude. Don’t expect to get the hours that are promised to you.
bad,There method of doing things at rite aid was counter productive. And there is no pay raises they put more work on there good employees but the ones that slack get easy days.
bad,Long hours high productivity standards terrible management high employee turnover have 90 days to meet productivity goals. If don't meet goals will be left go.
bad,"very slow paced, impossible to get more hours, managers are uncaring , pay is terrible with no advancement opportunities, no holiday pay, only had two good mangers out of 5"
bad,"It's a JOB to work if your young and in college or just in need of a part time job. Management was horrible and very messy. It was a very poor, stressful, unsanitary  and toxic environment due to management. Be prepared for moments of disrespect in the presence of any and everyone. They speak to you very poorly. The level of professionalism was zero. No organization, NO COMMUNICATION only managers and supervisors communicate, favoritism, always short staffed, management will beg you to come in so they do not have to work and very poor training as well (wing it) if you don not know what to do. Be ready to work holidays (no pay). The job was pretty simple for the most part greeting customers and providing quality customer service (typical retail). Best part about the job was actually helping customers it takes your mind off of everything else you have to deal with from management."
bad,Payment is unacceptable. Did not have to pay for insurance which was great. Could never get two consecutive days off. manager never supported growth. The best part were the customers.
bad,"The more you know the more you are expected to do, with no compensation for advanced skill. You can do what ever the store manager can, but are not compensated for it"
bad,"A typical day at work was read emails input invoices help check in deliveries. Clean, do trash, count the drawers and safe. I had to do vault drops and deposits. I would run cashier and shifts. I would work cameras to watch the store"
bad,If you want to be a manager be prepared to work non-stop. There is barely any training and the company is ina downward spiral. If you have a family hope you don’t mind not spending time with them. Horrible company.
bad,"pay didn't match the work, management was alright, learned how to pick orders build them on a pallet and brought them over to shipping, alot of the objects range from light to 70lbs, work place was alright everyone got along for the most part"
bad,Terrible non existent APDM. 0 communication. 0 backing from the APDM. 0 store level backing. Being paid the most in the district definitely didn’t hurt.
bad,"the company does not care much about employees"
bad,Most of the girls in the front end that work there are best buds so they picked on me and multiple times when one of them would make a mistake they would pin it on me and I would get written up. Was very bad for my mental health. Management was bad and I felt very uncomfortable every day working there. I needed less hours for 3 weeks because I had to focus on the end of school and passing my classes more and they wouldn't help; I was working 40 hours a week and even contacted a higher up and was also no help at all. I ended up leaving because of how stressful it was and needing to focus on school.
bad,"the company has been haeding down hill or at least my store and the choice in manager makes the company look real bad.we started with a brand new store and then they moved managers around and know our store is infested with rats,moths and other bugs.all our good customers are gone and the store looks awful.its actualy  crazy how changing managers can destroy a store."
bad,No advancement and favoritism is rampant. No real training and raises are horrible. This company gives nothing back to their employees. They lie to you and treat their employees horribly.
bad,The job started off great and fun in the workplace then after months go buy things started to go down hill job was very unorganized and lazy managers were not doing their job and store owner was not taking action to things that needed to be handled as the owner
bad,"Did not have a good experience at all. "
bad,There was no down time. Every second of everyday there were 10-20 tasks piled on you.  Even breaks were interrupted. Management didn't care how worn out you were and just kept pushing.
bad,job opening pay 10.20 hr. 
bad,"Worst job I have ever had. I have worked for 3 different retail pharmacy chains in a community pharmacy setting. the hiring process should have shown me that it wasn't a good idea to work for them. It took far to long, after being hired by the Rx mgr, I was told by the store manager that she didn't want to hire me and wished they hadn't hired me because she knew they couldn't give me the hours I had been promised. THEN after I had started floating to get hours, I ended up stuck in a towne floating only there for over a month. After having been floating for a month the new store manager changed my availability without consulting me and changed my schedule to a completely unworkable schedule for my lifestyle. They tell you that you are allocated an hour for lunch each day but if you use this full hour you will be scolded and given cashier work for the remainder of your day. I have been a tech for almost six years in two states. I am nationally certified by the NABP. Hands Down this company is terrible, not a single other technician or pharmacist I worked with could say anything good about the company in its current state. they management is essentially a storm of untrained people filling in where the last person left in disarray just to get out of the company. on more than a daily occurrence the rite aid system and workflow caused customers to become so disgruntled to the point of swearing and cussing at me. I KNOW that this is a pretty regular pharmacy occurrence. you're dealing with sick people and telling them more often than not that they need to pay for something they need."
bad,"I worked in the pharmacy as a tech, This was my first job as a tech getting paid, the first week that i was there was just training with videos, then the next week was full on training with insurances, and customers. I felt like I was getting snubbed because I didn't have much experience as others. No one even tried to talk to me only when training. If I even asked for help or a question I would get smart mouthed and sass. My ""coworkers"" gave me all the work they didn't want to do this included taking the trash out, dealing with customers, and putting away medication bottles. Every time I asked Them that they should do these as well because we were all techs, the answer was simply ""oh we don't like to do it"". I have seen personally first hand witnessed two mental breakdowns to Pharmacists done by the cause of the techs and Pharmacists. This pharmacy was full of techs that thought they were the boss and talked and acted the way they wanted to towards any worker I'm glad I left and feel very sorry for the next person they hire. The pay will be the lowest until you finish your three month trial and take the rite aid test."
bad,"The manager is completely unstable. Saw her be rude to customers.  She refused to wait on ""certain""customers. She ignores ""certain"" customers when they come in the store. She speaks ill of ""certain"" customers. She should not be working with the public."
bad,"They over work You, promise full time position and you worked less than 20 hours, manager was barely involved, starting they expect you to run the whole entire store while they just sit on their butts. You're stocking, doing endcaps, labels, and taking care of customers all at the same time while the managers and supervisors just watch. They promise you a high pay and pay you less then what they promised."
bad,3pm to 3am     and mandatory Saturdays.  If you have no family then this works but you work all night and sleep all day.....  i was a manager SALARIED....  no good
bad,Working for Rite Aid was stressful and for all the responsibilities you have you are overworked and under paid. They never really make you full time and they lack on giving you hours.
bad,my manager and district manager show favoritism all the time and promise to train someone and never do they don't appreciate good workers at all and give no support at all you end up doing all the work and they take all the credit ...also home office is no help
bad,The management was poor. They give you only 20-30 hours a week. The manager is constantly getting smart with you. Co workers are very rude to one another.
bad,Rite Aid gives the minimum pay to its employees while demanding more than maximum possible effort. You get punished for using the vacation you fairly earned. I spent over 3 years with the company and only saw a total of 40 cents in raises. They do not promote from within the stores and corporate only cares about the sales. We got robbed 3 times before they gave us any sort of security system. The hours you are given are completely sales based. If we didnt average more than 1k a day in sales coporate would call and say we had to cut hours for the next week. In the branch I was in which is located in a tourist area we had 5 employees during the day shift and at night it was only myself and one other employee. It was a very unsafe enviroment. Company also does not comply with the laws in regards to breaks. I have worked a 13 hour shift many times with no 15 minute breaks no lunch at all and then gotten repremanded for asking for coverage to use the restroom. Management blames the lowest level employees for their mistakes. Management also is does not care about personal issues. My uncle passed and I had to work the days of his wake and funeral. They would not give me off. Overall a terrible company with an unfriendly enviroment.
bad,Rite aid corporate treats their employees like slaves! You're expected to do a boat load of work and you get paid minimum wage. Plus you don't get any raises.
bad,"The managers at Rite Aid are diverse some can be amazing to work with however there are some that don't care about their employees just the work at hand. It is a retail establishment so schedules can change at anytime, but its been very difficult to work there and pay bills or take care of your family"
bad,currently quit from rite aid for unfair treatment. the company is full of people who are very negative from the associate all the way to the people at corporate bad very bad place to work in.
bad,Very remedial tasks that needed to be done and no ability for upward movement within the company. Managers have unreal expectations as well as no ability to change work schedule.
bad,"This was a not good experience at all, they are very irresponsible. They didn't work with my schedule and they didn't process my request off for my mother's wedding."
bad,"Rite Aid was my first real job and it had its pros and cons. It was definitely an experience across the board but the company in itself doesn't care about its employees, especially those who worked hard day in and day out. A typical day at work was a 10 to 12 hour shift standing on your feet all day without restroom breaks or even a lunch break. The pharmacy was always under staffed and the volume of prescriptions was exceedingly high for the location. The hardest part of the job was leaving my second family which were the customers I bonded with over my 7 years working for the company. The most enjoyable part was the day the doors closed for me and I was no longer stressed out but had found a better job for myself and my career."
bad,Underpaid and overworked. Not appreciated at all. Very poor management. No room to move up in the company. Upper management doesn't care about employees.
bad,"Rite Aid can be a great place to work and shop. It all depends on management. I love my Rite Aid store but hated working for the organization. I had an awful manager and all of my complaints over 6 months were negligently dismissed/ignored. Senior leadership was determined to mediate the abusive situation vs resolving it. This sent the message to my manager that's she's not going to be held accountable and can basically get away with ANYTHING including publicly humiliating, berating and teasing me. All of my complaints were very well documented and many times w/witnesses. The company chose to turn a blind eye instead of diving into the uncomfortable and challenging situation. I was denied basic benefits like bereavement and sick time because my manager wanted to punish me for escalating my grievances. I continued to give 100% due to my commitment to coworkers and those who depended on me. There was never a show of appreciation or basic respect from my manager. The entire situation was really sad and humiliating."
bad,"I work at the front end, not the pharmacy. We only make 9/hr which is way too low for the constant work. And there's no real training. They make you watch online training videos but 90% of the training isn't relevant to what you'll actually be doing. You'll eventually learn little by little but it's tough being new at this job with little training because rite aid gets some cranky customers and they'll get upset with you if you make a mistake while helping them."
bad,Picking is boring but easy.  Production requirements are sometimes unfair.  Management cares very little about employees family life.  Mandatory overtime takes its toll.  9 and 10  hour days get difficult to adhere to.  Group leaders are often rude and unprofessional.
bad,"One of the worst companies I've ever worked for. For a company that is all about ""wellness"" they sure shaft you once you develop an incurable, chronic disease."
bad,The most enjoyable part about working at rite aid is meeting the floaters. Meeting new pharmacist and experiencing their concept for running a pharmacy. With these experiences you are also fortunate to learn new short cuts for the system and how to help your work flow improve.
bad,"lack of support help, you are on your own most of the time. You are the cashier, pharmacist , technician,  & repair man . The company does not appreciate you as a professional."
bad,"Friendly co workers but management is not fair, they keep hiring new people and others that have been there longer do the jobs no one wants to do."
bad,"no advancement, pushing people into positions there not ready for, can't keep employees, don't pay well. Other stores are badly staffed, and store managers quit or don't care."
bad,"A typical day at Rite Aid would consist of my manager complaining as if no one did any work, denied 15 minute breaks, and being forced to do task that the manager did not WANT to do."
bad,"Co workers can be cruel"
bad,"not a good co. to work for ,too few employees for the work load.lack of advancement oppertunities"
bad,"I worked at Rite Aid for 18 years, 14 of those years as a supervisor.  Because they wanted to promote a 20 year old, they demoted me and gave her my job.  That is how the company works.  District Manager was awful but Manager & coworkers were pretty nice.  The job wasn't hard but a lot of lifting, sometimes heavy lifting.  Meeting and greeting the customers was always a highlight to my day.  Pay was lousy.  Didn't even break $10 an hour after all the years I worked there.  Would not recommend working for this company."
bad,"Rite Aid Warehouse was had poor managment. The co-workers was fine. The over time was ok, but they wanted to much for a little amount of money. They didn't not care about the emepolyes at all. When there is really bad weather they will make you do the next shift work, then let you leave when the roads are bad and expect you to be there tomorrow morning. I know it's a business and the work has to get done but at least act like you care."
bad,"A typical night a work started at 8:30 pm, three to four night a week you must pull full case. In full case you are expected to pull 300 to 350 cases an hour. The shelving was not easily accessible to reach items on top shelf one must stand on conveyer belt to reach many items. This part of the job was the first half of the night, the rest of the night was spent cutting boxes and stocking shelves which was fine. The leads at the job were always very helpful. As for management I feel they didn't give enough training for what they expected. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was pulling full case under the conditions that one works in."
bad,There is no job security working for them. I was never stress free working for them. Cultures/values are very low. They tell you to give the best customer service but they dont give you enough man power at the stores to accomplish that.
bad,I worked here for more than 5 years ONLY because of the people I worked with. They were tolerable. Rite Aid doesn't give enough hours to the people in the pharmacy so you're constantly swamped with work and not enough bodies. They implement a new program every week it seems like of more stupid work you need to do. It would be okay if they would also give us the hours to go along with the added work. This was such a miserable job with miserable pay.
bad,"I applied to a Monster job listing for :Pharmacy Technician. When I interviewed I was told it was a Pharmacy Assoiciate (cashier) job. But, that I could work into Tech position and be offered formal training as a Rite Aid tech."
bad,"corporate ,regional offices are disconnected from the individual stores and sadly they see only the paperwork from the actual stores and attribute that to everything also if they find a problem with a manager they just transfer them to another store."
bad,assoc. have it better then management.Asst. managers have every little to no voice and are just puppets.
bad,"This company though it has NO stores in my area was the worst job I have ever had. The DM wasn’t friendly, the type that used fear as a model. The DM would send his stooges to spy on me while I was at work. When my home flooded and I was trying to repair it there was NO empathy at all. I even asked for vacation after the flood and was denied. So in a nut shell I don’t recommend this company to my worst enemy. The comapany SAS a whole sucked"
bad,The Pharmacist needs to find a different career. She is to short with co-worker's and customers and has a bad attitude. Instead of being understanding and helping her co workers she blows up at them or makes fun of them.  I felt like I was in a hostile environment. Will never suggest working there. She is a good person outside of work and has a good heart. I think she is burnt out!
bad,By far the worst management I have ever worked with...bullies and harassment every day I worked...till I found another and better job and never went back...best decision of my life
bad,I work for the company for about 3 years or more and they could care less if I left or not. I had no help after my assistant and store manager quit. I was running the store by myself practically. And I had to fight to keep my pay after I moved states
bad,"Like I said it was terrible.. full of miserable, and toxic people!  Very TOXIC WORK ENVIRONMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Customers didn’t receive the customer service that they deserved because of miserable people!!"
bad,"Viscious company to work for. Will go to any extreme lengths to mistreat employees to maximize profit. As a pharmacist, I was forced to work 14 hour shifts, absolutely no breaks allowed. Also expected to remain at work for hours after the store closed to finish tasks, unpaid for this time. We were all continually threatened with dismissal if we did not submit."
bad,"They do not care about the employees, you are just a number there, I wished I got out of there earlier, managers are abusive and neglect the employees, not all of them where so bad but the mayority"
bad,"Senior management has no idea how how to treat their people. Constant paperwork, night work expectations, high turnover rate, no real direction from senior management"
bad,Company doesn’t really care about employees giving too much work and not enough help. Very frustrating work environment  at times with not much help due to cut hours
bad,"Blairsville, PA was horrible. I took a part time evening position and was trained one day for about 2 hours. The pharmacy manager was a witch, but the other techs were fun to work with. Pay sucked, I made 8.50 and was one of the higher paid employees.  There was no rhyme or reason for weekend shifts, meaning no one took turns, it was the managers decision on who worked and when. Also a high employee turnover rate"
bad,Management was my biggest issue. It was a “buddy” system. Pharmacist was immature. Working in a cooperative environment impossible. Glad to be gone. Do not recommend!
bad,Nice job until they told us they were closing the distribution center. Now they are bending over backwards so workers don't leave until the official closing date. A lot of time off without pay because there's nothing to do.
bad,It’s all  about the bottom line  worked in their IT dept for 25 years and there were only a few individuals that have a c*ap  and when the dept found out that they were laying off the entire department all they did was cram 1 1/2 years worth of projects into 60 days  causing what was left of us to work 16 hr days all week  there is no compassion. It is a business that is about to go under. And all the corp people want us to make sure they get their bonus
bad,"Don’t work for this company. The company has been failing for years. Lots of turnover in management. Minimal tech hours 48 per week in a store doing 800+ per week. Low pay for techs = turn and burn they all end up moving on to full time , better paying jobs."
bad,Basic training. No opportunity for advancement or growth in the workplace. Schedule can have more flexibility. Uniform is simple and company dont give employees meal discount
bad,"They place was very unorganized. Tasks where always forgotten to be completed, the counters are covered, the employees can be rude. The overall atmosphere of the company is professional."
bad,"Poor place to work. Management is unprofessional, and pay is not up to par with other distribution centers in the area. Employees leaving the company at a rapid rate. Corporate has said themselves that associates will no longer be given raises. No incentive to stay."
bad,"The people who own the company don’t care about their employees. Not only do they change your schedule constantly, they also get mad at you for not being able to come in on your day off. Absolutely the worst job I’ve worked. I would never suggest anyone work here unless it was their last choice. Good luck new hires, I hope your experience is better than all the other people I’ve heard from and my own experience. Oh they also don’t give you enough hours to be technically full time. They’ll cut it by an hour just to avoid giving benefits"
bad,Not worth the stress. Place has lack of communication and low pay. Seek other places in the area first such as XPO or Medline. This place isn’t worth the stress!
bad,"ok is a ok place but I did not like is because I didn't enjoy working midnights it was hard on my body and it was hard on my life...………………………………………….,"
bad,They want you to work what no one else will work the best part was working in the pharmacy that was fun. Other than that they watched every black kid that came in they would follow then but nobody else it was always black people getting followed. It was bad the racism that was going on
bad,"Every day felt like a waste of my time and effort. Consistently rude customers and poor training, paired with losing hours because I started tending classes at a nearby college and could no longer work late nights."
bad,"Management is very shotty, they pay based on a very low budget. They have very poor communication skills. They were respectful, however they were difficult to work with due to the lack of flexibility."
bad,"After working for this company for about 6 years , unless you become friends with upper managment, your never noticed and are treated like garbage , stores like in Wolcott ny , Fulton ny , Hannibal ny , and I. Cicero ny , and in North Syracuse NY all have garbage managers , they all treat you like a number and when you have an issue about managment harrasment, you are a liability and if you complain they will show you the door so dont believe the garbage any one tells you , it's a cut throat company and working hard is never noticed and your basically there puppet so dont be fooled ,"
bad,The boss was mean and never there. They left me on my own almost every day. I worked all but one day a week. The work was hard for little compensation. The customers were awful as well as the coworkers. I highly advise against working here. Almost everyone I worked with quit soon after me.
bad,I was a LPA for this company. Company had no growth. Hours was terrible. Store management was cool only part I enjoyed about this job . Corporation did not care about its workers did not train to handle hostile customers. On drugs with needles and knifes etc. unfortunately I left before they changed over to Walgreens. I would not suggest this job unless you was on the retail side which is just as worse.
bad,"Horrible company to work for. No accountability by Store Managers. You could steal them blind and not get fired!!"
bad,I wouldn't recommend working here. Was a good place to work at 1st but slowly declined. This place is closing down so its very stressful on your personal life.
bad,My store manager was very very inexperienced and had not a clue how to treat people. She was nothing short of a liar and a drama queen who bad mouthed ever single employee. She singles me out because I had experience she lacked and was incapable of actually doing her job. She would leave nasty notes telling me only she could write on the calendar and she demanded tasks that were impossible to complete. She would write me up for everything I did and nit picked everything. She would trash other store managers and employess and act like she didnt say anything wrong. I called her out on her garbage because I got sick of being targeted. Then I found myself with issues yet again. Heather is a tyrant and I suggest you stay far away from her. After the things she did to me and others you would think she would have gotten terminated. Nope . Goes to show they could careless what ki d of trash they put in positions in this company.
bad,The pharmacy manager talked very disrespectful to me on my day off in front of associates & assistant manager. I've never experienced that & I started with the company from when it was Perry Drug store.
bad,"Company constantly invents ways to screw over their employees, management is absolutely horrible, absolutely the worst job I've ever had, I would never recommend this to even my worst enemy."
bad,"Rite Aid gives you an awful experience. Management is inconsistent on ""policies"" and is lazy when it comes to daily duties. Cashiers are bored out of their minds and customers know that they can walk all over them due to the companies idiotic policies. Customers have complained about managers/ shift leaders to corporate and to store managers and nothings been done. For a company that says they truly care about their customers and associates, it disgusts me the treatment that is given to these people. I would not recommend working for this company even to my worst enemy."
bad,that place is horrible no room for advancement part of management was horrible customers was very very very rude managers treat people like they were there children or tired to and when it was room was advancement they would lie so u couldn't advance and its favoritism in that place no room for advancement at all would not work there at all those managers are horrible and now they have converted into wal-greens it is still horrible if not even more than before
bad,"Don't work for this company.  They don't know what they are doing.  Every time upper management visits,  they hammer you for something they told you last week to do. You can't win. If you're a favorite,  your store can look horrible and its ok."
bad,"Treatment of employees is very bad."
bad,If you have a problem and you need to get in touch with the human resource dept. no one returns your calls..but if you steal a vitamin water they will come to your store and fire you for $2.00
bad,"The customers and employees are becoming increasingly aware the company is folding without being prepared for its demise. Every move you make is monitored in order to have you disciplined and ultimately removed. When eligible for benefits you will be replaced with a new hire. Turn over is astronomical. Hostile environment, bullying, favoritism, and unprofessional. It is not the nature of the job that is stressful, it is the surroundings and the lack of dynamic. It depletes your well-being, your confidence, and will destroy your life outside of the establishment."
bad,"I believe the company is on the wrong path to success"
bad,"With us , it's personal. What a great slogan.  Company doesn't feel that way at all. Suck all the life out of you without compensation for all you do and they want more. No room to grow with the pay you deserve. Very bigoted environment"
bad,"The employees at Rite Aid are a pleasure to work with, however, the store is completely unorganized. There aren't enough management members nor are there any security members. We have one security guard that only comes into our store two days of the week. My store is constantly having items stolen from different people and we cannot stop everyone while trying to maintain our store. It seems more employees are getting fired than we are hiring. Very stressful when there are only two members of management at the store."
bad,I worked there while in college. It was good for a time and then I grew out of it. Met some good people there but the management was not all the supportive or motivating
bad,"I worked at my location for almost six years to get the maxed out pay of $16.25. Two weeks before my maxed out pay they fire me for being trained wrong. Big ordeal with the union, but in the end I stayed fired. It truly is personal with Rite-Aid."
bad,working at rite aid is horrible seriously my hours got cut. i wanted to be a manager but was told that rite aid would not make me one but was told no by employee
bad,"A typical day at work was slow it got busy sometimes, the employees were okay, the manger was really nice, there wasnt a hardest part of the job the jon was really easy, the pay was horrible, the most enjoyable part was when you got to go home"
bad,Rite Aid is a horrible place to work!!!! you never know when you are getting off! and when you are off all you can do is sleep.The management is unorganized and uncaring. i cant believe ive apent 18 years there
bad,"Easily the worst place for me to have been employed, I regret all of my time there. It discriminates people based on color and disability status and the company sucks"
bad,"I worked at rite-aid for 2 years and never advanced. I did nothing wrong and I did all the work that a supervisor would do, but I was never promoted. We were expected to do more work than was in the job description and you overworked for minimum wage."
bad,Given impossible goals to reach. Very hard to manage payroll when given a very tight budget and very hard to make a productive schedule. Learned to deal with stressful situations but there was no need for that
bad,"Cashiering pays minimum wage. They require you to clean bathrooms. You are verbally abused on a regular basis by your manager. Told your slow, etc. It was not a pleasant place to work because of the manager. The customers and products, also other employees mad rite aid a great place tho"
bad,"Conditions were unsafe, unprofessional and lacked transparency. Incompetent district manager and a turnover rate that would astound you. There is no communication about  what is happening and you are not informed on important expectations that affect security of your job. You will be setup to fail: lack of staff, training,  no follow through on customer issues, problems are pushed under the rug."
bad,"Absolutely horrible management. Began as an associate and worked my way to shift supervisor only to deal with extremely immature and unprofessional management. Salary was lied about, hours were docked from my paycheck without notice when store manager did not like my performance. Constant gossip and immaturity. Regional and district managers will side with store managers and do not care to listen to the issues within their stores. Corporate is not responsive when issues are brought to their attention."
bad,Long hours working in the heat.  Mandatory overtime almost every day.  Employees have poor attitudes and poor work ethics.  Lack of leads to run the modules in several departments..
bad,"Company talks a good game in regards to associates, but behavior is different.  Payroll has been slashed yet tasks continue to increase.  We've also been under the cloud of an impending merger/purchase for almost two years."
bad,"I do like to work for Rite-Aid, since I get my job done and no one hassles me about it. However, the company doesn't compete well with Walgreens or CVS. Therefore, I am always afraid for my job-security."
bad,I would never tell someone to work for this company! It’s horrible to the store manger to the higher ups. They don’t pay enough. They treat they co workers horrible you can barely live off the pay you make every two weeks.
bad,Too many cuts to payroll and the amount of work increases. Many in upper management have never managed a pharmacy. Sometimes we only had two people in the front end running the store and it would reflect on customer service
bad,"Bad absent DMs. Actually, I got along better working with the front end DM. Pharmacists constantly late with bad attitudes and/or low performance. Good techs and really bad techs. Horrific lines. Many, many unhappy customers. DMs and up have dream world goals to justify their jobs. And guess what, you can't ever possibly satisfy those goals. Example, you bring in 15 new customers a week. Thank you, now we can do business forecasting with those 60 new customers you're bringing in every month."
bad,This company is horrible to work for as from a management perspective. You have way too much pressure put on you and are expected to still do more. They are always short staffed due to the pay being horrible. And corporate does nothing to help. You’ll reach out by phone email or text and they never respond or just give you the sorry don’t have anyone to help excuse. If your a kid just looking for part time work to get by till college it’s perfect but anyone looking for a career don’t go here.
bad,Honestly I felt like I was in high school all over again. One of the most unprofessional work environments I've ever encountered. If you are planning to work there make sure its temporary because they will use you and abuse you till they no longer need you. I am a very professional worker so I went to work did my work and went straight home but it definitely was not my cup of tea to be around people who behave in the manners that they did. Managers will be revengeful and cut hours.. there was a lot of racism. The only good thing about this job is the benefits.
bad,Working for Rite Aid I have had to fight to get my job back after it was unjustly taken from me and since my return I have been mistreated. I am currently being pushed out by the store manager and feel like I am being targeted because of my store manager's personal feelings towards me.
bad,this is a very bad company to work for. You will have no life if you become a non exempt store manager. they expect you to make the job your life. Upper mgmt treats employees like property not people.
bad,"Great at low levels to get you started. But lack of career advancement, competent training, or quality pay or respect for associates. You don't technically even get an employee discount because customers can get something better."
bad,You work alone so hard to please customers and do daily tasks at the same time. I was able to handle this situation although not being able to use restroom for lack of staff was the worst.
bad,"I would not recommend working here.  I worked in the pharmacy and received about 2 hours of training.  I have worked in a  pharmacy before but the system was completely different and received no help in learning this system.  The pharmacist was moody and I felt like I was constantly walking on eggshells.  I was given a schedule but invariable would be asked to work longer.  The other employees where of no help either.  The other assistant would only count medication and not help with the customers.  I was left working the drive through window, counter, and file bags while the other assistant did as little as possible.  I did not enjoy this job and made the decision to quit."
bad,The only issue I had with Rite Aid is the store manager had no clue on how to delegate task. Everyone of her friends got a free ride while I got stuck doing all the grunt work.
bad,"Rite Aid is a place where you find a job, not a career. This is not something you'll want to be doing in the long-term. But if you do end up doing it, make sure you join the union."
bad,I was previously a pharmacy tech for 3 years at CVS. My end pay was $12.54. Rite Aid started me at $8 per hour. They did not provide any on the job training and were upset when I asked a question. They had Schedule II's on the shelf because there wasn't any room in the safe. Very poor management. Staff was nice but not competent or helpful. Did not work there long as the stress was not worth the pay.
bad,it was stressful because of favoritism and no hours for new employees it was hard to get adjusted there because of the nasty attitudes what was fun about the job is my customers that  seen on a daily basis
bad,"During my time with Rite Aid my training was extremely limited and after completing my 6days of training, I was expected to run a store. All of the system and computer work training was limited and I was lucky to have things shown to me if at all. At which time I was then expected to be fully functional as a store manager. I am extremely capable of managing my staff however it was difficult that I got no support with additional computer training or even how to enter a schedule into the computer. The lack of training, the horrendous way that trucks are delivered and the lack of support from the district manager were all the reasons I needed to leave a once great company that at one time actually cared about its employees. Unfortunately today, Rite Aid cares more about the customers then their own employees. Word of advice, if you take care of your employees, they in turn will take care of your customers. It's that simple."
bad,"Poor management, the manager base the schedule around him. They cut hours alot and don't pay no where near enough to live on your own. People quite alot and they want you to everything and anything like watch people so they don't steal or stop them. Clean everything and anything and basically devote your whole life and time to them."
bad,"First, lack of communication. Second, Poor management and safety violations everyday that are not fixed at all. We associates bring up the problems and then they are brushed off like we never said anything. The workplace is very stressful because the work is not done properly causing more work to fix it. The hardest part of the day is not being able to walk out of that place without having to worry about financial problems. The best part is when i know i do my job safely, effectively, and correctly and go home to my family."
bad,I do t really have anything nice to say. I didn’t really like working there. It was always so much drama with the fellow wmloyees. I couldn’t take it anymore
bad,"Management needs work, job culture is lacking, work/life balance it ok as long as you're a student, benefits are limited. Would not recommend unless absolutely necessary."
bad,"The corporation is unstable since the company is trying to sell itself out piece by piece no matter the cost to its employees."
bad,The District management (including HR) is extremely biased. Not enjoyable working environment. Very stressful for no reason. Have a quota for flu shots. Rate of pay is an embarrassment.
bad,You're workload isn't realistic. You could be filling over 250 rx per 8 hour shift with little help. Expect to answer the phones and administer flu shots while trying to fill the rx's.
bad,extreme workload with little help from the upper management.Cannot maintain the balance between work and personal life. The company does not care much about its employees.
bad,As a supervisor the manger expects you to finish a lot of tasks one person couldn't handle. Everybody works disorganized. The cashiers that are hired have a language barrier
bad,"Pharmacy only..no more compassion for customers. All quota based, vaccine pushing. Lost the passion for a profession I once loved. "
bad,"Company does unethical and illegal practices. Did not pay overtime for hours worked, instead shorted hours on the next week. No maternity leave when part time. High volume of theft. Underpaid, over worked, stressed out employees with little support from regional office."
bad,"The pay is subpar, unless you placate the boss's ego, there is no chance for advancement , my boss is an egotistical and lives to make everyone's life miserable. At least I get insurance through the company."
bad,"Minimal raises and benefits. The only way to get full time is to become a manager, and most of the time even that doesn't guarantee full time. "
bad,"When working for Rite Aid, it felt like the company didn't care about it's employees at all. It felt like Rite Aid just cared about the bottom line and that was all."
bad,"This is a terrible place to work. They give no lunch breaks, no tech help to do all that is needed to do as a pharmacist. They keep cutting the hours that you do have to schedule tech help. They do not care about there employees."
bad,"The work life is a concern; there are no such things as lunch time or breaks.  The co-workers are nice in general but management is an"
bad,"Rite Aid has by far been my worst work experience, and I have worked fast food. There is not an actual training program or procedure used to train incoming techs. You're thrown into the fire and expected to catch on or get out of the way. The techs that train you will run you through the processes as best they can. However, these stores are purposely understaffed according to script count. This system of staffing does not take into account what actually happens throughout a day of work. A good amount of the customers are over entitled, rude, and quite aggressive. You will receive no backing from management even if your life is threatened by the patrons. You will encounter some clique like behavior among management as well as some of the other employees. Upper management tends to use a passive aggressive style to bully store employees. Especially when it comes to doing things that could potentially cost you or your pharmacist to lose your licenses. "
bad,they keep coming up with new initiatives and change or increase expectations on workload and productivity but lessen your help  a common corporate theme the management must have forgotten what its like to work behind the counter instead behind the steering wheel driving from place to place the work life balance is a joke
bad,"Remain positive"
bad,"no lunch no break.there is a tech 4 days per week. pharmacist is usually forced to work alone. it is miserable and unfair and based on script volume. I would not recommend this store to anyone, all the pharmacists except two are looking for other jobs. There is nothing  good about the job except the pay."
bad,"Pay was not equal to the demands of positions which include a constantly changing schedule, physical demands(heavy lifting, cold temperature and skeleton crews to put up stock from trucks). Management was scared of employees and never disciplined disrespectful and threatening employees. Glad not to be there anymore."
bad,"This was my last retail job. I was so disappointed with management and their tactics. When it comes to any matter where they are not the main focus, they do not want to hear anything about it."
bad,"I was sent home with flu like symptoms from my first job on my 2 days off with Rite-Aid. I called my next work day, which would've been a Thursday to let them know I wouldn't be able to come in. I called, in total, eight times and left 3 or 4 voicemails on multiple lines. No one returned my phone calls. I went to work on my next scheduled day, Friday. The manager of CP could careless that I had been sent home by my first job for being extremely sick. All he cared about was why I didn't call him(which I did & left TWO messages) to let him know I'd be out. Most jobs, when it comes to sick employees, they want you to stay as far away from work as possible and get better, not Rite-Aid and not the CP Manager. He told me to my face that I should've came in on one of my two off days, which would've been Wednesday to make up for missing Thursday. In order to do that, I would've had to have known I'd be sick or coming down with a sickness(I showed no symptoms of anything until Wednesday night into Thursday morning). The only off day I've had is Saturday of the last week(4/16), I just had to leave work early Tuesday(4/19) because not only could I not stop coughing, but I couldn't stop sneezing, my head was pounding & I started wheezing and feeling the tightness in my chest all over again. Neither one of the CP managers/leads cared. All they said was ""ok."" I said all this to say that, if you're SICK, please don't think that Rite-Aid will care. They'd rather you get everyone sick(but they have flyers posted all over and around the bathrooms about being sick), maybe even pass out on their"
bad,"There was no balance between work and home. Management is lazy and provide  little to no trainingSome management that I worked with were extremely rude and inappropriate, I worked for Rite Aid for almost four years with no chance of advancement. The only time someone would advance with Rite Aid is through family/ friends. The only enjoyable part of working for Rite Aid were my costumers."
bad,Recent management in New Jersey would not appreciate loyalty or hard work. Too much Politics. If you are one of the higher paid employee they will try to replace you with recent graduate who does not have even half of the skills you do. Very sarcastic.
bad,"they are worse than high school kids. gossiping, and god forbid your new you feel like they are all talking about you and 9.9% out of 10 they are."
bad,It seemed like no matter how much work you did here you would never get to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Management seems to be shunned out to any potential great replacements. There is lack of opportunity. You really have to dedicate your life to this place but see little in return for it. If you want to transfer or leave it's like pulling teeth. It is a good experience but if your going to school find something more in your area because it is not entirely considerate of your life outside of work.
bad,"Favoritism from management to certain employees. No consistent treatment among all employees. No consistent hours and reprimands for going above and beyond job description, while picking up other employees' slack. Promised full time and first shift hours, which were never received."
bad,"I am a people person, working as a team or by myself is okay with me, I can and will function well under pressure, if we had an upset customer, I always tried my best to make that customer happy before they left the store..I learned how to manage people, to be efficient with my time, I had some great co-workers then I had some co-workers that were there just for a paycheck.The hardest part of the job was accepting the fact ou could not always make everyone happy.......Best part of the job is when a little old lady or man would pat you on the back and thank you for helping them..."
bad,I have had years of management experience before rite aid but they only paid 8.25 an hour starting off.  The benefits are horrible and you cant afford to pay them out of the small checks that you get. In the few years I was there I watched them force out ethnic employees as well as impaired (employees equal opportunity employer they are not.) It is really a bad company to work for. It might be fine for a high school kid that just needs some play money but they have no respect for their  lower level employees ie store manager down to cashiers. Its pretty sad.
bad,"Rite Aid treats employees with lack of respect.  You are no longer valued as member of the health team. It's all about the money and the numbers  - immunizations, mtm.  Mandatory meetings schedule on employees' free time not work time"
bad,I had a horrible time  here at this job. The manager treated me horrible.
bad,The hours are too sporatic and inconsistent for my working needs right now. I am looking for a permanent part time schedule.
bad,"They pay better than some pharmacies, but they wont advance their employees. They find outside people BEFORE EVER considering one of their own employees. Really big turnover. They hardly ever keep the same employees, they make excuses to fire them. They accuse them of stealing and never have proof. They accuse the cashiers for coupon fraud. If it scans into their register and the customer has what the coupon specifies for, then it is their problem, not the associate. They do have loss prevention but the managers and district managers want you, the associate, to physically stop a customer from stealing. Their merchandise is over priced. Unless it is cigarettes or alcohol. The cashiers are expected to do all of the cleaning on the night crew."
bad,Rite Aid is not a company you would like to work for. My immediate supervisor was great but the corporate management is very bias.
bad,Even the best die at this company and can get smeared with lies and rumors afterwards. Legal department runs the show and HR and upper management are its puppets when it comes to HR decisions.
bad,"If you like retail it's not too bad, laid back for the most part."
bad,"Typically work 14 hr days, do the store managers job as well as my own do not receive much as far as compensation, not accommodating to family life."
bad,a typical day at work for me is working closely with our patients. Retreving patients information so there medication can be process through insurance and filled by the pharmasict.
bad,"I was hired in by the Pharmacy Manager. I was promised that I would receive a week of training and the work conditions were to be a little unconventional; I was to be shared with EVERY Rite Aid store in the area (which totalled near 10 individual stores). I wasn't too thrilled about the schedule situation, but at the time, I was desperate. I was also promised a guaranteed 12 hours per week with room to pick up shifts if anyone was sick. However, when I went in the following week, after passing a background check and a drug screening, I signed the papers with the general manager and was told that I was going to be ""shared"" with the front of the store and the pharmacy, that is, I was going to work the cash register. I asked if I would be making the pharmacy technician wages while working front of store and then, a bomb was dropped, he told me ""no"", I would be working minimum wage. For the next month and a half, I was marooned up front at the cash register. I made sure to ask the GM every other day what the situation with the Pharmacy Manager was but he never had a clear answer for me. It wasn't until nearly two months into my being hired as a ""Pharm Tech"" that I finally had a shift scheduled in the pharmacy. But, yet another kicker, they didn't have enough hours for me and the other technicians were angry that I was stealing their potential hours. I would work a shift here and there, and after they got in trouble with the Union for stiffing me on hours, I finally saw twelve hours on my schedule. But, by that time, I found a job with a hospital's outpatient pharmacy and I decided"
bad,"Open or closed store, prepared registers for opening,"
bad,the benefits were amazing
bad,"My typical workday was great, I got to visit and help out all of my regular customers and even the ones who were not regulars. I learned not to trust your managers, because most of them stab you in the back. Management at Rite Aid is very bad, they let you do something wrong, and say nothing until a week later, then suspend you without even a write-up, then you get fired. My co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was doing something wrong and not hearing about it until you are called into the office to see the person in charge of security, all because they do not teach their employees how to use the wellness card the proper way. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see all of my regular customers everyday, helping them and helping all of the customers when they needed it."
bad,"Associates are consistently presented with increased workload expectations while resources provided are decreased. Staffing decisions imposed create unsafe and often impossible work environment. New programs and goals constantly being introduced with no resources to support accomplishment. Management support is nonexistent. Ambition rules and everyone is made to know you are either ""on the bus"" or you are ""readily expendable""."
bad,They teach who they want to teach. There were many hurt feelings for lack of training . Cold shoulder for entire shifts. Would speak to other people not me
bad,"Iack of proper management, lack of proper training. Need new corporate managers, they have no idea how to run a store, all they care about is pharmacy sales, and pushing flu shots. Unprofessional staff, very high school like atmosphere. Immature staff, I feel like I was actually bullied into quitting my job. Very sad, I was a good worker."
bad,The attendance policy is terrible. You only get 10 points and aren't warned or written up first. I was unaware of my point balance and had unforseen car issues and health problems. I was called to HR and terminated without any notice.  They fought my unemployment.
bad,the work place was a ok place too work . there not good at giving hours .was not enough hours to get by on taking care my child . there sick days is only 1 day which i dont think was fair
bad,"poor management,problem solving,hr is horrible,...breaks depended on hour,lunch to short for the amount of hours...if your a slower moving thinking person you are shunned/outted by management."
bad,I was treated well by the manager however  most of the other employees in my store treated me poorly especially a couple of them  When I with sent to work at another store I was treated well  with respect. A couple enployees did not follow the rules at my main store and put both the other employees and the customers in dangerous situations especially at night.  Even after quitting I spoke with both the district manager and received a  call from a higher level manager at the corporate office and told them what was going on and these employees were not fired instantly which is beyond belief.  Apparently the management is not that concern about employees safety like other companies are.  The theft in my main store was totally out of control and there should have been security guard present especially at night.
bad,"Not a good place to work at. Underpaid, overworked. Little room for advancing. Very liitle leeway for a slight mistakes. Hard to actually take time off that you earned"
bad,"I use to love this job , with pay is terrible the raises are 14 cents a year,, not enough help, the managers are only allowed to have a small window of hours but corporate expects all work done plus wait on customers and juggle everything else on less than 10.00 an hr  , I have over 11 years in riteaid, and I don't even make over 10.00 an hr, pathetic !!!!!!"
bad,The senior managers are not fair minded. They have cliques and treat those outside of their personal cliques unfairly. There is a huge problem with Nepotism. I had two managers reporting to me that were married. Very unprofessional and uncomfortable. There were managers that were bigoted against other races and treated employees of certain races poorly. When reported nothing was done to correct the behavior
bad,"Doesn't operate on logic. No concern about employee's safety, just the bottom line. The pay is poor, yet they want you to pull a rabbit out of your...hat for them. Upper mgmt is arrogant, un-approachable and unappreciative. Manages to get good people, but could care less about them. Would rather cut hours than seriously look at operational NEEDS and close an hour earlier."
bad,Management allows fraternization between employees creating an unequal work environment after hiring a co workers Doug's girlfriend Susan.She gets many personal phone calls at work and gets special treatment on the job.
bad,I had a new manager every month that i worked there. I watched employees walk out on them.  I Had a manger that yelled at me in front of my customer's and said I was stupid and took over my register. Not a healthy environment to work in. quit
bad,"Awful Management, taking a million smoke breaks, sleeping in the back of the store with one person in the front. Just awful management . Awful management"
bad,"Been there over seven years, didnt have to proper support system and NO staffing assistance. I was a one-person show. The management pressured staff through fear and intimidation."
bad,"Barely any customers, after you stock and clean there is nothing else to do. Very boring, basically just stand there hoping someone messes something up so you have something to do"
bad,"Back stabbing, dishonest to co-workers and customers, plays favoritism, thieves, do not follow procedures or company policies in accordance with sop, and the management constantly has her drug addict husband in there causing problems with the workers and the customers"
bad,"Corporate does not care about its employees."
bad,Don't get me wrong I love my job they don't paid good.. the insurance company is no good before we had 1199  I was happy now we have United healthcare it suck. We barely have heat. During the summer we don't have  a.c
bad,"The manager was very nice. I kind of knew I would get the job because the store was extremely understaffed. I told them the hours I preferred and they didn't really give me anywhere near what I wanted. I also said I could only work part time (no more than 25 hours), however they gave me 35 hours a week with 6-8 hour shifts 5 days a week, (weekends a must), which is full time at some jobs. The first day I was there I was scheduled till 10 PM and the Shift Supervisor made me stay till 11 PM to do a job, in her words: ""so (this supervisor) didn't have to do it tomorrow"". The next day I was the 8 am shift. The coworkers kind of acted like they were managers, except for 1 or 2 of them, who were actually pretty nice. This job is supposed to be cashier but were stocking most of the day because we were understaffed. This job is also minimum wage."
bad,I was in charge of daily operations of the store maximizing profits by implementing policy and procedures of company mandated agendas. Field management and store operations communication standards were significantly poor.
bad,"The warehouse workers were like a cancer. The “Teamsters Union” was a joke they were supposed to represent you the worker but they got their pocket lined by the company.  Management was a joke, if you were one of the bull dyk@ buddies then you got by with murder. Best part about working at Rite Aid warehouse was when they closed and moved to SC."
bad,Why i did enjoy my time at Rite-aid i do believe that most of the management in the towns where i had worked was poorly executed and could be improved.
bad,It's terrible working has a pharmacy tech they put you on the floor with barely any training and they just expect you to know how to do things while customers are yelling at You. it was super stressful I had to keep asking everyone for help which annoyed The customers. They left me at the register alone with a line of customers with barely any knowledge of how to use the register
bad,I was told with being a pharmacy manager that I have to always work extra and that is because I get paid more then a regular staff pharmacist. On average I work 10 hours more a week and get called in all the time. With not even a thank you.
bad,The group I worked for was controlled in a dictatorial manner with little if any respect for employees knowledge or ability.  Work conditions were often hostile with expectations that we challenge government code officials if the Co. didn't like the codes.
bad,"Through this entry level position, I was able to effectively learn about the health industry through the processing of medical prescripts while engaging both the customer and numerous insurance companies in order to complete my tasks."
bad,"The customers can be horrid, and the company will NEVER back you because they feel the customer is always right. The pay is terrible and the hours won't permit you to have a life outside of work. And even if you do have time off you won't be able to afford to do anything due to the low wages they offer."
bad,"in an industry with a high level of turnover and limited growth, rite aide has been the slowest and least adaptable organization i have encountered. Corporate had very little involvement in my location and  opportunities to advance were given to friends of management other than deserving candidates. With the poor decision making i have experienced in this company, it is not surprising that the Rite Aid name will soon be forgotten."
bad,Pay is very poor for being in medical field. You make more money flipping burgers or parking cars. Managers won't go to bat for you for a pay raise and doesn't know how to deal with internal conflict.
bad,"The place was ridiculous, they want want want and want more out of you, they beat the brakes out of your body and continue to expect even more, they lack sympathy when it comes to their employees. The hours are ridiculously long because management does not know how to handle their own job they create overtime when it’s not needed. And the employee ratio is people start and quit immediately because of the way it’s ran. They abuse you, horrible place"
bad,Horrible working enviroment where you are treated as a number and not a human being.  It is very clear to this company they are more interested in quotas than taking care of their customers or employees.
bad,"A fun place to work, but not professional in the slightest. I enjoyed the associated I worked with very much and helped me learn a lot with being an associate."
bad,"This company can't treat their employees well at all. They will reward customers who are yelling and screaming at you by giving them a discount on their products, and afterwards blame you for the customer being upset and possibly write you up. There is a lot of favoritism within the company and a lot of people (ranging from cashiers to upper management) are completely untouchable. I reported an employee who had been stealing from the company and Rite Aid did not do anything about it. I was treated worse for reporting it because of who I reported. That person still has her job. "
bad,Absolutely boring hated every minute of working there was standing for hours on end usually with absolutely nothing to do. Everything that i had to do took like 5 minutes.
bad,The teams are not working together. The staff cant get along. No one knows how to do their job and always put everything on one person..which was me when I was there. I got sick and they denied me a leave of absence but I was in the hospital with pneumonia. so they basically fired me due to me being sick because the staff they had didn't want to actually work. all the work got done more effiently when I was there so without me they had to do actual work. so in a long story short management and corporate have poor communication and support skills.
bad,They want numbers.  It's  all about numbers and speed and you had better not make a mistake.  Front end manager is usually jealous over pharmacist treatment and pay.  They think we are coddled and overpaid.  Stab you in the back whenever possible.
bad,"I disliked working at rite-aid. I enjoyed doing the work and the co-workers I had. My pay rate didn't add up to how much work I had to, and my manager was very disrespectful. I had some good times while I was there but, overall I disliked that job alot."
bad,"The management isn't well put together. They are really bad at communication. A typical day at work is horrible. I learned that the longer you have been there, the more stressful it gets. The hardest part of my job is everything. They always need help in other areas but refuse to train people. No one ever stays long enough to get the job done. They keep raising rate, so people barely make it and people just leave. The most enjoyable part of my job is leaving, I look forward to leaving all day."
bad,"The management is awful, the pay is worse, and if you have complaints, don't expect them to be heard."
bad,"Upper level management could care less about you. There was no opportunity for advancement, the pay was a joke. They took away the only good thing about workinf there which was 1199. Glad I got out when I did."
bad,Long hours mandatory overtime security has to let you in and half of the time they're not at the desk then management doesn't want to look into it prefers to let you go instead even tho you have high production numbers
bad,"After opening the pharmacy doors, typical day at Rite Aid included trying to fill scripts and maintain a proper workflow while trying to keep customers satisfied."
bad,"Rite Aid doesn't give their employees enough time or pay for the amount of work required of them. As a person who worked in management, I never felt like I had a day off. If an associate or someone called in sick, I was always on call to come in for them. It was as if I couldn't really enjoy my time off because I was always worried that I would be called in to work, especially during flu season. The lack of coverage was the biggest reason why I left the company. I just felt overworked with not enough benefits from it."
bad,"they pay terribly and don't care about their employees, even the managers get what other stores give for lower ranked positions, i wasted a year there only because i couldn't drive and had to walk somewhere close"
bad,"I worked with a lot of good people, I learned a lot about different departments working at Rite-Aid. The management team was very good and understood your out look on life."
bad,A typical day at Rite Aid distribution as a stocker/replenisher would include cutting boxed goods and organizing the goods accordingly. This was by far the most miserable job filled with the most miserable people I've ever worked with. It's a paycheck every week but the worst place i've ever worked.
bad,"They treat you like trash. If you are a pharmacist, they will constantly hound you even on your days off. to pick up extra shifts, go to meetings, ask you about things at the store (even if you are on vacation). The stores have no security, even if big issues happen. The technicians are paid minimum wage so there is a high turnover with tech help, leaving you with bad help or no help at all. The corporate culture is extremely negative. Pharmacist get no breaks, you are expected to work 12-14 hour shifts without a chair to even rest on."
bad,They can only have 2 Full time workers and when your part time you work 1 or 2 days for only 4 hours so you may need a second job if your living on your own. Specific managers are rude and lazy but not all. They let empolyee's get away with calling out last minute and or just not showing up.
bad,The company does not appreciate its customers or its employees. As a worked there what little employee appreciation programs they had disappeared. They cut a lot of corners to make money off of bad services and products for their customers. I quiet because I was tired of being treated badly and giving bad products to my customers.
bad,"Our pharmacy staff is wonderful and we're all like family. Management at district-level could be considered low quality at best and negligent at worst. The pay is terrible and the job is high-stress 24/7. The customer base varies, as with most jobs, but some can be truly terrible. In this position you can expect to be yelled at, berated, cursed at, and in general made to feel terrible."
bad,Not a good place to work ... This is one of the most stressful jobs I have had . There is No team work if you are good at your job you will be the only one doing it ....
bad,"Horrible, The environment is extremely stressful. Most of the managers are harsh with customers and employees. The money is Somewhat good, but I don't even think it is worth it to work there."
bad,"Overall I must say I wasted a few good years of my life. If you are a hardworking, dedicated individual, then this is not the place for you. The corporate will treat you as a number and not as a human."
bad,"The pay is low, corporate doesn't care for you or your well being. Completely understaffed. Its just a complete nightmare."
bad,"Really my experience was that they didn't care much for your family or you. Will take from you until you tell them to stop. On a store level all the way up to regional. "
bad,"I don't really have any complaint about the job it self, but management sucks. Each week they will bring new rules and more responsibilities but they will not add a peny to your salary. Management does favoritism, no necessory tools to do some parts of the job, registers go slow or will freeze at any time but mangement does not bother with them. They always bring new people and they don't stay long, so you're always training new employees which make you bored when it is repetitive. Leaving soon."
bad,Checking Inventory and Itinerary for the night. Learned how to go through the itinerary. Management wasn't good change schedule day of your shift. Loved my co-workers kept me coming in happy. Staying up all night some days that last hour was the hardest to keep my eyes open that's why I loved to stay busy. Most enjoyable part was knowing I had the whole day ahead of me.
bad,i would get to work at 9am than punch in and work the store to make everything was in order. i learned more from the people i worked with everyday than i ever did from management.
bad,"Work understaffed, the company keeps taking hours away. Job consists of customer service, business operations, daily banking."
bad,"i was working early morning, was doing stock room, looking experience items. order cover, doing the cashier, helping coworker and manger, answer the phone. day after day management become bad and change ."
bad,"Worked for RA for 2 years and I was never so miserable during that time. Senior management did not care about any of the people below them. When it came time for hiring for a Director of Construction position, none of the Regional Construction Managers were even interviewed for that position. Senior management already knew who they were goin to higher prior and chose not to interview the regional construction managers. Overall Rite Aid is not a good place to work they do not care about the balance of job and home life you are expected to work until the wee hours of the morning and get backup and the next day and do it all over again"
bad,Work there three years and dreaded every day there. It's a company with no morals.
bad,This company is all about making money and has zero care for its employees.
bad,The store I worked at district I worked at was unprofessional they also didn't protect use even though we had over 5 robbery's in 5 months. but other than that it was a easy job.
bad,"Out of every job I've had, no doubt this has been the absolute worst! The company is very short-staffed which means you will be overworked, the management teams already have their ""favorites"" and don't really seem to take any real interest in the advancement of anyone else, very,very poor on-the-job training, which explains why they are always so short-staffed and the turnover rate is so high, and no matter how many hours a day you work you will get nothing more than a 30 minute break. And yes they do break federal laws because for a whole month I was told I wasn't allowed a break! The best thing I've ever done was put in a two week notice. I'll never work at Rite Aid or even recommend it for anyone else! A friend tried to warn me before I applied, but I didn't listen. So, take it or leave it... you've been warned!"
bad,"The upper management in this company are clueless about what it takes to run a store and make decisions without taking that in to consideration. This company has become one that terminates associates because they make a mistake, as all human beings do. If you have reached a certain level you can say whatever, do whatever and there are no repercussions. However if you are under that level there is no room for error. The co-workers at my level and below are totally awesome and I love working with them every day."
bad,"It sucked, everyone is RUDE! Customer service is absolutle terrible!"
bad,My first job out of college. I worked very hard to earn my positions. I received no recognitions or appreciation. A very risky place to work as a young female manager.
bad,"It was horrible! 6 day work week, they called it 5 and 1/2 days - But I went in 6 days a week. Very demanding company!. I remebmber when the loss prevention guy would come in to investigate internal theft. he would pull a blank VCR tape off of the shelf and tell the suspected thief (employee) how they were seen on tape stealing. It was like what Cumberland Farms was accused of doing in the early 1990's."
bad,"Litttle room for growth, new management treat employees like dirt, the pay is not enought to support yourself better yet, a family."
bad,Managers try to push you to accomplish goals with threats and talking down to employees. No positive constructive criticisms. You will always feel as if your job is in jeopardy and never hear you did a good job.
bad,I never felt like I was part of the team. Manager always yelled at me in front of customers and other employees.  When I filed my complaint about it. He retaliated and I lost my job. He was never reprimanded.
bad,"Rite aid is barely surviving so the days are all about the number of shots you do daily. Annoying emails about these shot numbers every day. District leaders may or may not understand pharmacy since some are not pharmacists first. Terrible leadership and just plain annoying place to work. If you love being micro managed, understaffed and don’t mind feeling unimportant this is the place for you."
bad,They don’t wanna pay the pharmacy techs their worth. I worked there for 7 years and hadn’t made it $10 an hour and they knew I should be making far more than that. I was a big part of that pharmacy and knew customers by by name. . C
bad,"Corporation is bad. Concerned with money, but not people. No concern for employees or customers. Overworked, underpaid and unappreciated.  People quit continuously for those reasons."
bad,"You are not valued as a person just a robot! The more you do the more they want from you and the people who do absolutely NOTHING get to keep their jobs without consequence. If you are in management you will NEVER see your family; forget your kids birthdays, your anniversary, Christmas(they worship the devil), funerals etc. You can't even enjoy your EARNED vacation. STAY AWAY!!!!!"
bad,And all I can say is don’t make anyone mad make sure you make everyone happy every day so you can keep your job Because they say one thing and then do another .The DMs will always throw you under the bus to suit their self And then they make Lost prevention fires you.  I worked for Rite Aid for 16 years and this is want I got from Rite Aid
bad,"Great staff, very friendly. Very helpful, pharmacy staff is amazing. Really enjoy coming to this store, although the parking lot is not as nice. working there is cool."
bad,You never know anything until the day of. HR is a joke. Management is just as clueless as everyone else and if you work in Replen everyone is overworked and underpaid.
bad,I loved working here it’s just stressful like every other job you work I would have stayed if the pay was right. I was in management there and I was helping the other managers out.
bad,"A typical day at work for me would be cashing out customers, facing, stocking shelves on truck days, doing planograms, etc. I learned more social skills and also how to manage my time throughout my shifts which has helped me in the wrong run with my new founding career. The management was terrible, the boss always had attitude, always left nasty notes toward his employees If they didn't meet the quota for plenti/wellness scores, and also did not show any sort of caring emotion toward his customers. He was never thankful for the extra work that some of his employees put in during their shifts and was always more discouraging than positive. He yelled at his employees on multiple occasions IN FRONT of his customers instead of taking the employee into his office and confronting them about the issue at hand. The other workers were very stressed because of him and many had quit in a short amount of time. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the boss. The most enjoyable was working alongside other coworkers and managers who were very encouraging and told the other workers who were being discouraged by the head manager not to get discouraged because he acts this way towards every employee."
bad,Corporate makes Terrible business decisions. I liked my job but not the company. I would not pursue career there.  Look elsewhere for a solid company.
bad,It is a great company to work for. The corporate management suck at solving problems and immediate mangers suck at problem solving. Everyone wants to overlook the main issues. Immediate manager over the Asset Protection team likes to feed the AP team a lot of hopes and dreams and he does not follow through on his hopes and dreams. This company wants you to work above and beyond while  getting paid minimum wage.
bad,Does not train new associates on everything needed to do the job. They just throw you into the fire. When asked about company policy manager never got back to me. Does not pay well
bad,Was there five years and still couldn't get the equivalent to the rising of minimum wage. It's a joke you could bend over backwards and still not get credit
bad,I've worked at some places I enjoyed while that's a rarity as most were dreadful to me. It mostly depends on the pharmacist at hand if they have their priorities correct. Some I've seen spent most of the time talking rather than fulfilling prescriptions which led up to some very unhappy customers.
bad,No work/life balance.  Expected to work 10 to 12 hours and most Saturdays.  Company not able to keep employees.  Employees do not receive enough training
bad,I constantly argued w management because she never left me alone. She hated me. She ever pulley me aside once during my lunch to disc my weight and eating habits . I was so out raged.
bad,"According to me, it,s not good place to work because pay rate is very low after 2and 1/2 just got 8.25 per hour in pharmacy. Lots of work and less menpower. Too much work load on pharmasist & technicians.Always top managemet wants more business but do not want to pay more."
bad,swing door of employees - abuse the the employees with long hours because they were always short of staff-you know what time you start never know done
bad,"Rite Aid is an overall great company, few stores are not managed correctly. Rite Aid on hwy278 is managed terribly and breaks many company rules performing illegal acts."
bad,"Fast paced work place, way to much mandatory overtime, don’t care about workers to much ,bi-weekly payday .When I first joined the Rite Aid team things sounded great, Work days were only 8-10 hours, Do to lack of employees the work days are up to a constant 11 1/2-12 hours every day and sometimes Saturday is required. Management seems to prioritize their other building."
bad,"Before the change in management, this location was pretty chill. after the new *creepy manager came in, everything went down. me, and several others, reported verbal harassment to hr and in the end i quit"
bad,I believe this company is being bought out.  I liked the technology very much and the co-workers were very friendly and helpful.I wish hem all good luck.
bad,"Place was a joke when I worked for them years ago. Main job description was front desk cashier but you were also expected to stock shelves and hang sale signs in 12 aisles, run the photo lab, do Western Union, collect shopping carts, clean ""including outside the store"", set up displays, take phone calls etc. Granted, you could never stay in one spot at the register so the customers were typically in a bad mood by the time you were able to get back up there to assist them. Sale ads were idiotic, if you didn't show up during the first couple hours on Sunday for certain items you were pretty much out of luck for the week due to lack of quantity. Shoplifting was out of control and every time inventory rolled around, DM blamed the employees for the money shortage. In the break room they provided us with magazines called ""The Rite Times"" which did nothing but degrade the employees and more or less label us all as worthless criminals. The DMs were all incredibly rude, constantly in a bad mood and had unrealistic expectations."
bad,"Job could be so much better! Over tasked and no payroll,  no training hours for new associates, upper management micro managed. Being a manager you have to open the store alone, run the register, receive vendors, check dates on pages of products, change prices, answer phone, make schedule, go to bank,. when a cashier comes on you are free to get something done. Payroll is non existent for hiring and training your staff. If you like working 10 hour shifts, unloading trucks, working nights, weekends and holidays then you'll succeed here. If you need help with anything, don't count on your DM or HR,  They're too busy pushing you too get flu shots for every customer. Stores are old and tired looking."
bad,The company does not allow room for advancement. The benefits are okay but as an employee you have a very high deductible. Vacation time is okay but does not include sick time.
bad,"wasnt treated with respect, company did not support me when i was working loss prevention in dangerous areas. i was sent to urban areas because of my skin color, my manager felt i should be able to relate to people of color because of my skin color. job was very stressful. i never could get a strait answer. By the time i had a boss that was respectful n made the job ok. i was driving way out of my way to work. which was extra economic struggle i couldnt afford. when my manager stated he was leaving i had no choice but to leave because i would be put with a manager i previously worked with and that person was not respectful to me and others from my observation."
bad,They treated you like you don't matter. The pay is low. The management is unintelligent. The supervisor only hires females. Leaving was the best thing I ever did.
bad,"Rite aid is not a fun place to work, I believe that there are many prejudice employees at rite aid. Things are not professional in any way. Managers are fake."
bad,I would not recommend working here if you can't handle a fast-paced or stressful environment. Corporate expects unrealistic goals. The best part about working here is the relationship you make with your regular customers.
bad,"A great place to get your feet wet but poor customer service culture. The push is for quantity rather than quality. Constantly short on staff and hours. You will be on your feet all day and your shift will pass quickly. "
bad,It was ok job has long you kept your nose clean and stayed away from the drama great people to work with I had lot of fun help customers unload truck put up liquor off the truck learn new things
bad,I worked full time and was in school. i worked ten hour shifts from 7pm to 530 am. I told my manager that I was in school and I could work my ten hours I just needed to be off by at exactly 530. That meant work me harder and make me stay after 530. Once 530 would come and I would tell them I needed to go all that mattered is I get the work off. Not to mention it's ok for dayshift to leave work but as night shift we had to do our work and the work from dayshift. They don't care about you or your health. The building is dirty and dusty. And the production percentage was 96%. I was new there and within my second month I was at a 98% and they were still complaining. The best thing about rite aid is the cafeteria.
bad,Not a good company to work for. No room for growth. Do not fully train you for the job. Long hours no break. Does not follow procedures where it comes to pay raises. does not pay you enough for all you have to do
bad,I worked frontend cashier it was a good job but wouldn't get my break & when I would ask for a 10 min to get a drink the girl taking my spot looked mad for cashiering like...
bad,A typical day at work for me was always doing tasks my store or assistant manger gave me. I did learn a lot of things that I can take with me to other places to advance myself.
bad,"This company will use you and your time and you can be the best worker there one mistake and your out. In my experience working there they always want you to miracles in rain sleet or snow clear the garbage outside that had random items people would dispose there such as clothing, panties bra, sneakers, old baby diapers dead dogs, the list goes on but yeah they told us it was our job to do a task that could potentially get us sick didnt provide any type of protective wear to do these task. As for inside the store security was bad people came in and stole all the time no matter how many times they got caught. Had some old drunk lady name mary who came in there every night disturbing the customers and workers nobody cared. They had an open ceiling in the stockroom / cooler/ break room with alot of exposed wires and rats would eat the merchandise and the workers still put it out."
bad,this was a very busy store very nice people to work with rite aide for me was a stepping stone after getting certified learned about how insurance works and any new medications comming out
bad,A lot of work bare minimum pay. Never have a set schedule. The company cares more about customers than employees. Employees has to fend for themselves.
bad,enjoyed meeting new surroundings and learning new methods of work flow.gain new knowledge of better customer service and pharmacy day to day operation.
bad,rite aid says they care but they really don't trust me! underpaid wasnt appreciated even after being only hard worker would not reccomand
bad,"They have not had a manager for over a year in the pharmacy and everyone just does what they want. There is no motivation to get work done and I can't work with people like that. People like that are in every work place, but NO ONE had any work ethic."
bad,"This is a job that is okay when you are in school as it allows you to have a flexible work schedule. I would not recommend this job as a career position. It is unfulfilling, menial work that offers horrible pay and leadership that is always trying to do more with less."
bad,horrible! its the worse job ever! they couldn't pay me enough to work back in that sweat box. very dirty bathrooms and the bosses there are very mean to the workers
bad,"I have nothing good to say about this company, they wear you out, I was doing 400 scripts a day by myself and being micromanaged on the smallest details. I did not feel comfortable working there and went home every night questioning if I killed someone because I had to work so quickly and under so much pressure."
bad,"I did cashiering, balanced my drawer and stocking products. My manager was unorganized and not a friendly person. My co-workers acted stuck up. I liked working with the customers."
bad,like walgreens.  typical pharmacy job.  ok people.  funny customers because they are medicated and are usually angry and grouchy when they go in.
bad,"I learned a lot from my previous boss is now retired. I am able to run a store if I decided to do so. My most enjoyable moment is learning and meeting the different people that come through that day each day I work. I enjoyed my customers and that was truly the best part about my job. The hardest part was my new boss, he just didn't understand the meaning of caring and that people have their own lives. It was really bad but I choose not talk about it. The two years I worked for my new boss was stressful. But working for him made me deal with stress very well. And I truly never thought I could work in stressful situations with a person is so cold and disrespectful. I stayed at my job through all of that because I refused to let someone stop me from succeeding and accomplishing my goals. I wish him all the best and I even pray for him regardless of what he is doing and how he treats his employee's."
bad,Not a good place to work. Its was ok while it lasted. They were all about saving money but did not care what the workers felt like.
bad,"I assist in customer service with both front end and pharmacy."
bad,"I have worked with Rite Aid for the last 3 years. While I appreciate the learning opportunity I was given there, the company itself has much room for improvement. My first manager was a true rarity. Knowledgeable, friendly, patient and kind. He taught me so much of what I know today. This has not been my experience with most of the other managers I have met through the years. The company over works and under pays their employees and does not provide a safe work environment. The company is also big on playing favorites and turns a blind eye to many illegal practices. I was fortunate enough to have learned much due to the fast pace of the stores I was at and make some wonderful customer connections, but I would have to say those are the only 2 positive things I gained form working at Rite Aid."
bad,"A typical day at work would be to stock shelves, backup cashier, scoop ice cream, clean restrooms, mop entire store floor, receive load and break the load down twice a week, setup entire seasonal shelves and lots of other duties. I learned the true meaning of hard labor when I worked there. The management was ok and co-workers were great. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was when the load came in because I was by myself almost always due to the new hires always quitting after a couple of days so generally I had to break down all the pallets and distribute them through out the store, and let me tell you those totes were not light at all. The only thing I really enjoyed were the people I worked with."
bad,The leadership is terrible as is the advancement and labor given to operate facility.
bad,I used what was giving to me as a learning experience. I thank the company for giving me an opportunity to gain experience in the field but there was not enough money for me and the hours made it hard for me to balance my life outside of the company. The management there suck and none of your personal business is kept confidential. I developed the passion of taking part of being a compassionate caregiver in the medical industry.
bad,I went out of town to do my assistant manager training the store manager that trained me was really great. I enjoyed working in her store and coworkers. After I was put in the store that I would work in. it was ok and I enjoyed the nightshift co-workers Things seemed to be going well. Thats really it.
bad,always kept going back to the rite aid with tantalizing salary promises and managements promises conditions would change. 25 years later they are still on verge of bankruptcy and have the most vicious mid level management in retail today
bad,"Executive managements' only answer to their bad marketing and business decisions is to attempt to further ""leverage"" payroll by asking exempt personnel to do more with less."
bad,Most of the pharmacists that I have worked with or that I know that work for this company are overwhelmed and exhausted from the poor work conditions that include lack of tech help and excessive work loads. The upper management is not supportive and unresponsive.
bad,It has now been over 3 years since I left the company and I can’t believe how much I still despise the place. Every single day I went to work was awful. ALWAYS bombarded. Constantly fighting with angry patients because our best was just never good enough due to being understaffed. If I was sick and needed to call out it was somehow my responsibility to find coverage. Clocked out twice and went straight to the ER. Zero flexibility. No life with such crazy hours
bad,"Worked at Rite Aid for over a year. Was paid poorly and never got an increase when everybody else was getting paid 2 or more dollars more per hour than I was for the same job title and I had more experience."
bad,They’re too cheap to hire security from thieves and robberies. If u have anxiety don’t apply if you don’t u will get anxiety. Understaffed as well. Don’t risk it
bad,"Was excited at first, but the people were very cliquey. At times felt like they talked too much and I was the one doing all the work. They would talk about each other behind their backs including the GM who should have been a better example. Would not recommend to anyone."
bad,This place is not a family. Whether they try anf drill it in your head or not. Advancement is a joke. Rite aid is open 365 all year round no holidays.
bad,"A typical day at Rite Aid is just standing in one spot for countless hours ringing up customers, unless I was on the floor stocking shelves on truck day. Something that I have gained from working at Rite Aid is my confidence, especially with the public. I loved my manager at the time he was probably the best boss I have had this far. The hardest part about the job was being at the front end of the store and just standing and standing. The most enjoyable part of my job was the last hour of my shifts and enjoying the company of my fellow co-workers, who got me thru each shift."
bad,This is a horrible place especially as a manager youbhave no work life balance. You are always working. There were many weeks where i didn't see my husband.
bad,It's been over 12 years since I have work for them not sure how it is now can only say what it was then and they had alot of poor management I loved it there till the end
bad,"company has been on between death and life support for a decade and still struggles with terrible leadership and no care at all for the results. if you are part of 'the club', you're set. if not, beware."
bad,"Not a well run company, upper management gives in store employees the bare minimum to succeed. They cut corners at all costs and are a very cheap company, so in turn, the emloyees have no incentive to stay or give good effort. "
bad,Always open on every major holiday. Terrible upper management. No incentive to promote. Treats employees as numbers and figures as opposed to being actual people.
bad,"Worked at a high crime store, asked for help to secure store and store employees with no help from the bosses. Moral in the site was low, which made it miserable to go to work daily"
bad,"Work doesn't match pay, dont let you move up in the company. Always short staffed, this company has gone down in the last few years. Dont think it will last long"
bad,"There was no professional growth. Very boring and slow pharmacy. I enjoyed some of the people I worked with also some of my patients. but, I did not like the location."
bad,"If your looking for career advancement, then you have to work with the company at least 10+ years. Work life balance is non existent. As a manager, your phone constantly rings even if you are at a funeral and you district manager asks about labor. Your phone cannot be turned off if you are on vacation. Break time for managers are never allowed since the labor is so horrible that you are there with just one person most of the time."
bad,Not enough hrs. Not enough staff. Alot of people that r in the wrong job titles. They will hire people with no retail background. So the people there r training them. Then they quit.
bad,I put in 10 years of my life and they didn’t appreciate anything. Chump change for raises. In the 10 years. All I got was $3 more. To get a raise. They very seldom promoted from within because DM always brought in someone else from outside.
bad,I have worked for this company for 10+ years and in that time I have watched it go from a company that cared about the customers well being to a company that only cares about making money.
bad,"Would not recommend working there. Multiple instances of racial, sexuality, gender, and religious discrimination from management. Spoke to the manager about constant harassment issues toward myself and multiple black women coworkers from regular customers and no steps were taken to make a better and safer work environment for their employees."
bad,"Awful place to work as a pharmacy technician. Poor compensation, limited benefits, uncollaborative, and awful corporate contacts. The worst place to work and getting out is the best decision I’ve made."
bad,"The managers have no experience in talking to people like people. Very rude and not understanding whatsoever, and will require full work duties even if you are unable to do things due to a medical condition."
bad,"negative atmosphere, gossiping employees, no teamwork, very rude to other employees, managers treat you like your a child, filthy bathrooms, no one wants to help clean"
bad,"Avoid at all costs unless your a pharmacists, Do yourself a favor and stay far away. Company is going to go under my life has been threatened many times the security is a joke sometimes you don't even have a guard on site!"
bad,terrible manager to work with.  the DM let the manager get away with just about anything. Store never in compliance with any sort of LP policies. He's beyond lazy and the culture is very toxic.  He constantly puts everyone down to make himself feel better.  The whole environment is just a terrible place to even be in.
bad,"High staff turn over created a stressful environment for the front end staff. Pharmacy wasn't as bad, but there were difficulties in finding qualified staff with availability to work needed shifts"
bad,If you want any kind of work lie balance this place is not for you. We worked 12+ hours a day 6 days a week and were threatened with loosing out job if we needed to go home.
bad,During the Walgreen supposed buyout of Rite Aid my position was eliminated without even as much as a warning. Two day notice. I was not even offered another position and I worked there without missing work. Did what I was told and Store Manger never even stood up for me. Said it was a low volume store. Pharmacy techs come and go like flys and the pay scale is awful for them. Spent 4 years getting the flu clinics and outreach and this is how they thank you. They have Corporate problems.
bad,"Its perfect when the store is caught up. a lot of downtime, which kills motivation. Hours kept getting cut and other rite aid stores are getting closed and losing hours. Company's trying to get out of debt by selling majority of its stores to walgreens and it keeps getting pushed back. Job security is unknown and favoritism is strong there."
bad,This is the most stressful place you could work and make no pay with no breaks. You will be yelled at and treated like you mean nothing at allto the company.
bad,It started as a positive career advancement.. Then the disappointment of no communication.I thinknonce they get the correct people in the right areas it'll be a great choice.
bad,"They do not view employees as people. Constantly pushed to fill quotas, but also enforced the customer experience. There is precious little room between the two for any leeway; one always had to be sacrificed to do the other. It is IMPOSSIBLE to do every task they assign on a daily, weekly, biweekly, and monthly basis! Terrible attitude from higher management, but the individual pharmacy managers were wonderful to work with because they saw the daily struggle. They were in the same boat as we were, and did everything they could to please the customer and still be legal and safe in all practices. Merging with Walgreens made everything 100% worse. Still had to do all the pointless quotas from Rite Aid, but new requirements from the new ownership conflicted, and the workflow rules did NOT work with our computer program. Absolutely the most stressed I have ever been in my LIFE. I witnessed people quit left and right after the merge began to show in the stores. Customer complaints increased because we were too slow with the added kinks to our system. Happy for the experience, and wish it was like it was when I started in 2014. But the direction the company has taken does not mirror what it was back then. There was some semblance of caring, now there is none."
bad,"I worked there for 20 years and only used 3 sick days, when I had a personal medical emergency I was told I no longer had my position as a store manager, I never told them I couldn't do my job anymore. The district Manager could really use a course on people skills."
bad,"being the front store was a new environment for me to work in lots of lifting, management was great, very friendly. store made  a lot a since then."
bad,"pro: "
bad,"Company is ludicrous in management of shoplifting and continues to breed an environment where it is increasing at a fast pace.  They continue to expect employees to monitor this problem give them no tools or directions on how to do it. Then fire them across the country when they do it wrong.  see all blogs around the country"
bad,"They were very unprofessional."
bad,"I did enjoy working for this company until I felt that I was not treated the same as other employees. I worked 3rd shift which is a very hard shift to work my job was very tiresome due to the fact of being on my feet 8-10 hours per night and constantly moving, when I would apply for 1st shift positions,I was over looked several times and the positions were given to someone who had less time than myself with the company. I tried to come back to work on light duty work after having an operation and was told there was no light duty work available for me which I knew was not so. "
bad,Working for the leader in the Supply Chain is only good if you bow to his every need. Will only look out for #1 which is him.
bad,"I am the store manager but my dm is pushed by her boss and coming down on the managers demanding us to do the impossible tasks of running the store, being the cashier, the assistant and the shift manager. Very stressful because employees don’t stay long because the company doesn’t pay enough. Walmart pays more."
bad,Mind numbingly boring. Nice co-workers but not worth it. I could feel my life waste away every minute I was on the clock. The only perk for working there is the 20% discount.
bad,"Its an ok place to work. You can get promoted in fact I did without even trying. It can be challenging and they do promote a team environment its just sometimes hard to tell which team we are on"
bad,"I loved my work as a Pharmacy Technician but would never do it again in a retail chain. I am not sure if other companies are this bad when it comes to their Pharmacies but RiteAid's priorities were backwards. "
bad,"Over the years, corporate has rolled out more in-store promotions and implemented so much superfluous ""ideas"" and hasn't compensated their store level employees to make up for all of the added work. The company has gone downhill and I don't recommend anyone to work there."
bad,"poor treatment of all employees especially pharmacists"
bad,Good company to work for if you like maintaining a particular position for an extended time. Store level associates are generally fantastic to work with.
bad,"Everyday was stressful"
bad,rite aid was the first job had as an adult but did not get a raise i like what i did but they wanted me to do three jobs and payed me pennies i know my worth now
bad,It’s a job. I need the job that’s why I don’t quit outright. The people I work with are wonderful and almost like family. The management as for as District Leadership leaves the employees feeling dejected
bad,"If you apply to b a cashier, be prepared to do everything else. I’m talking being a janitor, a stocks man and etc. all this extra hard work for 7.25 an hour"
bad,"When I first was interviewed with the Store Manager, It was a great introduction to the company...Right at that monent..I felt I would like to work for them.At this point, I needed to find employment to sustain me..I am grateful fir the opportunity. ."
bad,"It is okay, you lear a lot."
bad,Horrible. The pay does equal up to the work. It takes too long to progress. There is no way anyone could work starting off in the first year and have their own place and sustain a normal life.
bad,"Between running a store and customer service,  work load was very consuming with little or no manpower. This company was very demanding with less hours and hardly anyone to cover shifts. I'm sure at one time it was a great company to work for but with most H R managers who never worked at store level as a retail clerk are clueless how cashiers, Ice cream clerks, assistant managers, shift supervisors and store managers are the ones who are important and the company succeeds. The unfortunate thing about some stores is favoritism. But if u are transferred to a store where co workers care about working rather than creating drama, than the job gets easier since your not carrying most of the load. Loyal customers are awesome. They are a big part of why most of us came to work."
bad,Good place to work although the Management is all a group and will quickly retaliate like they did to me don't care will get ride of you quick
bad,"The so called training program does not exist.  First Pharmacy manager used shaming as a method of training.  We learned by making mistakes and being ridiculed  for it.  My manager once sent me back to the ""losers bench""(her words) for making a rookie mistake; nothing that put anyone at risk.  Fortunately i wasnt her main target as i worked hard and kept mistakes to a minimum. There is no room for advancement without a pharmacy education, but youre not even encouraged to develop in your own position.   I have leadership potential and I couldnt  see myself in a support role forever.  I didn't feel relevant; I didn't feel respected."
bad,"I enjoyed working at Rite Aid when I started there as a pharmacy intern. The store was busy and we had plenty of help in the pharmacy to adequately handle how busy the pharmacy was. As my 8 years at Rite Aid continued, the help was cut back severely each year which made everyone's life more stressful.  In fact, one of our pharmacy technicians died from cancer and they never replaced her after she passed away. Management became worse as my time there went on also. They were always adding more and more work for the pharmacist but they would not give us extra help so we could get the work done. It was ridiculous. On the plus side, I loved my co-workers and they became like family to me. It was very hard to leave because I loved my pharmacy team. Also, the in-store management team was great and I was compensated well."
bad,work was hard co workers care for them selfs  was promised training did't get any no communication and building was cold was not fun to work for
bad,help the pharmacists provide medication and other health care products to patients and consumers.
bad,Rite aid was by far my least favorite job because the managers were very rude and they showed favoritism towards other employees. IT was a easy job i was good at and i was fast. I worked well with everyone and most importantly i gave each every customer excellent customer service. Although my current job doesn't give out enough its way more peaceful then rite aid was.
bad,"This was a terrible company to work for. The hours were long, 12 hour shifts with no breaks. Management only cared that we kept numbers of prescriptions filled to a certain level. Customer complaints such as, prescriptions took 20 minutes to fill, were met with disciplinary action. We filled 400 prescriptions a day on average with just 3 employees. I enjoyed working with my boss. He was very supportive and funny and he worked so hard to keep up with the demand."
bad,"The store i worked for everyone was kind and helpful in teaching you, i had to work different stores to get hours. The one store  the some of the employees  were backstabbers only caring about themseves. I thought rite aid was suppose to be teamwork..its to bad too i loved working in my main store too.  Karma  for those who think thetes an i in teamwork"
bad,"clock in run around between my long list of assignments and customer calls.then back to the registers because its usually only 1 associate and a manager.i learned a lot of things in my first year after then i was alone in the wild with no opportunity to get promoted.out of the 5 mangers we have only 2 are reasonably fair with the rest of the associates.the rest of them abide by favoritism rather than the rules the union place on them.the co-workers are fun and easy to get along with,if your lucky most of them cry and complain all day and avoid doing what they have too.the hardest part of my job would probably be catching up with the store at the end of the day we have so much to do like take all the go backs to the aisles in its correct placing.cleaning the floor,straightning the store and cleaning everything so the associates whom open can work comfortably.and then do it all over the next day.the most enjoyable part of the job would be the day we receive the truck,breaking load and enjoying an alone day in the back with the load. it stinks"
bad,I worked as a shift supervisor in Red Bank TN and finally quit because it was impossible to satisfy the district manager. Anything we did was never good enough for him. The entire store would work so hard to get things done and everytime he came and went we felt like dirt. I finally left for a competitor who treats me like a human being.
bad,Overnight shift management regulates employees very poorly and in those regards employees become disgruntled. Too much gossip and jealousy between employees and arguements. Overnight shift does not dip well with suppressing and
bad,Mananager is great. The company sucks. The regional managers only care for advancement and lie and blame everyone else for there decisions. Regional believes women don't belong in the workplace
bad,"They were completely unorganized, do not value good employees or good work ethics, they lack the ability to manage the work crew sufficiently and there is no room for advancement in the pharmacy area , nor is the pay good. And you get paid every 2 weeks which I did not like."
bad,"If your able to work with a good pharmacy manager the jobs is not stressful. "
bad,"they're not take care of their employers, always put more work but no raise. if you're excellent in your job they don't care.for them if you don't like the just give up."
bad,"It was a fun lace to work at when I first started in the replenishment dept, then moved up to full case pick and shipping then re-pack and then it wasn't as fun anymore."
bad,Should be better pay for the work you do but overall I learned a lot and met a lot of great people just wish the pay was better and there wasn't a lot of favoritism going on
bad,"I was working by myself a lot."
bad,Went to work not knowing what time we (employees) were going to get off. They give us a goal that's impossible to reach considering that the third shift doesn't have as many employees as first shift.
bad,"It's a corporate world."
bad,"I was hired in the pharmacy part-time as a 'Pharmacy Associate'. Despite having several years of experience in a Rite Aid before (my first job), I was hired at minimum wage."
bad,"I was a front end clerk at this Riverside store. I would have recommended others to work at this company prior to 2008, however, Rite Aid took a big hit during this year. Progressively, hours were being cut and as employees left, no new hires would be taken to replace them. When I began working for this store (which was this highest grossing store in the region), There would be eight employees in the store at one time; when I left, there were only a maximum of three allowed to work per shift. Much has suffered because of this move and I do not see it getting any better."
bad,"Web access to pharmacy letter and CE- City provided by employer; nice perk. Web portal access to clinical pharmacy, pharmacist letter, PMP, FLAVOR-RX, NPI enumerator,  and HMS. Many useful forms and information available on pharmacy workstation computers."
bad,"I was in management for well over 10 years, Rite Aid took over from Payless Drugs and from day one we were lied too.  Then closed store after store due to corrupt son of original owner.  "
bad,"I wouldnt recommend anyone to work for a compmay that allows a Pharmacist to steal and get away with it. Then turn around and PROMOTE her with her own store intead of  being reprimanded. They covered it up, then found the very first excuse to use it against me. Worst company ever, very disappointed and went ..against everything we were taught and their mission.  "
bad,"Working for Rite Aid as a teenager was great while I was learning how to build job skills, however, it is hard to move up in the company. I would say that it is a great place to work while attending college, so that you have some money for school. Other than that, I did not enjoy my three and a half almost four years with the company."
bad,Lots of pointless work and rules and regulations put in by people working in the corporate office made It hard to do your job without interference. Also there was terrible hours
bad,Is a very good experience to work at rite aid pharmacy even though I haven't been treating in a right way. To work with all the patients is my Passion.
bad,"great work place , but some people can be very rude. terrible pay. that was my main issue and over worked. mandatory overtimes. the 15 minutes break feel like 5 minutes."
bad,The stressful micro-managing culture wears you down over time and ruins self-confidence. I was very pleased to start the job but quickly found the culture was detrimental.
bad,"I only lasted a few months, as I would often leave work crying from the awful treatment of one coworker in particular. I brought up the mistreatment to the manager, and hardly anything was done about it. I left because the work was not stimulating, I had to fight for breaks or they would forget to give them to me, and because my coworkers were miserable."
bad,"Manager hovered behind me and would yell at me because I wasn't as fast as someone who had been there for several years!  After a week, I left."
bad,Wow where to begin. The ambiance is definitely stressful and toxic.  I've learned to work the register after much humilation which is the teaching technique they use. I've also perfected the art of taking out the garbage.  I took this job to gain experience as a pharmacy technician but I see now that's never going to happen.  I've worked for rite aid for a month now without seeing a penny.  Then just yesterday I was tripped by one of the coworkers which resulted in hurting my leg. It's been an interesting experience working at rite aid so far.  I like working with people and working there can be pleasant at times but I'm definitely not sure how much longer I can take it especially if they keep procrastinating training.
bad,"I started off opening the store. Then get all registers ready for the opening. Count down the deposit. I did freshness, zeros,recalls, damage / out dates, ordering product for the store. Making sure schedule was right with who was working. Opening the store, greeting customers, waiting on customers answering their questions, answering phones. Then after my cashier came in I would start on plan o grams. Cleaning shelves,stocking,helping in the pharmacy if needed. The hardest part of the job was lack of communication,with our higher up management. Nobody was ever on the same page. I loved my customers and they loved me. I had customers come in just to say hi or if they lost a loved one they would come in and I was there. I've come back to the store after leaving work because a customer want to talk to me or needed my help. I feel I am a real people person."
bad,I didnt like this place one bit.I loved helping the customers but mu co workers and managers are the worst.
bad,"I'd rather not comment. I wasn't there long enough to give any positive feedback. "
bad,the reason I left the rite aide I was working at it was a very toxic environment they retaliate on you if things didn't go there way. mangers were very petty and talk about your personal business in front of customers on the floor
bad,They do not appreciate how much you do.  They do not appreciate dedication.   They do not give decent raises.  They took too much insurance money from me for 3 yrs and would not refund it.  Highly disappointed in this company.  They take and do not give.   They do not care about their employees.
bad,Rite Aid was probably the most difficult job I had but I loved the coworkers and store manager. I just think that they needed more staff because the coverage was the worst part but I learned how to be a team player and an even better shift supervisor.
bad,"A normal day at work is crazy, I go from helping customers to unloading truck. I love having many different things to do, multi tasking at all times is a must and you need to be able to work under pressure."
bad,Very under staff. No help. Lack of employee well being by management. Disgruntled co-workers. Very unsecured environment to work in.
bad,The pay is not worth the tasks and other things you have to deal with. They never show appreciation. They are very unprofessional and don’t handle conflict very well.
bad,"I was given a conditional job offer for the night warehouse position. They completed the background check, and I was denied a position. I am on felony probation. Instead of giving me a chance, and asking me what happend, they made their own decision to not hire me. Completely unfair. The lady that hired me really liked me, and then they denied me. Society makes it extremely hard on people without giving them fair chances. They could've given me chance and then just fired me if it didn't work out. I would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"They are so unprofessional they don’t help you at all they don’t pay you over time they don’t pay for sick days they don’t do anything of that sort so it was very hard working there when you didn’t have any help ,"
bad,"My manager was new and bad at her job couldn’t take criticism and all ways thought she was right. The district manager was even worse he walked around threatening jobs everyday for things the store manager did wrong, the benefits suck, hours suck, and the company doesn’t care about its workers."
bad,Avoid if you're in the south. The company started off fine but you can see the company start to falter as hours are being reduced and eventually sold. Now walgreens is monopolizing the pharmacy world to the point the  means of becoming a pharmacist is null.
bad,"The Security managers were awful, wanted me to drive my wrecked car to work just so I could get there, couldn't get a ride to the car rental place and Enterprise couldn't come and get me. My car had no outside mirror, cracked windshield, dented door, and a dented fender."
bad,"I worked downtown Philadelphia, and there was poor management. I wasn’t allowed bathroom breaks at all, and the managers were never around when needed. I worked over the summer and the store had no air conditioner. I had to work at the register with a small fan. It was a terrible experience."
bad,"The job is very straight forward, get the truck to the shelf.  Outside of that there was no personal development, and management was coasting as the company was going out of business."
bad,"Rite Aid does not stand behind their employees, if your in the click with upper management, then you do no wrong!!! The No harassment law JOKE  I was backed up in a corner, not being able to leave a heated situation. I truly thought Rite Aid would stand behind my decision at time if situation,  but I was let go. I never called off , worked overtime due , always 💯"
bad,Got hired at a low rate with my manager experience they didn't provide enough training for me as a supervisor I was making $0.05 more than a cashier  too many turnovers
bad,They fired me while i was out on medical leave having reconstructive surgery due to having a car accident and my vehicle had caught on fire so i Also had ptsd..i had been employed 5 years. They let me go 8 days before my drs were releasing me back to work..i felt like out of spite.
bad,Boring job weird customers at night dead area close it down or make it a 24 hr Walgreens may bring more traffic it's a store full of nothing literally nothing in there but cold drinks
bad,Low wages not enough hours and no room for growth very negative employees with low pay and high expectations of the company unsaintary work conditions with outdated equipment causing health risk for employees.
bad,Rite Aid was a terrible place to work.  The management does not treat employees well.  They are not a stable company.  Their employment practices are questionable.
bad,I don't like working at rite aid because they don't pay me my register am so mad about that it hurts me to see that everyone else get more money than me
bad,I work as a clerk for the company in a very stressed economic area where the majority of clientele are on a form of assistance.
bad,A typical day could either be extremely stressful or very boring. It always depended on the day. Someday you felt like you were making what you were worth and other day's they couldn't pay you enough. I learned so much being a shift supervisor there. I pretty much always had good managers there. Always got along with them but they always followed different sets of rules which meant the workplace culture depended on the manager. The hardest part of the job was typically the customers and the day. You just never knew what the day was going to bring and after 15 years I always thought I had seen everything and then something new would happen. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships I formed with the customers and the employees. After being at the same store for my entire career with Rite Aid I knew a lot of customers by name and even what they were going to buy. It was kinda of fun to remind people if they needed stuff if they didn't get their regular stuff.
bad,Management is awful. You are underpaid and severely mistreated. Never get overtime pay regardless the hours you work. There is no room to advance your career. It is all around unpleasant.
bad,"The pharmacy technician receives horrible pay, the job can get stressful, corporate rite aid is absolutely nonsensical. Rite aid constantly shoots themselves in the foot and then blames people who have no control over it."
bad,"Rite Aid is a poor example for an company, with no room for growth. It was a waste of a working experience, poor management, and poor pay. It is also an unappererciate company."
bad,Inconsistent work hours. poorly trained management under qualified human resources personnel and one of the most cut throat warehouse jobs you'll find in the quiet corner
bad,"I wouldn't recommend even shopping there let alone work for them. probably the worst job I've ever had, the last year I was there. I would never work for them again no matter how much they paid me"
bad,"This was the least professional environment in which I had ever worked."
bad,"The pay is low, but nice customers make the experience worth it. Many of the Rite Aids have been robbed at gun point and they only provide security for a few weeks"
bad,I did not enjoy working here. The hours were unstable. The pay was terrible and the customers were rude. Additionally the management was unprofessional.
bad,"Good place to work, fast paced, good coworkers. Only bad thing is that the don't hire  full time right away, which is a bummer, but over all good job."
bad,"Pending the day it either went super fast or dragged on. We entered insurance information, contacted Dr.'s offices, made sure a 15 minute turn out goal was met with each patient."
bad,Awful.  Hated it.  Went 6 months without a Friday off.  4 months without a Saturday off.  Had to work every holiday.  Honestly the worst job that I have ever had
bad,On your feet all day but learned different medications and how to fill medications.  Most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the clients.  Fun place to work with co-workers
bad,"Management was poor, co-workers were rude. The store had no manager for about a month, then when one was appointed to us management would quit."
bad,was one of my first jobs for high school students the average adult couldn't possibly live off there income and the staff is ify most days
bad,"I do not recommend this place to work, the management is poor and not handled well at a corporate level, which makes it really hard to deal with."
bad,"Rude and noisy co workers."
bad,Lack of management from immediate supervisor.  Favoritism shown to some employees.  Hours were long and not divided fairly among all employees.
bad,Working for Rite aid was a tedious and dull work experience. Employer has very little empathy for there employees with physical or health problems. They do not make it very easy for needing less hours. They are overly strict on tardiness.
bad,"Cutting open boxes for selection."
bad,"managers or ""shift"" supervisors think they are on a higher pedestal and talk down to you in front of customers. completely unorganized. manager only hired good looking women to work in his store. was not given the day off when a family member passed. was forced to only take a 10 minute break when I found out and get back to work"
bad,"This company was not very employee friendly.  My hours were kept just low enough not to receive benefits.  Even though I worked throughout my pregnancy, I was required to lift heavy objects and climb ladders, even at 9 months."
bad,"the individual pharmacy I worked at went through a management change, shortly after a large percentage of the workforce left."
bad,"They expect you to run the pharmacy with almost zero technical help. Weekends you get no help, but are expected to run the drop-off window, pick-up window, drive-thru window, perform immunizations, and perform MTM. As well as enter Rx's, fill Rx's, sell Rx's in addition to all of the other expected duties."
bad,"I Stocked and faced the items in store, set up displays, greeted and rang up customers, answered telephones, handled cash and I also cleaned and maintained the store."
bad,fun helping customer an working when store was very busy because i like to stay busy an stay focused on my job. very up beat an a leaning experience daily. wored with unloading an sending out damaged goods an printing photos
bad,"I worked for this same exact store for over 10 years going back to when the store was Eckerd. My first 9 years there were great and then new management took over and basically kicked me to the curb. I was in charge of the food, candy and beverage departments where i would order and stock the shelves in those areas. Once the new manager came in and took over, he took over over those areas and sales went down, out of stock items increased, and more outdate product was found in these areas. With no managment in place it was basically everyone for themselves with no teamwork to make this a good store."
bad,Rite Aid gave great flexibility & opportunities for relocation & advancement
bad,filling scripts and inputting insurance information for billing and counting meds for despensing
bad,I was a supervisor they say there is plenty of advancement opportunities within the company but I do not feel that it is.
bad,i don't like this company and I wouldn't suggest others aplly for jobs within it.
bad,Will never work for this company again! Terrible management! Bad leadership and pharmacy is a revolving door for employees.
bad,"Customer Service"
bad,a typical day at work was dealing with all the micro managing. they didn't care about us or the customers at all. All they cared about were numbers.
bad,after june of 2012 it became a scary place to work more shoplifters on a daily basic that we could not get our daily work done.
bad,"I have had very good working relationship with those I work and also, come in contact with.It is a quite an interestion profession."
bad,"Slowly emerging from near bankruptcy, Rite Aid management is flexing it's new found muscle,setting aggressive unreachable goals. Inability to attain corporation demands means termination for ""overall poor performance"". Might as well sell insurance or cars, rather than being a healthcare professional."
bad,"Co-workers are enjoyable to an extent, but most pass the buck off on other people, couldn't care unless it involved them, and can be very gossipy as if in high school. Management aren't all on the same level and the work made it very hard to come in for the day."
bad,The customers are the most enjoyment in my job. I remember them and talk about what is going on in their lives is great.
bad,I enjoyed the time there l. Learned so much and enjoyed working and helping the customers. I even leari enough to help train the other managers.i was a pleasure working there
bad,"My only gripe was the hours, you get night shift or late shift if you haven’t been there for a while. The managers have been great and try to work around your home life and or other job schedules. Also the pay is really bad for any Technician with more then a year experience, and don’t offer much of benefits or raises. Would only do it as a temporary job, or for the experience."
bad,"This isn’t a good job unless you’re full time. This is more of a temporary job to get you by for the meantime. Hours are very inconsistent, no vacation, no benefits and very hard to get a full time position."
bad,"A typical day would be helping the pharmacist with  filling the prescriptions, answering phones and helping customers with drop off and pick up of prescriptions."
bad,"Its ok for people who are going to school not for a long lasting career!"
bad,It wasn't good. Terrible middle management and unreasonable expectations. Very little staffing was provided. Software was absolutely awful. Performance metrics were based on asinine concepts.
bad,"Like any other corporation, the experience varies from store to store. That being said, riteaid does not focus enough on  customer service and is known for poor customer service. They do not staff to adiquitly provide the best possible customer service,  there for this pharmacy is highly known for unhappy customers. "
bad,"Pay was good, insurance was good, ethical work environment was poor, technicians refused to follow protocol, management was oblivious to problems, upper management promised to correct problems but never did."
bad,"Going out of Business, Sold to Walgreen's pharmacy. no longer open after July 10th 2018. not hiring or accepting applications any longer.everything is currently being transferred to the Walgreen's across the street."
bad,Be yourself  work to full capacity  and if you not being recognized  or elevating to an higher position after ex amount of time get out.. and ask why and why not it might be personal  like my store manager  is with me
bad,"When I first starting working at Rite Aid in Corvallis we had the most amazing management group, but after the store manager retired the work environment fell apart. The new manager was snobby rude and I was constantly over worked. I was part time working 40+ hours a week."
bad,"I’m looking for a new work place because rite aid is toxic and does not encourage growth. I wanted to work there because I care about people and I want to help them. Unfortunately, I found out the hard way that isn’t what the company stands for. When my boss found out I wanted to go back to school she started to retaliate against me. Splitting up my days off. Making me close everyday."
bad,The store manager plays favorites to her new employees and treats the ones that have been there for a while like they are lesser than her. She will act nice to the customers but disrespect her employees.
bad,Many customers get irate and are irritable. There are too many issues with coupons. Many customers don't understand what coupons are accepted or what the restrictions (if any) are.
bad,Rite Aid was an okay job for me. I couldn't bare to stand at the register for long periods of time. Also i was overworked on truck days. I work nine hours straight with no break.
bad,"The company is ran very poorly, not enough hours, not properly staffed, not trained, management doesn’t care  you’re not paid right. They only really care about the pharmacy because that is where most of their money comes from"
bad,stock is never fun. its hard hours heavy lifting and deadlines. endless cleaning. a 24 hour store with the overnight shift is such a terror. Rite Aid really works you to the bone
bad,"The only good thing about rite aid is the community outreach I do for my position. Everything else is horrible. I’m only staying because I love Rite Aid overall and I plan on working with the corporate office. Rite Aid just needs to treat the workers that they pay such a little amount of money, a littler better. Everyone isn’t like me and believes that it will get better. So people leave after a week of working there"
bad,"The environment  you came in contact with sick and ill people and when you got sick they gave you  hard time with taking off for being sick, Also their were plenty of animosity when one person did a better job and got credited for it"
bad,"We would open the doors busy, no matter if we didn't get everything finished their was always tomorrow. Customers always came first. We knew our customers on a first name basis, they became family. I always treated them like they were my family because you never know what each day may hold. There wasn't really anything that was hard, unless you knew the patient really needed their medication and the insurance wouldn't pay.The hard part was letting them know, I didn't like them going without. Smile, even on the phone, it really does make that persons day. I have learned no matter how long you are with a company, no matter how much you try and improve every detail to help the company. Sometimes it's best to no longer be with the company."
bad,Poorly ran stores.  Management expected to work entire freight with very minimal help along with completing their everyday job duties. Upper management never backed up the store management.
bad,Pick another place to work. They do not value their employees. They pay less than McDonald's or Burger King. No work life balance. They need serious customer service training from top to bottom.
bad,"Would only work as a part time second job, Doesn’t pay well and isn’t much of a great job. Bosses are really strict and aren’t sympathetic towards needing time off for serious problems at home."
bad,"If you’re looking for a job as wellness ambassador or health & wellness associate DON’T DO IT... "
bad,never work here. they change your schedual and dont call to tell you. they are rude. they dont care about customers. I felt put down all the time. they always took short cuts and did things wrong
bad,Rite Aid is one of the most corrupt companies in existence!  They hire the most lazy and incompetent individuals and put them in management!  They treat their absolute best workers horribly! And worship the lazy and dishonest people!  Super toxic environment with a huge culture of bullying!
bad,Managers was very mean and did not help they employees out when they have a situation with a customer who wasn't so nice. Customers will curse you out call the manager and you will get in trouble and you was nothing but nice to the customer. They will give the customers a gift card and tell them I'm sorry about that.
bad,Training consisted of on job and ebts done at register and while working. Really cant be done that way when trying to concentrate on the subject.  Needs better set up... And  better training rooms...
bad,"They lead you on to make you think you will get more hours or a promotion withing 6 months and nothing changes and nothing is discussed whether it's your performance or not. Horrible communication, lack of team work, drama, and treat customers poorly."
bad,No growth in the company good job to gain experience. Pay increase is very low but the company expects you to do so much work. Not enough pharmacy Technician so all the work is put on one person.
bad,"The managers they hire within the store do nothing, and put all the jobs they are suppose to get done on the other employees while they sit in the office and gossip. Then when you bring your issues to the district manager they act like they agree with you, reprimand the manager, but nothing changes or gets done, its like its all an act. Plus the pay is garbage for all the garbage work you do. Also there is no room for advancement bc the managers say that they dont want to lose you, ie the managers hold you back for their own selfish needs."
bad,Promised promotion never happened. If u get sick its basically a write up.  Pay high union fees for a union that doesn't do anything. High theft. No store security.
bad,"I will not review this company. As I have previously stated, my star rating should provide enough information to show how the company treats their current employees."
bad,"I was extremely unhappy here. It may have been my store in general, but it was a terrible job. They hired me in as part time, no benefits and worked me 50 hours a week. The pay is terrible. My manager did not care about her store. Customers had a general dislike for us because there were never enough staff members to have prescriptions ready on time. It was absolutely ridiculous. I will never go back."
bad,The system of how work and workers are treated are not good. They have failed to treat their workers with dignity and fairness. This is a very Authoritarian work environment.
bad,"the hours were terrible"
bad,"Easy job. All you have to do is greet customers, ring them up and straighten the store at night. Very simple. However, I wish they had more cashiers working at a time."
bad,"Early in the morning, only worked their for a month so I didn't really get much out of it until i moved on to staples. Sometimes, depending on the time of the day their will be an influx of customers and it gets packed."
bad,I worked at Rite Aid and was not pleased with the way they ran their business. I was never given the hours that were promised to me and I never received any benefits. The management is poor at best. The on site managers were always great and ready to help but the store manager was rude and difficult to work with
bad,"● Doing all retail pharmacy technician job familiar with PDX and windows base pharmacy software,"
bad,"management sucks, pay sucks, district management sucks, you do so much to get paid chump change. its not worth it at all ! typical day would be opening the store, doing whatever the closing manager didnt do the night before (count safe, takje down old signs etc.) Management is very inconsiderate. most enjoyable part of the job would be your day off or lunch break"
bad,"i had only worked for rite aid for 3 months, but after week 1 i wanted out. they want you to do the work for 3 people in one work day, you get paid pennies on the dollar and literally have to work full time hours in order to make it, and don't think that because you have experience you will get more money because that's not happening. management doesn't care about your life or that you go to school its all about the store and nothing else. most of the time it is you and a shift leader working for 8+ hours because honestly no one works there or wants to work there. horrible place to work."
bad,"its not as fun as the janitor job i have, its pain working at rite aid."
bad,you and one associate running the store for about 6 hours. No presence in new high-tech world. Hard to get tasks done due to lack of employees/payroll. Not a great job if just being introduced to management.
bad,worst place to work at because of the bad managers and low wage and horrible district manager nick
bad,"The slow work pace was tiring."
bad,I loved my employment and really took pride in my work. Mgs. should be made to make sure without a doubt that their employees are aware of co policies
bad,terrible plase to work can not give any over time or 8 hor shiftswas only alowed 4 hour shift and sometimes less theft at these stores are really bad wold not work there again
bad,I want to work in the new field such as in the hospital because I have worked in the retail pharmacy for too long. I want to challenge myself and learn something new.
bad,To have a good staff you must have a strong leader.  I however did not have a strong leader.  The lead shift supervisors would advise the manager when they would work and for how long.  Manager never corrected attitude or poor behavior.  Not surprising that most rite aids closed
bad,"Rite aid company doesn’t care about their workers at all . There is no time in a half , open on every holiday , my store has very poor management. Management is a main reason why i want to leave and find another job . They do not care about their workers safety. The store i work in closes at midnight. It would only be one cashier and one manger until midnight which is nor safe . They just started to get security but only until 10:00 which is ridiculous. I only took this job because i was in school. Now its just a waste and not benefiting me at all , i am ready to go !"
bad,"I had a good start at Riteaid as an assiciate, then within 6 month was able to move up to being a shift supervisor, i worked really hard because manangement constantly fired employees.  Working as a shift superisor had its benefits but there were only two of us for a very big store and sometimes we would slave sometimes for 24hrs working because we were short staffed almost all the time."
bad,"Overall I did not enjoy working at rite aid. The environment was very negative and honestly unsettling, this was because of the associates and management. But my avorite part of working at rite aid was seeing the customers, they always made my day. I would not recommend anyone I know to work at this Rite Aid."
bad,"I was a part time cashier at Rite Aid. Hours were very inconsistent, one week I could have 28 hours, the next I could have only 8. Management was inept and took their frustrations out on associates. Cashiers are expected to take on responsibilities that should have no bearing on a cashier. The store was always understaffed which made things chaotic. Management has their favorites, your time at Rite Aid is literally predicated on politics. In terms of customers I would say about half of them were polite while the other half were some of the most rude, inconsiderate human beings you can possibly imagine. The pay was a joke, especially considering management's unrealistic expectations. Overall, I suggest staying away."
bad,"Typical retail pharmacy environment. That means busy, unappreciated and undercompensated employees. Little opportunity for advancement unless you are going to become a pharmacist."
bad,With the amount of responsibility the pay should be much higher. There isn't many oppurtunities to move up in the Pharmacy or make more money. This job is good for students because the hours are very flexible and they work with you when scheduling.
bad,"day to day work is ringing customers, interacting with them, i learned how to be a good supervisor and make executive decisions the most enoyable part is getting yuor work done and learning about your co-workers."
bad,unstable company.not knowing if company was going to be sold.uncertainty regarding future of the whole company.horrible general manager. not room for advancement
bad,You will never know what you are walking in on. Large amount of drug users for third shift. They make pregnant woman do the unloading of truck. This company is all over bad for women.
bad,"Fill prescriptions, immunize and counsel patients manage staff, watch budget and run the pharmacy. Started working for the company twenty years ago became pharmacy manager then switched to night pharmacy for a change"
bad,"Rite Aid will suck all of your energy dry within one day of working for the company. All of the managers and supervisors will look for reasons to complain about your work ethic so that they can move up in the company. The technology is old and outdated leading to multiple situations with customers and employees. Overall, Rite Aid will rule over your time without giving your wallet much of a break either. By the way, cleaning toilets and blood off of the floors is not part of the job description so if they ask, don't do it."
bad,Rite aid was a great stepping stone i got my full licence from their training and a great pharmacist took me under her wing and taught me all she could.  If you take advantage of the training you can make good money some where else.  I want to thank them for giving me the opportunity to learn and then setting me free to go to a better position. Upper management sucks.  The union only keeps the bad employees with a job.
bad,"The store manager lives in his own world and makes everyone else suffers because there aren't enough people working there. If you are a cashier you will be fine but if you work in ice cream, you are done for. you work all by yourself, no downtime, boss gets mad that the place isn't clean even though you don't have enough time clean and get people ice cream all alone."
bad,"The DC's are on their own missions, while stores are on their own, and corp office isn't paying attention and makes its own plans.  Great experience to deal with that organization so you can travel to somewhere else and appreciate what real organization is."
bad,Overall being at this store there just wasnt any room for growth or accomplishment..HEAVY WORK LOAD WITH THE MINIMIUM OF PAY!! NO RESPECT FOR EMPLOYEES
bad,"The management cares nothing for their employees. Stores are always a mess. Associates are expected to do everything from cashiering, cleaning and security in stores with several customers in it at once. With only 2 people on duty at once. It was a ridiculous place to work."
bad,"My typical day at work would be cashiering, cleaning, helping customers, and stocking front isles. I've learned from this job that retail work is not as easy as it seems. It's quite difficult and takes a lot of effort so I definitely have a better appreciation for retail. The management at my specific Rite Aid was very poor. The managers had favorites, there was unfair treatment, they had poor attitudes and lacked leadership skills. This workplace was full of drama and was very cut-throat. Everyone would always talk negatively about one another and start rumors that weren't true. The hardest part of the job was definitely working with the people that I had to. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to interact with people better and improving with cash-handling skills."
bad,"As a floater, must work whatever they want 24/7. Different stores have significant physical layouts, narcotic safes, drive thru, as well as varying standards of operation depending on staff. Very difficult to follow laws and your own standards with staff set in THEIR ways."
bad,"Adultry,drug abuse,favoritism, abuse, favoritism,sexist, productivity productivity different for different people all around terrible place to workI worked many years,took a lotta nasty jobs😃 turned down from promotion s. Many times,might of been a race thing,not happy,the work you do don't matter,it's who you know who your sleeping with"
bad,Unless you plan on becoming a pharmacist there is no career advancement. low pay and hardly any benefits. Poor management and people aren't properly trained.
bad,"Bad management, low pay, severe lack of safety control, lack of communication, cut-throat culture among workers. There doesn't seem to be any praise for workers there, good work is not rewarded, no accountability for poor work or accidents. The most enjoyable part of the day is the few people I like there that I can talk to in order to alleviate the stress from the rest of the job."
bad,"The company is always looking to improve its system which cause changes for employees every month. They push you to do more and more work (ex. Vaccines,MTM's,POC's) with no conversation of increase in pay. Upper management does care if you enjoy your position, as long as work is getting done and numbers are accurate they could care less if customer are being satisfied. They feed you lies and send you around the bush until you forget and your request. Never give proper training and throw you into the field to figure things out on your own which leaves everyone around stressed out. Rite aid is a very elementary company good place to learn how to do the basics, horrible place to stay long term. If you seek interest in trying a new opportunity and decide you do not like, the options of going back is them firing you."
bad,probably why they are getting sold off because they can not make a dollar and they are always cutting paryroll till the manager is doing ec=verything by themselves.
bad,Change management for  loss prevention. You work separate from your manger but you will work with store mangers. My Loss Prevent Manger was kind of a joke. He would tell you something and you follow it exact then he would lecture you for doing what he said. He would have favorites and would not even hide it.
bad,"Thrifty ice plant was a very good place to work before.. But with  new management this place really sucks no money here as a driver, I would not recommend working here and with this Walgreen merger who knows what's going to happen here so good luck.."
bad,"I loved being constantly busy in this pharmacy but there was almost no security. In the 2 years I worked there, I was assaulted over 4 times by different customers with no help from security. I've had my life threatened and people waiting by my vehicle. Other than the crazy moments, the constant flow of work was nice and meeting different variations of people was exciting for me."
bad,"It was a job that paid the bills but I wasn't 100% in love with the company, something's I didn't like some things I did like . But when it comes to your job type you have to go with what works for you ."
bad,As a cashier your pretty much doing everything  as management except counting drawers when its time to open or close and getting paid the bare minimum wage. Then when you eat and drink a .75 wafer and Arizona ( before the soda tax) without paying for it first they suspend you until approving the disciplinary action. Then they want you to dedicate your life and stop whatever your in the middle of to come there when someone calls out.
bad,"Training is a joke, the job does not pay enough. The benefits are too expensive. Was not explained job duties when hired. Have to be able to lift heavy totes. Need to be able to tear down shelves and rebuild, and if you have any back or neck problems this job is not for you."
bad,"Rite Aid does not stand behind there worker nor do they care, anything I learned was done by research. Make the best of this job if you want to but good luck with everything."
bad,"Typical workday is on your feet running around all day or evening,55-60 hours/week.Skeleton work crews,so you are required to run register,stock supervise all at the same time"
bad,I'm a hard working person but it was a strain to be understaffed and overworked. The pay was horrible and benefits were minimal. Corporate employees were dismissive and curt. I honestly wouldn't recommend this employer to anyone.
bad,"Advice to Management"
bad,"My day consisted of maintenance, stocking and inventory, working the cash register, money handling, coupon and food stamp handling, I did money orders and worked with Western Union to process codes to either send money or help the customer receive it. I monitored expiration dates on products and helped in customer service and setting up displays."
bad,"I have a lot to thank Rite Aid for as they had given me the opportunity to further my career skills. When I started with them I was given the opportunity to learn so much and eventually obtain my Pharmacy Tech State license which is exactly what I did. Although, they do not treat their employees with much respect for all we do. I do not believe we are paid per hour what we are worth to the company as well as the way their benefits work seem unfair. On a positive note, I love everyone one that I work with! We all work as a great team together which makes our numbers above average for the company!"
bad,The store went out of business. I got hardly any hours. I wanted to move up and become a supervisor.
bad,Working at Rite aid prepared me to come work for Medicaid. Sometime working with the public can be challenging but for the most part I enjoyed it. I enjoyed saving them money and interacting with them on a dregular basis.
bad,I was not the right fit for a cashier position at Rite Aid--then again very few people are. If you can take constant verbal abuse by customers a very very low wage and no real means of advancement be my guest.
bad,"I've transferred to 2 different stores, hoping for something better but nothing changed. "
bad,"I wouldn't work for them again. The management was bad and treated employees poorly. I was put in one position and not allowed to learn more. I liked the other techs. The hardest part of the job was working with the lead Pharmacist. I enjoyed my fellow technicians, all great women- they made the job fun."
bad,"There wasnt much wrong with the job, the managment on the other hand was not very friendly at all, very degrading at times."
bad,Rite Aid warehouse is not a career choice. But a job non the less
bad,I applied for and was hired for a Tech. position. But have only been trained on the register so far. There system is very disorganized and caotic. There is a constant flow at the drive-thru which makes it difficult to learn any other aspects of the job.
bad,"They cut my hours to the point that I had to look for work else where"
bad,"Training and process management very poor ... Initiatives not well planned, nor are they followed through by management to confirm completion or to review if they require followup actions."
bad,"In the years that I worked with Rite Aid,  we went through five PDMs and the company went through two or three major restructuring programs.  It seemed like they deliberately got rid of senior staff members and then tried to prevent them from getting their retirement funds."
bad,"I can’t speak for all rite aids but my store manager is not a nice person. "
bad,"I was a supervisor so you basically come in and count your till make sure it is balanced from the night before so you are not responsible if another manager steals money. Your job is to make sure the associates are completing their tasks but you have tasks of your own like setting up planograms, putting truck load away, counting tills and preparing deposits. If the line is long you must help even though you have hundreds of tasks to do. I had a mean boss so he would always belittle me and bully me saying I never did a good job but the truth is it will never be enough for him or for the company. If you apply as a cashier your job is simple and easy. You have to learn a lot of applications on the computer like coupons, state vouchers, price adjustments, returns, exchanges, selling alcohol and being informed about sale prices and promotions. You must also multitask its not just standing there checking people out its scooping ice cream its cleaning the restrooms, answering the phone, working load and restocking checkout candy. Sometimes you have to manage the line yourself because we are short staffed so you have to work quickly. But your job is the easiest out of everyones. If you want to be a pharmacy clerk its basically the same thing but you put prescriptions away in alphabetical order, call patients that are long over due for pick up, work both drive thru and in store patients because THEY NEVER HAVE TWO CASHIERS!! you have to learn the pharmacy system and memorize the legend so that you know what each prescription status is. Understand how to read prescriptions and tell if"
bad,Depending on your store location it would be a pleasant atmosphere.   I do not like that you are only given 2 hours per week to work on computer for advancing as a Pharmacy Tech.  So Pharmacy Tech In Training is a joke ..in my opinion.   Overall ..very hectic stressful place to work.
bad,This is the worst company to work for. Empty promises from management. There is a total disconnect between the front end and the pharmacy and it's like going back to high school. Everyone who works at my location is a snake. Managers punch in and leave or don't do anything except sit around all day.
bad,"stressful work environment"
bad,"The work load is crazy compared to what they pay, you literally dont get to sit down for a second. The hours are terrible and management just works you super hard so that they look good to their boss."
bad,Working for Rite Aid Pharmacy was a stressful work experience and environment. I was not provided with the tools needed to do my job including payroll hours.
bad,"Working there I had no support or encouragement from my store manager and half of the managment team. Most managers and associates had a difficult time working with the store manager, it was a intense and divided work environment. No communication or concern from store manager, especially in life threatening situations with violent costumers or gunpoint robberies. Fast pace and no job advancement."
bad,"Management is very bad. Allow coworkers who are dating to work the same shifts, and that causes problems. Management has their favorite employees and expects other employees to pick up the slack for them. This causes a hostile work place."
bad,"My job was ok sometimes but other times it was not. I helped out at alot of other rite aids without the compensation I was supposed to receive. I also had a baby and ( plus my father passed away 7 days afterward), and I never received my paid maternity leave benefits I was supposed to get. There were also lots of drama and gossip (and negativity) at this work place."
bad,"Turn around, people quitting was common on a monthly basis. Manager talked inappropriately. Refused to accept my 2 week notice saying he didn't believe I'd get the job. I did and he wrote in my record that I didn't provide a two week notice, therefore, I could never apply at any RiteAid in the future -- even though I was prompt, reliable and a good worker, affirmed by the new manager who worked there for 6 years and made $9.20 per hour."
bad,The management from general store manager and up don't really care about the employees and what's needed for the pharmacy if it doesn't directly correlate with them and their needs. It takes something going really wrong for management to do anything. Little reward for your extreme hard work being done. Do not pay their employees enough considering they are always extremely short staffed.
bad,The company was out of order. They had the store manager do my schedule which was kinda weird. My supervisor would make deisison which didnt improve the business
bad,Was an amazing place at one time. But is going down hill and fast. Manegment team is lacking. Wages are on the low end for job duty’s. Hard to get a full 40 hr week.
bad,Managers are allowed to bully others with no consequences. Union company must pay into union or you will be released from the job. Will be required to work in other departments as needed
bad,"I worked as a Shift Supervisor, and still do as I'm writing this. Our former manager left to work at another Rite Aid out of town and the guy under her took over. Unfortunately, he did not do well. I have been talked down to, snapped at, and the work he didn't complete, I had piled onto me. He spent more time in the back room on his phone than he did doing his work. I never got any help and had to frequently reach out to my coworkers to help me, which thankfully, they did. I'm very grateful for them. He hired someone in as a shift, but they were not in any shape to work and called in frequently. Once they quit, he refused to hire anyone else to help us. Instead, he made me come in more often than I was even available to do so. I am not sure if other districts have this issue, but whenever I would reach out to HR or other higher ups, they promise to help, but turn a blind eye. I would not recommend working here."
bad,Stores were not run properly. Had a few great employees that worked under me that were great. Employees under paid for the duties that were required of them.
bad,Company has been around forever an still is stuck in the old ways of doing things over working it’s staff due to the swinging door system they have in place. The average time a new employee stayed is under the 90 minimal. I think they’re being brought out by Walgreens. Hopefully that works out well . Managers here lack the people skills that’s required too run a machine as rite aide . Avoid rite until is cross over to Walgreens .
bad,"pharmacist was a a prideful, arrogant person. She'd make mistakes and I'd fix them for her but in her mind she never made mistakes and she knew everything."
bad,"I was with Rite Aid for 9 1/2 years, 7 1/2 as an Assistant Store Manager.  During that time I met a lot of great people and made good friends.  I learned a lot about the retail industry.  If I had known then what I know now, I would have run away screaming.  After 7 1/2 years of people telling me that I was ""next in line for promotion"" and then never having the opportunity to even interview for promotion, I decided I'd had enough of it. They changed policy so Assistant Managers had to close at least 3 times a week so supervisors are getting more of the preferred shifts. On Top of that, I found out that my subordinates (cashiers and supervisors) were making within $1 of what I was making.  Plus because they are union, they had better benefits that cost them almost nothing.  I, on the other hand, had over $300 a month taken from my check just for health insurance just for my wife and I. The compensation didnt make up for the responsibility and taking disciplinary action against poor performers is almost impossible.  if you only want to be a cashier or lazy supervisor, then this is the job for you.  If you're motivated and dont want to settle for the same ol' same ol', look elsewhere.  The people who run this company only care about profits, not their employees. (Why do you think they keep trying to sell the company??)  Dont get me started on the scooping ice cream part of the job.  Sounds fun at first but after dealing with people who want to sample everything and then taking 10 minutes to decide or the stoners (amatuers) who spent 15 minutes staring at the ice cream without saying"
bad,I work there for about 4 and it was okay first but it was boring because all you did was training on the computer. You had to do that for the first two weeks and have to study for a exam to be a register pharm tech. You have one year to get certified however I was rushed to work in the work area and couldn't keep up. they expected me to work super fast when i had no idea what o was doing and they were falling behind all the time. the work was exhausting and I could not do anything correct. when I was told that had to get better or else I left. They were blaming me for their bad management and supervising of me. I'm never working at Rite Aid again.
bad,"Management tended to shy away from normal conflicts instead of trying to dissuade them. There was a strong emphasis on performing tasks only one way, when other ways would suffice as well. There was a perception that entry level employees could learn in one way only and if they were not able to grasp concepts as easily as others, the employee was quickly discarded."
bad,It's fine if you are just starting but so so otherwise. Store manager was ok.  The assistant was an irritating little troll that wanted to do everything himself which made my job difficult. Pay is low and benefits for cashiers non-existant. Ok for a patch job but would not work there as a career ever.
bad,"Bad experience with unprofessional co-workers that are untoucheable. There many occasions that patients patients will threaten you, and you will not get any help from the management."
bad,was employed during at time of financial crash and found myself constantly looking over my shoulder until the day I was let go.  Rite Aid had to financially cut spending as their stock value dropped.  I am not a happy ex-employee
bad,"Decent first job; not for anyone looking for anything permanent. I worked there for several years, yet my pay was always poor compared to other jobs in the area."
bad,"It was hard for them to understand that I needed time off for my medical issues, and they gave me grief when my mandatory school function changed dates. It was annoying since if I missed the function my grade would suffer, but they refused to let my call in that once."
bad,Rite Aide didn't supply your weekly schedule until the last minute. Management was not fair. Very clean workplace. The customers were great and understanding.
bad,"I would never work for Rite Aid again. Management was awful. I would always end up helping the actual store, instead of the pharmacy- which I was hired for."
bad,"Unexciting but practical place to work. The work is monotonous and simple. The only enjoyable part of my job experience was interacting with my coworkers and costumers, the rest was terribly boring."
bad,"Working for Rite Aid was terrible. They do not care about their employees. The pay and benefits are terrible, and the management is just as bad. I do not recommend working here."
bad,"Rite Aid was a fast paced work environment that supplied vital medications to many patients but the technicians were not compensated well for their efforts nor were they properly encouraged. The management only cared about the bottom line, even when it came as a risk to employees and patients alike."
bad,In my experience I enjoyed my co workers real reason I would show up for shift. Customers are loyal friendly and some became my personal friends. Hours are unfair. No personal life. Long hours without fair pay! Terrible communication no store manager on site!
bad,"Company was not flexible and did not value a healthy work/life balance. "
bad,"Carrying heavy totes, less than minimum pay wage, no room for career advancements, no raises. They work you so hard and it's not recognized. I was a supervisor and did not make what i deserve."
bad,Management is not understanding of personal situations. Work day is full of extremely stressful tasks. Corporate refuses to help anyone below the store manager position.
bad,"What is said above. I enjoyed my time working at rite aid, I learned a lot about what it means to be a leader, and to make connections with customers. Unfortunately the corporate level is horrible, and they do not compensate their good employees as they should."
bad,The overall job was nice to go into although them manager was not only cruel to the employees but also mean to the customers. She also is supposed to coach you on any questions you had for the PTU training which she did not help with at all!
bad,Not a very dependable work environment/Staff. I was always getting called in on my days off to cover for people who would never come to work. There was never an easy day.
bad,A typical day at work is exercising what you've learned through management and workplace culture. The hardest part of the job is the most enjoyable part of the job.
bad,I've worked there for ten years and have done every reasonable thing that would be asked to receive advancement in the company.  The overall culture is horrible.  They preach about leadership yet district level on up knows nothing about leadership or how to develop an associate into a leader.  The only time I have seen an employee better themselves was by leaving the company.  With the recent sell off of half the stores in the company don't expect opportunities to become readily available.  It is very telling when almost all the Human Resources managers on the west coast have left in the last year.  Something is not right at the top.
bad,Rite aid pharmacy would not be a great place to work. Staff isn't easy on new people and are very hard on long time techs. Low pay and very high stress
bad,lack of communications. the benefits are so bad. so as the health insurance that cant really rely on because on how it is settled. the upper managers are so unprofessionals.
bad,Loved my first few years of being with this company. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and being able to help them when I can. Getting everyone excited to just helping their customers is a fun thing for me and doing the compliance work is rewarding to me. The hardest part of the job is just trying to keep up with everything when they are throwing so much at you and most of it is not your job to do.
bad,"I worked 2 different pharmacies during the week.  They were like black and white.  One pharmacy was pleasant environment the other was disorganized, lacked professionalism, violated HIPPA, eating in front of patients, employees not following policy etc...too stressful and was only there to help temporarily and ended up being there over 4 months, too many hours (was supposed to be part time), this pharmacy couldn't keep help.  New manager had no experience, let the techs run the show etc.  No structure there at all.  Too stressful, double standards, etc."
bad,"hire you with promises of raises and job opportunity and do not offer any, have been here for almost 3 years and am stuck, managers and hr do not respond in anyway to complaints"
bad,Make sure that you have a 2014 to 2017 vehicle. Because Rite Aid will probably want you to delivery medication to their elderly customers. I will have to make deliveries for two Rite Aid stores within a time span of six hours. They will write you up for every little thing.
bad,"A great learning experience, but not a good company to work for."
bad,"I hate it there only because I don't feel compensated for my work with making 10.00 an hour. They want you to know and memerize stuff as well as multitask. I think they should pay more, this is why everybody keeps quitting."
bad,"I loved every thing about this job from fast paced, customers and helping everyone attain medicine that they needed whether through pharmacy or in store. Pay was terrible and management stinks..they cared nothing about the employees as people and you could tell by the way they talk to you and customers"
bad,I worked here for a few months before I was diagnosed with cancer. I had to leave to have surgery and when I returned I was treated bad by my manager . The place was always being robbed and we had no security. Working grave yard shift that was scary. No matter how hard you worked things were never good for our manager.
bad,"Hours are all over the place"
bad,"they sorely underpay emloyees, the fact that I am a certified Tech and am paid just above minimum wage is ridiculous. Human resources is extremly hard to contact if not management, and once contacted are not very helpful."
bad,"It was a part time job, with no benefits, and also ther was no advancement in career, Enjoyed working as an intern but not as an employee. Managers were not involved as a higher level employee."
bad,"Where to start. The Pharmacist I work with has erratic behavior , impatient- she hates answering questions from new technicians and she has a habit of throwing things , when technicians has a question or made a mistake (such as medicine bottles & and the plate you count the pills are)"
bad,A typical work day consisted of standing behind the cash register. I learned better money and computer skills. Management was terrible. they basically sat there all day and did nothing. Co-workers were rude. the hardest part of the job was trying to fit in. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers.
bad,"``+Perform multiple duties within a multi-million dollar retail establishment.  Manage staff of twenty-five associates, and two assistant managers.  Other duties include sales, marketing, loss prevention, auditing, safety coordination, human resources, recruitment/staffing, inventory/merchandising, pharmaceutical and health care compliance, forecasting, budgeting and bench-marking of financials.  Exceed company standards and operational expectations."
bad,Rite Aid doesn't care about its associates. The treatment I got from the company in the three years I was there was as another commodity. The Corporate management team is toxic and makes everyone feel as if their job is constantly at stake for little to no reason. There will always be gossip at every work place but District Managers should never be involved in such behavior.
bad,"The job is for high school students, you can not live off the pay. the hours are short and you don't have a steady work schedule. They do work with your obligations ex, school, 2nd job."
bad,"I found my store to be very disorganized. There was also no teamwork. We were continually short staffed because noone wanted to work with the manager, many complaints were made but nothing was done."
bad,"My job as front cashier was to sell cigarettes  beer and all the grocery items in the front of the store and occasionally cosmetics, and over the counter medications. my responsibilities included stocking the cigarettes and candy assisting customers with the photo copier, and wiring money."
bad,"This retail position is quite basic yet pigeon holds me in order to further advance. I have learned nothing new from working under my current manager at this establishment that I had not already been taught at other companies."
bad,"not well managed"
bad,"A typical day at work was like completing cash register transactions and then basically just cleaning and stalking the shelves. "
bad,"The pay at rite aide is decent, and so are the benefits, the management really needs to be reavalueted in some departments they have a habit about hiding certain things when the corporate company workers come in. and management has a habit of picking and choosing certain workers for certain or higher positions, I would not advise anyone to work for these people ,you always now what time your going in but you never no what time of day or night you will be leaving even if you have a family, the best thing that I experienced is making new friends with my co workers they were the best team players I could ever work with seeming we had no one to turn to but each other."
bad,Only worked there for a few months. Very low hours. Not enough for my needs.
bad,"A typical day at work would be very unorganized , i would go in and they would be speaking Spanish to each other , they wouldn't tell me what they needed me to do until i started doing other things . management it was to many people in charge in one day , one person would tell you one thing and someone else wants you to do the next . my co-workers some of them was nice but they were very rude always spoke Spanish when i was around or telling me what to do , the best part of my day was interacting with fun customers or going home"
bad,"I enjoyed the challenges of working in the stores, asa it was fast based, very social, and required a lot of organization, leadership, and problem solving. In the end I found the company's disdain for it's employees to be intolerable."
bad,"To save cost from staffing, management at all times would do typical"
bad,"Since I have been employed at this job, I have been treated poorly as well as being ""just another employee to gossip about"" by another Pharmacy tech and a Pharmacist. They do not treat the other techs with respect. I also did not get the raise that I was promised after 90 days. I am very easy to get along with and I don't complain or whine about work. I come to work in a good mood every day and treat the customers very well. My customer service scores are very high and I am not even being recognized verbally for this. I am seeking other employment at this time."
bad,"Speaking strictly from the pharmacy point-of-view, there is no chance for advancement unless you are going through school to be a pharmacist. Pharmacy technicians have two choices: Stay as a pharmacy technician, or transfer to the front end of the store and follow that path of promotions. Benefits are mostly shoddy, and getting them is difficult. Rite Aid lowered their minimum hours to qualify as full-time to the average of 30 hours per week, but to qualify for benefits, you have to maintain and average of 35 hours per week. The healthcare is horrible with high deductibles that I could never meet. Their current dental program is good, and there vision seems to be good."
bad,"Rite Aid seems like an okay place to work at first. Seems easy enough, just cashing. But they expect you to do so much, set up displays, work whenever they call you, signage, cleaning, etc. They have you do things that technically aren't your responsibility. For example cycle counts, that is a supervisor's job. But they expect you to do it anyway. Right now management is all messed up at my store and the guys up top (higher than store management) aren't stepping up and helping at all. My store is a mess, absolute mess. We only have 2 supervisors and 1 temp manager who, doesn't exactly know what he's doing. However, corporate expects that everything still get done on time. Heck, payroll wasn't even completed on time because our temp manager couldn't do it! Now that's what I want, to work for an employer and have the possibility of my paycheck be delayed! Furthermore, an incident with a cashier returning too much money to a customer was questioned when, the manager was standing right there approving the whole thing! And they question the cashier? Who only simply put data in and asked for the manager to approve it? Well, enough ranting. I do not recommend working for Rite Aid."
bad,"Nothing stands out  they work us understaffed, more work  but not appreciated  when, just when will corporate see what they are doing instead at looking how many rxs were done each day!!!"
bad,"The people there are usually very friendly. Easy to catch on to how systems operate, & there is a good amount of busy work. Under paid job, depending on store location, very poor upper management."
bad,It’s very clear which direction this company is headed in. Corporate desperately needs input from the store level but they only care about satisfying the shareholders’ profit goals. This company USED to send out quarterly employee satisfaction surveys - they haven’t given me one in over 3 years and I think that’s very telling. Very hostile workplace where both corporate and your patients expect you to meet increasingly impossible demands with less tech hours.
bad,Many jobs to do with little to know help.  Often left in the store to work alone. Very little support from corporate. I would not recommend Rite Aid as a good place to work.
bad,They need help with their management.  They have no respect for work- life balance.  I have small kids and they were not concerned with helping me to be around for holidays.
bad,I honestly have no comment... Only thing I can say is this is a great beginning place for someone young who is just looking to get their foot in the door and gain some experience. Definitely not for long term career seekers.
bad,"If the pharmacist doesn’t like you or you don’t “click” with him, he will find a way to write you up and get you fired! Lack of training and poor team."
bad,Maybe with a better store manager but it was a mess and they expect the cashier to do so much. When nobody wants to do it they ask the cashier to do it.
bad,They need to treat there employees better and appreciate  them not all the management  bad some do have  a caring heart and care about there peoples .It was a good experience  working for them I moved  up in the company quickly  but the pay is okay would I go back to work for them right now it's no
bad,Chaotic from top down. Upper management had zero pulse of day to day business management. More concerned about Corporate parties and lunches than affecting store’s metrics.
bad,Was ok now business is going down hill. To many changes everyday it something new. Making people take mandatory time off it product in off. No more raises after thrid year
bad,"Honestly, the best benefits we get are all provided for us by the local Union as Rite Aid in SoCal is unionized. Those benefits are actually pretty decent and probably the best thing about working there, as rite aid is a pretty terrible working environment."
bad,The work environment can range from slow paced to fast paced after the hours of 4-Closing. Environment was not in the professional setting. There was many points in the day that the store was under staffed.
bad,Let me just say that just having a manager and cashier per store is not enough to finish tasks and take care of the customers.  I've ruminated enough about this place.  I do not want to talk anymore about it anymore
bad,Rite aid is not doing very good right now. They are cutting cost everywhere making all employees unsure how secure there jobs is.The work scheduled changes with each job and the scope of work is different with every job.
bad,"You can prove hours of work, come in on your days off, stay late, you do everything you think can improve you as a person and you get fired for something they couldn't prove, I didn't want to sleep with the boss."
bad,No job security and management yells at you and can let you go at anytime so you are basically walking on eggshells! Don’t recommend this company at all.
bad,"A typical day.. As soon as you walk in you run.. Everything is behind, phone rings off the hook. Some stores had a lot of staff, some did not. If you love running around feeling unaccomplished, This job is for you."
bad,"Fast food chains start at more than I make after working here over 5 years. No advancement. No raises. No hours, only scheduled 5 to 15 hours a week, looking for full time..."
bad,"Wasn't one of the best places I've worked, honestly wouldn't tell any of my friends to apply for at least the store I was working at. Management and training was to say the least poor. Stressful environment, inconsistent hours, understaffed,"
bad,"Nothing good to say, except we got paid on time. The company does not seem viable for the long term. It is probably a good candidate for a takeover. Yadda yadda!"
bad,"Working for Rite Aid is like working for your any retail store in the world. You know what to expect: minimum wages, long hours and of course the people which can make your day by far better or worse."
bad,You work very hard and the more you do the more you get treated like not the best. I dont get it the ones that dont do as much are the ones that get the most days off they tell them what they want to do.
bad,Not sure of the direction of the organization. Therefore employees leave because they do not know if all stores are going to close. There are changes done on a regular basis.
bad,store management was horrible and did not treat the employees well at all. There was nobody (even in HR) who would listen or consider trying to correct this issue.
bad,"On-the-job training consisted of getting on the computer if you had time and trying to listen and take tests while waiting on customers. The computer training was required to be finished by a certain month; however, adequate time was not given to take the training, and it was not allowed to be done on your own time. It was virtually impossible to complete the training. Pay was only $9.80 per hour with 50 cent raise promised after training was completed and test was passed."
bad,It was a decent retail job. Multitasking was a daily thing. Store management was a revolving door. Not very understanding management. Required to be on your feet the entire shift.
bad,"Worked 8 years , started out great . The company accumulated to much debt reducing much needed funding for running the stores properly and to meet the business needs,"
bad,It is a low paying job but a job none the less. The lenient work schedule makes it possible to work while at school but the hours are rough and the people I have to deal with can range from encouraging and lighthearted to down right aggressive and hostile.
bad,"very stressful job, extremely hectic.  not a trust worthy environment very hap  hazard.  awful work environment would never want to work there again. .,"
bad,"I worked part-time as a pharmacy technician and got paid minimum wage when a cashier is being paid just the same. Extensive training and licensing required but they do not pay for any of it. I paid almost 250$ out of pocket. On top of that, the store manager was so rude to me."
bad,My pharmacist/pharmacy manager was lazy-. He did everything to avoid customers and working. You pretty much had to beg him to do his job so you could do your own!
bad,I didn't have a job at the time. So it did help me out when I needed it.  They weren't very flexible with my hours and they always cut our hours back.  They didn't offer any benefits for part-time employees.
bad,"typical retail job, nothing special - I have moved to another state for college which is why i left - managers didnt really pay attention to employees, this was back in the early 00's I believe the store has changed since then"
bad,"The company, in its current iteration, exists simply to maximize the value for a sale to a new company. All new programs are made for future sales. Between potential sales (all stores have now been sold/merged to various different companies) the company is fairly consistent with day-to-day operations. However, thanks to the constant flux in upper management and the insistence on adding new programs to falsely make the company appear more valuable to potential buyers, there was a lack of upward mobility and an utter disregard for employee welfare."
bad,"Got hired as a supervisor right away. Initially it was a great opportunity to step into a somewhat manager type role, but it didn't last long. You make $1.00 more than the cashiers, who at my store, always bickered and complained and never got their daily duties done, and were constantly insubordinate to shift supervisors and our store manager. You end up working more than the managers, who barely stay at the store and leave ridiculously early. "
bad,The people who work there are very nice. As an employee it is not a bad place to work but as a member of management there is very little reward or support from the company.
bad,"Company needs to care about the employees. employee appreciation is lacking. Metrics is the most important to the company and the stress and work load do not matter. less with more mentality is the norm, management expects increased sales, higher script counts and flu shots along with MTM with no increase in payroll."
bad,"As a clerk, they wanted you in the front helping customers. Then answering phones, plus putting away medications. Then working in the back checking on customers prescriptions if not ready upon arrival. Most times operating 2 register as you are the only one in the front. The manger would get upset if you were with one customer “ too long” not taking into consideration most people coming to the pharmacy are ill or elderly. He would get all worked up and start yelling at people in a confined area."
bad,this store has such bad management that the store is always messed up unless they are expecting someone to come to the store from corporate and things are never done on time or never get done at all or never get done right. rules are not enforced for one person will try to follow the rules but the other one doesn't so it causes drama when the other is trying to do the right thing and one person wants to do it the other way. there is a lot of miscommunication in this store and no one ever says they are going to do what they say they are going to do. words and things being said about trying to make the store better that are being brought up to the manager just seem like they go through one ear and out the other. if one person cant do something the other person should not be allowed to do it either. they should also enforce the rules a little more and make it so it is a better work environment.
bad,"Don't get payed enough, do the exact same thing as managers but they get payed double. Cannot get one weekend off at all. Customers are very rude. they start you off with minimum wage and if you ever get promoted to supervisor its only 75 cent raise not worth it."
bad,"You're either super busy or the store is completely empty. The weekly schedule is not fixed, so you never have time to schedule anything unless its planned well in advance. Customers will scream in your face and you just have to stand there and smile and apologize."
bad,"not an honest environment,   employees lied to by upper management about buyout and their futures.  Employees told not to worry about their employment or  layoffs when they should be looking elsewhere when the cuts come in a year"
bad,"This particular Rite Aid was awful. Co-workers are back stabbing as well as the management. Management does not care about associates lives, just there own needs of having shifts covered. The benefits are nonexistent. There are no incentives to this job. The pay is horrible especially considering all that this job entails."
bad,"I worked with some great people but it is unlikely you will. No pay raises, minimum wage and they will work you like a rented mule. They do not care about employees and someone has to die for you to move up. Awful business practices. Go to CVS if you need to work in a pharmacy. No wonder they got bought by Walgreens."
bad,"This company I feel doesn't really care for their employees, they say we are Family but actions say different. Long hours you go in and don't know what time you will get off."
bad,A typical day at Rite Aid is very busy . Typical day includes phone calls with medical offices and insurance companies . Workplace culture was normal with stress on workflow. The hardest part of job was completing tasks with the amount of help provided . The most enjoyable part was helping our patients and teaching students.
bad,"Rite-Aid will treat you generally poorly. As their business dwindles and they close stores, they will continue to slash hiring, understaff stores, and pay employees starvation wages all while lying through their teeth about their commitments to employee success and job availability at other stores. The only positive experience working for this company was my manager, who was a kind and decent person who believed in helping employees maintain work/life balance. However, she still had to run the store on a shoestring and upper management treated us patronizingly at best."
bad,In all honestly Rite Aid is a good job for a teen or a young adult just starting college other than that they will most defiantly mess you up in the end just like they did me. I remember one time I was cashing a lady out that was in her mid-30s and she asked me how long Ive been working here. After I replied she immediately told me to start looking for another job because she warned me that there probably going to let me go after I try to transfer to a city closer to my school. Unfortunately thats exactly what happened.
bad,To be such a big company the salary is terrible. the work environment was fine and my cowokers was great. But corp and the gms just don't understand the day to day operations.
bad,"•	Handled weekly schedule with respect to payroll policies "
bad,"I worked for RA for 5 years and made 9.18 when I left. I worked countless hours of overtime to cover for others, but when I was in a car accident and suffered head trauma I was told to walk it off because no one else was avaliable. Higher volume stores are well catered to by the DM but the low volume store I was in barely had enough hours to keep one person there all day. I was running from the back room, to the pharmacy, to the front register, to the office, doing the job of three people while not making enough to keep one person housed. No amount of work from my team was ever good enough for corporate."
bad,The pay rate is minimal. Especially spending a lot of years with the same company. They don't care about their employees and their sacrifices for the company.
bad,Corporate doesn't care about their employees. They expect people to do their jobs. Corporate cuts hours. And expect the pharmacy to still function the same way. With less people working.
bad,"Job itself is very easy (picking and stocking), only issues I've had within this place is management not being understanding, way too much overtime  (everyday), no time for your life outside of here. On a better note, Co workers are ok, we get fed a couple times a month (hoagies, bbq catering, dunkin coffee and donuts, pretzels)"
bad,Expected to do a maximum amount of work with very few employees. You practically have to live at the store in order to get anything done. Very little positive feedback. They have no problem telling you what you have done wrong but never tell you thank you or give you a pat on the back for a job well done.
bad,"The overall managers of the store are very helpful and always try to be open minded to your needs, however upper management is barely involved in the day-to-day works of it's employees."
bad,the company is not the best but not the worse either. being salary is not worth the headache. was a learning experience. would not consider going back.
bad,Management does not support or encourage employees. No room for advancement. Employees are not acknowledged for hard work and you basically have to beg for a raise.
bad,"Working at rite aid is not for those in school, because the schedule is different every week and you don't know what to expect. The pay sucks, no break time, always short staffed, no training."
bad,I was not happy working with management who did not listen to the concerns of its employees. The company could use some management training courses.
bad,At rite aid (I'm sure not all of them) you are overworked and under paid. There is no incentive to work there and most of the time you can't even take a break because of a lack of staff.
bad,"Depends on where you go possibly, but at least for me it was too much work and no where near enough payroll to do it. You're not salaried, but the workload is too much for 45 hours. You're only going to have 1 person in the store at a time for the majority of the time. The pay is not high enough for all that you are tasked with doing. That is especially true for your supporting management staff. The training unfortunately is done with a thrown to the wolves mentality with too small of a grace period for the steep learning curve."
bad,This is a good job for someone who does not have any responsibilities. I've been there for 4 years and I just don't see a future there.
bad,"While not the worst company I've ever worked for, it's frustratingly difficult to get any assistance from upper management and HR will defend everyone but the associates who need them most. Tight budgets so the higher ups can keep their bonuses while associates making minimum wage are held to unreasonable work conditions and expected standards. Good enough for supplemental income but unrealistic long term employment unless you're comfortable becoming poorer as costs of living rise and wages plateau permanently."
bad,They have people in management positions that have no business being in them. If you have a problem and try to talk about it you just get made to feel small and unimportant and that all you're really doing is complaining. Then they'll turn around and cut your hours there's too much to do and not enough people to get it done you feel under appreciated.
bad,My time spent at this location was not the best. I was in charge of running the shift when I was at work. I liked the pharmacy staff and front end staff but our store was under staffed as a whole. Management was not on top of all the situation that where going on in the store which made it challenging to perform my job tasks.
bad,"I have worked for rite aid for 2 years as a pharmacy tech and im always at work on time, I work part time I have told them I need full time work but they would rather hire part time kids."
bad,"Typical day included stocking shelves, handling cash, providing excellent customer service and maintaining relationships with vendors."
bad,"While most of my co-workers were friendly, hard working, and contributed positively to my experience on the job, management (atleast at the location where I worked) allowed abusive behavior on the part of certain individuals based on title/rank."
bad,"If you are not a pharmacist you are severly underpaid and under appreciated, and even the pharmacists feel less than. This corporation only cares about profit and no respect for employees. I would not reccomend working here. Very low paying and hard work with no appreciation."
bad,"I was suppose to work the front end, however I did not know what all that would include. The work was more stressful because the customers cold be very rude. I worked at two different stores, one when I was home for the summer or holidays, and the second when I was at college. Both of the mangers were nice enough, but since I was never really there long enough to get close to any of my coworkers. The front end cashier is not only working the cashier, but making the entire front end look nice; I was never standing still while was working at Rite Aid. The hardest part about working there was when we had the trucks come in; the front end had to put all of the products that came in the trucks on the shelves, and mark off what aisle we worked on, how long it took us all while working with the customers that came in and needed help."
bad,"The place i worked at didn't really offer much movement up, you only got a raise once every year and it was only 2% from 7.25, that really isn't a boost at all, the rules changed somewhat often, the manager just didn't do their job right. the only reason i stayed as long as i did was because of my fellow workers. on the brighter side, there were many noble customers who were very kind, only a few bad apples every now and then."
bad,"opening the store helping customers find items, making deposits and closing the store."
bad,"Pay is very low, hours are hard to come by, and management doesn't seem to care about the company at all."
bad,"I have been with this campany for a few years and I am looking to get out. This compnay loves to under staff the stores but expects triple the work to be done. They are not proficient in hiring decent and knowledgeable Store Managers. The company has tons of money to build a new warehouse but claims broke at raise time. Your raise will only be 5% and good luck with getting full time. I am a college graduate who is unable to get full time and is working for someone who is younger with no real job experiance within this company and has less education than I. Don't be fooled by the solgans they use like ""with us, it personal"" or ""we care about our employees."" You are better off working at a grocery store or a bank because these places start you out above minimum wage and there is opportunity for advancement. This is why you can have my position within RITE AID!!!!!"
bad,"I was hired as a Wellness Ambassador at this store, and was supposed to spend the majority of my time doing community outreach. Instead, I was literally thrown in to the pharmacy, where I spent 95% of my time running a register; the rest of my time I was used as a pharmacy tech. I did the job I was hired to do maybe 2 hours a week at most."
bad,I love my customers and co-workers. Just not compensated for the amount of work load that is given on a daily basis and not enough hours. No benefits!
bad,Ive seen more than 12 employees come and go since Ive been at rite aid. There is no communication at all and no one is reliable
bad,"Typical day at work assist customers, locate medications, remove medications that are 12 days+ over, return medications back to stock, off load medication from truck, assist the Pharmacist."
bad,"A typical day at rite aid , your day starts with a wait to sign in for your shift using the computer based sign in method that doubles as a cash register , typically you will be late considering the registers are likely occupied  already, after at least a five minute wait for your co worker to finish a sale with the customer your opportunity comes . The shifts go by fairly fast considering its busy . The bulk of your activities will be centered around customer service , assisting in the sale of numerous items , directing customers to the desired item and the bathroom. Depending on what you signed up for you might have to deal with truck which isn't that bad , it's all physical , breaking down , organizing , running totes  and stocking out . If your unfortunate to request the night shift in hopes of a better cheque you'll get that along with a pervous sleep schedule but after a few weeks your body might start to get used to it . "
bad,"Typical day includes waiting on customers, Filling scripts, taking dr calls, patient calls, managing drive thru window. Filling prescriptions."
bad,"The company has awful management. Payroll is cut over and over. You're never to be alone in the store, but as a shift supervisor I was often the only one in the store. I would often work the first 2 and last 2 hours in the store without any other employees. Spoke with the DM and RVP many times about store morale, payroll, lazy managers to no avail. There was no teamwork involved. Cashiers would handle most everything while managers would put their feet up in the office. The pharmacy only had a tech 55 hours a week. Other times the pharmacist was left alone to handle the entire pharmacy. This killed the store. Script count was over 300 a day upon starting in 2005. When I left the store it was down to 100. No one upper management cared anything about improving the store, only complaining about the lower sales."
bad,"They are not understanding at all, very by the book. If you are late three times you are done. They value their customers more than their employees. I was being sexually harassed by a customer and my boss asked me to please give the customer another chance so he wouldn't have to ban him."
bad,most days were completing the same tasks. consumers were nice to the cashier.
bad,i was teen when i was working there so it was good for that time in my life
bad,I had a horrible experience from the management team at my location.
bad,"I was initially hired in as an Inventory Control Field auditor which I enjoyed greatly. Due to cutbacks I was moved to a product selection specialist (picker) after approximately 6 months. This job itself wasn't so bad, however the surrounding enviroment was the true downfall. Everyday had a different end time, so trying to schedule events and work a family life out around it was nearly impossible. Management with all due respect seemed clueless at times, and was very misleading when it came to the most basic of job elements. Many co-workers appeared to be bitter and unsatisfied and behaved poorly, at almost a high school style level. Growth potential was extremely limited based on performance and focused almost solely upon seniority. The hardest part of the job wasn't the job itself, again, it was the intangable factors surrounding it. I enjoyed being within 2 miles from my home to my workplace and prior to restructuring it had one of the best benefit packages available."
bad,"best part of the job was interacting with the customers and front line associates. middle and upper management seemed to be more concerned with the operational issue du jour than in running a successful long term business. unrealistic demands on the rank and file, a bloated and clueless middle management as well as an overcompensated upper management that has largely migrated from another failing concern combine to make this company's lack of profitability and viability almost a given."
bad,"Overall, it was a fun workplace for a college student, but there is not enough opportunity. The people were great to hang out with and I made some good friends. As a college graduate, one would like a more professional position and I would like to start my career."
bad,"Very young did not understand the culture.Manger all the daily responsibility's that involves,inventory,money, co-workers."
bad,longterm job with no room for advancement.pay raises are small
bad,"You will feel miserable and feel a sense of disappointment because of the tedious and body taxing work. The pay is ok nothing to write home about, you will develop no relationships here what so ever."
bad,"Started out good and some of co-workers were nice, but there was alot of favouritism , talking behind your back and gossip. Depending on location or store depended on the hours you would be offered."
bad,"Rite aid was not a good work experience because the manager was not understanding at all, and put more pressure on me due to me being the only cashier overnight, and was very threatening and controlling"
bad,"It's easy but understaffed. Some days there are no call no shows, management is flaky and shows favoritism. I guess you could move up but who wants to work minimum wage for the next 5 - 10 years?"
bad,"no work life balance, work teams are good, I enjoy people I worked with, they made working at RA fun. RA offers and variety of work hours available, flexible."
bad,"Good for college students who want extra money, bad if you want to have a life outside of work, no pay increases management goes behind your back in stead of letting you know what you need to work on. Only care bout sales treat employees like they robots"
bad,"I worked with one amazing Pharmacist and one that was just checked out and miserable until the end of the night ""thanks for all your hard work"" to ensure your return the next day. Patient care was as good as it could be in a retail pharmacy setting. I carried the workload of 3 techs plus my own and was constantly stressed out."
bad,Poor management but they definitely did have some great ppl employed on 3rd shift... The 3rd shift manager was new and really didn’t know how to manage his position but I am great it’s over and the pay is trash
bad,"They don't pay well at all, but you can still gain a lot of experience from working there. Management does not respond well to the needs of the employees, specifically pharmacy technicians. Bottom line, you're going to be overworked and underpaid."
bad,Rite aid isn’t a good place to work. The corporate structure is poor as they do not value their employees. My store had good employees which created a fun environment to work at. Management and supervisors were great which is why I accepted a promotion to supervisor.  Working at Rite Aid really comes down to the individual store and the employees there.
bad,"You don't get merit raises, very little carrier coaching, most people in the retail sector usually quit after 2 years."
bad,"Started as an asst.mgr and worked up to store mgr within a year. High turnover, high stress job.  No work life balance at all. You are given very little payroll and still have to complete your tasks, and God help you if you fall behind. Thats the only time""they"" send you help,  and it counts against you. I have seen better managers than myself chewed up and spat out.  I lasted five years. Their loss!"
bad,The absolute worst company to work for! Don't count on a flexible schedule or management understanding that family comes first. It's all about the $!!
bad,"Would not recommend this company to anyone looking for a job. Employees are two faced talking about coworkers, this place is drama. I would not recommend working there to anyone unless you enjoy being around childish people"
bad,"with the right training is great place to work .! "
bad,Need new managers and they need to set a time that we get off everyday instead of telling us when we get there and need to pay more than what they are maybe people will stay and not quit
bad,My experience was good for the beginning. I had a great boss and worked well with other employees. Reason for leaving was the last boss was very immature and not responsible. When reflecting my opinions to corporate they seemed to not care where the location was going.
bad,"My co-workers are really good and hard working and they make it a pleasure to work there. This particular store has a bad floor-plan which makes it a bit difficult to direct customers to items they're looking for, and the building needs maintenance."
bad,"There is zero work life balance here! It’s corporate’s way or the highway. I earned my national technician certification while working here and there was no raise, no reimbursement, nothing because it’s not required in Delaware at this time. Literally anyone can be hired to fill your prescription and the pay goes along with the mind set. Everyone is replaceable."
bad,Being in retail management is tough these days. Corp gives the stores too little hours for employees. Managers are typically on the floor as staff coverage at least 2/3 of their shifts instead of focusing on managing the store and how to grow sales
bad,The job was okay but they wasn't giving me enough hours or money..  I had liked the work environment and the people I was working with nice people. 👍
bad,"Generally there are two, sometimes three people in the store:"
bad,"Upon interview I was told that there may be occasional overtime and weekend work. When hired on it was manditory. My first year at Ritte Aid, I was going through a divorce and custody battle. They forced me to stay over or receive points. Advancement was very difficult because it was political."
bad,Only work for this company in a have to situation and only until you find a more financially stable company. The stress of not knowing the future of your employer is highly stressful.
bad,"I try to find the good in most situation and with every trial there is a lesson. The lessons you take with you can serve as a reminder or something you put in your metaphorical ""pocket"" for later. Hate to write unfavorable reviews, in fact I'de rather avoid this section altogether. That being said, This was a very stressful workplace and for little work to life balance. They made it incredibly difficult to maintain a schedule.  The last manager I had, practiced inhumane and archaic treatment of pregnant women. The employees also became disgruntled over the smallest internal issues and the overall level of workplace stress reflected in their behavior."
bad,"I learned a lot working for the Rite company as a Loss prevention agent. I enjoyed being there for the most part but, then began to see the way they would under pay, under staff and expect employees to get more work done for what they are being paid. I also feel as a loss prevention agent there was much pressure to make shrink without many tools I needed."
bad,"A good place to learn about business in the operational sense.  I learned about effective communication and how important it is to learn about the people that you work with.  I saw things I learned in school first hand.Management is driven but everyone has their bad days.  "
bad,"Rough, long days. No breaks, no support from management. went to work filled with anxiety, left 13 hours later exhausted. not interested in this lifestyle any longer."
bad,"A typical day as a shift manager is doing your pull and freshness reports. One day a week you have to stock your sections, you check in several vendors during the week, If you work overnight on the weekends your whole job consists of putting up sale signs. If you go over your scheduled work hours for the week they'll make you take breaks where you can't leave to compensate. Example: you're scheduled 38 hours and going into an 8 hour shift on Saturday you have 35 hours, they will make you take a 5 hour break so that you only get to your 38 hours. The store manager and assistant manager are very buddy-buddy."
bad,"The managers specifically one of them can be extremely mean and rude, the area the store is in isn't the best neighborhood. Some of the people that come in can be very hostile."
bad,"A typical day at work would be going in for a 5-7 hour shift, (depending on the managers mode during making the schedule).  I enjoyed working with the Pharmacy. They were amazing and kind people there. The front end manager is not qualified to do her job. That made me as a worker feel used and not cared about. I tried to work hard everyday and show I can move up. Promises were made but nothing ever happened. Making only $9 for 3 years with only an .18 raise. I enjoyed being able to do my own projects then they stopped and I received little projects that cashiers could easily do. I just feel not respected and neglected."
bad,"I was bullied by my co workers and my manger wouldnt do anything about it. I asked to be on the c"
bad,"Retail, pharmacy, customer service. Cashiering, pharmaceutical deliveries, office work, inventory, load night for weekly stock arrivals, higher seniority means more hours"
bad,"Working at Rite Aid, which is now actually Walgreens I believe, was never a full term thing for me. The company was going through many changes that they could not handle. The only good thing about working here was the opportunity to grow. I went from associate to pharmacy tech. to licensed pharmacy technician."
bad,"Not fair to employers and they did not help with managing hours correctly, I was not treated fairly. The pay is horrible and I worked there for a year and did not complete my CBTs at all."
bad,"I loved this job at the beginning then it became completely different, due to the fact that it was my first job everything felt normal. Then I realized the job is very sexist. the entire management staff was women, now don't get me wrong that wasn't a problem. It became a problem when they didn't do any hard labor, aside from the two shift managers, the store manager and the assistant manager did nothing. They would pretend when to cooperate would come around yet we the employees did not only all of our work we did most of their work, aside from the typical managerial paperwork. the hour distribution was more so based on personal feelings rather than work ethic.  I was friends with almost everyone there, I even won employee of the quarter after 3 months of being hired. I always worked hard and treated customers like family but that all meant nothing if I'm not making enough money to support myself. overall just a bad experience."
bad,The job was made a lot more difficult the longer I stayed but I believed this came into play when a new district manager was hired and all the old managers at my location were replaced. That's when I started to work longer hours and more days as well as there being only two people on their truck days when they received their products and I was one of those people.
bad,I can say for myself it’s a good working in environment to start off with. It’s not long term job for me. I am almost 21 the pay they are giving doesn’t cover my bills or rent. I think I really need another shot somewhere else before I turn 21.
bad,"The last few years there has been no clear vision, our direction. People are given busy work, when there really isn't any work. Upper management knows this and are just waiting for the merger to be complete"
bad,Very poorly run organization. Local facility did not want to improve processes or profiling to improve efficiencies. Relied on old ways of doing things.
bad,"Decent first job. Work with a lot of lazy, losers. The union 1776 used at the time was horrendous and did nothing. Didn't even know stores were closing, had to call them and let them know a week before. Then offered us terrible new locations for jobs just to say they did. Lazy."
bad,"Dealing with customers"
bad,"worked for 2 years, before the new manager came and left because the new manager was mean and full of herself. she treated every of her employee like they were less than her."
bad,"High stress, high volume store with not enough staffing at busiest times. Too much work for the staff, yielding high rate of customer complaints. Unreliable staff, poor compensation as far as pay goes. Staying past your shift also goes unappreciated."
bad,If you can imagine the misery of employees at your local pharmacy/convenience store you already know what it's like to work outside the pharmacy at rite aid.
bad,"Rite Aid was a great experience considering i was coming straight out of trade school as a medical assistant and now had to learn pharmacy, i loved it!! the pay was very low considering i was doing almost everything considering i was a quick learner.it was very stressful and not really good hours."
bad,Rite-Aid was an interesting experience.  The overall management seemed to be lacking in direction one day and overly micro-managing the next.  It was a confusing environment at best.
bad,Pharmacy Technician jobs are awful. you do all the work of the pharmacist without the respect or credit. Its so stressful and everyone is hateful....especially the customers on welfare that want everything for nothing. Retail is awful and that job was no exception. The more I learned the more everyone took advantage of me and the more I had to do for multiple stores. When I left I made so little it was a joke compared to all I had to do. Stay away from RITE AID!!!!
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make customers smile because you help them or have a conversation with them when no one else will. "
bad,"At first, working for Rite Aid was good. Company seemed like they were headed in the right directions. But the company started faltering and with the failed acquisition with Walgreens, the company seems to be squeezing all they can do to save money, which includes cuts in hours, meaning less technician help per day. This means pharmacist are expected to work with less technician help and sometimes by themselves, which increases the chance of prescription errors and patient harm. Many companies (not just Rite Aid) are pushing for more programs such as MTMs, immunizations, etc. to be done with less technician hours is really dangerous and I do not like the direction community/retail pharmacy in general is heading."
bad,"low pay, corporate treats employees horribly. Would not recommend anyone unless they needed a temporary job. Only took pharmacy job to gain medication knowledge."
bad,"Department managers are mostly really good people to work with.  It's when you go above them to Human Resources when you lose any real human contact.  People recently hired have been lied to about wages, and raises.  There is no feeling of anything more than a number.  It almost feels as if H. R. would prefer to replace everyone with minimum wage temporaries.  It used to be a very personable place, the new regime has changed that."
bad,"All operational duties in support of General Manage, financial support with cash and inventory control... staffing hiring, training and evaluating.  Customer resolution."
bad,"At Rite aid work was great, loved every minute of it. managment was great, workplace culture was amazing, I learned a lot from there, the hardest part was getting to know the layout of the store"
bad,Rite aid does not allow employees the tools to grow and advance throughout the company. Instead of promoting from within in the out source jobs from other companies that are comparable to their business.
bad,"I've worked at multiple locations, and there are always people who feel entitled and will boss you around due to the number of years they've worked despite their lack of knowledge and growth as an employee."
bad,"The upper management does not care about the store associates. "
bad,"No Comment,  I have worked there many years.  It is a constantly changing environment with lack of a cohesive mission and direction.  I want a career and not a job."
bad,Rite Aid has moved to a culture of intolerance. The employees at the store level are not appreciated. When there was recent increases in the New York state minimum wage there was no motivation to compensate long term employees in kind. Rite Aid is looking for people who will blindly follow and do not want self thinkers. Constant reduction in payroll and increase in work load. Not a very good place to work for hard working individuals because that is not rewarded.
bad,"It's stressful when the company cut your hours but insist that more work needs to be done and with not extra help."
bad,"General warehouse conditions with weak management and no room for growth. The environment had become very hostile and hard to work in, there were large amounts of employees very unhappy on a daily basis."
bad,"Hired as a pharmacy cashier,yet trained as a technician. The other technicians were vindictive females who tried to get me fired. I quit immediately.."
bad,“It gave me a great introduction to customer service and taught me about the workings of a successful small business employees lock of customer service
bad,This job does not get paid enough for how much the cashiers have to do. i did not like it here at all. As a cashier everything falls on you. management does not help often and when they do they complain about you not being fast enough. i refuse to get paid only 8.50 and get yelled at for something i can't control or something i didnt do. and they do have favorites and dont mind letting other workers know
bad,I think my Review Summary says it all.  Upper management are constantly pushing new ideas and always increasing responsibilities.  Unrealistic goals are set.  Never enough help.  13 hour work days are inhumane.  Reprimanded if you sit for a few minutes.  Miserable work environment.  Terrible computer system.  Overwhelming and stressful work environment.  Can never get anything done on time.
bad,"When I first started at Rite Aid everyone was nice. After a week I hated working there. They have 3 different people training you, you just get lost. I had no idea what I was doing. I would ask questions and they would act like I was stupid."
bad,It is consistently always busy so a typical day is never boring. I learned so much about customer service working here and a lot about myself and what I really wanted. The hardest part of this job was the benefits and pay.  Even though it was my first job it was definitely hard with that plus the stubborn customers that you may often get.
bad,"Start the day by going over what's expected, the time your expected to stay, and how much product you are distributing that day. I learned how to operate a pallet jack, I also learned how to work as a unit. Management was unreasonable sometimes, but overall they are pretty understanding people. The co-workers make the job hard to look forward to, they make it hard to go to work on day to day basis. The hardest part of the job is keeping up your productivity week by week. I enjoyed the side functions the company holds on monthly basis."
bad,its ur basic retail job. some okay management but sometimes have issues with hours. the dress code kinda sucks. idk fam i need to type at least 20 words
bad,"Busy, busy, busy! I learned a lot. What to do and what not to do. Customer service skills and multi-tasking is a must. I liked my co workers and my customers."
bad,Same as stated per Safeway description with exception that the company does not seem like it has security and high management guidance. The direction and future of this company led me to leave this company. It has been speculated that the future of this company is in serious jeopardy. I maintained the pharmacy within the rules and laws of state and federal guidelines while maintaining rx script growth and having the highest customer service ratings district wide.
bad,I just needed a job that would fit to my college schedule.  I did happen to win an award while working there and I wore that golden pin with pride. The giftcard was a nice bous
bad,keeping a clean work environment. Learned to provide good customer service skills.co workers were rude. The hardest part of the job was not being treated right and when brought up to the owners attention he did not do anything to fix the issue.
bad,I only worked for this company for a few months as a favor to a Manager that needed my skill set in merchandising.
bad,Not the greatest place to work for people with a family. Upper management expects everything done yesterday and the pay inst that great.  It did help me further my knowledge of managing people and a business as a whole. also helped me hone my sales skills. Not very rewarding as far as vacation/personal time. I cant imagine someone with a family being happy at this job.
bad,"Management like to keep store salary low so they could get a bonus each year. You have to negotiate a reasonable starting wage. Most of the customers were power plant employees looking to fill narcotics and they always ran out to soon. Pharmacist had a raw deal getting abused by unhappy patrons on a daily basis. Could never take a break. Did not get raise, increase, percentage off of store items. No good incentives towards working there."
bad,"Rite Aid micromanages to death. All responsibility is put on lead shift supervisors, who are highly underpaid.  Hard work, and the people aren't great."
bad,"the store i was at , was high stress, some  good some horriable customers. The staff was pretty good, alot of drama and they dont pay you holiday pay until after a year"
bad,"Poorly staffed on purpose.  The company tries to get the most bang for the buck with the least number of people possible.  The customers were great for the most part.  The management was the worst: inconsistent leadership, petty, nepotistic, and uncaring.  I left because while our foreign born colleague-pharmacist were able to take 5+ weeks of vacation, I was told that taking my normal 3 week vacation failed to meet the needs of the business.  When I questioned this I was told: ""it was a new policy"""
bad,"Rite aid was a good company to work for but they were not very job work/ life balanced and did not care for employees personal life! Limited and very expensive benefits package, little job security and management was very unorganized using a rule with an iron fist approach when dealing with employee discipline!"
bad,"Typical day of work signing and on the computer doing data entry and ready to fill prescriptions. Answering telephones while doing that. Also, putting away medicine that was receive to us. the hardest day at work is to just to have to multi task all throughout the day. the most enjoyable thing is assisting the customers and making sure that there medicine was receive to them correctly and at anaccurate time ."
bad,"fill prescriptions per doctor instructions,"
bad,"Typical days a t Rite aid is ringing up customers, facing products and unloading boxes. Pretty boring. I didn't learn much at rite aid only to count money quicker, operate the register and handle difficult situations with customers. My first manager was awesome always on task and ready to help then he was transferred to a different rite aid pharmacy. The new manager that came in was horrible. He was very unorganized and made his employees do is own work. I was working alone on black Friday because he did not set up a proper schedule for everyone. I did not really enjoy working at rite aid but if I did get any joy out of the day it was from the customers because my co-workers weren't sociable and rarely helpful."
bad,"Employee's are very hardworking! Staff is tight, therefore makes it tough when someone needs to call in sick, it puts a lot of pressure on the already tired crew. Also, not good when you have split days off for family plans."
bad,"Teamwork is important, but it becomes detrimental when it leads to ""group thinking"".  Many corners appeared to be cut for the purpose of getting the job done."
bad,The job was easy and it was easy to work there and go to college. It was nice to transfer between stores when I went back home for the summers.
bad,"I would say the Company as a whole needs to focus on building a strong management team, and allow store managers to be more creative with there stores."
bad,I was with the company for 7 years and it was always about numbers and what you did wrong.i wouldn't recommend this company as a place to work for anyone.
bad,"Work was fine, aside from the Teenagers for Team Leaders. This is a place of business and adults. The he said she said needs to be left in High School. I loved our customers, and enjoyed helping people. I didn't like that the Union took $39.00 every month. The Union never helped, they would say you have to talk to someone else. Pushing blame on everyone else. Stay in the Pharmacy don't let them move you. Pacific Grove CA. Monterey County."
bad,Techs do all the work for the pharmacists and only get paid 8.50 an hr. the pharmacists don't like to help the techs complete there duties and sit on the phone and talk all day. the breaks are short and very little time to eat. most of the time you have to eat on the fly while your working. most customers are rude and will yell at you for the insurance not paying for the meds.
bad,The people who do get promoted from within are usually not fit for leadership in my experience.
bad,"Thoroughly enjoy the position of Pharmacy Technician. Exciting to apply my skills, work experience and passion in this aspect of healthcare."
bad,"Typical day at work consisted of standing on your feet for 6+hours with only a 30 minute break."
bad,"I was promoted to Shift Supervisor. At first, I was ecstatic, things were going great, until the general manager was fired, and it was only myself and another shift supervisor to run the store. The biggest problem was the other shift supervisor had another job in addition to this one, so that left me to run the store. Another problem was that I was only taught the basics, counting the safe, making deposits, and checking in vendors everyday.It got to a point where I was making money, but had no time to spend it. I lost my girlfriend because unfortunately we weren't seeing each other that often. I was tired, and I lost so much weight. I was terminated for supposedly misusing my employee discount, but the purchases weren't made by me. This position almost ruined my life, and I'm glad I'm gone."
bad,I was given a 45c raise to a management position where i would have to travel to 4 different locations up to a additional 30 miles a day with no compensation.
bad,"A day when my superiors too advantage of the fact that I was new in the country. I was made to do every odd job, like taking care of the toilet and cleaning the floor, together with my duties of cashier at the store. I learned that when one is new in this country some people can take advantage of the situation. Management was aggressive and threating. Some co-workers were very friendly, and sympathetic. The hardest part was getting me to clean the windows of the store which is about fifteen or more feet high. I did not enjoy a day at that store."
bad,"The head manager I had was great he was understanding and fair. The supervisor was awful she was rude and complained too much, she wasn't fair when it came to the schedule. Everyone's hours was always going up and down she just wasn't consistent."
bad,My experience at my store may be different from others as each store is different. My store manager spends all day in the office. I've learned a lot because my fellow supervisors and I do almost everything. Corporate imposes several dumb policies on its associates. The hardest part of my job is the stress of trying to get everything done in my shift. The most enjoyable part of my job is probably the relationship I have with my regular customers.
bad,Poor management. Working with public was nice. Enjoyed customers and helping them.
bad,"I enjoyed working with people and helping others. It was a training store , so had new management almost every year and I didnt like that."
bad,"Always not enough people scheduled to work. No breaks, long shifts, No help on truck day. Open every holiday so if you have a family forget it."
bad,Rite aid does not train or teach their employees properly and rite aid management has no respect for their employees and do know offer their employees any chance for advancement
bad,"Rite Aid Pharmacy is not an employee friendly company. They truly do not care about their employees, from the stock person to the pharmacist. They get rid of all of their best employees, especially if you have opinions that are not compatible with what they consider profitable or valuable for them. They put unrealistic tasks on employees, obviously made up by someone that works in an office and not in the field and while your working on those tasks they continuously change them. It seems as if they make up stressful situations purposely to break their employees. Unionized stores are supposed to get a 30 min. break and two 15 min breaks, but they make it hard for you to take any of the 15 minute breaks and if you do get even one your looked at as if your doing something wrong."
bad,The work was not difficult but the environment was uncomfortable and stressful. I dealt with a lot of racist and rude people. Management was poor and only managed for own personal gain and enjoyment.
bad,"Management is the best part of the company. As a technician, there is not a lot of growth and job security is not guaranteed. I find it to be an unstable company."
bad,Working for Rite Aid was a fun place to work until about a year ago.I feel upper management needs to give some positive feed back and not just the negetive.
bad,"Rite Aid Pharmacy was a very difficult place to handle. The pay was very low, even for retail. I did not complain because I was receiving on-the-job training in the pharmacy, but when i discovered that there was not a scheduled increase in pay once I passed the state board certification, I was very disappointed. My site was very busy, which I enjoyed, but not as fruitful as other stores. The management did not receive any structured training on how to handle employees. Very stressful."
bad,It was very relaxed to work there. You could pretty much do anything. Just they didn't give out enough hours. I was a cashier some days i would stack the shelves. Manager was nice the co workers were very nice. There was nothing hard about working there.
bad,I would suggest all pharmacists stay clear of Rite Aid. Hardest part of the job was putting up with managemet. There is nothing enjoyable working for Rite Aid.
bad,I worked for Rite Aid for about 14 years.  The first 11 yrs were great.  Corporate and district management changed and it became more about money than customers & associates.
bad,"The work environment is extremely toxic, short staffed, lack of organization. Very unprofessional, Upper management has no care for employees’ safety ."
bad,District manager and regional manager make all the difference. I manage a low volume store with few hours available for employees. Expectations of district and regional manager are unattainable.
bad,Not good for hours.......... They cut my hours without notice and I was the only one there they cut because I did not work hard enough as said by management.
bad,"Long story short, was working for the company for 3 years, tossed around different locations, kept getting promised to take the technician class but never did. Worked as a technician but got paid for a clerk for 2 years...never gave me enough hours to get benfits.....everyone has different experiences..mine was not good and I'm glad I'm out."
bad,"With my time working at rite aid i have learned to interact more with customers, have a lot of patience , restock items, change sale prices , help bilingual /or non bilingual costumers with any questions they have."
bad,"I work for Conduent, which is a third party administrator.  We are a Call Center which takes calls from various clients.  We provide this assistance based on individual contracts."
bad,"I can say that while they would love to “make you family,” they treat family like (insert profanity) and won’t be afraid to spy on you without your knowledge on the basis that this is a “public space.” Unless you are in need of a liw paying PART TIME job with nothing else going on in your life, don’t get a job at Rite Aid."
bad,"Most of the positions are strained and individuals are unable to explore opportunity within the company.  There are advancements at times open, training seemed to be a hardship for the company."
bad,See above in summary. Management is clicky and unprofessional. Breaks are not given fairly. Learned to do deposits. The hardest part of the job is putting stock away and getting along with some staff that have been there many years. Most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
bad,I worked in a newer store that was not properly staffed. Store manager did not share the work load fairly  She never supported the weekend or evening crew. Ice cream and Pharmacy especially were understaffed. Employees would cover pharmacy lunches and were not trained at all to do so.  THE END RESULT WAS UNHAPPY CUSTOMERS AND STRESSED EMPLOYEES.
bad,"Dont work here.,dont work at his job low pay.,low pay management is poor.low pay ,  racial tension, dont work here. They care for black people. No one cares. No help."
bad,"The person(s) doing the scheduling were not coordinating, resulting in conflicts and scheduling you to work in different stores at the same time, which created problems for pharmacy management."
bad,"Cashier pharmacy and all products over the counter "
bad,"Rite Aid is good for a first job and thats about it unless you are a pharmacist. It’s pretty laid back but always understaffed so you probably won’t get fully trained very quickly at all. Corporate does not care about anyone, we are all replaceable. They supposedly used to throw parties and give away cars... don’t know if thats true but that would explain why I only got my yearly raise one of the three years I’ve worked there (which is only by two percent). This company has its eyes set on money, cutting corners, raising prices, slashing benefits. A very very poor and greedy company. Do not work for Rite Aid unless you feel like being treated like useless trash."
bad,Walgreens acquisition has made rite aid employees being left in the dark and lied to. Promises aren’t kept and pressure is put on them to make them want to leave. Upper level management’s answer for everything is we should be greatful we have a job.
bad,I enjoyed my time at Rite Aid. It was a great learning experience. I enjoyed working with my co workers and taking on new projects and learning experiences
bad,"The hardest part of the job was being able to balance work and life, the hours were long and unfairly distributed throughout the staff. I was unable to remain happy with unstable hours."
bad,"I worked as a lead and as a manager for the warehouse. And reading other posts I would agree that most of the management team in lacking. Through the little to no training that was offered to new managers (other than a guide to employee displinary actions). Then never teach how to be a “leader” and upper management is so consumed with hitting metrics that they forget that the associates are the ones we need to reach those goals. Upper management tends to manage through fear, although you never see any follow through with poor performance by the management team. Hour and pay for management do NOT match local competition."
bad,"fill prescriptions, customer service, stocking. teamwork was great"
bad,Found to be unfair.Racism was always evident. Management was often unfair to me. Supervisors did not follow company policy. I was placed in an job classification but not paid for it.
bad,I relocated and my position was not available so I had to wait for a store to open up and it has been 5 months and nothing has been discussed with me .
bad,"there are never enough hours to match the desired outcome for the day to be completed with the staff assigned."
bad,it started at 6 am stocking what did i learn nothing management ok hardest part nothing the most enjoyable part  was nothing i liked that job just no growth within
bad,A typical day at work for me would be come in and first thing is to make envelopes for the day as far as voids and returns and then start my day with ringing up customers what i learned from this job is that when dealing with the public you have to be understanding and be helpful as possible the workplace can be very busy at times and competitive but if your hardworking you can handle it the hardest part of the job is having to uphold so many things being a cashier at rite aid is challenging because your in charge of so much the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to be able to do things on spare time as far as getting work done because its slow paced
bad,"Too much to do with not enough labor allotted especially in an inner city environment. Depend on undependable equipment, upper management is inept and unhelpful to those on the store level."
bad,I enjoyed working for the company the first couple months. but then it went down hill and the manager had no idea. It wasn't a good place to work after a couple months. There was one employee there that would harrass other employees and the manager treated her like a pet. I left and of course this one girl got my position. I was a supervisor. Sometimes it did get boring because the manager would do everything during the day and leave nothing for the night shift. Some employees where great and others where not. I enjoyed everyone I worked with except one person. I just don't think that this rite aid is good to work for. THey will run you into the ground. There is alot of talking behind your back about you from other employes as well as the manager. I would not recommend this job. They like to hire outsite of the company instead of within. I never met the district manager for the whole 6 months I was there he never showed up. He never even called for an interview like the e-mail said they would. It was a good place to start and nothing after that. They don't hire within the company at all. So if your a cashier then you stay a cashier. THe manager likes to talk about what other people made as pay and it goes around the store to everyone.
bad,"I would say depending on which rite aid you work at it can be good or bad. Upper management screws over store managers a LOT, but it does have a ""family"" feel. The pay is not nearly enough, as compared to other stores and retail in the area."
bad,"The warehouse job in its self is not very difficult mentally but is a high risk for physical injuries. They don’t pay much for machine handling operators and the raises are minuscule even though it is a union job. Two tier pay scale also, so some do the same job for 1/3 less money. Management is very controlling and demeaning. I get that business is business, but this company lacks integrity and empathy."
bad,Difficult work environment combined with hard and long hours with upper management that have high expectation and demand results from an overworked and underfunded store team.
bad,"My overall experience was stressful. I was hospitalized for 4 days after 4 months of working at Rite Aid due to the stressful environment. Though, I was a part-time employee, the hours were not flexible at all. I was purposefully scheduled to work on days that collided with my school schedule so I would be left to choose on whether to go to work or school."
bad,"This was a rewarding job as I’ve learned volumes regarding managing a large staff and in an ancillary capacity co-managing two other locations. I had a tremendous district manager who was always available for help, guidance and consistent communication."
bad,"It's pay is low, benefits are bad, its stores dont live by its cultural mandate and mission, its managers (upper) are unprofessional and burned out. If you work here they will help you develop your skills in management, but also personally make you wonder if you were ever cut out to be in management. You will work hard and not be recognized for your contributions and you will be called in to work a lot since employees will quit. Virtually no one outside of management will work full time."
bad,"Rite Aid clearly cares more about their bottom line than they do about associates or customers. Low wages, expensive healthcare, crummy hours, ""customer is always right"" attitude when customer is clearly wrong. Would not go back."
bad,"I was a supervisor at Rite Aid for many years.  I went in wanting to do the best job I could and to help my employees in any and every way I could. But upper management tends to micro-managed the supervisors. Due to the continual overall poor performance of the department changes in policy and procedure were constant. The constant changes were ad-hock, off-the-cuff and usually ill conceived. I once was ""scolded"" by the director because I gave an associate recognition for a job well done because none of the other supervisors were doing that with their associates. Often times the changes didn't replace existing duties but instead added more and more duties to the technical staff and supervisors alike. Accordingly, there was a high turnover rate of technicians because they said this wasn't the job they signed up for. There was little to no upward mobility for most supervisors because upper management blatantly created new positions for and promoted those managers and supervisors they had friendships with outside of work. Poor and inadequate training was a common complaint among the technicians. This was due to the fact new training was ill-prepared and performed by internal associates truly not qualified or certified to be trainers. Even as supervisors we attended training that was rarely put into practice or even wasn't practical in our environment but it looked good on paper for the company. "
bad,"The dma role was very stressful.  You had all of the responsibility, but no management power.  Every Monday you would complete payroll, and take care of scheduling on a daily basis for pharmacists."
bad,The pay sucked. When they give you a raise it's between 15-25 cents which is crazy. The job is not hard but not to easy. It was a good job they just paid horrible. Lowest pay I have ever had.
bad,Not a good place to work unless you have no life and do not mind being treated less then a human at times. Money is good. Rite Aid doesn’t mind paying you to keep you as an employee.
bad,"Rite Aid was my entry into the pharmacy scene. However, the team that I started with was great but once that team changed and that includes management. It became an unhappy and stressful environment to work at. The pay was very little and not even on par with the average pay for pharmacy technicians."
bad,"The store I worked at solely relied on the clerk, especially on truck days. I can say most managers are lazy (this is based on the particular store I worked at). On truck days, managers only leave the office when they an associate needs them, if a customer needs their assistant or when truck comes (afternoon managers). Beside that, work is usually busy and fast paced. I get along with most of my coworkers and tolerated with them all. The hardest part of the job is truck because that is the biggest work load. In addition, multitasking is required since the customers comes first. Personally, I never joined the union but I heard it is great (co-workers that's in the union inform me). I learn how to manage my stress and time management."
bad,"I learned a lot from my time at rite Aid, but it was mostly self taught. There was no room to grow in the company, and little to no staff. Long work hours as well as a lot of weekend shifts."
bad,Working in the Pharmacy was not really my favorite thing to do. I didn’t really enjoy that work field but i did enjoy working the cash register. It was just too much with all the people and all the medication.
bad,Co-workers were the best part about this job.  I did not enjoy retail.  I did not enjoy much else about this job.  The mall that our store was in was slow.
bad,"Leading up to and since the Walgreens buy out of Rite Aid, there seems to be a heightened sense of urgency by management to focus solely on metrics and not on customer service.  For a company that always took pride in their approach to helping customers, I feel that they need to focus more on their employees and customers as opposed to being fixed on the numbers game."
bad,"Upper management has fallen off with their core values, and promoting the so called rite aid experience.  Spent lots of money to have Disney corp train us, but we failed to utilize any of those key tactics within."
bad,it was hard work little benefits and little training. stressful and moving all the time. come in temporary and treated like a third class citizen. the people around you were not friendly and didn't like to train anyone new and pushed u to keep up with there unreasonable quota from the start. no one cuts you a break in there and they just push push push u out.
bad,I didn't like the branch I worked at. Im sure there a lot of branches that may be more pleasant. Company culture was not that great and the staff was not very organized
bad,Very long hard days while you are standing on your feet and only sit down for 30 minutes.  It is very busy from open/close.  you are being pulled in every direction but we were still able to provide customer service.
bad,"I worked here 1 year almost and didn't get enough benefits, less hours and less pay.  Management was poor and didn't treat me fairly.  Other employees were given more hours and I was given less hours even though I came before them when I started working here."
bad,"Had to be on time everyday, and to make sure the task and objectives were completed durning that time but also to help anyone who need helping looking or searching for that item they needed"
bad,"Working in retail pharmacy can be rewarding, but also challenging. Unfortunately I experienced more of the latter and had difficulties with management, as well as customers. The long 12 hour shifts day after day left very little time for me to recover and take care of personal things. I felt as though management was not dedicated to helping the employees."
bad,it was a fun experience.  the store manager had no clue being a manager.  The leadership wasn't there to support their employees.  I would recommend this job for a college student or
bad,"company has sold half its stores. future is uncertain. compant will be bought out when walgreens completes its takeover of the stores they bought, most likely in the spring"
bad,I didn't just work at the Minerva store. I did Waynesburg and a few canton stores just so I can have extra money but the pay wasn't worth the amount of hours I worked for
bad,Working for Rite Aid was a hard job to have. The hours were long and being a part time employee meant that I had no benefits. The customers were never satisfied and were constantly agitated with staff.
bad,"It was a rat race from the time we open until the time we closed because we were always playing catch-up from the day before... "
bad,The company is a good company but depending on the location your work experience can be a bad one from dealing with Irate customers daily  to working with co-workers that were really no better.
bad,Open store close store go to bank unloading trucks putting merchandise were it needs to be . Learn how to handle customerneeds and wants.management add invoices and Bank deposits n to the systems. Work culture working with all types of customers.most enjoyable part is working with the customers
bad,"The worst part about working at rite aid pharmacy was being yelled at by the customers for things that were out of your control and management not having your back. "
bad,"A typical day at work would leave your feeling exhausted. You would run back and forth from register to filling prescriptions. The company would not provide enough hours to hire a full time cashier, which would have been a great help to work flow."
bad,It's not the worse company but it surely isn't the best. Some days can be good and some can be a nightmare. You quickly will be looking for another job.
bad,"This place was super corporate, it was not at all a fun place to work. They asked way more of me than what I was getting paid for. It was under staffed greatly and the standards where surprisingly outrageous."
bad,"The pay is terrible. The work is backbreaking. The people I work with are amazing including the Store Manager and Asst. Store Manager. Truck day is painful at best, pharmacy is slow and always behind extending the manager on duties hours at closing."
bad,"no comment  thank you "
bad,There is no room for advancement once you reach the management level. Limited schedule options for time off. Great for someone that does not have young children
bad,best part of job was the benefits due to the stores being Unionized here in California.  . management can be horrid and two faced- even to its Supervisors. Be prepared to work every holiday weekend and late night hours here. even co workers distrust each other.
bad,easy job to learned if you pay attention. the store i work in has alot of theft so i makes the job more stressful. our store employees are close nit and very family friendly. higher management is horrible and gives off the vibe they dont care about the employees just if you open the store and make them money which they bearly pay you.
bad,"it was an okay job, it fast pace at times and slow at others, some employees were nice others were not so nice but the workplace over was a starter job, it was nice to meet new people and helping."
bad,"Stocking and cashing customers out. I learned how to use a cash register, how to print photos, and customer service skills. Management wasn't too bad could've been better. Hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. The best part of the job was working around good people and being able to provide customers satisfaction."
bad,"Poor management because they hire manger from CVS store and the way CVS handle things are a lot different compare to Rite-Aid.  But overall, Rite-Aid can be a great to work if you can do it all by yourself. No team work depending who they hire."
bad,There is no proper training from the top to the bottom. You complete online training asap to help customers. Corporate makes all the decisions with obviously no input from the stores. This place will drive you crazy.
bad,I came in to this company with manager experience and I also gained so much more experience with them. I had great coaches in helping me advance my position.
bad,"Very long hours with no help to be had,. truck would come at 3am and you were expected to be there all day after being up most of the night. Could never get the district manager into the store to help with issues."
bad,It is very strict. You have to be a cashier and watch people and be aware of people constantly trying to steal. You often encounter drunks and you don't get paid nearly enough for the things you do and the things you have to deal with and with what your required to do.
bad,The environment I feel is toxic at times. Do what you got to do and don't get involved in gossip. My supervisor was good and tried to be fair but there are some that the shoes don't fit
bad,I have nothing good to say so with that being said where I worked was good up until the past few months all bad afterwards I think I would be better off
bad,"Rite aid was a very laid back fun environment to work in! Meeting and seeing new people was a plus, the manager was very nice and I wasn't scared to ask questions"
bad,Wouldn't reccomend working at Rite Aid Pharmacy.  Employees were very rude and disrespectful.  The ones who have been there longer than other would try to get the new employees to do all of the hard work when it is indeed a team effort.
bad,"it was a learning experience, it was verylong hours and you did not know what time you would get off until yougo to work that day.They also paid people different amounts although you were doing the same job."
bad,"Retail is not an easy business. They're  plenty of good supervisors, cashiers and managers who work very hard to make sure the store operations are done properly and promptly. The company does not appreciate this at all. For the amount of work needed to be done, we are not paid accordingly.  I also feel that they care more about the customers than about the employee, when in all fairness, they go hand and hand.. Happy employee's equal good customer service, equals happy customers, equals good business and more profit for the company.. Moral is very important in any business. They do not have a janitorial service regularly, so the cleanliness of the store is also part of our duties. We do not always have time to clean, this, in my opinion, affects how customers look at our store, especially when we allow customers to use our restrooms, this is another problem when we have some people who leave messes after they use our restrooms..We don't get paid enough to clean urine and other human waste."
bad,not a very good place to work does not care about employees or customers although claims customer friendly too many management issues and not enough people to serve customers properly with minimal pay for all that is expected
bad,"Management treats you very poorly/unjustly and favoritism is rampant-if you are targeted, you will be written up regardless of it's true/fair or not. A few of the employees were a pleasure to work with. However, you get little pay for extremely hard work, and breaks are hard to get. Management is poorly organized and training is poor."
bad,At this time i would not recommend working for Rite Aid. Management does not seem to be organized. Work place seem to be stressful. The hardest part of the job was matching new managements expectations.
bad,Great first job for high school students. Good for students in college or a part time job. Also good for elders just looking for something to do. Not a company to grow within or stay for to long!
bad,"My first 5 years working at Rite Aid was a wonderful experience. I had a great manager and a good team of technicians that I was fortunate to work with. But during this last year, mainly due to a hypothetical merger with Wallgreen's, our corporate made life quite difficult. This led to increased workload but with reduced hours for employees. Although I did not have my hours cut, I no longer had the help and supplies I needed to complete the daily work in our pharmacy. As a result over the last year all of the employees I worked with moved on to better opportunities. When I became the last member of that team left at my location I knew it was time to move forward."
bad,The computer was not user friendly at all and i struggled with trying to learn it .  I did not like how fast I was thrown into the pharmacy without proper training.
bad,Trying to do too many jobs at once. Trying to stock shelves and also take care of the register at the same time. very frustrating workplace. Alot of hostility between workers and management.
bad,"Was my first, high school, part time job, good job and people.  Attached to Eastview  Mall in Rochester area, good location.  Clean store, friendly people, good management there."
bad,"I worked for Rite Aid for a long time.  The whole time that I was there, I just kept thinking that I could do it better myself.  So that's why I started my own company.  Unfortunately, I couldn't make it work.  Thanks for looking."
bad,This job was great for the time being but it really wasn't fit for me. Some of the people I worked with I loved and they helped me so much. But they put a lot on my back while I got paid less than my coworkers and it felt unfair.
bad,they were great people to work for AND FRIENDLY PEOPLE AND FAST PASTED AN aslways work to be done and cleaning to be done too... always on time ...///
bad,"I've worked at the distribution center for over 2 plus yrs but because of personal reasons I'm unable to do full time.  I am a ""power producer"" EVERY MONTH Which means I do above and beyond what I'm supposed to!  But I'm about to lose my job because of their point system which is the most unfair thing ever created in a workplace unfortunately because I got sick on the wrong days or it snowed on the wrong day or my child got sick I used up the only thing I can use in those situations ....which when u hit 0 ur out the door no matter how awesome u are!!!  I earn nothing no vacation personal time nothing besides points which takes u 3-6 months to earn 1 day worth of points. So again if you are looking for part time or have any issues that might keep u from work more than 4 times a year then this is NOT THE PLACE TO BE!!!!!!!"
bad,"Rite Aid does not care about its employees at all. They claim they do just like every other company but they really could care less. The pay is the lowest around and their training program is a joke! Never have time to properly train nor actually learn your training programs and actually get your whole $.50 raise. Very poor hours and continuously taking hours away from the entire store by upper management. Go some where else, it's not worth the hassle."
bad,Rite Aid is too stressful to work with.  Less help than any other company.  Will not recommend to anyone.  Only for new graduate for a starting job.  Not a good company
bad,Stressful environment. Underpaid and overworked. Nobody is willing to help you out but expects your help when they need it. Save yourself the trouble and don't work here
bad,"It is ok to work there."
bad,I was hired when I was in High School. They don't care if you are student or not. They will treat you like a slave. The salary you get is nothing compared to other retail stores.
bad,"Rite Aid Sales Associate: January 2012-January 2013   "
bad,"continuously  on  feet  all day,  constantly  answering  calls,  persistent customer  service   a  priority. frequently  moving  from   one  area  to  another.   continuous  contact  with  other  stores  and    patients  on  a regular  basis"
bad,It's very difficult to take lunches and breaks. Job is always busy and demanding. Not bad if you are a driven individual and love to work. Management does what they can to support you.
bad,Not a good place to work poor management and the benefits for employees are bad not much room for advancement and the pay is bad too.
bad,"I learned a lot from this job, especially in the pharmacy. It really helped me to grow as a person and become better at what I do. The most enjoyable part were the people I got to work with."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of being constantly screamed and cursed out by customers due to poor responsibility within store management. Store needs to have management retrained on how to value their employees. And when an problem occurred, management did a poor job of resolving any issues. One of the hardest parts of the job was dealing with imediate supervisor who would not take action when their employee would get yelled at on a daily basis."
bad,Management is oblivious and there is very high turnover. Improper training and unnecessary work politics is rampant which leads to overall low morale.
bad,this place could have had a  better management team . there was one manager working for about 3 shifts. they didn't leave any room for advancement . they didn't want to pay the other staff and they were a little discriminatory to people with piercings and orange hair
bad,watching people in a negative light to make sure they where not stealing or taking items while being disrespected for doing my job
bad,"Your lower level managers are good people that care about employees, but upper and middle management does not. The company appears to follow a plan of not matching competition in terms of employee relations."
bad,"Working in the pharmacy at Rite-Aid provides a close knit family feel. The coworkers ensure there is always a judge-free environment. Pharmacy managers are always there to help and answer questions. However, there is not much room for advancement as a pharmacy technician and the compensation is not equal to the work that is expected to be done."
bad,"Rite Aid is an okay place to work. The store is located in Chapel Hill, NC. The store is nice and small. The most enjoyable part of my job is checking customers out."
bad,"or the cash register , help anyone in need. the hardest part of the job was trying to stop customers from having a hour long conversation with me when i would have a line."
bad,"I had to sell razor blades and band-aids to someone who had clear intention of causing self harm with the products, the supervisor forced me to complete the sale despite what the training videos stated when it came to refusing sales."
bad,"Hard work. Learned how to greet customers in need of help."
bad,Very stressful environment. People and coworkers were very rude and nasty. Tried to do the best of my abilities. I kept everything clean and helped everyone when i was able to.
bad,"As a cashier, I was responsible for greeting all customers that came through the doors of the store. I was also responsible for the up-keep of the store, working on planograms, and cleanliness. As well as working in the front store, I worked in the pharmacy as needed."
bad,"Not a bad job, but not enough room to advance or make good money. Job is the same. Day in, day out. Any input you have likely will not matter."
bad,"When I worked there the company was very close to going under"
bad,"a typical day in the pharmacy is always crazy but you have to not mix personal relations with work. Every job is different, I feel this particular store is not ran properly. Its very unorganized and the communication is basically non-exist. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I can bounce from other stores to help out. I enjoy helping as much as I possibly can."
bad,"Work hours unpredictable "
bad,"Employees are asked to do several jobs at a time. On a typical day this ex-employee was a security guard, receptionist, truck yard seal checker, employee services helper."
bad,I get to do what I really love doing. Training and development is what my experience and education have guided me to this career path.
bad,A good job that helps you get on your feet with good long term benifits especially for those who are currently at school. Good job is all i got
bad,The people are rude and the money part sucks the pay you 2.13 per hour and only expects you to make your money from tips alone and the restaurant that I was at was so secluded that only people who was traveling out of town.
bad,"I started at Rite Aid (formerly Eckerd) when I was 20 years old. I just needed a job to pay my bills. I was putting college on hold after completing two years of school. There was a sign on the door saying ""Now Hiring full time for Pharmacy""."
bad,"Very stressful work environment, and even though my other coworkers were pleasant enough, it was hard to make myself go to work when I was so miserable."
bad,Workload is too much and its not worth the pay at all.  Pay is not that good and they don't appreciate their employees.Management is not good and only care about customers don't respect the employees.
bad,There isn't much room for advancement with this company. This company will cut your hours without notice and it is done frequently. The people in the store that I work in are nice. The orders to cut hours come from people in the corporate office. they don't have any idea how things work fro store to store.
bad,The hours here are long and the composition is poor.  You will never receive a pain increase more than a couple of cents per year.   Most people working here make minimum wage including manager's.
bad,dispensing pharmacist multi task computer operated;checking technician work giving immunizations shots insurance issues  prior authorizations counseling patients on drug therapy
bad,Working for Rite Aid was not pleasant at all. They treated customers badly and for being the only pharmacy in town customers would rather travel elsewhere.
bad,Good job for high school student. Hours and pay are horrible.
bad,"i honestly did not like the job. The pay was horirble "
bad,"Same as I previously said.  It was a productive workplace, but very dull.  10 hour workshifts with no bright future, especially when I was working there as a temp.  Hardest part of the job was getting up early for a 6:30am shift, even on Saturdays and on days with inclement weather (snow, hurricane, etc.)"
bad,"Rite Aid has the lowest pay for Pharmacy Technicians in the area. Forget breaks and a lunch, you won't get them. Pharmacy Manager knows this violates state law and doesn't care. More worried about their cellphone that constantly goes off while on the job. "
bad,"My supervisor was very much the ""customer is always right""  kind of guy to the point that the law did not seem to matter.  I tried to straighten out the messes that had been caused and was told the customer comes first, the law be damned."
bad,"Worked here over 2 years. LOVED my job was fired over using a extra wellness card for travelers & kids who didn't remember there parents phone # to get sale prices. Many used an extra card, gave family members discount who weren't living with them. Had people help unload truck who weren't employed by company....and I got fired"
bad,"poor compensation, no full time hours, poor management, no training"
bad,dealing with cashiers also with customer with there complains and concerns also making sure the store is convenient for the customer
bad,working for rite aide was ok but to many over times for me to be home at good time for my family but was nice to work on my own.
bad,"Ringing up customer purchases/returns. I learned that I does not take  much to manage a pharmacy. The most taxing task of managers is inventory management. My co-workers were fun to work with, but did not take the job very seriously. The hardest part of my job was customers with coupon books, and the most enjoyable part was my co-workers. We worked off each other's energy which made the work day seem less tedious."
bad,"Working at Rite Aid is a fast paced experience. Every second goes by so fast, there are so many things to do and never enough time to get it done.  My pharmacy manager came to our store about a year ago and since the then, the days have gotten much easier because he is so helpful. Unfortunately, the district manager in our area doesn't recognize what an asset he is to the company and how he makes sure things get done when they are supposed to even if we don't have enough hours to get them done, so Memorial Day is his last day. My co-worker and I are like a family. We work together so well and we get the job done together. We are all in the process of looking for another job, because without our manager, the job will be unbearable.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get things done in a timely manner when there aren't enough people to get them done. You may tell someone that their prescription will be done in 20 minutes, but if 5 cars come through the drive-thru and 3 customers come to pick up their prescriptions inside, that can take 20 minutes or more and there is no way to prepare their prescription (or the other 2 or 3 that were dropped off in that time frame and are waiting).  I love seeing all the customers and knowing that they come to the store because of the staff, but it is more stress than one can handle at times.  I love my  co-workers and the hardest part will be not seeing them everyday, but I am ready for a job that will make me happy."
bad,Not employee friendly at all. Upper Mgmt. was not helpful. Mgmt. was overworked and underpaid.
bad,Underpaid for the level of responsibility in the pharmacy.
bad,"It seems like you get no support from your upper management.  While being a manager in my first year, if I had a question about something that another store manager couldn't answer, I would call my DM only to go to voice mail and never be followed up with.  Upper management would incorrectly try to execute initiatives without giving the full details of how we were to achieve the goal."
bad,"over worked, they cut hours so you get to do more with less people customers are either stupid or excellent at pretending to be so you do all the thinking for them upper management decides job advancement based on gut feelings and potential not actual performance. hardest part of the job is trying to keep a smile on your face"
bad,Experiencing working and interacting with the public. Upgraded math skills
bad,"Good Business, but not busy enough to stay busy. Have a lot of valued customers."
bad,when the store was not busy it was easy for any high school student but when it became busy it was challenging.
bad,"the store was always busy making sales"
bad,quick fast past work environment enjoyed every night going to work. the co workers were like a second family to me
bad,"Pay is below any average of a forklift operator, it is the lowest pay I ever heard of and wouldn't recommend this company to anyone if you want to make a forklift drivers salary look somewhere else........"
bad,I spent 2 years working with Rite Aid. I never had any problems until they brought in a new manager. Within his first week he had begun harassing me. He went as far as to ask me for a doctor's note on the first time using a sick day. He then called the note phony and proceeded to talk to me in an unprofessional manner on a daily basis. He ended up having me fired for failing to stop a customer from stealing merchandise even though I informed him of the situation in the first place. Very puzzling to how they find their managers because he was truly disrespectful and out of line.
bad,"Very rude & unfriendly management, overall not a place I would recommend working."
bad,I enjoyed working with my co-workers and the managers were very considerate.  The hardest part of the job was being too friendly with my co-workers and having to work a little harder to complete both their job and mine.  The most enjoyable part was being allowed flexibility to take my children to daytime appointments.
bad,"kooll many places to grow, the benefits of union is good as well as the ability to learn how to multitask is excellent"
bad,just don't work here they don't help at all the bosses hate you the co workers hate you
bad,"It's a good first job. I loved the customers are my job, they made it easier to come into work."
bad,"Rite Aid should give more attention to their payscale in regards to Pharmacy Technicians. They are a big contributor to efficient and productive care of the patients, but it is not reflected in their pay."
bad,"Walgreens has high slandered of pharmacy business, very customer oriented and pharmacist is well respected by the store management. There health benefits were very poor. Advancement in the company solely depend on how good you are in boss's books."
bad,First real job after highschool. Quickly advanced to manager. Helped pay bills while I attended College.
bad,The company made it very hard for employees to work because of budget cuts and such. Showed little or no interest in employees physical and/or mental state of mind. But I developed some lasting friendships with some pretty loyal and dedicated people in spite of company mistreatment.
bad,"I learned I never want to work in retail ever again if I can help it. "
bad,I was in the pharmacy department and we were the last place hit by the cuts
bad,rite was a typical job nothing real fascinating no room for movng up in company store was to little and the people that were there had been there forever
bad,"The job wasn't hard and I was told at the end of my 90 day trial period, ""today is the last day I can let you go without a reason, so have a nice day"" from my former manager"
bad,"The company as a whole seems to be a nice place. I did find that myself, and several others were promised promotions that never came. This appears to be a technique to get you to go above and beyond your job duties without any reward."
bad,1. approve payroll
bad,a good job for when in college. starts at minimum wage. stock shelves face product work with customers to help them find what they need.
bad,They lack communication from upper management to store level employees. They tend to say one thing and do another. They have favorites that don't tend to get in trouble. I'm not sure if all districts are as bad as the one i was in but be careful. Management has favorites at the store i worked in and You have to work around them. Co - worker are out for themselves and not very good team players at the store i was in. The hardest part of the job was the coworkers. The best part was the customer and helping them. This store doesn't give second chances or realize that people make mistakes. I liked the job but not people i worked with.
bad,Interim job before relocating to Atlanta after 25 years of Employment with PACCAR Financial Corp
bad,"Assisting with opening and closing of the store. I have learned that one cannot always develop a friendship with management, on the job you must always maintain professionalism. Most difficult part is having co-workers who wants you to do their job, but apprehending offenders is enjoyable and rewarding at the end of the day."
bad,"The job was Fun,Challenging and loving. I learned a lot of new things like how to type prescriptions and work a cashier register. I manage to keep a fast working paste so that they'll be no delays or upset customers.The hardest part of that job was Typing the prescriptions because some doctors hand writting was not easy to read or understand. I loved coming to work ready to help."
bad,"The Customers were always really nice however there was poor management and training plus it was difficult to get a break at times. Overall it was a nice place to work due to medical reasons that have nothing to do with them I am no longer there,"
bad,Hours are not good. The pay is also very low for the amount of work that is required from its employees. Not an ideal place for someone with an enormous amount of potential who has a good education background.
bad,I worked there as a pharmacy tech gave my heart and soul their. Covered up for a lot of people. I was even in the union but there was no job security plus people with higher post such as the pharmacist they have way too much pride you are not even allowed a single minute break even when there are no customers. They want you to just work work and work. I just have once complain someone you have family emergency but they say its not their concern.
bad,"I do not feel appreciated for all my hard work. You work so much and corporate is never satisfied,they always criticize every little thing even when they do not find anything wrong with the store. Some of the managers that they hire are very mean and undermine employees. They feel that since they are the boss they can do whatever they want."
bad,Rite Aid would be a nice place to work if there were enough employees to cover shifts.
bad,In June I will have completed my 6th year the other assistant manager has been there for 2 years yet we both make the same amount so yes I feel under paid.
bad,"Rite Aid don't think just follow orders"
bad,"Rite aid is very good at teaching you how not to run a company. There is a new CEO at the time of writing this, and she is changing a lot for the better. However, there is almost no support for the people in the stores. In the area that I am working, all of the other retailers are paying more than minimum wage, and I am stuck at hiring people in at that. I tried talking to the district HR manager, but she tells me that the union sets the wages, which isn't correct, and there is nothing that they can do. The amount of turn over that I have is ridiculous, and it puts a strain on the store. I know that I am not the only manager that is experiencing this problem currently; however, they do not care. Then the stress that the company puts on the pharmacists is beyond words, and I'm impressed that they agree to work that. They tell them that they have to do 10 of this and 5 of that all while checking the scripts and giving advice. I am lucky enough that the pharmacist that I have stands up to them just because they know if he leaves, then most of the patients will also. Both the front end and the pharmacy run on minimal hours, and if anyone calls off, then it's a nightmare to cover the shift, and most times, you will have to end up working a 14 hour day."
bad,Day to day it's pretty repetitious you pretty much know what you're going to be doing everyday each day of the week I learned how well my customer service skills really are and how much my customers really enjoyed me learn how to do inventory and a little merchandise seen actually got to go through with a remodel with them.
bad,The people in Corporate are not as knowledgeable as they should be for having college degrees.  There is a lot of laziness and guessing when you have any intelligent questions.
bad,No room for growth even though they say there is. When local fast food places offer more pay then the pharmacy Techs get that's not right or fair since the pharmacy busts their tears to meet goals.
bad,You have to try and muti task on things. Not usually enough people to cover lunches and breaks. Not enough pay. Management never communicated. Easy work.
bad,Management is terrible . At my job nothing works to much down time. And are manager do not care about the workers . Change are scheduled to meany time a year . It mess up are home life schedule when they do it at the last minute . A lot of people are not happy there . We are ready lost some good workers.
bad,"I was hired on cashier and promoted to part time shift supervisor, when promised fulltime. Took 2 years and 3 transfers to become fulltime. Was utilized more as a cashier than management. So the training was not there. Since I worked at a low volume store the help was not there. The work load was immense and not worth the pay, time, effort."
bad,Dont make it a career a d dont count on upper management to help you when you bring serious issues to the table they also will penalize you for not driving in severe weather conditions
bad,"Was treated unfair,paid unfairly.managnent was disrespectful to there employees,as well favorited which ones they wanted working there and who they didnt want there"
bad,"Stressful and extremely unpleasant environment"
bad,"It's all about what corporate wants and numbers. How many immunizations you can do in a week and how many people you can get signed up for texted messaging, not about the patients. The people who work there are nice, but if you dont ""fit"" in you can feel left out. The work can be a little one sided, they say that we are all a team but it's not. If I wanted to be a cashier I would of applied for the front of the store, not the pharmacy. Ask questions to do data entry and the pharmacist just takes over and does. Dont teach you anything, or you have to figure it out yourself. Other techs and the pharmacist are on there cell phones all day. The one pharmacists even shops in hers through out the day. Good for now but will be moving on soon."
bad,"A typical day at work included stocking shelves, processing transactions, and cleaning the store. I learned basic retail stills. Management was alright, sometimes difficult. The hardest part was limited time to complete tasks. The most enjoyable part was helping customers."
bad,"I enjoyed the fact that I was always busy from the time I entered the store until I clocked out at the end of the shift.  There was always work to be done.  Setting up ads, boxing up items that no longer were salable. That part of the job was fun"
bad,Not the job you want to have when you have bills. You get paid minium wage and expect for you to do 10 things at the same time. Good for a first job like I said.
bad,Too much uncertainty with company. No one knows what future lies. Not much opportunity to move up within company. Not enough pay. Work hard and no recognition.
bad,Was overly worked and had to work Closing shift to mid shift on truck days. Like three to four hours of sleep. And management didn't listen to our suggestions
bad,Like I said paid less  than minimum wage 10-12 an hour to work in a high thief area with dangerous thieves that will curse you out and potential harm you they are not trying to pay more how cheap of a complete and wonders why they can’t keep people corporate should be ashamed
bad,"Rite aid for myself is not a bad warehouse to get started off in. Putting in 6 years worth of dedicated employment, career advancement and increase compensation is absolutely terrible also changing their health benefit plan makes employment with this facility really difficult for a long term career choice. The plus side you are trained on company time to operate the powered equipment which why I say good staring place if you are new to the warehouse industry."
bad,this company had a lot to improve in. they tend under pay  their employees as well as over work. they don't seem to care about their workers very much. thing might have changed since I haven't worked for them in years.
bad,Hardest part of job seems to be corporate doesn't seem to care about store workers. corporate constantly initiating procedures that don't work in the stores.
bad,"The job at rite aid was ok, so long as you get a good manager. I did not, my manager did not car what was going on or if the other employees came in drunk or high as a kite. But if you where late by a minute you where getting written up."
bad,"I enjoyed working for Rite Aid for the first three or four years. After that, it became too physically taxing on my body. There was a lack of communication in the warehouse that could be very frustrating."
bad,"I only liked a couple of my co-worker (not my complant). Any time I tried to call out I pretty much got yelled at or got a guilt trip. My location was understaffed because nobody that applied was really willing to work there. Only times I called out was for car problems, weather conditions, and family needs. I admit I was late quite a bit but it was because of traffic and I also had to go across a bridge to get to work."
bad,"Stressful work environment. Little support from field management or corporate.  As much as I liked my day to day tasks and interaction with customers, the company was not one that would work for again."
bad,"Although I was working under a union during this time, The pay evens out to minimum wage. Your job as a cashier will never be just as a cashier. You will sweep, mop, close, open, breakdown pallets at 5:30AM, serve ice cream, file paperwork in the pharmacy, the list goes on. I was happy with working a full time job that put a roof over my head, but the level at which they stretch the ""Are you willing to do work outside of the specific job duties you were hired for?"" question is at maximum. The management was poor and although it was well known that the asst. manager wasn't reliable and had caused many people to leave- because she was in a union there was not much that could be done. Kind of a catch 22. "
bad,I enjoy it very much and love the ones I work with. I'm having trouble with my shoulder and the repetitive work in the pharmacy is not helping.  I work I'm the pharmacy and it seems to run a lot better then up front.
bad,The employees make this place a great place. The union made it possible for us to keep our benefits and our jobs. No advancement opportunities. Thank goodness for ice cream.
bad,"I worked at a 24 hour Rite Aid as the grave yard shift. It was just me, a supervisor, a pharmacist, and a pharmacy tech, that was it. Normally this can be done with a small crew, but we were located close to a homeless shelter, so we dealt with shoplifting daily. It did not help that we desperately needed someone as security that was never provided. When the regular shoplifters found out we did not have any security, there was practically nothing we could do as they had a field day there. I tried doing this for 3 years and at the end, I was becoming unhinged because I started to have really negative views about people that were homeless and the general public itself. Leaving there was the best decision I have ever made for my mental health. Don't do it, it just isn't worth it."
bad,Not a bad place for a part time. Hours are always being cut. Required to pay for union fees so use the services provided by the union. Find a store in a good location and the jib experience will be better.
bad,"I enjoyed helping the customers, guiding them what to do next, inform the oharmacist of any issue relating to their rx, filling and keeping the work station clean. There was a lot of favoritism and one person constantly watching over the other and poisioning the mond of the mananger. there is not much growth and encouragement."
bad,"The benefits are great if you are in California, but hats thanks to the Union and not the company. Most of the time I feel underpaid and overworked..."
bad,"The more volume your store did, the less you got paid! The District Manager and Regional Manager always threatened your job and insisted that you work from 4:00 am to whenever on truck day."
bad,"company has been dreadful ever since the purchase of Eckerd Drug Store"
bad,This was my least favorite job ever.  The manager just delegated the night shifts and jobs he didn't want to others. Talked about things that were too personal and it weirded me out.
bad,"When I started there it was a good place to work, but the manager then retired, and we got a new manager.  Since then, it's went down hill, our new manager is simply not management material.  In order to be a good manager you must think of all of your employees not just certain ones, and you must lead by example."
bad,my responsibilities as shift supervisor at rite aid are to count out all the registers make deposit and manage cashiers. I have learned to delegate store duties and to praise employees when they are doin good and talk to them when they are under performing. Management is good they are team players. The workplace culture is a little laid back could be more productive. The hardest part of the job is working load only because we should have more people working it. the most enjoyable part of the job is working with all my co workers in a fun environment and keeping great customer service which is most important.
bad,its alright hours are flexible. schedule  gives you time for appointments and family time. nice breaks and lunches. get used to regular customers very personable job.
bad,"rite aid has little place for advancement in the company so i do not recommend for anyone looking to make it their career, unless working in the pharmacy department. hours suck, open 365 days a week, which means required nights, weekend, and holidays. they do not pay employees enough for the work they do, and the once a year raise makes no difference in your check at all."
bad,"Management does not want to hear from you."
bad,"Rite Aid has the potential to be a great employer. However, constant missteps and mismanagement causes it to be a less than favorable place of employment. If you're in a lower volume store, they'll be times when you're in the store alone. Payroll doesn't get much better for higher volume stores. The bulk of the work falls on the Store Manager because there's no hours to give to a staff. There's also a huge problem with turnover in Field Management/ corporate. Save yourself the trouble."
bad,"The store seems slow pace and easy but what you don't see is the stock room. There are several items to keep in order,restock, replenish, and organize before your shift is over"
bad,"As a manager, I was used to being in more of a coach/training role. In Rite Aid, it's a lot of hands on and more physical labor. Less help due to budgetary reasons."
bad,"Although it was a great place to work, the higher management makes it clear that they want you working for them and only them. In no way do they want you to improve and move on."
bad,"Rite Aid is a decent job if you are a teenager or young adult because the pay isn't great but the job is fairly easy. In conflicts of employee vs customer, corporate will ALWAYS choose the customer! They care more about customers than their own people. The front end is open regular hours on holidays and the pharmacy closes at 5-6 on holidays. You must work there full time for a year before you get any vacation time (1 week) and the next vacation raise is after 5 years (2 weeks). The company does not really have employee incentives."
bad,There was a quota which was competitive for all pharmacies.  It was more about how much was done and not how the patients were doing.  Some pharmacist lacked customer service skills
bad,Company culture very different once the takeover occurred. Was never the same. Payless was more community and family orientated. Rite Aid came out west with a thunder and the business has been down like the stock price ever since.
bad,Always understaffed. Managers required to work 50+hrs a week to make up for low payroll. Company wants everything done yesterday and keeps its employees very stressed
bad,I think they had too many ppl who wanted to be in charge and i didnt know what to do. One tells my to not listen to the pharmacist then next they say hes my boss and i have to listen to him. Then the next day im getting yelled at.
bad,Rite Aid is in the midst of being purchased by Walgreens.  This has created uncertainty within the company.  It shows from management on down.  This is why I am currently searching for new employment.
bad,"I took this job after college, and started looking for other work within the first six months."
bad,"Slackers are more appreciated than hard workers. If you work hard they will always complain that you haven't done enough but if you slack and do nothing, you get away with it all the time."
bad,"My job was difficult and challenging and my job was not fun because the people was rude and impolite. I filled  prescriptions , stocked medicine that was the challenging part learning where they went from using the generic names. I did like being a pharmacy technician, but the workplace made me feel uncomfortable."
bad,"stressful at times, understaffed, but what staff there was was friendly, customers varied from kind to rude, always busy so that the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers while the most enjoyable was working night shift with less customers"
bad,annoying manger and rude. not enough hourly pay for the ammount of work employees do. they need to raise the pay and give longer breaks and change thier unifroms
bad,"Enjoyed in the assistance of providing speed and accuracy to deliver medications and assist in Spanish translation of consultations. Inventory was always low, store management was always conflicting with pharmacy management and staff."
bad,I was constantly on the run in a extremely busy store with no partner. It seemed to be impossible to get a day off. There simply were not enough pharmacists at that time to staff the stores.
bad,"The management where I worked was great inside the pharmacy, when it came to the management on the floor for the retail end it left very much to be desired."
bad,The feel is different from location to location. I've worked and shopped at several locations. The dynamic is selective and subjective. One day at one location can mirror another day at another.
bad,Rite Aid is a customer service company and there is not a single person that works for that company that will protect their employee's against a customer.
bad,I worked in connection with the pharmacy to bring in customers and set up flu clinics. I also worked with the customers on the floor to help them locate different products and bring them to the pharmacist to recommend which product they should use. I really enjoyed working with the customers
bad,"Field management needs to listen to their stores. "
bad,I worked second shift at the rite aid warehouse as an order puller. The work is easy but the hours are long with small pay. They can keep you until the work is finished some nights lasted until 4am in the morning.
bad,"No communication between shifts, complaints are mostly ignored, and the staffing is unbalanced between shifts.. Overall its just a company going under."
bad,"Much of your day as a pharmacy tech is trying to complete all the necessary tasks of the day with an ever dwindling amount of resources. A locations with good colleagues helps a lot but it does not make these stressors go aways completely. Recently a whole shift was cut out of the daily schedule and we are forced to deal with two techs for one day instead of three while customer volume is constantly increasing. Upper management does not seem to care much about the workers at the customer service level, and rarely responds to our input."
bad,I applied to for Pharmacy Technician job but was offered a Wellness Ambassador job as well. I would be working part time Wellness Ambassador and part time Technician. I would say hardest part of the job was trying to go out and do Wellness Ambassador. I would have much prefer to be in the Pharmacy doing what I went to school for.
bad,Managers dont manage here . They do 70 percent of the work becuase of corp giving all stores extremely low payrolls making the managers life a stressful job. Opening is usually a manager and a cashier and chances are your in a busy store. The pay for managers is not to bad but the workload is merely impossible to complete. The field leaders consistantly behave like higher ups by ordering the managers to do impossible work and accept it for normal base pay. Not a job i would.recommend if your not a multitasking iron giant or superman. The customers are extremely rude and demanding considering its only 2 employees per shift. Shoplifters are basically in the stores everyday...good luck making your shrink plan . Anf if you do happen to have employees good luck getting them to do what corp expects for min wage. Im sorry i meant the slave wage
bad,"Rite Aid Pharmacy is not the place to work if you want to move forward in your life. Corporate, and upper management only care about numbers, instead of staff, and have little interest in keeping staff morale high. There is VERY little room for growth. I have seen many employees come and go, and for the ones that stay, they can be a hard worker, but never move up within the company. Management in all areas (pharmacy and front-end) need proper training on how to deal with issues that can arise. This includes customers, and staff. The store is usually understaffed, leaving the employees overworked, and underpaid."
bad,dirty work and very physical for low pay short staff and benefits are available after one year of working. Enjoy not being able to take  a day off for a year.
bad,I didn't mind this job. Well working here I learned a lot about different medicines and people. Hours were good and my co-workers were fairly nice and helpful.
bad,Company has a habit of reducing employee hours and asking its associates to do the work of three while expecting outstanding results.  Very stressful.
bad,I liked working with all the people that was there. But the drama that the store carried is crazy. They were always good with the customers. The manager would work with you on anything that needed done but the back stabbing that went along with it was crazy.
bad,"The job was ok mostly nice staff and a easy job it was part time did cashier, stocking, cleaning I did the whole works the two managers where nice and two girls I went to high school with worked there very nice only on employee who just did not like me at all everybody else was nice not the funniest job easy to get by at a young age"
bad,"The work days were simple, but when I worked there...the management was absolutely horrible. I learned that I never want to work for a company that is willing to fire their employees if they come forward to bringing up an issue. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a horrible security manager and a horrible store manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was that the coworkers were nice, but they have no drive to move up in rank."
bad,"All management fuction."
bad,"She creates a schedule that works with my needs, however upper management is disorganized and flighty. Not work through salary, with the amount of work required daily."
bad,If rite-aid wants to succeed as a company the bridge between corporate and employees must change. As an employee It was troubling to see all corporate people have weekends off have tremendous salaries and get paid on opposite weeks as employees!! Make better incentives!!
bad,"Working for Rite Aid is ok it can get pretty boring at times.  Traveling to different stores and working with managers can be a hassle, and annoying.  No one really cares about your safety, because it's not them doing the job. Pay is whatever not all that.  Even if you give your all to ur work that u put into the store u still don't get recognized."
bad,"The pharmacy staff is a mess. The pay is not good. The pharmacist there is lazy and rude and never helps out but it is supposed to be ""team work"". The drama there is completely unreal. Don't ever expect a break even though you have the right to or you will hear smart comments. I cannot begin to explain how much it drained me working there. Corporate doesn't ever do anything so don't expect much from them. They pretend they ""care"" but they do not. I would not recommend working here, it will literally drain the life out of you. Best thing I ever did was leave that place."
bad,"working with customers, doing little tasks here and there. organizing merchandise and working with money and photo center"
bad,Lack of mgmt. Understaffed. was never sent for pharm tech training even though hired as such.Pharmacist was hired and suddenly made supervisor with no training and no support and as this week was suddenly fired making understaffed situation worse.
bad,"The Job Was An experience that i will never forget. I have learned so much that will help me along the journey of my career path. Some people were kind, friendly, and actually took interest in the job and not just for the money. The environment was clean and yet safe. Being at work was like you being at a family gathering, it was incredible."
bad,Too many corporate policies are inflicted upon their associates to make the job unenjoyable. Expectations are unrealistic and cause stress among the employees and create strife.  Advancement is slow and you feel stuck at your current position.
bad,"They compensate you well but squeeze the life out of you and expect 12 hours work in an 8 hour day. The problem is that you are expected to fill prescriptions, give top-notch customer service, do all other required work (all no problem) but then do hours of scut work in a shift."
bad,rite aid doesnt no pay well they require you to dress up in a dress shirt and tie everyday of your shift and they expect a lot out of you for the amount they pay my experience wasnt all that great working for this company
bad,"I learned a lot working as a Pharmacy Technician and will greatly take that knowledge with me everywhere I go. A typical day at work would be running back and forth from the counter to the register ringing customers up and counting medications, doing data entry, and always being on the go!"
bad,A typical day at Rite Aid consisted of clocking in and running the register until time to clock out. I learned absolutely nothing and the manager was never available when needed. Co-workers never stayed employed there long. The hardest part of the job was staying committed to work only one day a week. The most enjoyable part of the job was that when other stores had the hours I could go work in their pharmacies and train which was what I was hired for.
bad,You have a lot of people in line and there was always customers stealing from the store. There was always people leaving from the line because the line was too long.
bad,"relaxed environment, worked the cash register, stocked shelves, answered phones, helped customers find items, cleaned the store"
bad,"stressful, co workers ok, i've learned a lot, helping people is what i really enjoy about the job. Management is ok for the most part"
bad,"The company as a whole I do not think appreciates their employees. There is no incentive for employees to want to do well, not much opportunity for growth and definitely no rewards or benefits for jobs well done. However with that being said, my particular location, I got along very well with my supervisors and co workers. That is the only positive. Typical day to day, filling prescriptions, dealing with doctors offices, insurances and customer service. Fast paced and upwards of 400 scripts per day."
bad,"Been with this company almost 2 years now and have yet to receive my yearly review, had to fight for a very small raise last year. Management does not communicate at all with the staff so you have no idea what is going on most of the time."
bad,"not enough help, work very strange hours. not paid very well. they require so much more from their employees with no return from them."
bad,"I loved working with my co-workers but the day-to-day work was tedious. I learned to work a cash register and stock, remove and discount products. The store did not get very many customers so it was slow but overall it was a great learning experience."
bad,"Management is the problem. They give out tasks that can't be complete in a day, which they would know if they ever got out to do any work or at least listened to the people that do, then tell you are making excuses. There is a major disconnect between works and managment and the workers."
bad,"I typical day at work is filled with task such as data entry, filing prescriptions, filling prescriptions. We also speak with doctors office to confirm patient route of administration and frequently call insurance providers to gain coverage for patient medication. The hardest parts of our job is being unable to help patient because of a doctors error or insurance not covering certain medication which sometimes causes customers to become hostiIe,I enjoy working as a team to help assist our customers with medications that aid them in staying healthy."
bad,"A typical day at work was pretty much the same. My Job duty was a cashier. I didn't really learn much from working at rite aid. My manager showed favoritism, some co-workers were nice and friendly the others were rude and disrespectful. I can honestly say the hardest part about the job was truck day and inventory. The most enjoyable part was doing signs."
bad,"I do not feel that the rite aid corporate office cares about their employees. I would not recommend this job to anyone unless you have the highest possible stress tolerance level. I am generally a carefree happy person but this job sapped that away from my work life as well as my home life. We were not given time to take restroom or lunch breaks despite the legality. When human resources were contacted regarding said issues they came down to visit but did nothing and asked more of our staff then what we were able to do with the amount of staff and hours we were given. The management was poor, uncoordinated, and cold. A typical day at work consisted of running around doing about 7 things at once; answering the phone, filling a prescription, assisting a customer, contacting insurance companies, checking in orders, assisting drive through, counting out pills, identifying pills, resolving issues with equiptment and various other duties. Most of which are all being done at the same time while you hope you dont forget to complete any very important tasks."
bad,the most important part of my job was my customers.I learned alot of customer service and how important customer satisfaction is .Getting thier basic needs shopping at our store was a plus in customer satisfaction.Coworkers  looked up to me for any help with customers or questions as sitting goal for employees for thier 8 hour shift was prompt  and suceeded my shifts
bad,working in the store was a nice experience but the company itself needs major improvement I worked there for 4 months an it took 2 months after I resigned to receive my first pay
bad,"The people to work with are great.  They are the only reason to keep the job."
bad,I didn't like management or the hours. I did like my co-workers and customers.
bad,"A typical day starts with no additional help in the pharmacy but the pharmacist for the first 1 1/2 hours.  All the work is on the pharmacist's shoulders.  Then if you weren't lucky, the district manager called and started harrassing you as to why your flu shot numbers were down even though you asked every phone caller and customer in the store if they wanted one but the answer was no.  The district manager would not accept that.  If her numbers were off and she didn't get her bonus, she came down on the pharmacists.  If it wasn't for the wonderful customers and great coworkers, you would swear you were in HELL!"
bad,an ok company slowly dieing horrible benefits package and no security
bad,"typed, processed, fill prescriptions and helped customers"
bad,Just a stepping stone while I update my IT skills.  I have little or no opportunity to develop new skills other than the interpersonal skills I get while dealing with customers.  
bad,"As an assistant manager, my duties were many. The average day was 10 hours, minimum. However, you are only paid for 8 of those hours when on salary. This, to me, is a travesty."
bad,"I cannot recommend this company, as they seem to use ""Asset Protection"" as a stop-gap measure, rather than an active program."
bad,I will continue to fill this out later. I don't even want to think about it right now -- it was that bad!
bad,"Very Disorganized, more about quantity than quality. 7 days open a week with very funky hours."
bad,"Serving the customers was the most enjoyable aspect, a close second would be the merchandising of the store, personally interacting with the employees."
bad,"Your will receive the true meaning of customer service. In the beginning as a cashier you to deal with all types of people. Promoted from cashier to shift supervisor, not only you deal with the customers but you have to deal with employees who are under your authority."
bad,This was my first job since leaving the military and was an eye opener to civilian employment. I realized that I had a lot to learn.
bad,I love warehouse and manufacturing jobs.
bad,"Well as soon as I get it I make sure to take all the medicine bags and file them in the right place so that when a costumer comes to pick them up the person who rings it up knows where to find it. After that I then either assume the cashier position for about an hour or so, or I start typing up the scripts and entering them into our system so that they can be filled. While doing all of this you have to deal with all sorts of customer problems such as billing, insurance, trying to juggle filling with helping the people out. Toward the end of my shift I start to reload the medicine machine with vials of all sorts and then I restock up on certain things that need to be filled up. All in all the day is always busy, but for 7.25 it's kind of a joke, no incentive to wanna work there whatsoever."
bad,"Working in Rite Aid is an experience that I hope I would never go back at working again. Dealing with customers on buying groceries is really stressful. They arguing on something I have no control of. And the worst part is when there is a store delivery. I have to wake up early in morning, bring big heavy box supplies inside the stores with same amount of pay."
bad,I do not feel comfortable at Rite Aid. I have had panic attacks because customers getting mad and no managers around to help. I don’t feel happy going to work I feel very stressed.
bad,It can be a great place to work depending on where you work.  There are some areas that are great and some are poor.  Little support from upper management in the bad areas.
bad,Company is struggling to meet investor expectations. This is driving a very negative culture amongst the senior management team and being passed down to Associates and Managers in the field.
bad,Hill's retail is regular no playing stuff on the Shelf when stuff back off inventory Counting Stars. Just a regular Stormtrooper is fun everything is just alright
bad,"short handed all the time."
bad,"I had a horrible time. My store was not well managed and the company did very little for its employees. My store was the best in the district, so I couldn’t imagine how the other stores dealt with it."
bad,Too much favoritism. Don't get credit for your ideas in meetings. Short breaks and they expect the employees to take a 10 minute break instead of a 15 minute break.
bad,"Enormous discrepancy between fiction and reality. we are given all the tools we need to complete a perfect job; in reality unless I clone myself several time, there is no way I can use these tools efficiently if I don't have the adequate staff to do so."
bad,The work itself was fine but the management made my time there incredibly unbearable. They tried to guilt me when I put in my two weeks notice and one of the assistant managers lied and almost got one of the other assistant managers fired.
bad,"Although the workplace could get stressful at times, the management team was very helpful throughout all situations. Sometimes the customers there can get overwhelming."
bad,I worked in low volume store which I do not prefer. Low Rx volume but system so slow took everything I had to get work done. My partner was fired unfairly and they replaced him with floaters. On my shifts I would go in to work to a mess.
bad,I would get to work and I would instantly start ringing out customers or putting away stock.My customers were pleasant but I would get the one or two that were flat out rude and the management would just say grin in bear it.
bad,"typical day is busy, many tasks"
bad,being a mom where your job doesn't understand was hard. as all parents know kids are your number 1 and if your job can't be flexible with that after you tell them. I don't understand.
bad,"Is a place that hire you by hour and you don't have benefits unless you are a full time, the pay is very low compared to other places and there's no possibility to grow."
bad,"The pros are that you do get to have their reward points card to get discounts on their store brand items,  but that's pretty much it and the cons are you don't have that much time for a lunch break."
bad,"Barely got any raises over 4 year period. Not for me. The customers are rude. The job has hours though and some benefits, but definitely not worth the job itself."
bad,Typically day ended with a lot of work but not really productive. Junior needs to obey seniors. Politics within the pharmacy. People pretend that they are really care about customers' health.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job was my fabulous customers. "
bad,"Challenging, Stressful place to work, current culture is not motivating. Company will be downsizing or will be eliminated. Environment does not cultivate teamwork."
bad,"In my last store, the people I worked with were wonderful. Everyone was friendly, no drama. Before that, not so much. My last manager had transferred from our previous store and I followed shortly after to continue working with him. We were a great team and good friends. Prior to him, I had been at one location and gone through nine managers in three and a half years! Corporate was so tight with a buck even my manager had little influence on my wages. Raises were pitiful at best and insulting at worst. Seems they cared about profits more than people."
bad,"Worked hard, loyal, not appreciated."
bad,"All Rite Aid cares about is the numbers each store can generate. They will add more and more tasks that require a certain number of enrollments, shots, ect. All adding to the quick pace of filling 200+ prescriptions with understaffed shifts. If these goals are met, there is no benefit to the workers who reached the goal. If the goals are missed, the store is berated by corporate in emails."
bad,The harder part of the job having a manager and employees that don’t want to do their job... I learned a lot of costumers services the most part that I like it when I see things getting done
bad,"Management was only concerned about themselves and not the associates. Being a union workplace, sometimes it was hard to work with the associates. Other locations were run much better."
bad,"open store ,do deposit, pull report ,freshness report ,stock ,face ,cashier, checkin  vendors, merchandise every season ,working on planagrams which were monthly ,ran a 8 person crew, helped customers to find products,ordered milk and supplies"
bad,Very poorly run company. Very low paid employees. These go hand in hand. No one cares and it shows - frustrating to work for if you have any work ethic.
bad,"I stayed with the job for as long as I did because I truly loved the work.  As a pharmacy tech I would enter prescriptions, count and dispense them.  I would have stayed, however I was maxed out at $9 an hour (this was after I became certified).  A fellow employee was making more than me and had less experience (gender wage gap?), and no matter how much you excelled in the position, there was not only no room to advance, but you were told you are all ""just a tech"".  I would pick up the slack from other employees only to be treated the exact same.  I would not recommend working here unless you're ready to be taken advantage of and underappreciated."
bad,"While enjoying working with my fellow employees and taking care of our customers, I did not enjoy the inconsistant application of the rules and regulations of company guidelines.  Pros to the job were that in my position, it allowed me the flexiblilty to be with my kids for important school events."
bad,"My pharmacy manager, staff pharmacist and the other techs are amazing! It's higher management that is horrible! Don't recommend this company to anyone"
bad,"I was working the job of someone who was certified and was being paid less than someone who worked at an easier slower job, the people I worked with were amazing but the district managers were mean and expected way too much"
bad,"Being a pharmacy technician, you have a lot of important responsibilities and multitasking is a huge part of the job. I consider it an important job that demands a lot of qualifications and learned skills. I was payed barley over minimum wage. The pay was not enough for the hard work put in. Working at rite aid was not worth it, low pay and little to no advancement opportunities."
bad,A typical day at work was an 8 hour work shift with a 30 minute break. The Co-workers and management helped the day go by faster as they were fun and easy to work with. It was an extremely fast paced environment with constant interaction with customers and calling insurance companies and doctor offices.
bad,its an ok place to start off at just for experience in customer service. could be fun depending on your co workers and managers. but overall its a temporary place to just get experience.
bad,"Hours/Pay was not enough to pay bills or to be able to get personal things for yourself. Good environment, friendly customers, and good management, but not the best."
bad,Nice place to work. Bad management. Great people to meet. The experience was great. Most of the managers will help you except one. Manager was very unprofessional.
bad,"I've been with this company for 2 years now. I stayed because my direct coworkers and manager were awesome, despite the pay being well below the national average for a nationally certified technician. Things have been rapidly going downhill for the past 6 months or so and it has become more clear than ever that the company does NOT care about its pharmacy patients or employees, just the numbers and profit. Do not take a job with them, you'll get nothing for what you give."
bad,Rite Aid was a good place to work. It was my opinion that the work was very difficult based on the pay. Sometimes the management wasn't necessarily there for you if you had a question or needed something.
bad,"Rite Aid is a challenging place to work. Hours are not set and subject to severe cuts, pay for anyone outside of the pharmacy staff is dismal, and the stress level in high-volume stores make the environment at work unbearable.  Corporate doesn't see it's employees as people, and this is clear in their policies and practices.  I would not recommend working working for this company."
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked. I was here for 4 years and was constantly being played. I was promised 2 raises by the district manager that I wasn't given, I did not receive any paid vacation time like I was supposed to because of an error they made when hiring me, I was forced to be transferred from the original place I was hired because they knew the store was closing but didn't tell me until weeks after I was hired. Basically said transfer or lose your job. I never got any proper training and also didn't receive one of my annual raises. THEN was harassed and sexually harassed by an employee at the store I was transferred to, had 3 meetings with District Manager and Human Resources and the problem never got solved. 3 women quit because of this person and there were still no repercussion on them. Corporate Rite Aid Does Not Care About You. Job pays minimum. You cant ask for a raise, no matter how well you do, they will not even consider it."
bad,"rite aid is a good company, but they don't pay much. as a cashier gets paid minimum wage and the managers get paid o couple of dollars more with triple the amount of work."
bad,Good learning experience. Learned a lot about accountability and hard work. Management team seemed structured well. Company had a lot of turnover and in turn was a little difficult to connect with a lot of co-workers. Hardest part of the job was being able to give our customers the customer service they required and balance out the constant merchandising. I enjoy the challenge the most while working for Rite Aid.
bad,Working at Rite Aid as a pharmacy technician is good if you have good management and strong leaders. Worked there for over a year and became fully certified and still had no pay increase other then $8.50 while other fully certified pharmacy technicians are making $15 an hour across the road.
bad,"Love being a tech,and working with customers. Co workers were great. Very flexible with other. However company does not care about employees only customers. Lowest pharmacy pay ever. Very much under paid. Decent work hours are unpredictable. Short breaks."
bad,"the pay was not the best. but it was weekly. Different sights, they would send you to. Al lot of favoritism. YOU needed to know  people to make it there"
bad,"cashiers have a lot more responsibility than the other employees with tasks like stocking shelves, cleaning, photo lab technician, answering phones and assisting customers sometimes all at the same time. there are no permanent shifts, a lot of time employees are scheduled to close at night then open in the morning leaving little time for personal life. some co-workers were more pleasant than others, the same with managers. the pay is minimum wage and not sure what the benefits are like."
bad,Management has no issues with leaving stores understaffed and still expecting one person to do two or more peoples work. The customers are usually fun and interesting to meet.
bad,"A typical day consisted of stocking shelves, bringing up sales items from the basement, and handling the register up front. My coworkers spent more time talking than actually working. Management was not always direct with instructions and lacked communication skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was still being able to put a smile on customers faces from being myself."
bad,"A typical day at ride aid is inter act with different type of people, and welcome they bussines to the store."
bad,"A typical day would be full of multitasking between cashiering and multiple management tasks that needed to be complete.  With Rite Aid, I have gained a great deal of customer service skills on a smaller scale store, whether if it was when I was a pharmacy tech or a manager.  I also learned to delegate better than before, knowing I couldn't shoulder the entire workload alone.  The most enjoyable part of my job has always been the customers.  I have grown to know a great deal of my customers personally, we exchange more than just greetings as they walk through the door."
bad,"PROCESS:"
bad,"I worked really hard and had to do everything from stocking the floor to janitorial services for little to nothing. I went to work everyday with a positive attitude and made my positive mark on anybody I came in contact with. I was always reliable except when I felt unappreciated I made it known that I was uncomfortable in the workspace and nothing was done instead I was penalized. So, I decided to resign from my position. I'm hoping to work for a company that's positive and open to personality. Not everybody worked towards making the workspace a better place."
bad,"Rite aid is a fast paced workplace and time devotion is needed in order to advance.. management in the store is very good and helpful with ""truck day""..  The day in which the store receives its inventory for the week. Coworkers were few but decent. A couple were a little lazy at times. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with random customers and constant movent.."
bad,"Typical day is pretty manageable. Learned alot about how to deal with the public. co-workers were all nice, but at times I felt extremely uncomfortable with the store manager. I did not feel they wwere receptive to anyones problems but their own."
bad,"A Typical day at Rite Aid is greeting each and every customer as they walk in the store, making sure they are informed on the product and know where the product is in the store. Cashier 5 or 4 days a week, depends on on who was working, Stocked the store once a week."
bad,"I go into the store and begin my routine.  I check cameras and partner with management to identify if theres anything I need to address.  I begin my check off list.  Ensure EAS towers are working, ensure bag checks are being done, Ensure vendor and fire logs are correctly being used.  Once my daily routine is done I then identify the dishonest customers who attempt to cause a loss to the company.  The best part about my job is knowing that I am making a difference.  Knowing this keeps my drive going and helps me to find new and better ways to do my job."
bad,"Depending on who the manager is its usually a cool place to work no chance to move up but pay raises aren't to bad."
bad,"Arrive at work and clean you station area. After, you would go and get your labels to be scan by your scanner. When scanned, items will appear on your screen and you pick those items from the list. After one label is finish, move onto the next until your work day is over."
bad,Rite Aid was an interesting place to work. It was fast pace. Keeping the shelves well stocked was a daily chore. Product arrived in large pellets and all staff was expected to assist in placing product on shelves ready for our customers.
bad,"The pharmacy I worked at was for the most part enjoyable to work at. The staff was very supportive and workflow for the most part was ok."
bad,"same as any retail job"
bad,"I basically came in every shift and did my job. Management did not do a good job with stimulating my mind. Opportunity for growth or advancement was not given. Being the person that I am, and needing to be challenged consistently and given more responsibility, I felt stunted and work felt monotonous. The part I enjoyed the most was the conversations that I struck up with all my customers. I enjoy seeing different faces everyday, and also developing business relationships with regular customers. All my coworkers were there for a paycheck, they never seemed motivated or in high spirits. They often made my moral drop."
bad,"This pharmacy is situated in a particularly busy area. A typical weekday brings in about 400 new prescriptions. A typical weekend brings in about 200 new prescriptions. 4 out of 7 days in the week there is only one pharmacist on duty; and this makes the work day very difficult especially on days when the prescription count surpasses 500 new scripts. "
bad,"There is a lot of drama. If something goes wrong, they unite together whether or not they are management. They discriminate because they are all friends. If one person doesn't like you they all make your life a living hell until you can't take it anymore and you want to leave and find another job!"
bad,"long hours, neverending, baby sitting unionized crew! district mgrs. always ""on"" the management team. Never do anything right "
bad,"management is multi-store, shift supervisors open/close & run the store, do deposits, oversee cashiers, help pharmacy, stock, check in vendors, ect."
bad,"greet customers and help them find the products they need. Learned how to become a strong solid worker. Management is a little difficult and challenging. My coworkers can be difficult to work with at times."
bad,"doing alot of interacting with all kinds of customers. data entry, counting pills, answering phones and taking out trash."
bad,"Don't care about their employees, some of the managers think they know it all, they also look down on you, and the managers are also very rude. I would not recommend this job to people,"
bad,This is the job that really helped me get into the working world. I learned how to be a sales associate here after working for 2 years. Store Manager was very dismissive and toxic. They hours were flexible but many preferred to work the late or afternoon shifts to for the reason of not workign with the manager. Hardest part of the job was really just standing all day and thats it. Other then that you would do regular associate duty's that included being on the register stocking and various other things.
bad,No opportunities for advancement and it seems like everyday there is some new duty to add to your workload. I wish they would pay their management team more specifically assistants because we can’t join union or make close to what the store manager makes.
bad,"Poor performance is legally defined as 'when an employee's behaviour or performance might fall below the required standard'. Dealing with poor performance is, however, a legal minefield. This might explain why some employers tend to confuse poor performance with negligence, incapacity or misconduct."
bad,"Local management was beyond fantastic, corporate was just constantly feeding lines of bull on why you weren't eligible for benefits or why they can't pay you more or how they screwed up the benefits you finally got after 3 years"
bad,"Good opportunity and much to learn."
bad,"I was not a fan of how things were run. The store was very understaffed and we had so many jobs to do some shifts but others we were left standing there doing nothing and told to “find something to do.” It was frustrating for me to be scheduled both weekend days when asked not to. Communication with my"
bad,Great benefits but upper management is not the best because they really don’t take care of there employees but the pay is great and the employees are good to work with
bad,The atmosphere relies heavily on management and the store you work in. The pay is terrible especially compared to other pharmacies. Work is usually relaxed but can get hectic and stressful. Unorganized and good workers are not given any appreciation for their work.
bad,Went thru 3 store managers while I worked there. One was actually stealing from western union. Hectic work environment with little respect from pharmacist. Lots of ream workers from other techs helped alot.
bad,"To be honest, working on liberty ave is a different experience. People would come steal and i would told i can't stop them or do anything so i would to work with that in my head all the time. I would forced to go on my break when I don't want to. I would get 1 break one day and the next day no break and its only one 30 minute break. Working there was okay some staff is really nice and friendly as to others would be rude and not helpful at all. If you have patience to work there then go ahead cause."
bad,low pay and no advancement opertuinty. easy work people are good here. i do enjoy the sedual if they paid more i would have no issues staying at this Job.
bad,Decent hours  three work shifts nice benefits clean environment  smoke free constantly walking nice and friendly staff great training easy to get to from all major highways
bad,The company has been on a decline since i was hired. They have been in debt for years and are constantly adding more programs to try and increase sales but won't spend money on staff. They run on skeleton crews and most employees are overworked and burned out.
bad,"Management was good, when a new manager took over the store, she sat all of the employees down and gave us a list of everything that she witnessed that week, then described how awful our work styles and ethics were, 3 employees turned in their 2 week notice letters later that week."
bad,Favoritism and poor management.  No care about employees working 12 hour days in 106 temps in the sun.  Mandatory overtime in this temperature has new people walking out the door.  No respect to employees that have been there since the doors opened.
bad,Truly do not have anything to comment on other than work security as they have had many years of financial issues. Too many management changes.   . . .
bad,Its not a bad place to work but you dont get paid the money your suppose to with all the work you put in. Sometime you don't get the appreciation that we need as an manger. Over all not a bad place to make money.
bad,"Working in the pharmacy, you encounter many issues that require a specific learned skillset to handle. Much of it is the sort of thing that you have to acquire on the job, between patients with unique issues and insurance companies that need specific things in specific ways. However, after working there for 2 years, I happened to learn that new hires THAT I WAS TRAINING were getting a higher wage just starting out than I was making after being there and learning things that i was now working to pass on to my junior associates. Also, after I upgraded my status to become a registered technician, it took the company about 3 months to actually get me the promised pay raise that came with that. With all the work that I put in there, it doesn't feel fair that I am in such dire straits as I am financially."
bad,"The management at Rite Aid is very unprofessional. There were many times that I had been treated unfairly and bullied and nothing was done about, I had called corporate, HR, the union, and nothing. I DO NOT recommend working here. They just don't care about you."
bad,low pay for techs right around minimum wage.  and then they have to pay for their own license to practice and fingerprinting.  they are out a few hundred dollars to work for minimum wage.  it make zero sense.  the final result is rite aid staff in the pharmacy aren't very happy and are constantly looking for a higher paying  jobs. I would fill 400 plus rx on a typical monday and have about 26 hours of help. good luck doing that for a living and keeping customers safe and happy.
bad,The company is always short people. Coverage of people not coming is horrible. The pay isnt competitive. The co workers arent friendly to customers and to other employees
bad,"The company needs to work on better management skills, proper training, and coworker engagement skills with each other. The job was pretty easy and straight forward. I was pretty confused on exactly how my performance was because there was one supervisor who complained about everything I did but my other managers approved of my performance. Other than that I enjoyed interacting with the customers better than the other employees because they were toxic and just gossiped all the time."
bad,"Working as a Cashier at Rite Aid is an easy job but the salary is only $7.25 an hour, I didn't like the store manager and one of the managers, and the work can be very boring."
bad,It's been nearly 20 years since I've worked for this company so I hope things have changed for the better. It shortly after the chain had bought out payless drugs and things were chaotic then. I don't think my review would be relevant
bad,"Understaffed and overworked. No compensation for the sweat and grief we go through. Penny raises . The one saving grace of this store is the fabulous pharmacy and front end managers. If you like taking abuse from customers and have them rewarded with gift cards then welcome to retail pharmacy. We do have many very kind,sweet, understanding customers, but we are a very busy store. Crazy sometimes. But the abuse we have to take from the other customers whom the world revolves around doesn't make up for the low pay and terrible insurance. Oh, forgot, no breaks..In an 8 hr days, maybe 10 min to eat and go to the bathroom."
bad,Clock in and get straight to work either doing returns that should have been done from morning shift or on the register helping with the line. It helped me to better  communication skills with all different people. Wasn't the safest environment but security definitely did their jobs. The management could have been better. Hardest part of the job was trying to keep a calm head with customers who yell and scream at you.
bad,"I was there for 2 years and it took me 6 months to finally get my medical and when they hired me, I was told that I'd be sent to school for Pharmacy Technician which then was taken away."
bad,"Some stores are great to work at, others are a nightmare. Corporate management seems to treat you well, but when it comes to store managers you're taking a risk. "
bad,"Great staff,awesome place to to start working with the the public, rite aid has a few ups an downs but fairly ok place for maybe a student or someone in need of work"
bad,Rude customers and sometimes management. long work days are completed with unfair hourly pay rate. a starter job and not a place to work for those seeking a career.
bad,"Customer service, stock, security of store, I learned managerial positions. Different work cultures. Unloading of truck, it was always stressful, unorganized, chaotic. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
bad,"No communication daily, you will not know your expectations for production, which you are expected to meet."
bad,"Each day each person usually stuck to the same routine. "
bad,i work in rite aid store as a cashier.i feel so good deeling with customers of any type.there was a good management and i was so helpful.i learnd a lot about customer service
bad,"Rite Aid is a company that demands a hard worker to take charge and complete the numerous tasks that needs to be completed daily and weekly. We complete daily tasks such as keeping an accurate account of large amounts of currency, invoices, recalled products, price changes, inventory management, payroll, and overall store appearance. "
bad,"Needs more help"
bad,the people I worked with made it comfortable for me to stay there and worked with me by helping me out a lot. I learned a lot from them
bad,"The Pharmacist manager made several offensive remarks in regards to customers receiving medication on State Medical benefits. I myself am a single mother, whom depends on state medical for assistance. The environment was uncomfortable and not a good fit for me."
bad,"The culture at Rite Aid to Overly Profit driven, not enough care towards stake holders.  The employees are treated poorly on a daily basis."
bad,"A typical day at Rite Aid pharmacy consisted of typing prescriptions and filling medications, also interacting with customers and providing quality customer service."
bad,"Temps treated poorly: Expected to perform as much/better than employers for several months, just to POSSIBLY be hired"
bad,"The most enjoyable part was to constantly learn with the company to make you a stronger independent employee."
bad,This is a good place to work if your looking for a part time job. Moving up in the company is difficult and the job doesn't offer to many challenges so the day can drag at times.
bad,Everyday at work is a new learning experience and two days are never the same.
bad,"A Typical Day At Work Is Me Coming In and Working Behind The Register And Anwswering Phones Or On The Floor Switching Labels And Shelving Stock. I Learned What It's Like To Work In Retail, How To Interact With Customers And Be More Responsible As Far As Keeping The Store Clean, Changing The Newspapers, Making Sure The Store Is Clear When Time For Close, Closing The Windows And Locking The Doors. The Management Is Good, The Store Is Run Well Everyone Gets Along. My Co-Workers Are Good All Female But They Older. 50+ Age. The Hardest Part Of The Is The Amount Of Things Im Doing. All My Co-Workers Are Much Older So What They Can Do Is Limited. The Most Enjoyable Part Of The Job Is Interacting With The Customers Definately."
bad,Love my coworkers and front store staff but district and corporate could use better communication skills and to be more in touch with those helping to run the company that results in its profits
bad,"To many higher up problems, employee's treated badly."
bad,The upper level management should be required to take leadership training. Their ability for conflict resolution was not that of a corporate level. Definitely would be beneficial for company morale.
bad,Rite Aid was a minimum wage retail job that I would not recommend. I worked there as a minor and breaks were optional. Management was fair with the shift supervisors but not so much with the SM. Employees would shop a fair amount during their shiftz
bad,If you come to work on time and try your hardest they will throw the whole work load on you................ ................................    ......
bad,This place is horrible to work at! Managers sneaking around and spying on you. Cashiers acting like their your boss. Managers picking favorites. Messing up your schedule.. no time and a half for working holidays btw you only get a few hours for holiday pay.
bad,"Rite Aid needs to be more considerate towards its loyal and hard working integral employees and stop transferring/hiring nonproductive problem causing employees to productive stores.. This Company's values have changed drastically, it is appalling. A lot of horseplay with minimal work performance and the tasks they don't complete get pawned onto others and the ones taking up the tasks with their own to do tasks are the ones being disciplined.  The romancing between coworkers (unbelievabley unprofessional) and against company policy, people have been termed because of these individuals. Employee feedback Surveys are conducted by corporate  to better the company's employees experience in the store.  Of which unfortunately you can't get the proper experience when working with poor management... Why even bother with these surveys when they are not going to be followed through."
bad,The mangers don’t care about you and they talk to you like your 7 years old and on top of that you don’t get 40 hours very disrespectful management and they try to embarrass you infront of other people because they have better pay
bad,Personally disliked rite aid. Their HR isn’t very good and the store managers they hire aren’t the best. Rite should do better backgrounds checks on employees including Managers and better training.
bad,You work long 12 hour shifts and have little support help to keep up with the workflow. They had good computer system to help with the work flow. Some stores can be very busy
bad,"Working in Rite Aid is the most stressful job I've ever worked. I love the people I work with. We click & we have our moments but to me it's our second family being together 40 hours out of the week. But for the amount of work the Techs do at Rite Aid, we do not get paid enough. Without the Techs, the pharmacists would be lost."
bad,As a float pharmacist I met many employees who were amazing and many did their job well. Overall Rite Aid just seemed disorganized and the job got stressful due to lack of help in the pharmacy and not a good work flow.
bad,"good place to work, with lots of learning opportunities. don't get on the bad side of your co workers though. they will try to get you fired if you are disliked."
bad,the company has work/life balance issues no flexibility with work schedules.  the stores are understaffed with heavy demand.  Management show no compassion for its workers
bad,"stood snd worked 8+ hours and barely gor a break, i worked there for 8 years and never got any vacation days, benefits or advancements within the company"
bad,"low pay, the job and the people are great but the pay is too low. They require too much work and qualifications but not willing to give a raise or overtime"
bad,"The hardest part of the job, is keeping up with the pace of the job. Multi tasking is a must. Coworkers are friendly and caring. "
bad,Rite Aid is a good Job to have and to learn all steps to provide great Customer Service at any Job. In a 8 years I have grown and learned so much about myself and the Company.
bad,"Rite Aid's ok for a temporary job, but it wears on you over time.The poor corporate management, lack of necessary support. Typical overworked, underpaid minimum wage job."
bad,"extremely busy , but always got the job done . you need to have patients for this job due to some rude customers and hold your mood steady . most fun part is lifting heavy things."
bad,A typical day working for Rite Aid felt to be understaffed often. I enjoyed the people I worked with. In the pharmacy I reached my max potential for this company. I moved to another company doing the same line of work with increased compensation and benefits.
bad,Co-managers and supervisors are typically easy to work with. The store manager was the WORST. Did not treat me like a human but only a worker. Scheduled me only on overnights after I told him many times that they got in the way of my school and personal lift.
bad,Most coworkers are nice. The DM is horrible. They talk  to the managers like they aren't worth anything. If they don't like you they'll find a reason to fire you. I would always go to work feeling on edge. It's very stressful.
bad,"This job gave me self gratification, I loved to work with the public. I gained a lot of knowledge on this job. The work was great. Working with people that didn't care about others as much as I did, made this job hard to deal with other employees."
bad,"I started working as a relief Pharmacist going to different areas in town and that was the hardest thing in the job, dealing"
bad,"While I've managed to learn a vast amount of necessary skills at Rite Aid, they do not compensate their workers. I had to fight for a lower raise than I deserved. There is no room to advance or hold a full-time position that will be able to support a family."
bad,This place tests you customer service skills. Just need to offer a larger starting hourly pay and should give differencials starting after 10pm-6am.
bad,"Cash registers will always brake down. Also the A/C in the store and so the customers will start complaining. Tough time serving ice cream to customers. Management takes advantage of the part timers, they over work them. Their work schedules aren't stable, they change it every week and so the employers get very upset specially when they work holidays and weekends constantly with no breaks. And nobody is assigned to do one thing in the store, everyone gets switched around. Your title will be cashier, but they might be put you to serve ice cream. Not Fair."
bad,"Rite Aid is a horrible place to work.  They are the lowest paying pharmacy in the area.  CVS and Walgreens supervisors make $12/hr and Rite Aid starts you off at $9/hr.  It's pretty bad when your store manager tells you that you deserve a raise for your hard work but her hands are tied!  I do have to say that my boss has her good points.  Very flexible and willing to give you time off when you need it.  But, the communication in the store overall was pretty awful.  Disrespect was tolerated and not disciplined."
bad,I worked for the company for 8 years. Starting at Brooks pharmacy was great and what seemed like a giant family. Rite aid is very business forward. customer service did not seem to matter as much as money unfortunately. Management looks at their employees as a number.
bad,Store manager for years moving from store to store with no chance of advancement. Ten to 12 hour days weekends evenings holidays and Late nights.
bad,"This was my first employment in the retail industry and was a fine starting point. They were having their problems, legal, and the people there were long standing and dedicated."
bad,"The supervisor that interviewed me was nice, but the one that was working regular hours was one nasty women! She didn't know how to talk to anyone but the other supervisor, we all spoke about her problem and nothing happened."
bad,Easy job and I learned alot about retail. I've had all types of managers from good to bad.My coworkers were pretty cool to never had a problem. The hardest part of the job is meeting deadlines and costumers. The most enjoyable part of the job is your regular costumers who become family.
bad,"There was always something to do, there was times when there was nothing to do and you can find something to keep you busy. I enjoyed working there and I enjoy working in general no matter where I work "
bad,"I clock in to work, ask associates about any strange activity . The associate will willingly tell me any suspicious activity in the store. I review it on the camera and investigate it. Them I go on the floor and spy on shoplifters."
bad,this job was a hard working place to work at we would always be moving and lifting heavy stuff everyday i think that was the hardest thing about the job was lifting every second.
bad,Compensation was very good with lots of overtime.  Upper management extremely poor. Not a very well run organization.
bad,Needed money so I got a job as a cashier.  Lots of management changes and turnovers. not a great sign of a strong company.
bad,"•	Trained new Associates and managed the store inventory with the nighttime shift Supervisor."
bad,Easy work but a lot of busy work truck days and hanging sales tags are not fun! I was an assistant manager and made $8.50 per hour!
bad,"NO MONEY! THEY LIE!!!!"
bad,"The day will start with turning on all equipment counting registers/safe, pulling back stock and POS outs, completing zero counts. THEN you unlock the doors. You might have an associate at that time to help run registers or you or possibly your on your own until 10:00. The pharmacy techs are there but they have their own job to do. there are general four or five people to run a store. Theft is high so don't get hurt trying to fix that problem. "
bad,"While all the people I work with in store are personable and friendly to work with, corporate often makes this job less than satisfying.  As a pharmacy tech your expected to pretty much run the entire pharmacy from register to drop off and filling prescriptions all at the same time. Everything is expected to be done in a timely manner only to recieve minimum wage, no extra holiday pay when working the holidays, and lack of decent benefits. The pharmacy is often understaffed due to the lack of hours allowed to be scheduled due to corporate policies and while your allowed to take lunch breaks there is often no time to take the breaks."
bad,"I have been working for Rite Aid for almost 6 years. I like the environment of the workplace, but not the benefits. I thought that in time my benefits would increase, but they have only been decreased."
bad,"Wasn't too thrilled with my position, but it was a job. I left the company because I couldn't get the hours I needed and the pay was not great."
bad,"This company has so much potential but falls short due to its managment structure. The company has no true training program for its associates and therefore when positions open that are higher than entry level they hire from outside rather than promote from within. They usually start entry positions near minimum wage and give 2 to 3% raises yearly meaning someone would have to work with them for 4 to 5 years to simply gain a $1 an hour raise. No raise exceptions outside the annual review. The company does treat its customers very well, but likes to nickel and dime associates with pay cuts, etc."
bad,"Working for this employer has taught me alot. Most of the associates are friendly and hardworking. The job is fast paced and alot is expected. Often felt overworked, but overall it wasn't a bad experience"
bad,"I currently work here, it is a fast paced environment where there is constant work and at times not enough technicians. Also, starting pay is very minimal."
bad,"It is a very busy store, mostly due to the Canadian border crossing,it is very fast paced and I enjoy staying productive and busy. But when short staffed it can be challenging to find reliable employees all the way up here."
bad,The hours were always being cut from the people who needed them most. I was a college student who needed the money to pay for groceries and any school items that I may have needed. I always had to ask my brother or father for a little bit of extra cash because my job couldn't give me the hours I asked for.
bad,I left because I was being paid 9.38 an hour as a full time supervisor. There are cashiers that make more than that at other company's and upper management was unwilling to raise my pay.
bad,I don’t want to write a review. And I have to write something with 150 characters to continue on to the next step of creating an account. I’m at the p
bad,The management team would ignore problems constantly and lots of people working their would not meet their minimum picks per minute and nothing was done about yet it they still complained
bad,If you are an experienced technician I would not recommend this job. If you are looking to start off it would be a great job to gain experience for a new job.
bad,"I loved my co-workers and my customers but working for Rite Aid's non-union store often felt like a dead end. Like working for most corporations I mostly felt like I was used and abused, like I was just a dime a dozen nobody at the bottom of the pole."
bad,Hectic and stressful workplace that doesn't look out a lot after the employees as long as the corporate numbers are running right. No motivation for the employees.
bad,"All the workers were nice. There may have been a few that were not so nice. 98% were amazing."
bad,"Fast pace always something to do but long solitary times with short breaks and short lunches, must be a goal setter or will fall behind in company demands"
bad,Wasn't the type of job I could make any money there we never had any set hours u never know what time u are getting off and the pay wasn't what I was looking for so I stayed until I got my wedding situated
bad,"In the two years i was with this company i was not treated very fairly. there was a large number of broken or false promises regarding hours worked, promotions and raises."
bad,Besides the fact of this i'd still be working there and i'd be happy but because of that issue i was released from my duties with that company but overall still good people and a great company to work for.
bad,"Company stretches pharmacists beyond reasonable performance standards, potentially compromising safety, in the process of filling prescriptions.  Field leaders have way too many direct reports to be able to spend quality time developing their teams."
bad,"Fast paced job.  Learned a great deal.  Staff was very friendly and easy to work with.  Although busy,  the staff made the day bearable. Worked well as a team to get the job done."
bad,management teams are fine. wage is to low to accommodate cost of living. can be stressful at time. health benefits not great for non-union employees. diverse
bad,The job itself was easy and decent. The pay was not the greatest(8.50) especially when they expected you to run the whole store yourself. The manager at the defiance store was rude and inconsiderate of others. He would roll his eyes and give off bad body language towards customers.
bad,"The night crew is always under staffed so you are constantly over worked. Despite getting a good pay and good benefits, people are constantly quitting. The management is very poor and they cut a lot of corners. Especially when training new employees. I've worked there for almost two years and I'm still not fully trained. Management claims they treat their employees fairly but they don't. They pick on certain employees, constantly giving them tougher tasks and/or grunt work, despite being trained for higher and better responsibilities. The best part of the job is leaving in the morning. That thought is what gets me through the night."
bad,Lot of responsibility for a shift supervisor and don't get paid well at all! People was great to work with just not a lot of hours available and the pay was horrible
bad,"Rite Aid has very few benefits if any for working there, while the managers and coworkers are often great people you will get along with. The higher ups such as regional managers are often there and can be rather rude and set unrealistic ""goals"" for your team. Avoid working here if you can."
bad,"Rite Aid was a very uptight place to work. It was not comfortable for me to go to work every day, knowing that I would most-likely never make more than $9.00/hr. there."
bad,"A typical day at work just cleaning an helping customers"
bad,"Worked overnight, annoying customers, even more annoying manager. Times when I was the only person working the entire store and had to work the register and stock the floor simultaneously."
bad,while working at rite aid I thought that it was relaxed in terms of time to do things. I felt like the corporate officers were not very good at their job at the time
bad,I was harassed by a coworker and corporate and my manager didn’t take it seriously at all. I continued to be harassed till I had to leave it was sad. It was an amazing experience with the exception of that.
bad,Low pay to start with even if you have a license. hours are low and not consistent. Hard to get a raise even if you work hard and go above what is required.
bad,A good entry level company that teaches you the basics of retail and management. Management is quick to promote individuals that once you show you're dedicated to your job . Communication between upper management is poor and they require you to work long hours with very few breaks
bad,"My direct manager was great.  Upper management, not so much.  She was a tyrant.  She had no concept of people skills.  She did not understand that working on broken bones was not optimal.  Her attitude was ""do your job or leave"".  She thought that rewarding a customer's bad behavior was more important than the safety/sanity of her employees."
bad,Hard job to please management.  They did not support pharmacist in charge.  workplace was very stressful due to issues with staff.  I enjoyed interaction with customers.
bad,I was able to get to know by name about 30percent of My customers many would only let me help them when I was working. Work for manager is stressful A.D. they do not get paid well.
bad,great job and great people.. they work as a team and everyone get alone... about to turn into walgreens but hopefully everything is still good over there
bad,This job was highly stressful. There is something about working for a corporate company that is not fun. This job was very stressful due to all of the politics that takes place in this company
bad,"Reports directly to Loss Prevention Manager"
bad,Rite aid is a cool place to work at for a person that's on the hustle to get extra money to pay bills the lack of hours sometimes is the only problem and salary
bad,"Customers are rude, pay is unfair, DM is rude. Everyone that I worked with made a significantly higher hourly wage than myself and I had worked there longer than most of the people who made more than me."
bad,"As this position was merely part-time, and from years ago, it is difficult to write an accurate review. As many retail positions are, a Rite Aid Associate was required to be friendly, efficient, and varying levels of patient with customers. One of the more difficult aspects of the job were inconsistent hours--weekly hours ranged from approximately 15 to 35 hours--and properly resuming job duties, as they were often short-staffed."
bad,Constantly busy never a dull moment   Good environment. Always finding something to do. If you want something to eat or drink there is good places nearby
bad,Rite aid was hard to work for. It was a really long time ago so I can't say if they have improved or not. They very well could have. I might check them out again sometime
bad,very limited growth opportunity. If you're not a pharmacist or store manager you will be stagnant. there is no room to grow.  don't expect to get any decent raise.
bad,This was my first job out of high school and being in the position of an Assistant Manager has prepared me to handle any situation that might arise in the customer service/hospitality field.
bad,Employees are good to work with. The work is easy and not difficult at all. the manager is excellent and easy to work with. The best part of the job is getting to work with and deal with the customers.
bad,i would go into work. and if its a slow day the manger would task me out to do things as if i was a store associate and take me away from the floor to actually watch people.
bad,"In the 3years I worked their the store had 5 different managers who all followed different ""company policies"" .  No one will train you. You will learn as you go. Major responsibilities as soon as you start, even though you haven't been taught much. Opening and closing procedure, that's it."
bad,"I always enjoyed coming into work because not only were our patients lovely, but our employees were just as nice. Everyone always had a smile on their face!"
bad,a very great company to work.. very great employers...   a very great workplace .. we work hard together as a team.. I enjoy working for them. i love my coworkers
bad,"My overall experience working for Rite Aid has been unpleasant. There is an excess of politics, senseless directives, and corporate buffoonery from the district level upwards--unlike what is typically experienced at store level. After fifteen years, five different stores, and moving from front end associate at the cash register to shift supervisor (all union positions), I was adamant about never becoming management due to the thoughtless treatment of employees. The corporate dictum that spares the payroll to spoil the earnings helps absolutely nothing at store level, engenders an uncomfortable work environment with little to no help, heightens anxiety, and dulls the productive spirit."
bad,"The customers were my favorite part of the job. Rite aid carries a wide variety of items and are coupon friendly. A typical day of work involves putting up truck, plan o grams, rearranging merchandise, and ringing up customers."
bad,Gaining skills to move forward in my pharmacy career. I love being a Pharmacy Tech. I love helping people and working in the pharmacy environment.
bad,"Depending on the store's location, you could get a great supervisor or you could get one who really doesn't want to be there and couldn't care less about the associates that work for them."
bad,Average place to work.Little payroll to work with  for the main part of the store but most of the customer service and sales come from the Pharmacy so the front end of the store is not as busy.
bad,"good place to work , a lot of overtime but when the business go down they layoff people. doesn't matter if you are many years there"
bad,Management was not friendly. My co-workers were not pleasant to work with.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers.
bad,The work schedule was great you was set on a time and usually that's when you worked all week. I loved working with the co workers and everyone got along. It wasn't long hours. I worked with children.
bad,"Friendly group of staff, thorough training, ability to work at multiple stores if needed, ease of scheduling, know what to expect every time you walk through the door."
bad,I enjoyed working with my co-workers but my customers are the ones that made my day. Enjoyed seeing them and helping them. Since I was there for quite sometime I got to see their family grow.
bad,"rite aid is a great company. good benefits and 401k. Union available as well."
bad,"I dont like that they make employees work in 110 degree weather without any breaks too get water. Decent place too work , but they need better managers."
bad,"My schedule is currently 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. I sometimes work twelve hour shifts. The 7 a.m. person sets the pharmacy's day ahead. Once I  get settled at work, the first thing I do is to see what needs attention the most. On top of all the inside work, patients come up to pay for their prescriptions, drop a prescription off, ask about insurance information, ask for guidance on where inventory is in the store, and even down to personal questions. Coming from a high volume pharmacy, multitasking and working efficiently at the same time are key. We fill anywhere from 300 prescriptions to 500 prescriptions, however numbers aren't the only thing to take into consideration when it comes to a fast paced environment. We could have a good easy day, and fill 500 prescriptions with no problems, or then on the opposite end of the spectrum my team and I could fill 200 prescriptions and have to call the insurance on more than half of them and get behind on my work very easily. Time management is so important, because one bad fifteen minutes can cause a set back. With saying that, that is why I make sure everything is up to par so when a busy fifteen minutes happens, we as a whole can make up for time lost. Our team at in the pharmacy works so well together under any condition we are given; but it has taken a while to get there and for everyone to learn their role and improve and perfect on that daily."
bad,Rite Aid has a tendency to be enamoured with the recent press clippings generated by the financial district as well they should be. The financial turnaround they have managed is impressive. However they have failed to execute on their stated objective of making sure their associates are happy. The district I have been employed at has been a virtual revolving door as it pertains to the management staff of the 12 stores that make up the district
bad,"The company itself has good direction and intentions but the district teams do not care about their stores as they should, if they did I feel they would be a lot more successful as a whole."
bad,I honestly don't have anything good to say about this company.
bad,"-	Delegated and helped perform daily tasks with employees."
bad,Worked there for about 6 months and that was all I could take. Management team not very nice at all.
bad,"Working as a cashier in an environment such as Rite Aid was one of the most boring and monotonous jobs I've ever done. Although I liked the interaction with customers, management was a bit iffy at times. I enjoy a job where I can help people or make people smile, and I did get to implement this into my experience at rite aid, but I would have liked a happier environment."
bad,you live in your store!  Not ideal for a young mother.  You will never see your family.
bad,Provide customer service at the cash register as well as the sales floor.
bad,The typical day at work when I worked at Rite Aid was I did everything under the sun. I worked seven days a week to keep the store afloat. I recieved no assistance from corporate office or my District Manager.
bad,Wellness Ambassador.  Promoted sales of over the counter medications and flu vaccines.  Enjoyed working with customers.  Learned about health and medicine.
bad,"My daily task for work are backroom pull sheet and freshness... The backroom pull consist of a sheet that has items that we have overstock and when that item sales and we have extra in the backroom we pull it and fill the shelf. Freshness is a date system where we enter the expiration date of makeup, food items, medicine and etc. And when it comes to date we pull it and then scan it out if the system as damage."
bad,A job that can open doors for you and take you furthur in the business.
bad,"I would not recomend anyone work for Rite Aid, ever. The work at Rite Aid was not bad nor challenging therefore I cannot complain about it. I did not learn anything from this company except the hard lessons in life that you should get everything in writing before you make an agreement. Management see you as replaceable and do not listen to or acknowledge and issues you may have. Co workers were ok. The hardest part of the job was getting through the day without making managment angry for not being in 10 different places at once. The most enjoyable part of the day was leaving."
bad,"it was an okay job in the beginning, after a month past everything was getting crazy. the job was under stuffed i was stuck at the counter for long periods of time every day"
bad,"I have learned that If you do not plan on becoming a Pharmacist in a retail setting. Then, your growth potential is limited."
bad,Could use some improvement but from leadership but wonderful staff and fantastic customers.
bad,"Relaxing, learned a lot of drugs, great place to work, nothing hard bout the job"
bad,"A typical day of work is running around helping customers, coworkers, stocking shelves, counting money and the like. "
bad,"While working for Rite Aid I was given the opportunity to work as a pharmacy technician.  I learned a tremendous amount about prescriptions, several drugs, and how to handle customers who are less than thrilled to be interacting with you since most were sick.  I had an amazing mentor in the pharmacy, one of the part time pharmacists was more kind, patient and knowledgeable than I could ever have hoped.  He took the time to explain different medications to me, what they were for and any side effects that may occur.  He was an incredible teacher and I will never forget him.  The hardest part of this job was learning to handle grumpy customers in the most delicate way possible and ensuring that they got everything they needed as quickly as possible.  The most enjoyable part of this job was working and learning in the pharmacy."
bad,I caught on to everything the managers taught me fast. Two of the managers were very helpful and took the time out to make sure I was on track. I liked working here because I love interacting with people and making sure they're satisfied. 
bad,"I worked at 3 different Rite Aid locations. And, I quickly learned that they all had one thing in common.... They don't care for their employees. The break room, bathrooms, and back rooms are filthy! I'm so grateful to have moved on."
bad,My career at Rite Aid has been a leaning experience.It has shown me what i can expect in retail Pharmacy.
bad,"Interesting people, enjoyable work enviorment co. Car.Travel to various locations."
bad,"A typical day at work would be helping customers, handling different forms of payment, and a little light cleaning."
bad,I would like to maybe one day work for Rite Aid again just not the one I have previously worked at. I made some wonderful friends there and will continue to shop there.
bad,Dealing with coworkers. I learned to have patience. Very Disresepectful Manager. Didnt get along with coworkers. The best part was the fulfillment of working.
bad,fast paced
bad,"Only worked with one rite aid, the experience differs from store to store. I believe your experience can be positive depending on the manager and coworkers you have."
bad,Maybe it was me not being totally hapy with the position but the grind of getting up everyday to go to work began to weigh me down. Getting up going into work knowing my career was going nowhere was taxing after a couple months and was happy to get out of that rut by moving on to another opportunity.
bad,I tried to get more hours from a year and some change being in the company and I was told okay and I never received it in the case I was being told I doing a great job well enough to receive it do to hard work and that’s the reason I truly left and management where nice but very in caring about the job being more intensely pressure for workers to work for there hours
bad,Rite Aid was fun I enjoyed working with customers. Everyone was helpfull with my training. I opened and closed registers. I served ice cream. I smiled and greeted customers.
bad,Rite Aid is like a family. We have a very nice customers and our employees are friendly and helpful. Duties are written down daily  so we know what we must get done that day.
bad,A typical day included all kinds of customers and management that did not do their jobs well. You were treated unfairly and there was favoritisms that occurred.
bad,"We are not supported by the uppermanagement at any point in time. The customers curse at us and threaten us and insult us and we are supposed to call and apologize to them. We are not allowed to refuse service to anyone, even one of the aforementioned people."
bad,Working at rite aid wasnt so bad. It is for sure very stressful to deal with patients problems and concerns. It was a daily routine based. Rite aid itself is great. Management was great and organized.
bad,Working a rite aid has given me a lot experiences in management and leadership skills. It is a great first job but nothing further you learn everything within the first 6 months of working
bad,The people there are great but because management is so strict the environment feels bland and hours feel long. It's an ok job but not one you should stay at for a long time.
bad,A typical day at work is always a good one for me because I always make the best of my day. Everyday I learn new ways to deal with customers. My co workers are great I really get along well with all of them. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep my cool when I am addressed but such nasty customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is pleasing the customers.
bad,I worked for Rite Aid for 5 years and learned so much during my time there. I very much enjoyed the customers and pharmacy team.
bad,"Duties include new employee training, customer assistance, telephone inquires, item stocking, and customer sales."
bad,I loved this job while i was pregnant BUT there wasn't any stability when i was done on maternity leave. i was given a 12 hour a week job  30 mins away from my home.
bad,"It was my first real job, and it was my time to go. The company was not a good fit for me since I my career plan involved other things such as video and photography."
bad,"I liked the people I worked with at Rite Aid. Corporate wasn't very helpful. The job was stressful, over worked, under paid, and short handed. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at Rite Aid/."
bad,"My overall experience with Rite Aid was fair. I worked there for a little over 2 years. The management was always the best part about coming to work. Unfortunately, I couldn't advance in the store."
bad,"I enjoyed working there while I was there for 2 years. Nice people and good customers. Easy working environment. Good place to get started off working in the pharmacy business, in my opinion."
bad,its a good place to work but pay is horrible and management care less about ur welfare moreso the benefit is affordable to an extent
bad,"I will state that my District Manager always was great to me. However, the feeling I got from all other upper management was very negative. Maybe I was just spoiled by my time at Toys R Us."
bad,"A typical work day was rather involved but, but very enjoyable to be a part of everyday. I learned how to work independently, quickly  and accurately. Management was how should I say the main sticking point with this job. My immediate supervisor was a figure head that was put into her job because she was at the right  p lace at the right time. Her boss or the returns manager who was involved with a higher up manager within the company; slept her way into her position etc. So, you can see what I'm saying here and that is it."
bad,"Back in 1997, started as cashier which was fine, there is a big turnover of management so you never know what you’re going to get.  You have to adjust accordingly. Overall it was great to work there. But right now it is very stressful with the district leader that we have. She is very demanding without knowing really  how far behind we are. There is so many hours in the day and we don’t have a great crew ."
bad,"is good place to work and a ok pay but the people make it bad and some of the manager are unfair. Also, manager and lead favors people. I wouldn't go back there unless I'm really desperate and need it."
bad,"Rite Aid is a great company with awesome compensation/benefits and room for advancement but they want you to work all the time, sometimes overtime and are always short staffed. Weekends, nights and holidays are a must. Rite aid is open 365 days a year. they only hire part time but you work full time hours and there is hardly ever anyone to cover a shift in you call in sick."
bad,"youll be doing alot of work, and still get paid min, customers are always rude the ucla students are a pain to deal with when they buy booze"
bad,Not a hard job at all. Customers are enjoyable. Hardest part is moving fast to get work done that has to be done within a certain amount of time. I've learned you can please everyone so do the best you can without breaking rules
bad,The hardest part of the job was only working four hours a week. I'm unsure as to why this was my schedule because I was available five days a week. A typical day at work consisted of putting away truck and filling prescriptions. All of my coworkers were very nice and kind hearted. The most enjoyable part of my job was how quick the work day went by.
bad,"The typical work day at rite aid is busy, we are one of the busiest pharmacy in town. Sometimes we process over 300 rx's a day. The co-workers are nice, known some of there for a very long time. The most enjoyable about the job is knowing that you gave your all to make sure that the customer get there medication."
bad,I enjoyed working at Rite Aid. Overall a good company to work for.  I started as a picker then within weeks I became a trainer.  At times I felt as some of the managers and team leads were unfair at times and showed certain people different attention.
bad,"Assistant Manager"
bad,• Initially began as a customer
bad,I loved my job at Rite aid the only thing was that they closed my store and I had to be demoted 3 levels to a Walgreens which was not fair. Yes they gave me a job but very hard to move up again. Had to start over.
bad,Pharmacist since day one put trust in me so I learned a great deal.  I learned how to interact with insurance companies and doctors offices.   Hardest part of the job is not having efficient staff.  Pay was not efficient.
bad,"they try to promote within however, most of the time the higher up positions go to people who have never worked there or are filled by people who have worked for the company for 30 or more years."
bad,"Working at Rite Aid is very nice when you first start. Your work is always valued from your superiors, and there is always the chance to move up in your position. Management can be unpredictable, depending on the store will depend on how management will go. Hardest part would be dealing with rude customers. Enjoyable would be helping the kind customers find exactly what they need in the store."
bad,It's a cool place.  The manager always does his best to work with your schedule.  He is very understanding.  The workers are a team and we work together to get the job done.
bad,The company allows and promote within its ranks. Does not discriminate and there is is union for all employees which protect employee against any unfair treatment.
bad,i open the store and give good customer service and make your the store is cean and ready for customers and I make sure money is good and everything works good. I also make sure freshness'is done to make sure we don't sale bad items to our customers.
bad,Love the Staff. Customers are great but not so good location. We need more loss prevention for theft. Overall a great place to work and very friendly.
good,Liked the job it just ended company is going under so the job ended and we were told Walgreens would employee us but that was not true. The hours were horrible.
good,"Cashiers in the Philadelphia area are only paid $7.35"
good,"No thank you looking for advancement "
good,its a good job to have while you are completing school but not for a career wouldn't advise it the simple slow paced for some is good but for a person like me its just not sutable
good,"The manager does not train you, i got yelled at the first day for not knowing when to take my second break, the manager was rude when i spoke to her concerning her yelling at me. Need to hire professional managers, she does not have self control and barely speaks english, interrupted me always when i spoke to her. The staff can be rude, they gossip all the time. Customers can be ghetto, so it's hard to work with, security sucks as well at doing their job. Several people walked out with merchandise."
good,"A lot of work but a lot of hands on experience in a health care setting. I've learned so much about pharmacy working here, even some pharmacist work which I'm currently enrolled in a pharmacy program to graduate to be a pharmacist. Work here is you want experience."
good,Good  place to work for a young adult With no responsibility or kids. Hard to move up in the company but if you have a full time job it's it will be a great part time
good,"weak management team"
good,I  enjoyed meeting new people. I didn't like the pay rate or the hour pre week that I was given. There was no room for advancement.
good,management has no idea of the reality in pharmacy day to day life. Most policies make no sense and make the working for company worse. feels like upper management haven't seen the inside of the pharmacy in years
good,The Management picked their favorites. If they didn't like you then they would find something to write you up for. It's like a revolving door there with employees. I was happy to leave there.  Employees were over worked and didn't really care if you got hurt on the job.
good,"Had fun while working there as a beauty advisor. Too much work for one person.  Was ok while it lasted. The job title carried  way more than expected...I basically ran the whole beauty area myself. Hours are long. Standing all day, always running to help everyone. Ringing up customers.  Event participation in donations  toward juvenile  diabetes. Creating  fund raisers."
good,"Long hours with a competitive atmosphere in the work place. Poor management with excessive micromanaging constantly stifling growth"
good,It was a decent enough place for a first job. Pharmacy was understaffed and issues that arose that needed PDM to step in resulted in disappointment. Company sent green pharmacists to work in a store that did 400-600 a day with a staff that needed a good foundation in order to keep everything in working order. Raises were your typical .2% and not at all worth the time and effort that most of the staff put into their daily tasks.
good,"Usually busy on weekends or rush hour. Learned how to use the cashier, freshness, damages, and face. Nothing really hard about the job. Enjoyed assisting customers."
good,"They do not care about employees only the business. When vital equipment breaks, you just have to suck it up because it will not be fixed or will be fixed improperly. Employee compensation is one of the lowest. They do not offer advancement or raises  for advancement."
good,I worked there for a few years and only received a raise once because they had a freeze on raises and that was only because I took a Supervisor position. And that raise was not much for the added responsibility.
good,"Privilage people, bad management comunicación toó. Its full Of unpredictable people. Weird coworkers. Easy work. Need to inprove management and concentrare un customers un many ways."
good,"Managers seemed to choose favorites, worked under stressful conditions but offered great hours ad easy going co-workers. liked the over-time. fixed hours."
good,"I don't like retail because of customers with horrible attitudes, under paid and thieves poor health coverage only a week vacation I was there for 6 years"
good,Still just unpleasant and not enough attention to detail. Also very comfortable with underpaying employees and overworking them. Customers have too much influence on how the job is done.
good,"I enjoyed working with Rite Aid and our team was really good.  However, the store level employees were paid absolutely the minimum possible.  It was disheartening to hear about the salaries being paid even entry level employees at the corporate offices and to realize that there was no respect or consideration given to the store level employees.  Most companies realize that the employees at the store level are the ones in touch with the customers, their morale and attitude either make or break a corporation.  Rite Aid is upside down.  It is all about the corporate structure.  Because of the poor wages, Rite Aid employees tend to turn over frequently whenever they find a job that will pay their bills.  Morale is terrible and the work is the same at Rite Aid at $7.60 an hour as it is at Walmart at $11 an hour.  Leaves the pool of employees pretty empty of good workers.  Stores run on a skeleton crew and managers are hog tied about being able to flex schedules for employees needs."
good,Some of the employees are nice to work with. heavy work flow no down time which I like. Some of the costumers where hard to get along with but I enjoyed working with these employees.
good,"making up prescription labels per approval of pharmacist while working effectively in a timely manner to deliver prescriptions on time. "
good,This is a very fast paced environment. Good co-workers and nice customers.
good,"It was a temp job and was not a good job."
good,The manager smoked and did not consider that their were women including myself that worked there that were pregnant. he would smoke inside the store and in his office even after he was told do not smoke inside the building but refused to.
good,"Don’t do it, it is not for anyone looking to make a career for themselves. Unfair practices throughout the entire staff. Basically overworked and underpaid."
good,Working at Rite Aid was an eye opening experience. I had no idea that customers think they are always right and loss there temper at the first person they saw. I also didn't realize how bad the prescription problem was.  I am glad I had the opportunity to work there.
good,I was a supervisor hired in. Store manager allowed another sup to make schedule which she gave herself open-3pm off every weekend or 1 weekend day... After 6 months I asked if I could alter my schedule some to the store manager (closing every night) since I was going to go back to school. She told me I would make more money working at rite aid than I would working in the medical field. I turned in my Keys the next day.
good,The upper management in the district I worked in was absolutely degrading to employees. This is a great place to get certified as a pharmacy technician and MOVE ON to bigger and better things!
good,The management team is terrible at my location. The work here at Rite Aid is repetitive. Training to move up in the company isn’t present. The only form of training is if your manager decides to show you how to complete a job. CBT’s are workshops online that everyone has to complete to know about policies and rules in Rite Aid. At my location the store isn’t reaching it’s full potential. We aren’t meeting profit margins because of the store management present. The only time the store manager attempts to have a meeting is if corporate management is threatening his job.
good,The job itself was ok but the manager at the time was particular about who she worked with with at that time . Later on she was terminated I had already left for another job. If I could stand 7 hrs straight I would go cmback but I can’t stand all of those hours anymore.
good,"I was making a far lower wage than my male counter parts as well as receiving less in my raises and getting stellar reviews. Females in this company make almost $15,000 less a year than their male counter parts even if they are in a more productive store. Women are stunted in job opportunities that are offered to them compared to their male counter parts as well as have to work much harder to prove themselves. Coming from brooks where everything was based on merit a co worker of mine who was making less due to low performance was making more our first raise at rite aid for no other reason than being male. He had multiple call outs, poor work quality, and low customer approval where as I had no call outs, great work quality and high customer approval."
good,Like any corporate run company there are hits and misses in each store. Poor management at certain locations. Employees can do as they please and not do their jobs correctly with little to no coaching.
good,If you have a family not a good place to work. Unorganized. No team work. Stressful work conditions. Management doesn't care about worker's. Safety. Job morale is very low.
good,"At Rite Aid, I was a Wellness Ambassador.  My primary job was to ensure customers got their proper shots, primarily:  flu, shingles and pneumonia.  I went business to business to inform companies that Rite Aid could come out to the workplace and give their employees their flu shots (provided their insurance covered it)  I publicly spoke at senior centers, and assisted the pharmacist at the flu clinics and returned to bill the shots thru the computer app."
good,I was a pharmacy technician for Rite Aide. I worked 20-24 hours per week. I learned a great deal about insurance companies and the dispensing of prescription medications. I also know that I would never want to be a pharmacist or work just with medications all day. During this time I missed patient care.
good,"Rite Aid is a fast paced high stress pharmacy that is always under staffed and constantly busy.  There is always a wait for prescriptions and a constant line of patients waiting long periods of time for simple prescription refills.  If you are there long enough you will here customers and patients that complain about how busy we are and how we need more people.  They also call us over qualified cashiers, because we spend more time running cash registers than pharmacy technician duties"
good,I feel that a pharmacy tech should get at least $10 an hour. $9.40 isn't cutting it. Also there are no benefits. I work 1-9 so its very poor work/life balance when I am a mother of 2 kids under 2.
good,I liked helping people. Rite Aid gave me the opportunity to do that and to work with a lot of amazing people. The different managing styles of the managers I worked with was a life changing experience.  I learned how to lead with out being overbearing.
good,"When I walked into work every day things were the same. It was monotonous and boring. I did like knowing exactly what to do though. "
good,Extremely nice to guests. Pay is horrible and advancement opportunities do not always mean increased pay. Good job for part time or students. Vacation is limited and job can be somewhat dead end if you are not district level management.
good,Breaks were given but they only offered fifthteen minute breaks. The workers were nice. Management was fair and nice. Workers got paid for meetings and training.
good,"I worked 3rd shift which is suppose to be 8pm to 4:30am. They haven't let us go at 4:30 since our last boss retired. At that time 90% was what you had to make every night if you did more then that it  was great! Since the new boss started it went from that 90% to 100% every night. We had mandatory overtime every night sometimes til 8am. Before we had mandatory overtime, not every night though! My children has recently went back to school my one child leaves out at 7:15 and my other at 8:20.I am a very hard worker that never mind doing my job, so when expressed to my boss how important it was for me to be home with my children before my wife leave out for work I thought he would definitely try to work with me. He told me he understood, it will be o.k and not to worry about it! I thought it was o.k! When I returned to work the next day i just want to be sure that everything was good as he stated. He told me because I left early i still received a  half point companies policy!! However during our first conversation never did he say anything about me getting points against me, he simply said i understand, its o.k don't worry about it.. This company will loose a lot of hard workers do to these new policies!"
good,"My workdays in PA varied from running my store to doing extra projects like store remodels, store set up and store closings. I was on the projects team for record returns, getting stores ready for inventories, and merchandising. My District manager there was understanding and willing to help out in any way. He was fair and appreciative of all aspects of the job. I enjoyed my time with the company until I had to move."
good,Rite Aid offered me the opportunity to attend college while still being able to work. Flexible work schedule and a great place to work especially for college students.
good,"Working as a pharm tech at Rite Aid is a very stressful job. They bombard you with computer based training when you first get hired and unless you have prior pharmacy experience it's all gibberish. When you finally get behind the counter they throw you to the wolves. With very little guidance from the more experienced employees you have to learn on the fly. That would be okay if it wasn't for he constant dirty looks for not knowing what you're doing after only a week there. I finally was able to pick up the job after a few months (thanks to a lot of dirty looks and trial and error on my part), when the new employees were hired I tried my best to ""train"" them, but their desire to get the job done right is nonexistent and now the pharmacy is in disarray. Also Rite Aid cares more about the feelings of their customers than their own employees. For instance if a customer's medication is not in stock the customer has every right to verbally assault you and all you can do is stand there and look at them. If you walk away you get in trouble, if you try to explain to the customer what's going on, you get yelled at. Rite Aid takes to heart ""the customer is always right"" and could care less about their employees emotional/mental state."
good,"Needs new management"
good,Every work day in shipping starts with bad news about what we have done wrong and or errors that have been made from the previous day. Management staff makes decisions that do not really benefit our work conditions but instead add on more work and stress to get the job done effectively if not harder.
good,"Entered  patients data and filled prescriptions. Did the end of the week paperwork, waited on drive threw window, waited on walk-in customers, user cash register and answered  multi-line phones.  Made and checked in weekly drug orders."
good,Rite Aid was an okay job but they didnt have a respect for employees  nor did they ever offer advancement no matter how much hard work you did
good,"Vary Busy, fast paced. Multi-Tasking job. My co-workers were great to work with."
good,"Most days we worked on new price changes or resets. Ran cash register when needed.  I learned about how the office is ran and how inventory is done.  The first Manager I had was great, then they brought in the old assistant manager who was moved to another store because of customer complaints back as the manager.  I left 2 weeks later. She had a real attitude and was reported and nothing was done.  Not a hard job at all, anyone can learn it.  Enjoyed talking with the customers who came in."
good,"Very stressful job at that particular location, especially when we did not have a pharmacy supervisor or regular pharmaist for a whole month, if not longer. i recommend rite aid for the experience, but most of us were constantly looking for the silver lining. There was a drop-off counter, pick-up counter, drive thru, and delivery, and only one tech or customer service rep would be working ta time. Very difficult."
good,A typical day at Rite Aid I would watch for any customers who may have the intent to shoplift or any customers that may have been arrested for shoplifting in the past. normally I would start by checking all exist making sure they are free from abstruction and any hazardous material. check with the store Manager for any incident occur while i was not present. The things that i learned from Rite Aid was being able to learn to deal with all types of people the diffrent attitudes whether the customer came into the store feeling like he/she didnt get the help that they need to find a product or even if they were on line to long and start to cause a seen regarding if they were being helped or not. my co-workers taught me how to deal with certain individual that have little patience. the hardest part of the job i would have to say it would be closing time. the most enjoyable part of the job i would have to say on delivery days.
good,I just did not enjoy working for $5.00 an hour and were not understanding about family issues.
good,My experience with Rite Aid was not a totally horrible experience. My pharmacy manager and store manager made promises they never followed through with but over all it was to bad. Another problem I had is when I applied I put hours on my app that I was available to work and I was told that would be fine a a few weeks after being hired they completely changed my hours. The pay is not get but its better then nothing. My fellow coworkers were awesome people to work with and I overall like my job. If they few issues mentioned above were taken care of better I would have stayed there much much longer. Rite Aid does do on the job training to earn your pharmacy tech. certification which is defiantly a good thing. This is one of the biggest reason I decided another company would be best for me because upon being hired they promised this training and again once being hired they went back on there word and i completed all but one of the modules to complete the program. They pharmacy manger told me at that point they did not need a tech at the time and i was not going to complete the program which was a huge disappointment. So again they go back on many things that they promise during the hiring process. The pharmacy manager I worked under was very rude and had the attitude of being better then everyone and anytime asking for help seemed to be a big inconvenience to her.
good,They do not pay there employees a decent wage. Its not a bad place to work unless you get stuck with some of the older Eckard employees that Rite Aid kept.
good,I liked working for this company in the beginning the first 4 years and then life got in the way and I needed to stay went to school had an economic meltdown
good,Nowhere near fair compensation for the work demanded of you. Some stores are union. They like to hire from the outside so it’s hard to move up. Pharmacy and front end are separate.
good,"This depends on the team you are working with, at this location nobody seems to be on the same as of the supervisors roles to lead us associates. There is too much favoritism along with personal feelings and life interrupting the jobs at hand. Also the manager seems to give her employees much to leeway therefor there are no consequences for employees action."
good,"Stay Away, no work life balance, do not try to have a life of any type of life. Management changes have changed it for the worse. Stay away, especially if you have a family"
good,"When I worked at Rite Aid there were literally only about 7 employees. There were two front cashier, three in the pharmacy and two in the photo lab. The way the shifts worked, however, there would only be one front cashier and one photo tech with the three in the pharmacy. The front cashier would sometimes double up as a pharmacy cashier and a photo lab tech which made it to where we were spread really thin and overworked. It was ridiculous!"
good,It was okay but being part time was not enough. Only got paid every 2 weeks and was struggling to support a child on that salary. Co workers were awesome and still recognize regular customers to this day
good,Checked all emails. Made sure all employees scheduled knew their tasks. Balanced out the safe funds. Checked for any discrepancies. Welcomed all guests.
good,"ive been with rite aid for over a year, what they neglected to tell me, while i was in school, i was averaging less than 35 hours a week, that means it doesnt matter how long you work there, you dont get vacation time, personal time, or anything."
good,"Its an ok job for awhile if youre trying to look for a job right after highschool."
good,Rite Aid is a money hungry unionized company. They would rather hire a new employee than allow the chance for a current one to move up. Management needs work with spiteful and revengeful people leading the districts.
good,"The current business climate is getting progressively worse. The future for this company is very uncertain. The compensation for most positions are under market value and outdated. The company has always lacked in the area of diversity and inclusion and its only gotten progressively worse over the years."
good,Management terrible  the supervisors don’t care about the employees.it was a terrible experience If they get better management it’ll be a good place to work.
good,Very intense real estate committee. Sites were selected and reviewed by supervisors prior to letter of intent negotiations. Deals were then presented to the real estate committee for approval
good,"As far as Rite Aid itself, it is an easy company to work for but dealing with the public is stressful. I have many duties with my job title so it can get overwhelming at times. Overall it is not that bad of a place to work."
good,"Pharmacy Technician is an assistant for Pharmacist, but some pharmacist will treat u as their own 'servent', everytime to assigned and blamed u. e.g. the label stick in vials is not their style but there is no certain style of it, some pharmacist are very nice and willing to teach u the skills."
good,The regional manager constantly makes random visits to make sure the staff is working beyond their expectations and pushing to sell products that customers are continuously refusing.
good,I come in. I get dressed. Managers are updating me on whats going on. I clock in and the higher management is already on me having me do 12 things while also having to help the cashiers.
good,"Overall, Rite Aid was ok.. Not enough hours or benefits . people were noce, besides pjarmacy manger. Very fast paced place. Would love to work at Rite Aide again."
good,Rite Aid is a fair employer except for the fact that when it is not Holiday season the work hours are very low. There is no real chance for advancement from what I was able to gather was that regional offices would only promote people they knew personally rather than giving a new person a chance. There is no real support for advancement.
good,"Poor management led to my low reviews"
good,During the time at work i would stand for 7-9 hours a day checking people out and stocking shelfs if product was there if not i would make sure products that were there were in order.
good,"This job offered no way to advance, hours were long and sporadic. While working i did learn a lot about maintaining a storefront and I picked up alot of customer service skills. But my roles and responsibilities often exceeded those in my job description."
good,I really do not feel that I am in a position to be too judgmental about this place. I was hired with the understanding that the hours were not plentiful.
good,"Working retail has its own limitations but the co-workers make the experience a positive one. It is nice to work in the community that you live, because you know many of the customers."
good,"Poorly managed, the district manager would come in regularly to put pressure on us. Chronically understaffed. Frustrating customer base that couldn't and wouldn't follow direction. Overall a soul-sucking mismanaged job."
good,Had to take a medical leave and was treated as if I'd committed a crime. No one is trained properly. Equipment is all out of date and falling apart or broken.
good,I enjoyed working as a shift super visor at Rite aid very much. The customers and coworkers were great. I was hired part time and received part time benefits which are none. at Rite aid 36 hours is full time I was steadily kept at 35hrs or even sometimes 35 1/2 hrs. where as full time employees receive $11 dollars an hour and benefits. Very unfortunate.
good,It was a good experience working at Rite Aid. I learned many things and improved my social skills a lot. It was good pay and flexible hours. It was a good job.
good,"Hours can get long and boring "
good,"Working for Rite Aid provides retail experience,  and customer service experience. A typical day operates on what sales are needed for the day, workplace culture ranges from many ages and allows everyone to be open. The hardest part of the job is satisfying every need of every customer."
good,"would not like to say at this time thank you manager is ok they are are different from one store to the next the dm i dont care for, only looks out for herself not her employees"
good,I worked two different stores to get my 40 hours a week. I has a huge amount of responsibility with little pay. I was a supervisor over cashiers. The store manager was extremely rude to employees at the Hogansville store. The Lagrange store manager was nice and helpful. I would go back to work for RiteAid only if I couldn't find another job.
good,"Working at store level is a great experience however, corporate leadership is absent.  Unclear and unrealistic expectations from people who don't understand the rules and regulations themselves."
good,"Pharmacist didn't work well under pressure , never organized and always under staffed. I don't feel the pharmacy department was able to exceed because amount of scripts received didn't match the on hand man power. However both pharmacists Steve and Tim were always professional!"
good,"Enjoyed working with customers. Typical day at work was very stressful due to disorganized work flow. Bullying between co workers was made known to management and nothing was done about it. the hardest part of the job was being bullied by fellow employees, most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers, especially because they were local folks that I knew my whole life and had gotten to know from working in my town."
good,Working in a religious environment making sure that every customer had the ultimate experience provided by the front desk associates.  We all worked together making sure all the kids and members needs were met.
good,"Highly stressful job environment, having to always work with no help (primarily understaffed most of the time). And, having management expecting you to find your own help while trying to meet their expectations."
good,"I've worked at Rite Aid for over a year during college, my experience is mostly positive. Shifts are typically a straight seven hours, either opening shift or closing. I've worked at a few different locations, so opinions may vary. My main store was considered the busiest in the district, this made cashier shifts pretty chaotic during peak hours. However, some other locations had a very laid-back and easy going atmosphere."
good,"days include structured work assignments set list of items that need to be finished, followed by walk in customers. small pharmacy with at most 10 coworkers. hardest part of the job is working with irate customers. the most enjoyable part was the down time."
good,"Great knowledge of working in the backroom. "
good,"As i enjoyed my position at Rite Aid as a pharmacy cashier, and data entry,i enjoyed being busy. with friendly and respectful coworkers."
good,This job is very dependent on the staff surrounding you.  There is no way not to work as a team and successfully complete a busy day in the pharmacy.  The management continually changes.
good,"	Duties include , opening/closing of the store / western union / safe/drawer counts / cash audits / cycle counts / zero counts / out dates/recall returns / planograms / Kodak photo certified / receiving loads and stocking / employee training."
good,pull products from selfs & put them in totes with correct store
good,"Enjoy coaching new and current associates, merchandising with multiple interruptions (find it exciting to get the job done)."
good,"Hands on experience, customer service, answering phone, crosschecking accurancy of prescroptions"
good,"Overall, I like Rite Aid. Unfortunately, there are 3 full-time girls that I work with. They are required to have so many hours to keep their benefits and vacation days. Sadly, I have the least sonority because I was the last one hired. So the hours are not available, and I don't have any at this time."
good,Many duties during the course of a day. Work well with my coworkers. My manager is great.
good,"the company wanted to make there stores look more satisfactory but didn't desire to put the manpower behind the idea, if something went wrong they didn't know which way to handle it, very sloppy upper management, the job would be done but we saw lots of ways for improvement"
good,"In the past, under different leadership, this was a great company to work for.  Recently, due to budget cuts and reductions in the work force, the overall moral of the facility was very low."
good,Budget cuts=less employees on the floor.  Less employees on the floor=bad customer service. Bad customer service=diminished sales. The wheel goes round and round. Overworked and underpaid sums up most pharmacy workers.
good,"My day  working at rite aid I stock shelves, processed returns.hardest part of the job was the hours there wasn't enough hours.What I like'd about my job was the co-workers they were very nice and kind .I love working with people also I enjoyed taking care of my customers.makeing sure they were happy and found what they needed."
good,"Very business pharmacy with lack of employees. Fluctuating schedule.  Learn a lot about pharmacy work and insurances, which was beneficial.  Great for a young person to get started."
good,"The management at rite aid is terrible, shifts were always changed without notifying me, they would assign tasks but would not allow time to do them, no theft protection, reviews were never on time and much more....."
good,The management really only cared about doing their 8 hours in the daytime and always left you suck at the register with no authorization to do anything to help the customers without calling for a manager or supervisor which resulted in the customers waiting.
good,Co-workers work well together. Since we work short staffed most of the time we work together to get things accomplished in the pharmacy.  We are able to find hours at other RA pharmacies close to us to try to get hours.
good,"Once you have learned the basics, there is no more growing. The job becomes dull and not challenging. It is crucial for companies to create an ever evolving environment so that workers can continue to improve along with the company."
good,This job was temporary while I was in school. I had to pay school fees. Some customers were friendly and some gave issues like every other workplace. You didn’t get much discounts but it was fine. They didn’t pay attention to my age when it came to handling tobacco. Overall the job was alright.
good,They tried to push workers out of employment when they got close to being up for benefits. You would get your hours cut to the point it was not worth working at all anymore for them.
good,"I liked the job, worked at several locations, rather close to home, not allowed enough resources to properly operate the store, theft was very high, all Nevada locations now closed"
good,"Few managers were great and one wasn't good."
good,"losses a lot of business. doesn't strive to bring customers in.  most staff just wants to be on their phones instead of working,  lots of texting and talking more than working"
good,Typical Retail job with an added bonus of terrible corporate management. The benefits are low and the hours and somewhat flexible depending on what they need for the week.
good,I worked here long ago and really have no idea how things are now. There were things I enjoyed. I had things going on my life when I worked here that were so much more important than any job. Rite Aid did not understand that.
good,"Good place to work, management were good at the beginning but they forced us to work 12hrs a day which is not good, they paying good after 8years working there I was making $ 18 per hr which is not easy in were house jobs."
good,I feel that management only communicated when problems came up. Management rarely gave compliments. The store I worked in management tended to be pleasant to you until she did not need you any more and would cut hours or try to make the work place difficult so that you would quit.
good,"Some people don't do there jobs, no leader ship out for them self's and not a team player. Always pass on work to other workers. Taken more breaks then should."
good,Hours were horrible it was mandatory overtime but you didn't know how many hours of over time until after lunch or later so if u have kids in school or daycare and noone to take care of them afterwards this isn't the job for you. Time off is a hassle so doctor appointments are a hard to get off for. Only a wawa near by and mom and pop store so you better take a lunch. No public transportation access. Very hot during the summer only industrial fans that blow dust. Pro The totes you have to carry around the belt are heavy when they are full so the weight comes off with ease
good,"This role is ok when you are willing to return to the workforce after a long period of self employment or unemployment.  If you are a part time employer, you can expect to be working weekends for approximately 20-30 hours per week as well as mid shift hours."
good,"Worked at 4 locations total. "
good,As stated above. Hard work does not pay off while at Rite Aid.  Having been with the company (7) plus years and all the while giving empty promises all along.
good,rite aid barely gives recognition and or compensation . yea it was a good company to work for when I first started but then slowly my hours disappeared from full time to part time and barely a raise now that I'm part time and I've had to make other arrangements for another job outside of rite aid
good,"Rite aid was a Very bad company to work at. They provided zero career advancement whatsoever, Poor Hours scheduled, no full time offers, and little pay."
good,"No breaks, no attention to employee health and well-being, pay was not the same between the Key Managers or between the sexes. Yes, there were learning classes but few and far between."
good,"My biggest problem was how crazy the hours would be. One day I would work 1-9pm then the next day I was working 8-4pm, then I was working 12-7! Quite often I closed the store from 4-9:15 and it seemed unfair that everyday I was closing the store when there were two other people who rarely ever closed it down."
good,"overall that was a good place to work,  if your not working Security, none of the clerks were security minded while at work."
good,Retail is a hard business to be in if you’re not a people person. I work in the pharmacy and I love my team and my one manager. There is just no advancement and the pay is very poor.
good,Although diversity is important on jobs Rite went over board. Reverse discrimination plays a big part in their culture.  Employee disputes were left unresolved unless it involved minority complaint.When unloading truck and stocking merchandise you have to keep stopping and running up to the front to wait on customers. When sales were on most of prices were not in the system which involved looking everything up to be able to modify prices. Managers had to give approval for the most ridiculous things. A lot of these functions took so much time that the lines were always needlessly backed up.
good,"Working in the pharmacy at Rite Aid is pretty much just a stepping stone to get something better in the Medical Field pretty much get your foot in the door type of thing. However, the pay is very low and some of the people are not very nice to work with at all."
good,working at Rite Aid it was a Stressful work place/ unfair work environment. The Job is left to one Employee to do the Majority of the work. the Treatment was unfair and there was favoritism. Also there was unprofessionalism were as our Manager would share confidential information with my coworkers.
good,"At my Rite Aid pharmacy, there is always only one technician and one pharmacist. If the pharmacist on duty is lazy then that one technician is running around like a chicken with its head cut off! The pay is the lowest of other pharmaceutical companies and there is no room for improvement."
good,"It was a very calm environment. Management was just very bad. After we lost our general manager, we received a new manager, and he was just completely different and had a different style of managing things."
good,"Miserable management, pay sucks and customers are so rudeeeeee. I hated all the stupid little videos we had to complete every month as part of training. Don't understand why they want to constantly as so much of you but are not will to pay you more than Mcdonald's employee."
good,it was very customer service oriented job. also very fast paced. non stop at times.. Co workers are friendly. Managers are always there to help. good place to work.
good,Was a good job but no room for career advancement & low pay with no set schedule per week. Each week would be a different day rather than a constant schedule.
good,"Pharmacy technicians, the face of the company, are paid less than technicians at other pharmacies. Raises are locked it at 2% or 3%. Corporate management tends too focus on numbers of prescriptions filled with no consideration of customer care."
good,"Typical day at work, busy."
good,"Management was always very involved in quotas. A certain number of prescriptions had to be filled per hour. The particular pharmacy manager I had was a mess.  She threw things, berated us, and then would cry and try to chit chat. It was like a bad relationship. I learned a lot, at least."
good,"I worked overnight so I did all of the ending day reports and deposits.  The typical day was doing the deposit, business day report, and then working with customers and store recovery, which included trash cans inside and outside of the store, sweeping the parking lot, sweeping the store floor, mopping where needed, and cleaning the bathrooms.  I learned how to manage people according to their strengths and how to manage time.  I was the overnight supervisor so I dealt with any issues overnight including theft.  The store manager was pretty easy going but kind of lazy.  The other employees were all friendly and supportive.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers that cursed at you and threatened you almost every single day.  The most enjoyable part was working with my overnight crew which I came to see as friends."
good,"Filling prescriptions, managing technicians, placing orders for drugs, checking technicians work,,,,,......................................................"
good,"As wellness ambassador, my job is to contact customers about awaiting prescriptions, outreach in the community to bring awareness about vaccines and the services of both the pharmacy and Redi Clinic.  When needed, worked with pharmacist as well as in front end as cashier.  Hardest part of job is to convince customers to get vaccines and management's expectations are somewhat unreasonable.  Numbers are all that count, no matter how hard you work.  Staff is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Rite-aid want you to do to much work for little pay. They switch store manager whenever they want too and don't give enough hours. Corporate is terrible and don't care about no one but themselves.
good,The people are nice.  The administration doesn't seem to care about the employees. The pay is not very good.  It can be quite stressful depending on the day.
good,"Nice place to work, short breaks tho, and no health care. Only web minimum wage and have to stand a lot. Not too hard a job tho, just need basic cashier skills"
good,Its retail. Pay is good and you just deal with the rest. Try to get a decent store with decent help. They could be better giving pharmacist more tech help.
good,"A typical work day is very busy from start to finish. You have to deal with awful people and their awful attitudes, but sometimes you are blessed with nice patients. It is fast paced and you need a lot of patience."
good,I would go to work after the lunch how for most people as i was a part time worker who would stock an isle and clean every night for closing. I learned that running a retail shop take a team and everyone needs to work together. Management was nice and friendly but more so as wanting to be friends they did not work as a proper authority figure in a leadership role should have. the hardest part of the job was moving heavy loads and clearing the warehousing part of the store but with a good team effort not to challenging. The enjoyable part of the job was the team members everyone was nice and worked well together.
good,it is an alright place to work but you must have lots of patience because customers can be very rude. you have to explain things several times for some people and people get angry easily when you don't do a return for them. not e wry store carries the same things.
good,"low pay,no benefits for part time.  schedule was never the same, hard to make a life outside of work, expect a lot of work for little pay"
good,"if the job requires six people...you will get 5 to do the work. Er, make that 4.  Nope, count on 2. Yep 2 to do the job.  Don't be surprised if you're standing alone."
good,Most of the supervisors are amazing. I do feel that the primary management needs an overhaul. This is a fast paced place to work and it is an amazing experience dispite its many flaws with upper management. I would work here again if I need to.
good,"i learned good communication skills. i learned how to work a register"
good,with being a Technician my  experience will help me in furthering my future plans. I enjoyed meeting people and most were very friendly I am a people person.
good,"easy work 1st job, no hard labor, not stressful, flexible hours while going to school, or other part time job, good area to work also good people to work with."
good,You do the same thing everyday. There isn't much of a hassle and there work definitely isn't hard. As long as you just do with what you are asked to accomplish everything should go well.
good,"I noticed that it was very easy to get promoted in a short amount of time. While I was never transferred, it appeared as a fairly easy process. My most current store manager had not previous experience as a head manager and it definitely showed. He had several visits from district managers and our regional vice president, who he apparently had personal as well as work relationships with, and they let a lot of his mishaps and unfocussedness slide. The store manager before him had a history of bad customer service and fighting in store with other employees and still was promoted to a larger, higher volume store. I had a hard time dealing with these mangers in a professional manner. I luckily had other co-workers who were a complete delight to work with, managers as well as cashiers and pharmacy department members. I hope to take the management experience gained here to future employment."
good,"Most of my fellow Technical Support Representatives where great to work with. Everyone was willing to help each other to get the job done. But, Management seemed to not care about the group as a whole. They would have favorites that everyone could see, even the people that where considered favorite."
good,Rite Aid is a great opportunity for students and first time job seekers but not a viable career opportunity. There was no set schedule from week to week and pay was minimum.
good,"I love working for Rite Aid and my manager is very realiable. But for the amount of experience and education I have, I feel I can perform at a higher standard."
good,"Rite Aid expects perfection, but employees deaf and blind people to achieve it. Management turn around is ridiculous."
good,"the jobs are not difficult and it is decent pay for the job. however, management could be better and there is no advancement. in order to keep your job, you have to make production."
good,Good starting job. No room for advancement really. Flexible job. Good for entry level but they do not invest in their employees at all. Also wages are significantly higher elsewere.
good,"Rite Aid is a good start for a first job. I was there for 10 years and all I can be is grateful for the opportunity they gave me to work there coming straight out of high school. Got to learned how to work in different departments, and also got to used different forklifts. Now moving on to bigger and better things..."
good,"Rite Aid would have been a better job if I had better managers and there were more customers. I had so much to do on a daily basis in a short amount of time that was just overwhelming, too much for one person. Should have had more cashiers."
good,"didn't last thru 90 day probationary period and i'm glad i didn't. store manager played favorites, wouldn't accommodate day off requests and was lazy"
good,stock coolers put items back at the end of the night that customers didn't want or need when checking out. pull items down from overheads block the store and wipe down the glass at the end of the night.
good,"Rite Aide was a very busy store. I found the day to go by very quickly. While it had it's challenges since management was very poor, with lack of concern or care for the employee's it was a satisfying job and I learned a great deal. Working in a face paced atmosphere was good."
good,"I am a definite people person and love helping people. I enjoyed this job because I was able to do both things. I operated the cash register as well as helping customers find what then needed around the pharmacy. I filled and re-filled prescriptions, worked closely with doctors and insurance companies, and had to use extensive math skills. Coworkers were sometimes hard to interact with, because I was not training to become a Pharmacist as they were. The job was very busy and I had multitask, which is no problem for me."
good,"I woul come in and go about my daily duties. Go to the back and take out all the empty boxes. Then I would get on a register and check out customers. Throughout the day I would refill the ice cream. Service the ice cream department. Then at night sweep, mop, checkout my register and then make the nightly drop."
good,"Never knew what department I was going to work, co- workers were good, I enjoyed the customers."
good,"I actually had a good work experience with Rite Aid. However, this was due to the management I worked under and the co-workers I had, not corporate. While I enjoyed the variety of work my job here involved, because it kept me busy, this was because corporate demands so much of their employees while dolling out no payroll. It is impossible to allow enough time for only one cashier on front end and then expect them to be on the floor helping people as well as running security on the front door too. This is a company that, like all too many these days, that want their employees to do the work of 10 for min wage!"
good,"My typical work day was to come to work and follow a script to help the customers. I really learned how to perform good customer service. The management was not that good. I enjoyed my co-workers. "
good,"i spent most of my work day re-stocking and or taking inventory,then running up to the front of the store whenever a cashier was need or to serve ice cream.It was a good experience for me."
good,"I loved the customer service aspect of the job. As shift supervisor my responsibilities included delegating task, audits, photo processing, shipments, merchandising and most important customer service."
good,"input data information in computer system. answering phones and answering customers questions. front end management was great to work with, pharmacy manager was not a people person he was difficult to work with and he need to improve his customer service."
good,"Freedom to self schedule day to day tasks, regular service repair calls and upgrades to both hardware and software formats as needed."
good,My work day was always very busy! I learned to listen to the customer and respond in a positive manner. The management was very demanding of all employees. I received employee of the quarter January-April for outstanding customer service. I enjoyed visiting and seeing all the regular customers. I enjoyed my job and never thought of it as work.
good,A typical day at my job i find to be a total drag. I still like working pharmacy in general but I dont feel like im part of the team at rite aid. im constantly stuck on the cash register when I do know how to perform other tasks.I dont feel im given the opportunity to put my skills to work. I didnt go to school to be a cashier. we have a good team at rite aid. Lately has been a struggle because we dont have a manager at the moment.
good,Interact with customers regarding prescription scripts and insurance.
good,"This company would be better to work for, for those with seeking an entry level loss prevention experience as the pay and training are not up to par for an experience professional"
good,no job security-outsourcing jobs even to other countries. Letting people go that have been there for years to replace them with untrained temps an a lower wage. Not taking into account that a 50 year old person may not be able to work as fast as a 20 year old person.
good,Rite Aid is a good place to work at when you really dont know what you want to do. You can go into the pharmacy if you want or you can become a manager or a supervisor. Lately the environment hasnt been the best.
good,The store manager was the worst part of the entire 6 years I worked for Rite Aid. My coworkers and customers and the pharmacy staff made these years fly by. The pay is poor. They should treat their employees better. They would probably care more.
good,"I worked and went to school. every Wednesday and Thursday I went to work at 3 am, Went to school at 7 am, and went back to work to finish truck and generally got home around 9 or 10."
good,Well its a typical job with so many nagging from a overwhelming group of managements. I wouldn't recommend the environment.  but if you need the money. go ahead
good,"Rite Aid Company pay is way to low, I made there what I made in 1980. They also make to commit to working a Strech Project for 16 months and told me for those months that I was going to get a Raise and offered me .75 cent raise. I traveled in 2 Districts to train other Wellness Ambassadors increased their Vaccinations in over 30 stores put over 20,000 miles on my car for no extra pay or gas card or company car, they did pay me .45 miles per mile but the gas prices did not cover the wear and tear on my new car."
good,"Our store is in a high end area of California . i have been at my store for 12 years. Currently we are understaffed for the volume of our store. We need help bad . we have a new private pharmacy that is opening across the street that could hurt is really bad. We just got remodled and it is beautiful. We need a ice cream scooper, a ambassador, 2 more cashiers."
good,I really did have a lot of fun working here. After having left 5 years ago I still keep in contact with most of my coworker and one being one of my best friends today. The only problem I had when I was there was lack of hours. The year leading up to my departure I was highest in seniority and was able to pick up hours in the pharmacy and it was still not enough. I would often times have to travel to different store to make 40 or as close as I could to 40 hours a week. My term there was when Rite Aid was under hard times and looking at bankruptcy. I can not say for sure if things have gotten better for them.
good,"Overall Rite Aid is a great company, the store manager,bbad apple.. I was hired as Wellness Ambassador that was able to train as a Tech and to get my license. Unfortunately I failed my test by 2% . The store manager refused to let me retake my test not wanting me to transition to Pharmacy, which led me to be fired/quit."
good,"Great for experience in management. No work and life balance. Great for learning how to stay organised. Over all it is great to learn how to work exhausted, under unnecessary pressure and without a home life."
good,Once Walgreens took over the transition period from rite aid to Walgreens was loaded with miscommunications and lack of leadership while corporate wanted you to go in two separate directions.
good,This company has some improvements to do. There for almost 3 years. Company closed after being sold to Walgreens. They did rip me out of my severance pay. They did not ask me where I wanted to go and basically said either you go or don’t get any pay. I also was cheated out of my vacation pay for two years:
good,"Rite aid is a great place to work at. Just dot apply for the rite aid that i worked at. The management was great for the first month, after that things started to go down hill."
good,When I worked at rite aid I would work every weekend and holidays. There was no rotation. My children were a lot younger and it made it extremely difficult.
good,"A typical day was really monotonous, as the store was open 24 hours, meaning shifts usually lasted until 11 pm. After 7 or 8 pm, the place cleared out, and there was rarely anything to do but sit there. The management team changed while I was working there. The original team that hired me were great. They stayed to help pack out the delivery, and had great relationships with their employees. The replacements, not so much. They were very cliquey from the get-go, as they came together from another store, and were of the same ethnicity. They quickly accepted another person into the group for that exact reason, and they would sit in the office for periods ranging from 30 minutes to 45 minutes, either on their phones, talking, or something else. Their laughs could be heard by other employees, and when one of them were asked to come and help on the register, there was no sense of urgency there. They would do it at their own pace. The newest member of their group was unprofessional towards the end of my time there, calling employees out in front of customers, disappearing without telling anyone where they were going, and taking breaks that they weren't allowed to take. With only two employees in the store, they should not have taken a break, and even if they did, they should have been able to come help when help is needed. However, she refused. And when I called repeatedly, I was scolded for it. The hardest part of the job was dealing with new hires. Their hiring basically hinges on a survey and a drug test. If you pass, you're in. That being said, they hired individuals that were"
good,It’s ok to work there I’ve been in five buy outs in my 27years I see people come and go I seen customers come and go we lost a lot of customers  and I meet new customers every day
good,"Fast-paced action in food mart and beauty. Slow times is mainly used for cleaning, facing and stocking all products. Associates work together to complete all the store work."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of jumping headfirst into a rush, as I worked at one of the busier locations in my area. "
good,"Working at Rite aid is a very energetic and fast paced environment with a high concentration in customer service, driven with a friendly atmosphere deffinately keeping you on your toes"
good,It can be a productive and fun experience working with a respectful team. A typical work day now is much more manageable once you have learned how to do things according to the rite aid management team. The hardest part of the job is making sure your work is being completed in a timely matter.
good,"typical work days are very stressful"
good,"Schedule never ready in a timely matter, favoritism, unfair treatment, rude associates, inappropriate comments while on lunch break with other associates and manager asking about if private areas are shaved and so forth, I’ve been grabbed by the manager in the past denies health care in an emergency situation denied going to my fathers funeral."
good,"I liked my job a lot, but the manager was doing illegal things, and I found out about it, and he fired me, and put me on ""NO REHIRE""-- saying that I quit & did not call or anything."
good,"Hard work goes unnoticed.you can be accused of anything with video and email proof showing it was untrue, And still be let go. Lacking in security cause staff to judge a book by its cover."
good,If the customers like then you are ok. But it seems that they give people positions that they know from other companies and there own workers can’t move up in the company
good,Dealing with upset customers due to my manager being mean also not getting paid enough for all the work I did. Not a long enough break or being able to drink water while working.
good,"I used to feel like Rite Aid cared about their employees. It’s clear that they’re just another corporation that only cares about flu shots and money. Seems to me that they don’t know how to manage their money. I wouldn’t be surprised to see stores close in the near future. I love my store and my team, but upper management and corporate leave little to be desired."
good,"Poor wages and expect their Pharm Techs to do everything a licensed Pharmacist does.  Is willing to train you, but the pay increase was embarrassing!  .50 cent raise once you had your license."
good,Rite Aid is good job for younger adults just starting in the work field or good for making change for older workers. For me I've out grown this and need to move on to bigger and better. Minimum wage is nothing to be proud of. It helped me in my time of need but now I must move on and further my career.
good,Not thrilled with how the environment was from day one but I needed a job and this is what I had at the time....but at the same time I learned a lot and learned what it was like to be behind the counter at the pharmacy
good,"I was employed there for almost a year and a half, and we were robbed three times: twice at gun point. The higher ups didn't care that coming into work made you panicked, and only their darlings (People who worked full time) could take advantage of any benefits, despite the length of time worked for the company."
good,This company is no longer in business.  Bought by Walgreen's. I did enjoy by time there and learned many important jobs and skills and how to work as a team.
good,"Although my time at Rite Aid allowed me to come out of my shell and help me socially as a person, I found a lack of happiness throughout my career. It took me 4 years to get paid a dollar more and I received no benefits while working full time. There was a lot of unfairness in numerous areas at the store I worked at."
good,"Typical day - Gossip, immaturity, insecurity among employees."
good,"Workers often complain of sicknesses like runny noses and eyes as well as coughing and sneezing.  When asked of rite aid to clean the carpets in the pharmacy and clean the ventilation systems since they were never cleaned since the building was built, rite aid felt that it was an unnecessary procedure due to its expense.  The health of rite aid employees was not a concern."
good,It's an ok job the workload can tend to be crazy at times but its something good to start off with.  The work atmosphere is good and the people. As far as upper management i had no clue who they were .
good,i unload trucks put them in the staging area until its ready to go to the production floor working assists with daily receiving of incoming merchandise
good,"you never know what time you get off, i learned how to work in a warehouse, it was a very fast pace job , it has a good pay  , ifyou dont have a car then you shouldnt work here"
good,"Cool for short term but you would only want to work for this company if you want to make this job your career and satisfied With the less than 30,000 compensation. Store managers are only individuals that make more than 38,000."
good,at rite aid being a pharmacist tech i would fill up customers prescriptions and put it on the shelves then i would ring them up and whatever items they got off the shelf
good,Very stressful environment with a lot of demands for one person working the register. Long hours with little to no help from managers or another associate. Hardest aspect was stocking aisles.
good,The people i work with are nice. But im not even working part time hours im working anywhere from 10-15 hours a week. When you tell them you need more hours they always blame it on the district manager.
good,Human resources never really help when it comes down to a problem you have sometimes you will be the one at fault. Your assistant managers will be more helpful than your actual managers. To be completely honest the whole entire job it's nothing but a high school for adults.
good,"I didn't like the pay here but I remained employed to gain as much knowledge and experience as I could gain in pharmacy. Both of my bosses were professional,wise,yet fun to work with. I had seven co-workers with whom I worked with each day different person and out of all there were only three that actually  made the work day run smooth the other ones jus made it chaotic and stressful."
good,Working in the Rite Aid Pharmacy is a very difficult position to be employed in.  It is very fast paced.  When you feel as if you are working as fast as you can Management makes you feel like you are lagging behind.  There is no room for growth and there idea of training and on-boarding is a disgrace and only hurts their employees.
good,"Both managers at my store were wonderful. However pharmacy district manager and her boss was not. They always pick on the hardest worker and tell you you look bored or you arent doing your job, especially when you are running your tail off to keep from sinking due to one staff pharmacist's lack of confidence, compassion, and drive for the company and one co-worker who is always poor me. My advice to upper management is really appreciate your good workers and don't assume the best technician looks bored, she's just carrying the weight of a pharmacist and two technicians jobs."
good,They are not the best I have worked for and they are not the worst. Poor life work balance and poor management led to stress. Slow paced and boring no matter how they dressed it up.
good,"Maintenance for stores is not a priority neither is pay equality.  Overall management is fair and friendly but there is not enough capital to make this a successful company.  Also, most stores in the south east will become Walgreens by the spring of 2018."
good,I worked for them for 5 years it was OK at first but when I chose to start my family that's when it got crazy they weren't really accommodating while I pregnant and when I went on maternity leave I was asked to return early from leave but I wasn't given my normal hours so me and the manager had it out so I quit unfortunately
good,"It was a hostile environment, I did not leave on good terms.  There was a lack of communication and balance within the particular store I worked.  Most enjoyable part was my coworkers."
good,"The company went from being very supportive and encouraging to a CEO who advised us that we were of no value and could be replaced anytime.  Destroyed morale and continued cuts to pay and dropping sales, very discouraging."
good,"Good place to start dont put all your apples in one basket, venture out get a second job managers differ from place to place it was fun on occasio hr can be pricks at times"
good,"Job Work/Life Balance - bad"
good,I would work here if i could. People are very helpful and like to help each other. Benefits are good and helps you out if you continue to work there. But there are always pros and cons of the place. Especially when one of the manager is always upset due to her family problems and take it out on the staff thats one thing i did not like .
good,Difficult to get assistance from payroll.  Schedules are not published in advance.  Lots of turn over.  Hiring is very slow so we are always shorthanded.
good,"For working here almost 2 years, I can say that they don't care about the employees at all. There's individuals who call out multiple times a month and get no punishment. The pay is terrible for what you deal with and how much work and pride you put into the job."
good,"working for nearly three years and less than 1.00 dollar in raises. constant management changes, overworked. One can find light in any tunnel at times, but for the most part it was an exercise in self preservation."
good,I love working in fast pace store because the day goes by faster. If you are not given a support system and everything falls on your shoulders; you get upset and do not enjoy your job as much.
good,"A typical day at this job consisted of cashing people out at the register, helping customers find what they were looking for in the store. also, answering the phone when customers called for the pharmacy or for a certain item in the store. restocking the coolers and shelves at night, were also part of the job duties per day."
good,"Over protection they watch ur every movement make not wanna even move around an do work they think everyone steal , lie, an cheat... crazy... pay an hours where good an"
good,"Was looking for a long term, stable career. At first Rite Aid fullfilled that, but soon I found was a fallen company and waiting on buyout."
good,This pharmacy scripted for more staff than it had. Makes things a lot more stressful. Also had drive-thru window which took some getting used to
good,"Its a great first job, it taught me alot of stuff like how to handle customers and how to make a store look better. The most hardest part of the job was dealing with customers when they were mad about something and trying to make them happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people in need and going above and beyond to help customers and them being happy about it."
good,"I have worked here for 8 years and the management team seems to make their own rules and pick on anyone they do not like or who doesn't think like them. The corporate people seem to not really care or pay attention to what happens in the store levels. Almost like if it can be dealt within the store by scaring an associate of losing their job or a write up, they are okay."
good,"Process prescription, cashier, stocked pharmacy.  I became familiar with drug and the dosage and reason why they were prescribed.  Worked directly with customer to assist with finding over the counter medication and any thin needed in the store."
good,"Fun at times, but a very high stress workplace. Poor management and overworked employees. Not enough pay but the hours are good. Just work really hard to get what you want."
good,A typical day at work would be coming in and counting your register waiting for customers to come in the store to greet them and ringing up customers. You would complete tasks like western union transactions and money orders
good,"Utilize your workforce! I saw several instances where good over-educated or wonderful technicians were passed over for advancement in favor of outside hires, or even unqualified associates, that happened to know the right people or run with the right crowd. Great people who had degrees and had been loyal to the company were not promoted, when they could have been grooming those associates for upward movement."
good,"Deal with rude and Irate customers constantly, the majority of them being drunk. I hear borderline sexually harassing comments on the daily bases from said drunken customers. On the upside I do enjoy working with the majority of my fellow co-workers."
good,"There is job security with this company but there is no balance between home an work . You will be working very long hours and probably closing the store ALOT . AM are guaranteed 45 hours . No weekends or Holidays off . If you get a Store Manager with a attitude problem,  he will give you the worst schedule there is which is usually all nights and weekends and the DM won't do anything about it . You will be in charge of the seasonal conversions and the profit planner (merchandising ) and there is usually 4 or 5 pallets of merchandise,  depending on the store . Christmas is the worst . Benefits are OK , very expensive. There wil be time when you have to close and then open the store the next day .The SM can basically give you any schedule he wants and there open from 8am to 10pm and open EVERY holiday."
good,The job itself is easy. But there is no air conditioning. & they always have mandatory overtime so my sleep schedule is all messed up. I don't have time to do anything. Got hired as full time & they won't let me switch down to part time. Really don't like the work conditions.
good,"Its a nice place to work. However, it's a place that you wouldn't feel comfortable working at as time goes on. You gain good experience and the co-workers are very nice people. Management wasn't that great due to lack of work done then blaming everyone else; taking the blame was the hardest part. In the end, you learn there are different types of managers and you'd be lucky to have a good one."
good,"Overall I love being a Pharmacy Technician. My desire is to help others to the best of my ability. I pay very close attention to my work, it is very important to make sure each client is getting the right  medication. Billing insurance companies and making sure what medications are covered and not covered. I would love to make a better salary in my filed of work. The hardest part of the job is the pay and not enough hours, the pay rate is $9.00 hr. The team i work with overall we work well together to get the job done. And I most enjoy that I am able to put a smile a clients face regardless the situation."
good,It is a good company. The company is open 365. It makes it hard if you and a SM or a ASM to have good work life balance. The company seems to worry about the might dollar and not how it effects it associates.
good,Typical day requires opening the work system for pharmacy staff;providing consultations for providers and community members.
good,Rite Aid is a local drug store. The management is not to bad. The coworkers can be fun and energetic. The pay is minimum wage with not the best of benefits.
good,"I was at rite aid for 3 years and waited for my pomotion for about 1, I was doing  everything in my power to get reconized buy every new manger that came in witch i was getting reconized but the mangers would never last, talked to the corprate office they were giving me the run around  . I liked working in retail just had a bad experince with rite aid."
good,we have a great team we all work well together. have gone thru a lot of changes but we keep going.  meet nice people love helping customers
good,"very busy store with only a technician and a pharmacist on duty "
good,"Co-workers were very friendly . My typical day is standing on my feet for 6 to 8 hours . I am always on the floor, either helping customers or stock shelves. I have learned how to be a good employee and how put forth good work ethic. The hardest part of doing my job is our truck day, because I am often left up front of the store with no help while I assist customers and put out the truck.  The most enjoyable part is how friendly everyone is to each other. And getting to see my customers leave my store happy and with the products they were looking for."
good,"A typical day consisted of processing transactions, assisting customers in questions about store products and what the store has to offer."
good,"I began working here simply as a temporary job to get some extra money before I moved out to San Diego to start college. It was good for that, I was just a high school student. Great beginner job! However, if you plan on lifting yourself up and push yourself, look elsewhere. At my location,it seemed as though none of the older coworker were really ambitious or passionate about what they did, especially the manager. The manager wasn't one to be overly attentive or helpful, he never acknowledged the work I put in to do things right, but told me everything I did wrong. There were definitely the good parts and bad parts, but the bad really stood out."
good,I worked with individuals who would not train someone on the basis of age.  I enjoyed working with the customers however my coworkers made the job difficult.
good,Rite Aid is a very good job. You learn something new everyday.Some days are busier then others. I learned how to read doctors hand writing and learned what drugs are for.
good,"Operate register assist customers straighten shelves unload totes and boxes"
good,"While I thoroughly enjoyed my store and my manager, drama was extremely prevalent. Corporate also gives out these policies and then backs up the customers when they complain about the policy they implemented. It is the most frustrating thing. And don't think you will get promoted, they would rather promote someone in order to get rid of them. Bad company to work for."
good,"Lots of unuseful work and unrealistic deadlines. The distribution and pricing systems is ridiculous. They send totes to the stores with one or two items as small as make-up in a tote alone. They also scatter a few of certain items mixed with many other items among numerous totes, like they are playing scavenger hunt with their employees. This creates unnecessary back tracking. They also have their plan-o-gram stickers changed on a monthly bases, just to have them covered up by weekly price change stickers. And on a weekly bases you have to pull sale stickers off, just to replace it with one that says the same thing. I’m just being honest here."
good,"The hours vary from week to week. Also it was very far from my home, and management was very stingy with raises that were mandatory."
good,Being a cashier and stocking shelves.  I learned that I do not care for retailing. There was a constant turn over in management.  I work with decent co-workers.  The hardest part of my job was standing on my feet for hours.  The most enjoyable part was meeting all the different types of people.
good,"As an associate, I had to wear many hats with many different responsibilities. Rite aid is your typical minimum wage job. Working at Rite Aid motivated me to complete my college education and to work hard for a real career."
good,"*A typical day at work consisted of having one person to open and manager to complete daily functions. This consisted of completing reports, checking payroll, completing plan-o-grams, completing price changes, writing store schedules, manage freight flow, seasonal change overs, and placing store orders."
good,"Close net workplace, but no fairness from management when it comes to balancing hours, holidays or weekend hours. You deal with a lot of demanding customers and have to have a thick skin to do so. The most enjoyable part is that the good customers are very loyal and you really have a good working and friendly relationship with them. A lot of drama with co-workers and everyday is like high school and the drama is just crazy. No loyalty from the employer as to advancement. District Manager was demeaning and sometimes cruel during store inspections and he wanted you to report on your Manager to him constantly, which was very unprofessional."
good,A typical day at rite aid would be to work 12 hours and try and do a two person job yourself and get a crummy attitude when you cant do it fast enough even tho the other girl ignores the customers on purpose and still gets paid the same amount as you.  The management lets alot of unacceptable things slide because they dont want to be short handed. Rediculous.  Some of my co-workers were great people but the others were just hard to get along with and completely selfish.  The hardest part of my job was trying to take care of every customer on my own because like I had said previously the other girl on staff walks like a slug and ignores customers on purpose.   The most enjoyable part of my job was the end of my shift when I got to go home..
good,"Management was ok, she didn't really care about your well being. All she really cared about is you being there at work. Everyone else at work was pretty nice. There really wasn't a hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was making money and meeting new people and seeing the regulars that would come in."
good,"Working for this company was a great experience although it was not a rapid process for me to step up the ladder from a sales associate into the supervisor position.  The other downfall to the position was the massive amount of responsibility required and the miniscule salary that was being given.  It was a complete turnoff after my dedication to the company of 4 years.  However I learned so many skills that of a manager.  I essentially was the store manager because I held the keys I opened and closed the store.  I was in charge of all monies and the safes, deposits and registers.  I communicated to the cashiers and other employees their daily tasks as well as handling everyday store procedures.  There was yearly store resets and always new products coming in that required the shelves to be re-set constantly, and corporate level communication was required through emails and telephone.  I truly had many responsibilities and did enjoy the job and I grew so much and developed my own self being around people and knowing who I am as a person and what I can do to help people and what people enjoy about me.  That was the most rewarding part of the job."
good,"Typical managerial tasks including hiring, firing, forecasting, marketing. P&L control, inventory control. I enjoyed customer interactions. Upper management did not have a good pulse on the marketplace."
good,"Helping customers, working seasonal, keeping the stockroom clean. Customer service is key, you keep them happy and your day goes off with out a hitch."
good,"Different policies, must provide own uniform, standing in one specific spot consecutively. I enjoyed helping people that i could."
good,"A typical day consists of filling prescriptions, handling cash/credit transactions, and interacting with customers.  I had to learn the system (NextGen) and the workflow quickly in order to get the orders done.  The hardest part of the job is the lack of communication between people, specifically management outside of the home store.  I enjoy the education aspect of the job and know what the different types of drugs interact with, the new generics or brands that come out, and enjoy working with the pharmacists."
good,Rite aid was my first pharmacy experience. Although I liked my co-workers and enjoyed meeting and servicing all of the customers there was not much room for advancement. Also no guarantee for work on a weekly basis.
good,"I have not worked here for a while, but this job was not a learning experience."
good,"Working with customers (greeting and assisting), stocking shelves, operating cash registers, balancing cash drawer, and closing up at night. "
good,wasn't an easy place to advance in. Everyone I worked with was very nice except for management. He didn't take anything anyone said into consideration.
good,"•	Responsible for developing film, cleaning photo machines, as well as adding developing chemicals as needed"
good,Busy pharmacy/retail store. Management could have been better. Benefits & Pay rate were not satisfactory. Not very flexible with hours/time off. No PTO and no paid time when i had surgery and would not let me come back to work after i was cleared.
good,"Arrive at work, given assignment for the day by supervisor, greet each customer in the store at that time.  Perform task assigned (cycle count products not on the shelves, pull and stock shelves with overstock products, set planograms for certain areas, and/or do front end cashier for customer buying products in the store)."
good,"Management needs to beleive in the Manager of the store"
good,i liked working with the people and customers at first but we lost a lot of techs at once and it made the work place very difficult and stressful
good,Served as Director of Phamacy with this organization.  Worked 10-12 hours day.  Supervised day to day operations.  Supervices 3 full time technicians and 3 part time technicians as well as 2 pharmacists.
good,ive been working for this terrible company for many years and it went completely downhill. positions being lost people unappreciated etc
good,Rite Aid teaches you a lot to start your career path and provides you a workforce where you can develop..
good,"Typical day includes monitoing patient profiles as I fill their prescriptions. Checking for any interations with their other medications. Counseling patients on how to take their medications while supervising any technician I might have. Giving any immunizations such as Flu, Shingles, Pnuemonia and various other immunizations. Answering emails and performng any jobs as manager of the pharmacy."
good,Easy to work with. Management very nice. I would go back to this job.
good,"A typical day is working with no supervision, management and co-workers not too into customer service, more about getting the job done."
good,"Daily duties were supervising employees, daily paper work, cash handling and processing photos. Enjoyed this job until they changed management."
good,it was good for the most part. i new how to do just about everything other then management. never learned anything new. i liked most of my co-workers. there was no hard part to my job. my customers were the most enjoyable part in my job.
good,"Rite aid is okay, will never make top companies to work for. They do not pay workers enough to get quality help.benefits are decent."
good,"I learned how to drive a forklift typical day at work is long hours fas paste productive, the hardest part of the job is working in extreem hot weather,"
good,typical day at work is stressfull very busy. lways something to do on very short staff.
good,"Learn to live with corporate. My district management was not the best. If your manager doesn't like you, they seem to be able to do whatever they want to you with no repercussions."
good,The percentages in which they expect you to pack totes is ridiculous! Unless you are constantly running they will fire you. I worked through a temp service so my pay rate was different.
good,Pay was not fair in my opinion for the amount of stress & work that was put on employees. Management was not positive or encouraging & wasn’t helpful or lenient for emergency family situations/sick days.
good,"I worked here for a short period of time after I graduated hogh school and it was a temporary job. They left me go because I had to call out on two Thursdays, which were inventory days, due to family deaths."
good,"Software easy. Management easy going. Understaffed. Not willing to pay your worth. Once committed to pharmacy, you lose your life outside of pharmacy."
good,"Job is very easy management sucks depending on what store your at, really relaxed environment and the people there were nice. I was in an area of high theft so constantly watching the doors and aisles"
good,I arrived on time according to my work schedule which was set by the Pharamacy Manager. I learned how to apply the policies of Rite Aid Drug Computer System to the drive thru pick-up prescription customers.  I also applied my previous Customer Servicd experience when I delt with in-store customers.
good,This is a good job for a first timer but at the store level it is not a career. Ask for high pay in the beginning because the raise come once a year and are percent based so there not that much.
good,"Working here I learned that it's okay to be rude nasty and disrespectful to customers I also learned that they do not care or protect their staff at any cost they want you to be the Super person thats works there own department and cover other people's jobs bevause they choose not to do it. Also have you go things that are not your job. You get super low pay. All the management from HR,LP, Store Managers, Co Managers down to the Pharmacy Managers are terrible. They only hire one or two people who rarely know what to do."
good,"It's hard to rate as a whole company, because each store is uniquely run. My store never had enough hours to go around and I was part time for years. Then I found out a newer employee started off making more than I did, but I had experience and she didn't. That was enough for me to go and look for a company that respected its workers."
good,This company only looks out for top management.  Even after cutting half the stores at Rite Aid still can’t make it work.  Bad management!!!!  You really know how it feels to be a number.
good,"A Place To Learn Proper Customer Service. "
good,staff pharmacist. long hours with not enough help. little clarity on emphasis placed on importance of daily operations (number of prescriptions versus immunizations).  goals seemed to change
good,"Management has no real time awareness of employees via computerized inventory control system , system is antiquated as well as inadequate for the volume of product that is generated on a daily basis . There are many individuals at RiteAide who have a wealth of knowledge in regard to how the process functions or doesn't depending on the task . Those without a sense of urgency to complete assigned tasks are overlooked while those that do stay focused and on task are rewarded by being given more work to offset those that fail to perform at standardized performance levels ."
good,Started as a cashier in highschool qnd I quickly progressed into a shift after I graduated while taking classes. The amount of work they expect vs the pay you get is ridiculous. All of there major competitors pay significantly better and the discount you get is the same as the one the gold members get and don't think about benefits as it is tricky to become full time. If you happen to get into a union store you get a yearly raise which comes with a union due increase. In my 10+ years with the company my largest non promotional raise was around a quater.
good,"My opinion is that conditions for the employees could only get better with the recent acquisition of Rite Aid by the Walgreens Corporation. For the employees that remain, I wish them the very best."
good,"I very much enjoyed working for Rite Aid in Kentucky.  It was a pleasant and supportive working environment.  The crew and management cared very much about the company.  I wish I could say the same about the Louisiana locations, but they caused me to leave the company."
good,It's a starting point for pharmacy. It gets you some experience but doesn't pay the bills right away. You have to try to find hours and work all of the time to make ends meet. Everyone is super nice though!
good,"On a typical day at work I manage the entire store from cleanliness safety and merchandizing, I also work with the pharmacy to help provide outstanding customer service to all patients."
good,The worst part about the job is that they are inconsiderate to what you have going on in your life . The best part is amongst the staff you build friends and bonds with your coworkers.
good,"Rite Aid it's a good place to work, but there are no advancement opportunities, and depending on your DM you could be extremely underpaid.  There is also a sense of insecurity with the future of the company."
good,Productive fast pace workplace. A great deal if work to be accomplished. Worked with some great associates. Enjoyed many if my coworkers. Overall nice place to work.
good,We were lied to about keeping our jobs once Walgreens took over. They did not let us know that we didn’t have a job until 2 weeks before the store closed
good,"data entry, calling insurances, invoicing going and coming inventory"
good,"Rite Aid is a good company to work for. It is a fast paced, challenging environment to work in. The Nexgen computer system is a powerful resourceful system to work on."
good,"The overall job was okay. I would not go back. It was one specific person that made my experience a non enjoyable one. It was pretty good pay, but a lot  of work came with it."
good,They were always  giving me problems about trying to balance a single mother/work schedule. It was overwhelming  most of the time. Rite aid let me go when they changed my schedule and I said I couldnt.
good,"as a salary manager must be available all the time. Work/ Life  balance is poor. It is really depend of your immediate supervisor too. To compare with CVS, Rite Aid is much more relaxed retailer."
good,in spite of not being a competent company I liked to work and I had good and bad experiences.When I started in this company in the state of Maryland I liked it a lot and had good experiences and I had an excellent manager
good,The customers got rude very quickly. The environment was fast pace and it hot out of control from time to time. The hardest part of the job was trying to deal with some of the customers attitude at times.
good,It could be better. Depending on the store and the type of management you are under you'd most likely be able to have a wonderful experience. Iove my job and I do enjoy helping people it's just a bit overwhelming at times. As long as you are willing to learn everything will be great
good,My hours were being cut because of the Walgreens acquisition. I started at 40 hours weekly but had less than 30 when I resigned. Of approximately 1900 stores purchased by Walgreens only 1600 would remain.
good,I went to work everyday and felt like I was in a rut most of the time. The management often did the bare minimum for the day. Mostly uninspired and lack of soul.
good,Rite Aid is a good company. I did not care for the job and life as a pharmacy technician. Contact with the people was what I liked. I did like stocking the shelves and working with the other employees.
good,Working at Rite AId was okay. I covered a lot of shifts and learned everything pretty quickly. However I was only allowed to work closing shifts because people with mroe experience there were allowed morning shifts.
good,Not much to say about them. The got bought out by Walgreen's and all the Rite Aid stores are getting closed down. I didn't really like the way they ran things and management sucked.
good,"Always covering others shifts, always forced to work weekends, have to fight for vacation. Never enough help. I spend more time at work, instead of with my family."
good,"it`s just a regular shopping place but it mostly busy on sundays, I learnt a lot working with the company but the management was very poor , the hardest past of the job is when you closing on Sunday because it` always people in the store arond that time and you can chase them off due to that we stay a lil bit later just to get thing doe but the manager always complains the next day about over time and it`s not in the policy oif the company to work over the clock, most enjoyable part of the Job is the team work but not always thou just being honest"
good,the typical day would be stocking and greeting and taking care of customers. At first the manager was ok but then he hired another kid and he gave him all the other associates hours and the kid ended up stealing from them.
good,they train you well. the only reason i left was the awful customers and low pay. the customers were the absolute worst. the hardest part was keeping working with a short staff or a floater pharmacist. will never work retail again
good,"Depending on your store manager and district manager, this will determine your rite aid experience. The Benefit package is not all that great, but at least there is one."
good,"In my performance review, my district manager was upset with my numbers. This company, and I'm sure other big chains, are looking only at numbers when reviewing employees. Not one time did we discuss how I have treated patients or fellow employees. And when asked how I could do better, what is my problem I was left to figure it out myself and received no training the the areas in question. I was asked to go part time or be terminated."
good,"working at Rite Aid was a very unique experience. It was fun working with people but at the same time very challenging. I worked with not enough help especially at closing time. I didn""t feel my position as a supervisor any different from just an ordinary clerk except for the big responsibility at hand.I'd say salary was not commensurate to the duties and reponsibilties."
good,The area was terrible. Constant problems with customers stealing and lying. Threats were even made as someone said they would shoot me for not selling cigarettes because he had no form of ID.
good,He stores are run different from the other store.  Rules are sometimes different. Too much  chief's and not enough Indians. If topped out no bonus will they give for end of year.
good,I love the customers but hate how the company treats their employees who have been there for extended years.  The pay could be better and management could be more fair in treating everyone and their schedules equally.
good,Every day is competitive. From watching the managers mistakes I've learn a better way to manage a company. The hardest part of the job is balancing life and work.
good,It's an okay place. I just don't think the wage is fair. This is the least I've ever made doing the exact same thing. You do get insurance and a 20% discount on regular priced merchandise.
good,"minimum wage, no advancement, flexible hours/ shifts. No paid vacation, no sick days , annoying, aggravating, ok as a part time job , nothing serious ."
good,"Working in the pharmacy taught some valuable life skills, however a typical shift wasn't as faced paced as I would've hoped. Pay was mediocre and balance with school was difficult."
good,not good horrible staff and management. unfair misleading and just a place I would never work again. all they care about is what they need reguardless if your sick or not
good,I liked working at rite aid. I enjoyed very much meeting the customers and helping them to locate items they were looking for in the store. I would like when they would put in a good word in with my manager or they would come into the store and ask for me personally
good,"Really don't have any to much to say about his company.No real ability for advancement , very low wages employees seriously over worked to match what they were getting paid."
good,"I wouldn't make rite aid my career but it pays the bills for now. high stress job, minimal raises, unreasonable deadlines, poor management, lack of hours and no OT."
good,"To continue cutting hours from people and requiring associates to work  alone for 5 and 6 hours is a ridiculous expectation. Especially when upper management wants so much done each day. After 13 years, enough was enough for me."
good,"A typical days work consisted of strictly cashier work for me and occasional restocking of the floor as well as waste duties. management was very unenthusiastic and really uninvolved , you could usually find them in the back office for hours at a time. workplace culture was non existent. The job was self explanatory , i was a sales associate , and there wasn't any particular enjoyable moments other than helping my beloved neihborhood elders . Overall it was stable in the sense that you knew what was going to be your job but we often look to be challenged as people . This place does not challenge you."
good,bad place to work. with low pay in and out of hot trailers all day. lift boxes as heavy as 70 lbs. hardly get a chance to stop and drink a water bottle.manager is as lazy as a fat pig.
good,"Rite aid was an ok company to work for, nice clean store.  Some of the  people were nice especially the elderly .  Really low, low wages, great company discount though 30% off everything but, clearance items.  Only were able to get paid time off, after 90 days of employment."
good,"It was an okay place to work. Could be good for a teenager just starting out in the working world. For me wasn't career type place. I did however like the customers who came in daily,"
good,Rite aid helps you you develop your services and ameliorate your greeting experiences. This is a place where your relation with customers make you grow tremendously
good,is an ok place to work the pay inst great at all and just a little bit above minium wage great first job or for someone fresh out of highschool they do offer benefits but they are bare bones minimium
good,"Everyday is a different day.  Some days are fast paced and extremely challenging, while other days are extremely slow and simple.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the mean customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is creating friendships with the nice customers."
good,"I love my job because of how much I've learned at no cost to me. But I've been making close to nothing for the entire duration of my working there. I feel there are too many responsibilities for the wage, also, hours are not readily available."
good,"Relaxed atmosphere.  Pleasant employees. However, there was too much partiality between employees.  Nice employee discount.    "
good,"It has seen a lot of changes which has been a real challenge and killed the moral of the employees.  Due to the constant threats of loss of jobs and store closures and business downturns, it is difficult to stay upbeat and positive.  Management treats all employees like you are a thief, and suspect.  It is not a nourishing environment."
good,"The hardest part about this job was they cut hours when sales are down , something you have no control over. The cashiers have too they bottle return."
good,"I was a Pharmacy Technician at Rite Aid. While I enjoyed working with fellow employees, the environment was stressful. I believe this was mostly because we were short staffed quite often. Other than that, it was a new experience, and I'm thankful I learned a lot at this job."
good,Easy work. Always something to do which makes the time fly by. Lack of communication between departments and upper management. Poor health insurance coverage.
good,The turn around for technicians is high and compensation is low. This is a great job for those looking to gain experience in the pharmacy. Management was very willing to work around school schedules and work with those who have more than one job.
good,"Typical day at work: Usually the same task in rotation for the week. Customer service, inventory, scheduling, store maintenance."
good,The overall most difficult part about the job would have to be when customers are extremely inpatient. Customers become very frustrated when they cant receive their medication when they want it. A typical day would be expressed as starting off a bit slow and easy to a building up face paced environment where all must be on their toes in order to get all the medication filled on time.
good,"The Typical Day at Rite Aid is very hectic at times especially when working with ones self. Which happens with me, but overall it is not a bad place to work if you are starting out in the work environment looking to gain experience in the work force."
good,Very tedious work and hard on the body over time. The environment is very dull and loud which can be a bit overwhelming and stuffy at times. No sun light which helps you lose track of the day.
good,"I typically enjoyed my time as a pharmacy tech, the job was tedious at times but the people  I worked with were fun. The patients that came to our pharmacy made my day at least once a week in some way."
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers at the Brookings Inn, I believe is means great deal to always keep a positive attitude with everyone in your  atmosphere. It is also important to put in maximum effort, even at the worst of times. It is crucial to be present and be on time for every work day. Also, must always be prepared and enthusiastic to learn new things and overcome new challenges to grow and develop with the company to the prime of my ability."
good,"Coming from clothing retail into drug retail is quite a change. There are so many more in depth issues you would never have to deal with in clothing retail such as insurance and medications, pushing flu shots, and creating western union money transfers. In my particular situation it is the management style of the store I am currently at that I do not agree with."
good,"Love interacting with people and co-workers are great but can be overwhelming at times due to skeleton crew and job expectations.  Rate of pay is lacking for work expected, no benefits or paid vacation time until one year of employment at 30 hours per week have been completed.  Company only observes holidays with shortened hours but always open."
good,Worked here as a pharmacy technician while in school. The wages were low however the hours were few enough and flexible enough to accommodate my school schedule.
good,It is great if you are looking for a job to just pay bills while looking for some other work or to have second job to live in today's economy. There is a lot of room for improvement like any other work place but I don't see why they ask us for our opinions if they don't listen to them anyways. It also makes no sense how some of the operations are don't but at the end of the day work needs to be done and somebody needs to do all this grunt work so the products go out to all the stores for the consumers.
good,At times it was nice and a good place to work. Then there were times it was average. Just have to be willing to work at all times of the day and plan to work weekends and holidays.
good,My typical day consists of shifts that are usually 8 hours.i would have to stand behind the counter for the most part of the day. i usually worked till closing at which time i would have to sweep and mop the entire store by myself. the staff is very kind and easy to work with.
good,"the people were good to work with..."
good,"A typical day at work involves giving the customer an enjoyable shopping experience. It can either be a busy day or a slow day. There is always work to be done, and sometimes it can get stressful. The hardest part of my job is my schedule is never the same, it varies often; as do the hours. It would be easier if it could stay the same. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the people I like."
good,no communication from corporate to stores.  I would get different answers from different managers and nobody seemed to know what was going on ever.  Everyone said that's the Rite Aid way........
good,the store I worked at used to be so nice the manager was the best person ever we was a family unit the hardest part people was always comeing in the store stealing
good,Worked at the store for 2 years in that time we were robbed and gun point twice and I myself was assaulted by customers. Management refused to give us any security except for a temporary guard who was only there for a short time. If you are looking for a partime job its a good job but if they ask you to be a supervisor youre better off declining. they'll give you a 50 cent raise but work you twice as hard.
good,"Greet customers and take care of their needs, fill prescriptions, maintain a clean and tidy work environment, answer phones"
good,"Overall, the front end employees and manager are nice to work with, but the department where I worked at was not a pleasant place to be. It was horrible. I come to work already tense & stress."
good,"I would say this would be a good job for a part-time student, but don't work here expecting to move up while maintaining a certain level of sanity. I work at one of the Beverly Hills locations, and if you are aware of the demographic that frequents this particular store (besides employees of the surrounding places of work), then you can do the math as to how enjoyable working at Rite Aid can be. I would say do this job for a year and then find something better. This is not the type of employment that will fulfill you at the end of the day."
good,"Working for this company has taught me that experience and education doesn't ensure advancements.  Promotions are based on who you know and how quickly you apply to internal postings. I have however learned many valuable skills in the accounting field which can benefit my future endeavors. I would have liked to learn much more, or to be cross trained in other areas of the accounting department instead of being taught a specialized job."
good,"The people I work with and see on a daily basis are great; however, this job has no bearing on my level of education and leaves me feeling unfulfilled."
good,"Happy,hard worker,experience,knowledge,multi-task,and dependable."
good,"Rite Aid pharmacy does not provide the best benefits for their employees, however, it is not a bad place to work. Our pharmacy is organized, and motivated to help our patients in a timely matter whilst providing excelling customer service. While at this company, I gained a working knowledge of medical terminology, and aspired to become certified as a technician."
good,"A typical day at work would include answering phone calls and filing prescriptions for customers, as well as inputting scripts, counting out medication, and running the register. Other duties include filing prescriptions, cycle counting, and billing insurance companies - calling and speaking to insurance companies may be required for certain situations such as requesting Prior Authorizations and refill requests. Contacting doctors offices may also be required for refill requests on medications, and for Medicare Part B DWO forms."
good,Assisted the pharmacist on duty with entering and processing prescription orders. Enjoyed other peers and learned various things about different insurances. Developed execptional customer service skills.
good,"I started working at Rite Aid as a team associate, but I moved up due to my hard work and willingness to learn.  I caught on quickly to the cross training, and I spent time working side by side with my manager to perfect my sales/retail skills.  I worked a wide range of tasks.  I ran a cashier’s shift, I managed shifts, I unloaded and stocked freight, I helped the pharmacist when needed, I processed deposits, I made orders and also returned items, I conducted inventory checks, etc.  I learned so much through this job position, and to this day I use the skills I learned from Rite Aid to perform my daily duties."
good,"Back when i first got hired, it was a great new learning experience. As years went by the job became more and more mundane. The people i met were great and we worked well together. The best way to describe rite aid, its good to start out but not stay in my opinion."
good,"I put away the daily shipments and I cashier, I also count the meds and I send out deliveries and mail med's out. I am also scanning documents"
good,"I feel that some retraining could take place for management.  Also, many changes are on the way because of the new corporation buyout. The overall experience has been good and advancement is always available."
good,"Friendly co workers but management is not fair, they kept hiring new people (shortening the present employee's hours), that had been there longer. This job is only good for high school teens who want to earn extra money while attending their senior year to prep them for the working society. However, management positions may be different."
good,"Too lean, but not unlike other corporations of that size.  Decent compensation and benefits.  Talented senior team.  A bit antiquated."
good,"The job is not bad but management abuses their power. The pharmacists are good workers but the person in charge of scheduling is very unprofessional and plays favorites. Aside from that, there is very little opportunity for advancement and the pay is close to minimum wage. The job is not difficult but the lack of coordination makes it much more stressful than it should be. This would not be a bad place to work if they were more organized, offered a more competitive pay, and rewarded hard workers."
good,"The job itself is quite simple and easy. I've learned being there, that you must have patience and be alert of others around you. Not everyone has the same mentality and thinking process as yourself. Management is pretty decent there. Co-workers are ok for the most part, although at times, some tend to do unbelievable things. The hardest part of the job is trying to maintain high energy throughout the day to achieve your production for the day."
good,"•	Located assigned cash register at beginning of shift and counted money in drawer to ensure that they contained the correct amount of money and adequate supplies of change."
good,"Great co-workers, and customer focused environment. Restrictive policies make work more difficult and unnecessarily stressful (ID people if they look under 65 is a hassle). "
good,"Too busy to work "
good,"A typical day at work if it was either morning shifts/ after noon/ evening was alright not the best job I had but I had to make the best out of it.  I learned from this job on having patient with customers when it came to ""the price being the wrong price"" so as a cashier I would have to either walk with them to where they got it from and read the label to them and explain they have to have certain points to get it for the lowest price, and some customers would say that's false advertisement all I was able to say ""I'm sorry"". The hardest part of the job was managers thinking they can be in the office all shift long or go have a cigarette outside."
good,Great customer service. Great product selection. Fast friendly check out. Photo services on site. Customer assurance and satisfaction is huge in positions where interaction with others in required.
good,"Ok place to work.  I learned the harder you worked at the job, the easier the job became."
good,You are going to work hard and you have to maintain one hundred percent accuracy. Mistakes can kill people.  The greatest part is helping the really sweet people. But the administration doesn't back you up as employees and the health care is minute.
good,"Not very happy with the overall company. Benefits are ok, compensation is great if you work in a store.  upper management only cares are upper management"
good,"I was a shift supervisor.  While I did like my job there, the pay was very low, I was never guaranteed the hours that I needed to survive.  There was very little life/work balance as I was expected to be available on my days off due to my position."
good,"Worked with great people, and was able to obtain on the job training."
good,"invoices, out of dates, damage, overstock, ordering, supply ordering, stocking, cashier, deposit, program sets"
good,This was an okay job. I met some very nice people while employed here. It also help me develop more patients with people.
good,"Engage with customers, to better their life through wellness. I learned that a huge number of people do not get vaccinated. Management and co-workers are supportive. Hardest part of my job is getting new pharmacy customers. I enjoy traveling the most in my job."
good,Allowed me to test my patience with everyday shananigans and disrespect. Overall i become hard to any insults being racial or personal; this job placed me in situations to where i could prove to myself that i can handle and deal with anything thrown in my direction and coach others on how to deal with similar problems.
good,"Typical day is a very fast-paced one. I would come in to work with prescription waiting to be filled, customers waiting in line to pick up and drop off prescription, and at the same time customers waiting at the drive-thru. "
good,"If you're starting out and need a job, this is a good starter job.  Not great, but good.  From what I've heard, the starting rate has raised but it's still a retail job.  You're constantly on your feet and are not allowed to sit down or stand still unless you're processing a customer's order.  It's worth it with the pay increase but you won't be advancing up the corporate ladder.  Your best hope is to make it to the pharmacy in the back."
good,"typical day included cleaning the bathrooms, stocking merchandise, cashiering, cleaning, and answering the phones"
good,A good place to learn how to accurately work in a fast paced environment within a team of people.
good,"company had a high turn over rate, did not value its employees"
good,A typical day at work with Rite Aid was a fast paced but fun and exciting place. you meet many different people and learn a lot about cash handling as well as customer service. The hardest part of my job was sanitation. the restrooms were very dirty. I have to say the most enjoyable part was the customers. They were for the most part very friendly and out going people.
good,"*Call insurance companies about prior authorizations, vacation overrides, and problem resolutions for prescriptions. "
good,My days were usually busy and dramatic. Customers screaming for their medications and complaining about co-pays.
good,"Very busy "
good,"Rite Aid has poor control of their management ( This is just from my experience, not all managers)  The main office in Pennsylvania has no idea what it's employees experience from day to day.  Yes, customers do come first, but most of the time, to the detriment of the employees."
good,"My job was to always make sure the customers were taken care of and help get prescriptions out in a timely manner. The main store manager was fun and enjoyable to work with. The Pharmacy manager that I last worked with had too many ""favorites"" that could do nothing wrong or for that matter got away with too much. I always enjoyed meeting and helping the different customers that came in."
good,"Your success or failure at this position will depend solely on who the pharmacist  is. I have worked under pharmacists who contributed positively to my work experience, and were willing to explain things to me, and another who demeaned me to a point where I lost all my confidence and realized that I would never succeed working under her."
good,"On a typical day I completed cash, credit, debit, check, and EBT transactions. Performed sales price put up, and price teardown. Put new products on shelves, and restocked shelves. Processed damages and outdates. Put together product displays. Processed film for one hour photo service. Completed maintenance and shut down of photo equipment. Sorted cans and bottles. Restocked and faced the cooler. Executed planograms for shelves. Completed closing protocol and objectives. Store Management was unreliable, and put a lot of tasks and responsibilities of their own on lower level management and employees. Most of my co-workers were helpful and friendly. Unpredictable work schedule and hours, was hard to schedule anything around it, and lack of pay.The most enjoyable part of the job was learning a lot about customer service."
good,Most management was not very consistent. Blamed the most less knowledgeable employee about negative things that happen. Job compensation and hours were not able to assist in everyday living as far as keeping bills paid and having gas. 
good,My typical day at work was mostly assisting customers with finding things throughout the store. I learned how to set up planogram and I was good at it too. Management and co-workers were very nice and productive in all ways. The hardest part of the job is having rude customers and the most enjoyable part is getting a customer what they want and what they need.
good,"Typical day was filling prescriptions, ordering supplies, assisting customers, answering phones, and being a cashier.  I learned how to fill prescriptions.  Management was good.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was filling the prescriptions when we really got busy, had to be very careful and accurate, the most enjoyable part of the the job was the discounts."
good,It's a good company to work for. I had a good experience with management. I didn't like the fact that they only start you off as part time. There is chance for advancement if you are willing to put in the time and work.
good,Very productive with customers.I loved the enter action with them. I also enjoyed working with the other employes.
good,Very busy and not enough cashiers for me to get my list of jobs done in a timely manner
good,The manager that was at our location got moved to another store leaving us with no manager for 4 months. They finally promoted someone at our store for lack of finding anyone else to take the position. During that 4 months the store was highly unorganized (and still is). We had 3 people quit during that time and being without a store manager no hiring could be done. So it was up to us few employees to fill in the necessary hours.
good,Even though safety procedures are a very important aspect for any position I felt that Rite Aid went a little over the top. I did not lock out a motor switch for a conveyor as I felt it was almost impossible for someone to turn it on or off. They would of had to slide up side ways on ladder railing to get to it. That in itself would not have been a safe thing to do.
good,i like the work but not the location of this store it was a good experience but i feel my education is worth much more than they offered
good,"A very challenging atmosphere specially due to lack of ancillary help. I enjoyed the responsibilities and challenges for almost 20 years working as a pharmacy manager, but recently due to financial crisis for the coeporate the downsizing has led to stressful work atmosphere due to lack of help. I maintained the excellent customer service with 10-15 minutes wait but the managerial work began to get overwhelming due to which I was forcrd to resign after 20 years of dedicated service mainly because i could not compromise with customer service."
good,Typical store associate job. I enjoyed working with everyone there. Management was awesome...
good,there was no advancement opportunities given to me every day i had so much work to do and everyone else sat on there butts and didnt help me
good,"I enjoyed what I did in the pharmacy department. I enjoyed the customers, but didn't like the way the management was handling the store."
good,"Typical work day consisted of inputting new prescriptions, processing prescriptions, filling orders, and ringing out customers for their purchases. Highly demanding job and busy day-to-day operations"
good,"I have been treated unfairly upon the termination of my job, even though I dedicated my time and energy to grow a company business."
good,The Union really tried to interfere with day to day activities. Be watchful of older employees with seniority and trying to convince them to be team players.
good,I couldn't live on the pay.  The hours varied.  The job itself is very easy and I often did not feel challenged. The people I worked with were very nice.
good,Rite aid should pay the employees better salaries and benefits. its a great place to work if you only looking for a part time job. Overtime is not allowed.
good,"You will need a lot of patience for this job, it really depends on who you work with. Some Managers are flexible,  others want you to slave and kiss but in order to get a promotion or good review, worse part is the pay because you technically would be doing the same work as a assistant manager, however get paid less. You will be used most of the time."
good,"Rite Aid was one of my fun jobs, I learned a lot working there. Thats where I built my customer service skills, learned how to price, stock etc. I think the downfall was their pay was horrible & that's what caused me to depart."
good,"Great place to work.,  Associates are encouraged to give the highest level of customer service and engage with customers. Retail store is a great opportunity to start and make it a business career ."
good,At first the management was great and the workplace was a good place to be. Then the people in management changed and things started taking a turn for the worst and many people left.
good,Management changed all the time. They did not let us run our stores as we wanted. There was not enough support when reaching out to management. I had great job satisfaction helping my patients.
good,"Overall, I enjoy my job at Rite Aid. My co-workers are great and I have a wonderful relationship with my customers. Management has completely ruined the work environment."
good,"Good people to work with.  Very slow pace environment and VERY poor payrates for hourly employees.  It says something about a company's need for overhaul of wages when you could get a job in fast food and make more money.  I had over 10 years customer service experience, and and was offered below what I could make at Wendy's, for example."
good,I'll go in clock in . Is start buying stock in the ice cream and then I would order for the ice cream clean the restrooms go through and face the whole store then I would go to an order in stock liquor now wash outside
good,"I went to work for the company as a favor for a friend, at first it seemed like a good company but as the buyout from Walgreens got closer the quality of management and work conditions worsened"
good,The district manger dont care about her workers.. the store has no working AC unit in the summer months and no heat during the winter months. The only concern is sales . And the pay is never equal for people atvthe same  level
good,"This place of employment is great for those who need experience in retail for other jobs. Its slow easy work, a little time consuming but overall not a bad place to work. however you cant make a living off of it"
good,"The stores in the Northeast are being rolled into the Walgreen's system and are then usually closed. Sadly, competition for consumers and opportunities for pharmacists and technicians will be extremely diminished."
good,"I have nothing to say at the current moment. Rite was a great place once upon a time, Thank you for understanding nothing to say at this point...……….."
good,"There was a regular customer that would come in all the time, we knew he was a transient but always acted accordingly. On this particular evening something was off about him. He proceeded to my liquor aisle and selected a small bottle of vodka, then proceeds to grab an orange juice and a bad of flaming hot chips. After he made all his selections he proceeded to walk to exit of the store. At this point I see him walking towards the exit at which point in time I ask if he would like to pay for the items he had in his hands. At which point he responded to me oh no this is my store I can take what I want. At which point I stood in front of him and told him not today. He tried to get a little aggressive at which point I took back the items while he was cursing and telling me I was a racist. Made a really big ordeal and tried to file a complaint against me with corporate.  Since I followed every protocol I had learned In my training I was able to proof that I indeed was in the right with my actions. I even got an award for it. Truly a fond memory I have."
good,It was a good job to begin with. I stayed there 5 years and they always made promise for raise opportunities but never came through with any. The had trouble keeping new employees. It did teach me how to do tasks in a timely manner. Tasks were high speed and prescriptions had to be done in under 15  minutes.
good,"This would be a nice tempary job, not somewhere you want to be for long. To be fairly honest if your not part of the management team then its not worth it. Don’t expect overtime beacuse they definitely dont want you to receive any extra hours weekly."
good,I have enjoyed working for this company for almost 18 years. It has definitely seen its share of ups and downs. I hope that the company as a whole is able to make it for years to come in such a competitive market.
good,My experience with Rite Aid started off positive but quickly turned negative when my manager wouldn't teach me anything.  Then I was promised that I would have my own store and I did not
good,"I was a forklift operator on 1st shift at the Rite Aid Distribution Center in Fairless Hills, PA. My start time was at 5:30am and my end time was supposed to be 2pm, but they had mandatory overtime basically everyday, so I wouldn't get done until like 3:30-4pm. They expect you to make rate by picking a certain amount of items per hour. Managers there were not the nicest and everyone who works there seems like they hate their job."
good,The only thing that I personally don’t like about working at Rite Aid is that it’s not a team oriented job. I like working with team members makes it more enjoyable.
good,"the job itself is fairly easy. cashier and stock person are easy tasks. the environment can be very stressful due to poor management, lack of communication and incoherent co workers. "
good,I was hired in as a MIT (Manager In Training) in March of 2007 and had to quit in June because they CLOSED all 30+Nevada store locations and gave 60 day notice. They didn't assist with relocating individuals or offer Transfers to out of state locations. Very poor leadership and Communication in 2007.
good,Demasiadas horas de trabajo sin ninguna remuneración moral o economica
good,"Rite Aid's motto is 'with us, it's personal', and that's reflected in interactions with customers, coworkers, and corporate staff.  There exists advancement opportunities; entry level positions aren't dead-end jobs."
good,"The store I worked  at was quite busy, so it was expected of us to serve larger quantity of customers rather then quality of the service. Often times there were substantial amount of work load for one to tackle in a single shift. So often it was quite stressful. However, the bright side of  this would be that it allowed me to grow through all this adversity. Also the staff that I worked with were great people. Each with interesting background and unique story."
good,Only worked for this company with limited training. Management was not the best for training. Did not receive a employee handbook or instructions. The training room was not the best room and the computer was outdated and slow.
good,An ok place to work at sometimes...didn't like the long hours and some customers very rude and nasty overall an ok place. Co workers were okay as well
good,"Great place to work, but salary not the best. Great staff. Hours were long and mandatory over-time. Managers had to be in the store every Saturday, this caused me to miss out on a lot of functions. Left for this reason mainly."
good,"a typical day at work was stocking the store and/or replacing stock to proper places."
good,"a day at work was a day at work all business oriented, we did have some good managers and some bad ones too.  I worked there for 5 years and had 5managers"
good,"It's really one of those ""It depends on the boss"" things. Some are good to work with, others are lazy. Overall it was fine, but it just wears on you after awhile."
good,"Definitely a great job for initial training and learning. Terrible place to work if you are trying to make a living, no raises, and very few opportunities to move up with in the organization."
good,The company was lacking direction and consistency within the retail stores. Managers were not good at being efficient. Stores always had problem with inventory loss and very little integrity with coworkers and the company.
good,"Depending on the location, management is okay. Medina location however is awful. Management with NO experience, always behind, the store was always getting flagged for not doing work, get treated badly if you don't do all the work, friends get promotions with no experience. You have to also self learn like 90-95% of everything."
good,"Most of the staff members are friendly and understanding"
good,"As long as internal goals were met (eg number of scripts processed, number of immunizations billed, amount of beer sold) and the managers got their annual bonuses, all was well."
good,"most days all there is to do is sit at the register except to front face the store, breaks 30 min cant leave unless more than 2 people in the store working"
good,I used to love working for this company but in recent years the management has become very poor. There is no balance for home/work. Management handles issues in a very demeaning manner.
good,Management was moved around several times through the years that I was there and there was a constant need for reinforcing rules within the different stores and associates.
good,Great company to work for but far too many politics where in 2018  ethical conduct is still very questionable by upper management.  Let’s just say many cover ups by Corporate.
good,"Rite aid is where you go to earn extra cash, but not a place to make a living. It’s not professional, the management team doesn’t know how to approach people most of the time."
good,Rite Aid is not all that bad... the pay is horrible and the annual raise is no where near enough. That should not even be considered a raise. Holidays and benefits are not the best either.
good,"Hard to keep employees because pay is low, work is stressful, and people in charge are backbiting gossips. Too much personal drama at work. Good benefits, but at the cost of your personal life. I still try to recommend Rite Aid because people are clamoring for employment."
good,"Some days work is stressful but most of the time it is exciting and fun. There is something to learn everyday and the company provides training by computer based sessions. The workplace is always competitive and focused. The hardest part of the job is the stress and need for multi-tasking, but the most enjoyable part is the gratitude from the customers and feeling of satisfaction from helping the needy."
good,"A typical day at work isn't bad. I come In with a positive attitude and as the day goes by I keep that same attitude for the sake of my job. I've learned to be more patient with not just customers but with coworkers, I learned customer service skills over the past 5 years of working thee. The management could be better. My first year of working there it wasn't that bad because the store manager was pretty fair but the shift supervisors made decisions based on personal feelings. The second and third year I moved to a different store because I moved to a different borough and the manager at the time wasn't the best to work with at all. By the end of the third year going into my fourth year, the store manager was replaced and the manager we got was pretty good. She was fair and cooperated with everyones needs and worked with her team. The current manager now is not fair at all and is making up his rules as he goes along."
good,"I applied to be a shift supervisor which was what was on my application. I met all the requirements as speculated and i was told that I had to complete a job survey before they hired me which i did. I got called for an interview and was told to complete some lab work to complete the job process. When i came in on the first day i was told i had to start off as a cashier and a girl who was there before me basically had to become a SS before i could. I tried to understand this because i believed i needed to understand their system. i was getting peanuts of 7.75 which was lower than my previous job even with my experience and education. Moving forward, its been 3 months in, i have had my hours cut, sometimes i would go without working for weeks, a new guy which was hired after me which i know for a fact    knows the manager is been given more hours. All in all its an easy job to do but its just bad management which i am definitely going to confront."
good,"It’s a nice place to work, but not anough employees for how busy the store is. The store needs more hours. They also need to provide a better lunch/break"
good,"Wish they had worked with my after school activities. I had track and was let go, because I was running a race, When hired I told them I was on a track team."
good,"Some of the people that comes in Rite Aid helps in how the company treats its employers. If you have a good team to work with, it also makes up for how the company treats the employers."
good,I wasn't very happy working at this job. it seemed that the management and senior management were not often on the same page. Supervisory positions were given to people with very little experience and were not removed from those positions when they could not complete the job.
good,"It was an ok place to work, just no advancement opportunities. Work was good for a few years but needed something more. Day to day was a regular retail job"
good,Warehouse working making sure workers get what they need to send to customers.Mangement was not fair an u could not move up in company if you wasn’t liked
good,"The pay here is ridiculously low. They expect licensed Techs to works for close to minimum wage. Yearly raises are a joke. But, if you need a paycheck, its a job."
good,"The store I worked at has closed. The only full time positions available were for management, pharmacy and some shift supervisors. I liked working with the public and thoroughly enjoyed the diversity of my customers."
good,Very bad pay for what you put up with. Not enough training on the cash register. Union takes $20 out of every paycheck. very boring when your not busy
good,"Managment could have been a lot better. Very low wages, not worth what is expected of you. Communication was not open and available. A lot is expected of each employee, sometimes too much."
good,When you have poor management mixed in with employees that don’t have the job requirements but want a set schedule don’t mix but majority of the customers are sweet
good,I wish I still was still Rite Aid but Walgreens took over our store so now it's Walgreens and I miss ready and I rather work for Rite Aid and Walgreens I've had a lot of experience with Rite Aid I know how to do a whole lot of stuff for a supervising holding Keys open stores doing truck unload truck running register I had to open and close the store I did truck every Friday at 3 a.m. in the morning alone in the truck putting stocking everything deposits
good,"My typical day involved all of the normal/ usual pharmacy duties. I would verify prescription that the techs entered. I would complete PMPs, MTMs, and POCs to better help with patient compliance. The most enjoyable part of my daily job would be interacting with the customers. I take great pride in exceptional customer service. I think that is very important to give great customer service, learn each customers name, get to know them, their family. In doing this, it will make them want to come back."
good,the reason on why people leave rite aid is because of the poor management  and respect. i enjoyed working there until i meet new managers and were rude and very unbearable to work with.
good,"Typical work week is extremely busy and fast paced. Diverse job tasks related to customer service, data entry, inventory control, etc. "
good,The job was good for what it was. I was able to move around inside the company and take on many different positions. It was a great place to work as a student as there is flexibility in the schedule and job requirements.
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is the diversity in customers that you get to meet and interact with. offering assistance to customers and co-workers is very self rewarding.
good,"This company is not a bad company. It's just that people higher than store manager abuse their power."
good,"Horrible place to work at, manager was horrible, staff was rude, and was unfair. Never got a meal break and was constantly under stress. I would never recommend it."
good,Worked at both kind of stores. Deal with people stealing. Pharmacist thing they run the place. Keep that photo machine going and get those cigarette counts done!
good,"Overall, a manageable yet fast-paced place to work at, where a day there feels like time is moving slower. Each day is hectic, and especially when understaffed, expect to do more than just cashier work. Depending on coworkers, they'll either make it bearable or worse to work, so make sure to scope the employees there before considering."
good,A nice job to have as your first but you will quickly want to find another after dealing with stress from retail and the various customers and situations you encounter every day.
good,"This is a good first job for anyone looking for a part-time job, has a great life to work ratio. Great for when you are active and are either going to school or working another part-time job"
good,"Work life balance doesn't really exist.  I was ""promoted"" to a better store and it turned out to be a lateral move with much longer driving time and longer business hours.  My stress and mental health levels have gotten out of hand in the year I have been at this new store.  I voiced this concern to my manager and nothing has been done about it.  I feel pharmacy associates are taken much better care of.  When they want a vacation coverage is found for them.  In the front end we are expected to make it work and do 14hr days to cover vacations if we can't find coverage."
good,"Management did not do a good job training other managers, favoritism was on of the reasons why I did not want to come back. People who were there before always got better scheduling hours. Too much gossip and was not a very professional environment at times. Loved the energy of some of the customers, loved the discounts. Hate the pay, you do alot of heavy lifting and work alot with your hands and not enough pay."
good,"Management lacked communication skills with their employees, training and positive feedback and praise and encouragement to grow with the company. I wanted to take tech classes to become a pharmacy tech and I attended 3 or 4 classes that were never documented even though I signed in each time."
good,"Typical day at work starts at 06:30 setting up outbound staffing"
good,Ok overall need better benifets for employees. Fast paced in pharmacy which is nice and customer service you meet a lot of nice people. Manager is good. Hours are not up to par as they could be.
good,You manage products in bulk and take time out of your day to help customers from time to time.  Management at Riteaid is stock work that often is compensated with pay worse than that found at warehouse jobs that require you to do the same thing.  If you're not strong and short (so you don't have to bend as much) look elsewhere.
good,The customers are great its how upper mgr treat you that's sad there is no thanks or good job said they expect you to put them 1st your kids 2nd god forbid you get sick miss a day or go home early its usually a rite up the pay isnt well you only get a 3% raise once a year
good,"You will get 40 hours a week but no set schedule, one day you are opening the store and the next you could be closing. Schedules are all over the place, one day you can be opening the store, the next you could be closing the store. Its a great place to work if you dont have a family at home. For breaks you either get a 15 min paid or punch out for 30 mins but then that means you cut into your 40 hours given to you."
good,"I am thankful to have a full time job with benefits that doesn't pay minimum wage. That being said, we are horribly understaffed because rite aid doesn't take good care of their employees. Spouses who have the option to take insurance through their employer are no longer covered, even if their benefits suck. I am currently doing the work of 2-3 people while not being properly compensated for it. It's a stressful environment. There is also no opportunity to advance. If you don't like where you are, too bad. There is also no constant schedule. I hardly see my family, but need to pay the bills. This job is better than nothing, but I don't recommend it."
good,I open and closed the store. We did daily deposits and counted all the cash drawers. We had a truck every week. We did daily paperwork to check prices in the store. We did western union at this store where they could send large amount of money or pay a bill. Every March we had to count everything in our store to get ready for inventory. I helped in the pharmacy when needed.
good,"It is a very diverse workplace with many opportunities to learn new skills."
good,"good place to work , alot of turn over, alot of work with very little help which I tended to like. as manager it was always about ""sales"" which was reall stressful for our workers. was always friendly to Couponers, which boosted sales greatly. we would then get extreme couponers which caused a lot of coupon policeys to come into questions ."
good,the job was simple the employee conduct not so much management was unskilled at times felt like they had no idea what they were doing benefits were decent pay was extremely low
good,"What can I say, it is just another cashier position. occasionally, it is required to do stocking and audits of old products but that is about it. One plus I can say is the 20% discount I was receiving on all products except the government regulated alcohol and tobacco."
good,"went to work clocked in did my job to the best of my abilities, did assigned work took care of any issues as they arose clocked out and went home at closing"
good,"While in school, this is a great place to work. The work is routine once you have learned all there is. Patients/costumers are of a colorful diverse community."
good,"My boss gave me the time I needed to study as I went to school, and the rest of my coworkers were very supportive of everything I did. However, higher management cared nothing for us in the store, and often put far more work on us than manageable. They were quite souless, so be careful if you work for Rite Aid, as higher management is poisonus."
good,"During the 5 years I was employed, I worked random shifts and hours every day was different. This is not a good job if you have children as the hours and shifts are never consistent and if you ask for certain shifts that fit your lifestyle the other employees get upset... especially ones who have been with the company for years. I worked front end and in the pharmacy and both are the same hour wise- always different. I was considered part time for 5 years and most weeks i'd work 30+ hours and some i'd be lucky to get 16. and because I wasn't considered full time even though I usually worked full time hours I never qualified for benefits. It's a good job for someone with out a family"
good,When I was employed for Rite Aid I was responsible for runner the front register and providing incoming people with a high standard of customer service. When I wasn't cashing people out I was walking the store organizing and re stocking shelves. The staff and regular customers made the job bearable and sometimes even fun.  I found the hardest part about this job was working the most random 4 hour shifts 6 days a week making it hard for me to have a balance between my work and life outside. Though I can say there were several customers that came in every single day that in a way I became friends with and we would always have something to laugh about.
good,"A typical day at work includes directing the cashiers, completing planograms, going to the bank and scanning in vendors. Overall it's an okay place to work."
good,I was an cashier I checked out customers and stocked shelves and unloaded truck. Rite Aid management was alright and the work culture was clean. I enjoyed getting to interact with customers.
good,Stressful...unfairly compensated...no room for advancement...the pharmacists want you to do all of their work...pharmacists are lazy and expect you to do everything.
good,The great thing about this job is there is repetition with task but what changes are customers. It was very difficult to get promoted from inside the company. They would rather hire from outside the company then promote from within.
good,"Would help if the company took the role of the certified technician more serious. $12 an hour is a complete joke. Will never attract and especially keep talent other pharmacist with the current level of pay. Long hours coupled with constant no-show employees, make working there miserable"
good,"Began in Boston MA, didn't enjoy the work given but the people were nice. Relocated to Akron OH, Just didn't have the same connection. They were gracious to allow me to transfer, and the job paid better than some. Management could improve communication skills."
good,Great opportunities to move up in the company. Locations can be hard. As a cashier they will not cover parking expenses if there is no lot. Turnover rate is high. Even when you get a 30 minute lunch you have to wait in long lines if you purchase out of store.
good,"Very fast paced and if you can't keep up you will definitely fall behind an be able to multitask efficiently. A very easy job to get the hang of quick,"
good,"open 77 hours per week with only 20 hours of tech help per week.so most of the time you have to answer 3 phone lines, run the cash register, fill all the prescriptions, etc,  you are allowed 2 weeks of vacation but almost 100 of the 365 days of the year are automatically blocked off.  as of april of 2017 there were no weeks available to ask off."
good,Working at Rite aid wasn't horrible. As a cashier I got to do more things then just check out customers which was nice. Getting set hours and time off wasn't difficult. But that's based on management at the store. but still little benefits and not many chances for advancement.
good,"Store is given inadequate hours to schedule employees causing an excess of stress on workers picking up work that is more suitable with extra workers. Another result of this is if the workers are unable to manage the workflow due to being understaffed, the patients are stuck waiting for longer times than needed."
good,"a very stressful job,they want you to do a lot,not much room to more up.you meet a of good people. they need more patience with people,sometime they are young , going on first job.you do learn a lot."
good,"A typical day was very busy since it was a high volume store in an affluent area. The customers were at times very snobby, but it was nothing unbearable. Management could have actually done their job. As a cashier, I received many tasks, but nothing ever seemed to see completion. The best part of working at this Rite Aid is the fact it was in New Orleans which is a very lively city!"
good,"early shifts ,fast paced,hard work ,loading boxes all day good people , warm up exercises in the morning. gotta keep your eyes and ears open for forklifts,pallet jacks etc , moving at fast speeds and around corners"
good,I enjoy the people I work with as with any customer service job there are always going to be certain people who you can't please but overall a good place to work.
good,Only worked there as a cashier for about a year and left there because I was making more in 8 hours of overtime at AEO than in one week at Rite Aid.
good,Staff are overworked and underpaid. Vacation time requests not met. Employees are not appreciated by upper level management.
good,"The hours are pretty inflexible because there aren't too many employees, and they seem to only want a few employees working at once, especially at closing time. It can be stressful to handle all the customers when it's just a cashier and a supervisor working at once on evenings. I'm told that not all Rite Aids had this problem since they had more employees though."
good,I haven't gotten a raise in the year i've been there the. managers are ok but the company as a whole is selfish. ive worked hard  in the past year but it hasn't been noticed
good,"It's an okay company to work for, great if you plan to stay a while, you can progress after a year of working here if your an associate. Managers are considerate for their employees personal lives"
good,"Great company at first then I became disabled due to a work related injury that was never reported and from then on I was ridiculed and demeaned my my fellow coworker's and supervisors and considered a burden always being told I should just give up and quit! HR never believed me even after I made several attempts at meetings with them, (I was considered a problem, and I made it up). Over now moved on, and I  just hope other people do not have to go through what I've had to go through"
good,Overall a good place to work...they open at 7 which is ridiculous as you get no customers or one..the company runs the labor budget on a shoestring budget with high demands getting projects done on time..the theft is huge and at one time a security personnel was hired but then rite aid cancelled the contract..dumb move...the store has one male on staff...descrimination issue
good,"Always busy. I learned to enter prescription information into the computer, refill prescription for patients. My co-workers were just unique individuals. There was not anything hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of my job was serving our patients."
good,good team work among associates and management. good work/life balance. out dated systems. closed minded on new ideas.
good,"its very repetetive, you do the same thing every week. job gets pretty boring. the job is really dependant on management if they are bad so is the job."
good,First job with training which was good - Learned to put school learned skills to work in a fairly fast paced environment.  Co workers and customers pleasant.  Scheduling of hours was fair. Training on their computer system was not complicated and easy to master. Commute was long to this location so not a long term job solution for me.
good,"As a pharmacy technician, the wage was very low. Without seniority, I got my hours cut a lot. It wasn't a very good experience for me."
good,"Typical day at work is unexpected"
good,"Rite aid has the resources to be a great company, but they do not care enough about their employees.  They have a lot of very good associates but the work environment is so bad that most of the employees are unhappy."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of opening and closing the store, having access to the safe and making sure it stayed at its normal amount. I counted drawers up and down (including pharmacy's). The hours where too long- some days I would work 11/12 hours and others I would work 4. I didn't mind the long days if they were more consistent and I felt like I wasn't being paid enough for the effort  I was putting forth. I was in charge of the entire cosmetic section which included stocking and making sure products were ordered when we ran out."
good,"Resolve customer complaints regarding sales and service."
good,"I worked with customers"
good,the job is very physically demanding and the compensation doesn't justify that. you have to work 18 months at 10 dollars and hour doing a TREMENDOUS amount of labor.
good,"A typical day at work is making out the daily tour sheet for the cashiers and myself to complete for the day."
good,"Rite Aid, as a whole, is not a good place to work if you are looking for a career. Upper management does not care about the employees, and makes the lives of their store management all but miserable. Good for a teenager's first job, but not much else."
good,"If you can multitask? Rite Aid is a good job."
good,"I did not enjoy my experience within this company. The particular store/management I faced on a daily basis was a joke. The hours were so mixed up I couldn't sleep well or see my children. I did like the type of ""environment"" - such as helping others and meeting so many customers and creating a bond with them. Other than that, I am honestly glad to be out of that place. I don't want to sound to harsh or rude but truth be best."
good,"Worked on all aspects of running a store. Made schedules, hiring, loss prevention, ringing, helping customers, keeping up store standards, receiving and stocking."
good,"depending on your location, you are constantly on the move, whether  your on the register, displaying merchandise, assisting customers or completing your daily tasks as a manager. If you are a family oriented person retail is not the place for you . you will work holidays, you will work long hours as a manager. If you are a people person you will enjoy the small talk with your daily customers. those customers that come in daily and who are pleasant to converse with made it worth the while to continue working daily."
good,"In terms of the actual store that I worked in, I had almost no problems. Everyone there was well-experienced, no one was left out to dry and for the most part things ran smoothly. The biggest issue that I had was when we started having issues outside of our control and upper management's reaction to that. The main issue came with shoplifting, which we had no way to enforce (couldn't even bring shoplifters back into the store due to liability), and being in a bad area made it even worse. When the situation got bad enough, the higher ups brought us all in for a few meetings and basically blamed us for the problem. At the same time, they promised us security guards and extra measures that never came in my time at the store. As a big business, this cost-cutting, low liability game is more than common, so if you are looking for retail experience, this is not out of the ordinary and I can't be too harsh. Just know what you could be getting into."
good,"A typical day at work involved attending to customers, stocking shelves, doing inventory, greeting customers, organizing pharmacy patients medication and assisted the pharmacist in filling prescriptions. Working with coworkers was sometimes challenging but often enjoyable."
good,"Rite Aid Warehouse was a great learning experience, knowing the in's and out's of how a corporate warehouse works. Management was great and friendly but also stern. I worked every day and even did overtime for 3 months, but not even my hard work didn't win my a permanent position after my probation period. Working there was a little bit degrading to me as a person because high value products were sometimes stolen from the assembly line by other workers and so they had security issue locker inspections and wand you before you left to go home. Not only was this an annoying policy but could really agitate you if the person in front of the line to leave, did in fact steal goods from the warehouse. Working 12 to 13 hour shifts and at the end of the day trying to leave to go home."
good,"I worked for Rite Aid for about a year. Their management was a little unprofessional. There was a lot of favoritism and the store manager was a bad role model for her employees. Instead of encouraging them, she would talk about them behind their back."
good,rite aid was not that good place to work at but you do meet a lot of new people and for your first job it is ok. The management was hard on me because they wanted me to become more than a cashier.
good,"Supportive management, friendly co-workers. Great time interacting with customers and developing rapport with frequent shoppers and vendors."
good,It is a retail setting and there is a lot of corporate filters that you have to go through. The pay is not that good. but I moved up to a supervisor after a few years. If you work at a union store there are very good benefits. Overall it is a lot of stressful work for little pay.
good,The day consist of building outbound orders for the stores. We stand between 2 spurs and that's how the freight is brought to us. Very fast paced even though you will only work 6 to 7 hours a day
good,Great Work enviorment. Steady job with job security. Although there is no way to advance in the company. Overall enjoyable work enviroment with lots of ways to learn.
good,"If this is to be a part-time or temporary job, it's perfect. Prepares you for most jobs dealing with customer service, stock, cash handling, HIPAA.."
good,"I worked here and honed my skills as a caring cashier,I  love working in watts because I love helping people and lifting them up."
good,i was able to advance quickly due to my previous experience in retail but wasn't taken serious. upper management had favoritism. work fell on everyone else (mainly me)
good,"As an 18 year old, this job was good experience working with Pharmacists and counting pills for customers."
good,"A typical day in the life of a merchandiser at Rite Aid is many things. All but simple. Each day faces new challenges and obstacles that must be over came and successfully completed in a sufficient amount of time. I have gained great knowledge in Merchandising, Plano-grams, Re-sets, Organization skills, Strength, and Undoubtedly think that I have gained the skills necessary to even run my own merch team someday very soon.  I have made strong bonds between my self and the many great people and co-workers I have met along the way. Some so close they are like family to me. However my actual family life outside of the company has been lacking these last few years due to the hardest part of the job, being gone on the road so much. It is getting very hard with this job to balance any sort of life outside the company and though I do love my job and has become a great passion of mine there are not many advances and I don't see myself doing this my whole life. When it does come down to saying good bye I will hold my head up knowing I had just encountered  a wonderful life experience traveling the beautiful state of California and seeing places I would not have been able to see otherwise."
good,Rite Aid was a great experience for me.  I learned how to deal/talk with customers.
good,"Only thing I can say is - stay to yourself and don't get involved with ANYTHING that is not part of your job. For instance, if your a front end cashier - just stick to that! Don't get involved what the pharmacy, management or store security is doing. I learned that after 12 dedicated years I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and ended up getting fired for simply defending myself against an unprovoked shoplifter attack. If I would've been on the other side of the counter or any other part of the store, I would still be employed."
good,Worked day normally 10 to 12 hours holiday seasons more also constant training of employees turnover especially in larger metro areas very high. Constant resetting of departments and inventory. Upper Management overall did a good job of being honest about what you are up against on a daily business but they are very critical of numbers and all jobs are bonus driven. Hardest part of the job is employee turnover and customer theft especially alcohol. Is a good job to meet many new people.
good,"patrol the store, view CCTV cameras, arrest shoppers for stealing merchandise co workers were great, management was outstanding.chasing criminals down who stole from the store.  enjoyed the pay and hours of work."
good,"I love my job at Rite Aid, I'm just looking for a better opportunity somewhere else. Rite Aid as a company is amazing to shop at, but to work for, not so much."
good,"worked as a cashier, and a trainer for new employees."
good,Coming in making sure the cash registers has proper change. Making sure the work area is clean and all sales items are in their proper place. I learned under any circumstances give the best customer service as possible.The hardest part of the job is not always Satisfying every customer because we may not have a particular item in stock at the time. The most enjoyable part is maybe helping a disable or elderly customer out and having them leave the store highly satisfied with the service.
good,Overall job is ok but due to strenuous work in the shipping department the hours are long and then they are cut very short
good,This was a very customer oriented job. I learned a lot about dealing with customers in a friendly and polite manner to ensure they were always satisfied.
good,Didnt like my expoerience working there. Management mismanaged our time and were unorganized
good,Cleaning the front counter area. sweeping and light cleaning. attending customer needs. breaking down any shipment.
good,"There is nothing to tell, and these reviews hold you up when you could be applying for different jobs."
good,"Rite Aid was decent, decent schedule, decent pay, decent work expectations. However, union dues were ridiculous, and our store had a ""break room"" that was essentially a closet with no working heat or air conditioning, making ""required"" breaks absolutely horrible. Specifically our store manager was crazy and very mean to her shift leaders (thankfully not so much myself, however it was not unusual to hear her screaming across the store at someone else in management for something that wasn't their fault). Lot's of drama between the pharmacist and the store manager. Aside from my coworkers in management, the expectations of the job really weren't so bad. However due to high prices and lack of business several stores were cut in the area, ours included."
good,"Working with Pharmacist on Duty and Learning new medications for Patients and Be a part of people's lives providing Demanding Customer service. Handling cash transactions use of POS system with accuracy and carefully balancing the Cash Drawer daily at end of the Shift. Following Instructions of Registered Pharmacist with adhering policies and Procedures Of HIPPA."
good,But it's not the best place to work by any stretch of the imagination! There's not much room to advance there and the pay is super low by comparison from what I've found.
good,Provided an eye opening experience and really makes me contemplate which directions I will take in the future.
good,"Started at Helpdesk processing all incoming calls."
good,"I was given great work opportunities,My Managers Taught me a lot of skills that i can use in my future career opportunities."
good,"Worked for the company and did receive recognition for my years of servitude, but after the recession, management changes caused some great company wide collapses. "
good,This company expected you to do everything for nothing and you were never allowed a day off or allowed to call out
good,"I didn't get enough hours maybe one or two days out the week, it was one I know and ok environment to work in just wasn't the job for me"
good,Everyday was different and you always learned something new. The hardest part of this job is it is mentally stressful. Attenion to details are a must with maintaning a calm and productive department. Best part of this job was the customers. After 6 years I had built a great relationship of trust and understanding amongst our patrons. 
good,"fill prescriptions, consult patients on medication and OTCs."
good,A typical day at work is entering prescriptions in computer I've learned to be patient with customers and co-workers. We worked as a team so our consumers can get there medications in a timely matter
good,I enjoyed working at Rite Aid and I got to know our regular customers quite well.
good,"There is not to much to say here. This is the type of job that you go to, do your job, then leave for the day still stressing about what is going on there. I tend to live through my work so, I must say that I do take pride in whatever I am doing. I personally have to say that the job is good but, I have a passion for many things and retail is not one of them."
good,its alright as a part time job while you're a student. There are not that many benefits for working part-time.
good,Worked different hours all the time never set schedule it was hard to become full time in this company.
good,Everyday is a new day learning new information regarding changes with insurance companies as well as medications. My supervisor makes sure that all of the employees are up to date when it comes to new information with anything that has to do with the pharmacy. i enjoy working with my team and working with customers everyday
good,"Great Job, great people, good customers. Challenging but rewarding. Good work life balance. Not micromanaged."
good,"I had never worked for a large chain pharmacy. I found the culture to be depressing in that the customer came last, policy came first. I had never experienced so much ""drama"" amonst such a small number of colleagues and was appalled at their feeling about the customers."
good,"A typical day at work includes, cashier duties straightening the store and getting the work list the manager leaves completed. Sometimes I help out in the pharmacy and with that I bag patients medication answer the phone and assist them with any questions or concerns, if anything is out of my knowledge I'll connect them with the pharmacist since I work up front in the store part. I've learned a lot especially how to deal with the public and functions on how to maintain a store. My management is awesome he works along with your schedule if anything is going on such as doctor appointments or family emergencies and he's pretty fair as well, and that goes for everyone else too. The hardest part of the job is watching for shop lifters and getting them to obey once they're caught. Another hard thing is dealing with really frustrated customers over a product misunderstanding. The most enjoyable part is working with some of the great people I've met over the past five years the customers love me and I get along with everyone."
good,"It was okay working at Rite Aid. Some managers were not very hard working. Standard of excellence is very low. If you try to go beyond that you could get looked at kind of funny. No real promotion opportunities. If you want to be mediocre, Rite Aid is the perfect place."
good,"Excellent people working in this facility, I had great co-workers and a team that worked very well together. I enjoyed all of the people in my department as well as the majority of people in the rest of the building.The Sr Ops Manager made it unbearable to work there. She bullied people and used less than professional tactics in her dealings with almost everyone."
good,"A typical day at work is checking out customers and helping them with any questions or concerns. I learned to be patient and have a positive attitude even when others are rude. It helps alot. The management ranges. We have had lazy and unorganized managers and hard working ones as well. Most employees quit or get fired, or move locations so you never know who is going to be your boss or co-workers next month. The hardest part of the job is standing for a long period of time in one location doing the same thing over and over. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and friendships of your co-workers. A friendly conversation makes the day more enjoyable."
good,"The company is okay, but upper management is very complacent with core values and policies. Job security is not guaranteed, benefits are lacking and not interactive with store personnel."
good,A typical day at Rite aid always consist on catering to the costumers I learned alot of people and organized skills. Management were very nice. It was a joy to work for the company.
good,"as a salary employee you definately do not have time for anything, district support is ok, but they definately need to find a better way to train on work programs."
good,"Was a nice place to work, people were nice and had opportunity to work on customer service."
good,"Rite Aid is trying to go through a resurgence, which may be great, but it's leaving most of us feeling lost in the direction of the company and our role in it.  The leaders of the company are not doing a good job sharing the vision they have for the future."
good,I’ve been at my job since I was 18 so that’s 22 years. There have been many changes in the company that are not helping me advance or do more for my family. If you are starting out it’s a great opportunity.
good,"The new contract states there are no raises except the raise to ensure you are just above minimum wage. This means you can work there for 5 years and still be paid the same. However you get PSL, PHP, and numerous occurances. Basically impossible to get fired after you are hired direct. So for the slacker employee it's great."
good,The cashiers there are always friendly.  The management varies from location to location. The environment is well kept and store stocked fairly well for the most part.
good,They do have good benefits and their salary are fair enough. The company is not flexible with their hours. the most enjoyable part of the job is when there is nice and polite customers or when we were all caught up with our jobs that was the best feeling. I was able to learn more about insurance claims and more pharmacology technology. The workplace was not very enjoyable. I feel that there is always a pro or cons in every company workplace.
good,"too much to do with minimal staff"
good,I always felt needed and respected at Rite Aid. The workers were like family. We had buffets and celebrated holidays together. We bought presents for each other. We laughed and had so much fun with each other and the customers. We called our regulars by name. Working there was an adventure. I loved it there. The pay really was bad. That was the only thing and the Union wasn't any good and was never needed.
good,"Was a good starting point for my career. "
good,"They are really poor at wages, maybe the wages dont have to be good if they think that cashiers were a dime a dozen but I was in the pharmacy & they paid $9 an hour. That's just over minimum wage.  They will have to do better than that to keep their people. Or they can train them, certify them & then they go to another pharmacy to make decent money elsewhere."
good,There is a lot of opportunity for overtime during the holidays. Rite Aid takes employee safety very seriously. If you're a good employee there are plenty of opportunities for advancement.
good,The job has very flexible hrs. Management is caring and work friendly.  Compensation is low if you come in as a cashier. Recommended for 1st time employees right out of Hs or someone looking for a 2nd job part time.
good,"Job is what you make it. Customer Service is key. Great place for students. Job is not hard, have to work weekends, scheduling is by seniority. Good luck."
good,I worked as a floating part-time technician at $8.25/hr and Rite Aid didn't even offer to pay for my travel expenses to float at different stores. Technician hours were always being cut as well.
good,"If opening shift, you will onlock the store and count on reigister. Start putting windows up. When cashier gets store we work on deposit.  i then do freshness (check dates) ."
good,I totally understand learning new responsibilities constantly with little training and no compensation for extra said work. My district leader would come visit every few months to dish out more work.
good,"Company is actually trying to recover from a lot of downs in the past.  A lot of reorganization and new methods that don't match,  most of the position required productivity. A lot of employees quitting because under pays compare with other companies."
good,"You can easily get a schedule that works for you, but depending on the store you work at varies greatly if youre a human or a robotic number. Most stores are very under staffed and you dont earn a decent wage for your workload due to the staffing issues. The quality of the stores working conditions very much depe ds on its ma agers, of which there are very few empathetic individuals."
good,"Except for some managerial  inconsistencies,i  overall enjoyed working at  Rite Aid.My co- workers   were  genuinely helpful,and  put in team effort,the store was kept organized due to  hard work and cleanliness of all staff members."
good,Each shift is fast paced. The grave yard shift is overwhelming. Management changes frequently. Not much room for advancement. They are constantly hiring.
good,"The Field Technician posting is a stand alone, self starting position. You are in charge of planning your week and day to day operations. While scheduling all upgrades and projects to completion. A great job."
good,"enjoyed diversity, where diversity are makers for differences in life experiences and thus differences in the thought processes necessary to attack big and little problems."
good,"Good and helpful managers and co-workers.  RiteAid has internal training and certification program. That is useful for beginners. A good place for start of the career. However, not much opportunities for career growth and salary increase."
good,"Learned a lot from this position is terms of being able to handle cash, learn for employees about products and company objectives, and how to deal with customers."
good,"Run the register, scan damage and outdates out, face and front the store, re-stock the shelves if possible. Managers were okay, some bad and some good. Rumors were always believed no matter what. Learned on how to run the register, scan items, be a shift supervisor, planogram resets, and how to use the scanning gun. Hardest part was getting all of my tasks done cause while being a cashier, i was also being trained to be a shift supervisor."
good,"I loved working in the pharmacy at rite aid. My Co workers were awesome and the Manager is pretty much down to earth."
good,"Functions like an average retail pharmacy; long sometimes flexible hours, on your feet all day, hard to take breaks or lunches, fast paced, but very patient oriented."
good,"They need rotation of the workers. They favorite their people who had been there longer that, doesn't work. What is the sense of having your workers watch for people that steal ,when he has nothing to do about it. You're not allowed to put hands on them let the police take too long so why make us follow them."
good,"Advancement to store management is typical, beyond that very hard to come by. They seem to hire from outside the company to fill upper management positions rather than promote qualified candidtaes"
good,expectations for 'unskilled' (phcy techs) workers was much higher than the wages offered and actual  training support provided - put a significant strain on the pharmacist
good,"I joined Rite Aid a few months before the upper  management got caught doing illegal activities, so the work atmosphere was clouded with uncertainty. Rite Aid survived and is doing better now"
good,"Working with Riteaid for a year, I was promised to be given full time hours but it never happened. I wasnt able to receive any benefits unless I was full time. Work environment wasnt very professional."
good,"If you are going to work at a union store go for it otherwise it’s not worth it. At a union store I paid $30 per month for my health benefits, at the non union store I am paid less and pay $238 a month for me and my kids health insurance"
good,Would have been a great place to work if there was no downsizing.  Positions were taken away then stores closed. Company bought out too many times.  Very few stores still in existence.
good,The crew was often understaffed at night leading to constant rushing to get a days worth of work done in only five hours. This was due to the managers choice to keep employees under thirty hours a week. So most shifts were only five hours long. Not enough time to take care of an entire store.
good,"Long hours, plan to work every weekend and holiday. You will have to learn every aspect of the store. ..................................................."
good,Was partime employee was not able to enroll in benefits as well as didn’t work everyday had 10yrs experience plus prior to working there as far as the computer system that was  used would  of preferred to be trained on that longer they were also transitioning to Walgreens
good,"We’re it not for the coworkers I have had, I wouldn’t have stayed with rite aid for as long as I did. Which still was only 7 months. As a registered pharmacy technician I only made $10.00/hr which if you know anything about the job, is a laughable and disgusting amount to be paid. On top of the fact that you have to PAY to be a pharmacy Technician (registration, certification etc)"
good,"Everyrite is different depend on the volume and location . If your in a rough area lil southwest Philly , westphilly or even south phila . You will face a lot of challenges that you over come and accept or you move on to what u can take ."
good,I enjoyed my job. Because I love my customers. Hi love the venders and just interacting with different people from all walks of life. Ive spent the last two years worling hard and learning everything. That I could possibly learn. I felt the more knowledge obtained. I was bettering myself. In the end it has become difficult. My superiors just come and go as they please and do what they want. I felt like alot waa left on my shoulders. They were off every weekend and never asked about my schedule or if I needed to do or take care of anything. I felt used and unappreciated. I was 8 months pregnant still crawling around pn the floor swtting planograms. And no one cares as long as they didn't have to do it. To me thats not team work. Its poor leadership. And it hurt my feeling. But no matter how bad it hurt or bothered me physically I kept on. Because im a singke mother. And I have to do what I have to do. Which is work when I need to be there. I very seldom request days off unless its for my children and doctors appointment. Or for myself. So when everyone above me thake off every weekend and come and go as they please. That becomes an issue for me.
good,I enjoyed my time working here. The day went fast. Daily tasks were varied and fast paced. I feel as if it could of paid more for the type of employment. Management was supportive.
good,"Working for This company was an opportunity, but I need new challenge. This job was enjoyable and now I need a new challenge to grow professionally and personally"
good,"It is retail, what can I say. Usually long hours all day on your feet and dealing with customers all day long. Not horrible if the right manager is working but per almost all retail jobs, pay is at the lowest while many expect a lot."
good,"You dont get paid very well, but if you just need a temp job this is fine."
good,"Fun job in that you get to interact with patients and be a direct source for patient information. Management never staffs stores enough, always understaffed."
good,"Tasklist is large but not unmanageable. "
good,At times hard to balance work and outside life due to scheduling. The company seems to only care that you hit your store card goal and vaccination goals. They do not seem to care about the customers or employees but rater only their goals. Benefits are not the best but are costly along with the union dues. As far as the benefits it is hard to find specialists let alone the time to get to see a healthcare professional.
good,I would never go back to work for rite aid. I barley would get a break time and while at work I was working non stop. I didnt like the work environment.
good,"Was alright at first but it got time to leave the place. I meet some really nice customers and some I just let god handle. The environment there can be cool, but it all depends on the group of staff and direction they take."
good,"I got a lot of work experience in the time I worked here but we were so understaffed, to the point that employees would need to be in multiple places doing multiple things at the same time. An extra employee or two would have been great."
good,"I gave medications from doctor to sick customers with right person, right medication with their strenght. Few days late the customers came back to see and smile at me.  The smile from customer to me, that is made me happy."
good,"Really dont' wish to comment on this. However, apparently, it's required. Rite Aid is not that bad a place to work. However, my experience was that they are never fully staffed."
good,"To improve the health and wellness of our communities through engaging experiences that provide our customers with the best products, services and advice to meet their unique needs."
good,"I only got a chance to work with them for a few months, but the overall feeling of the company is not bad."
good,"Picked orders 8 hrs day and packed orders as picked. Do your work don't depend on others . Nice work environment members became like family.everyone had a specific job to do. Work was fast paced and some heavy lifting. Had a time schedule to meet. If not meet in 8 hrs, required overtime until job was complete.  Sometimes required to load trailers for next day deliveries. Totes were heavy to load. Sometimes 50 lbs of more. Enjoyed joyed working with co-workers able to communicate well with management as friends."
good,"Rite aid was my 1st job, I worked at a store that was closed down and they found me and the rest of my former co workers positions at other locations."
good,"I worked for a high volume CVS and this is much better but still needs to improve on staffing stores. Overworked, understaffed, focus claims to be about patient care but it's really about the $$$$. Retail pharmacy is going to be a thing of the past in the next 5 years, go mail order."
good,"I didn't hate working at Rite Aid, but poor management made it very frustrating. The temp managers have a history of promising things and not following through, but overall it was very lax and chill"
good,"The atmosphere is very boring and your tasks become redundant, same as every retail job. It is sometimes a challenge to get the days tasks done but if you work with people that you are fond of, it will make the hours much more bearable and fun."
good,"Being the only cashier put on a shift gets very stressful, but when it isn’t busy, the job is super relaxed and chill. It’s a small work environment.."
good,Been with the company for four years and was transferred theee times. When you request a transfer you will get denied but when they want you to transfer it happens over night. Not good
good,Could definitely manage their employees behavior towards other employees better. The bullying was horrific. Like high school all over again. The whole reason I left the job.
good,You were expected to keep up with all pharmacy business.  When I left I found out that I was making 10 cents more an hour than those that were just hired without experience.  I had worked there for 4 years.
good,"Worked in very busy and slower pharmacies.  In the busier stores, staffing was not an issue.  Can be an issue in lower volume stores. Overall, a good work experience."
good,"Good firm but the Health benefits package is insufficient. Employees are required to augment with a significant portion of their yearly salary.  If it is not used, payments do not roll over until the next fiscal year."
good,i dont care left becuz i got a new a better paying job no stress easy a job for just starting out and still going to school i recomend this job just as a start up
good,"On a corporate basis, terrible management, struggling to stay in business for the last 10+ years, bad management decisions.  In store management was great & very supportive until corporate got in the way."
good,"They didn't provide raises once you top out, there policy on everything else seems to apply only when it's convenient, and the union is kind of weak, other than that ok"
good,"the job itself is like most other retail jobs, however the management team leaves much to be desired . many times you would be scheduled off, but due to scheduling issues you would have to come in anyways ( which happened quite often) ."
good,"Manager is difficult , I like everything but how rude the customers get. I would not work here for a long time. manager is very inconvient , other than that everything is all good ,"
good,I applied to the job to earn enough money for a gift. The environment was slow-paced and not challenging enough for me to want to continue staying after it had served it's purpose.
good,There is room to grow if you have what they want. To be management you have to be at the store ar 5 am open at 6 am and be able to close at 12 midnight also you have to have a car.
good,Very little training. Just threw me to the wolves. Wanted me to follow people if I thought they might be stealing. Didn't learn much prior to the supervisor position. Was mainly at the register or by myself all day.
good,"The organization of workers were poor, as well as the relationship the workers had with one another. There is always room to improve yet there is lack of recognition for unique additions to the company. They lose great workers by not addressing the concerns of associates and putting the opinions of those in higher ranking first. The higher your position the greater your priority, simultaneously the lower your position the lower your respect."
good,"The typical work day is usually pretty smooth, but sometimes there isn't much to do and it can get a little boring. Most of the people I deal with (customers) are very nice and kind, and those who aren't are so infrequent that I can handle it. The current manager at my store is a bit unreliable, but they're generally a reasonable person, at least. The hardest part of the job is some of the crueler customers. Sometimes it feels like they don't even see me as a person. Though, at the same time, making a customer happy is really satisfying and pleasant. I've learned a lot from working here; admittedly it's helped a lot with my people skills. I can now handle negative people a lot more maturely, and just let it go because in the grand scheme of things, negative customers are insignificant and not worth getting upset over."
good,"A typical day included replenishing stock from the back room, executing planograms to reorganize merchandise on the shelves, and various other tasks that changed day to day. I got along with the management and enjoyed working with them. The most part of the job I didn't like was that there was typically no help when closing. The cashier was required to stay at the registers yet I was expected to delegate tasks they had no way of completing. It seemed as though in that aspect I was set up to fail."
good,"It's a good place for a first job. It is also good for college students. The hours you work are made by week basis and doesn't leave much room for personal planning. obviously, a steady schedule would."
good,Working in this pharmacy is great if you enjoy dealing with patients face to face daily with long hours of standing. Most of the time you will be a cashier or stock the pharmacy.
good,"Starting off the hours and work weren't that bad. As it went on however, the hours started to dwindle and instead of my full shift of 8 hours id end up only working half or less. The work itself wasnt terible but id only recommend this job as a jumping off/ experience gaining position."
good,Worked after I graduated high school to help my mom out around the house. Job was ok after awhile but then it started to decline with less hours and not enough pay. Back then it was a great job for high schoolers. I'm pretty sure the pay has changed
good,"It is a fair job, ive been there 3 years and I feel that I'm not making enough for being there as long as I have , and all the tasks I preform. The good part about it is it has taught me to handle hard situations with a calm attitude, and it taught me to be more confident with my abilities."
good,Management cocnference for the most part were well prepared and engageing .Managers were able to discuss store performances were and meet various vendors to discuss any in store issues . Also  vendors were on hand to showcase new and improved products
good,"Typical pharmacy chain culture, sometimes stressful depending on your boss."
good,It was a good starting part-time job. Nothing more to really be said. Other than you'll be stocking shelves and helping customers out when its needed.
good,As an assistant manager it was very stressful. The store manager i worked under was motivated but very immature and unprofessional. She did not keep a very professional attitude and let her personal feelings dictate how she handled a situation.
good,"The job was okay but the management was very poor, but i've heard that the management has changed since i've quit. At work you stock shelves and you talk with customers and finalize their purchases."
good,"No sick days, but I had some great coworkers, it was fun when we weren't getting blamed for customer's scripts going through to insurance. which was the hardest part of the job to me."
good,I learned that Rite Aid care more about the customers then the employees. the work is very easy its either your on the register all day or you are on the floor bending over a lot. but if you enjoy the small work setting its a great place for it.
good,"It was an extremely fast-paced environment. The management was not very good, they don't care about the employees. The managers showed a lot of favoritism towards certain employees, and it was unfair. I did enjoy my regular customers, they were always so nice and really started relationships with all of the employees"
good,"Rite Aid has very little payroll to work with for scheduling but isn't very stingy once you are on the clock, so if you work there full time, there are ample opportunities for overtime as well. Assistant managers and shift supervisors both have more responsibilities than I have encountered in other retail settings, which makes doing the job more varied and satisfying."
good,"Good workplace, very personal relationship with workers and customers. I enjoy the freedom of welcoming new ideas to allow the store to grow and change for the better."
good,"During a typical day at Rite Aid, I would run the store from opening through a full shift and possibly longer.  The basic things I learned at Rite Aid were different computer programs, basic Pharmacy technician skills and how to make it possible to get as much product that would be placed in a big box store into a truly small box store.  That was one of the most difficult parts of my position.  We would receive much more product than we could merchandise on the sales floor and have to be very creative in how to accomplish that task.  "
good,Rite aid is a job that high school students should apply for. It teaches you good beginner skills such as communication and register/computer skills. I suggest you apply for rite aid as a temporary job. There is not much room for advancement.
good,"Rite Aid is a great beginners job. It allows individuals to learn how to become a great cashier, manager and much more but can get very messy at times. The workload is very much and the pay is not sufficient."
good,"I enjoyed working at Rite-Aid due to friendly customers and staff. However, pay and advancement was slow and over time it was not worth it. I am looking for a more permanent job that allows full time and benefits. Rite-Aid at most would allow 32 hours between several different stores."
good,"I worked as a clerk here, I learned the ways of pharmacy. My manager there at the time was very nice and so was the store manager. the hardest part of the job was the busy busy pace I wasnt use to at the time"
good,"Rite Aid always made me feel like I had someone watching for me to slip up.  Patients rarely, if ever, came first.  Management was a group of business people, not healthcare people."
good,"My time at rite aid pharmacy was not extremely pleasant. The manager would constantly say she needs more help but refuse to hire anyone. There was a complaint that we, the employees, were getting too much overtime even tho we only worked an average of 38  hours a week."
good,"This job is fairly slow-paced, has some different experiences that are outside of normal retail, and is a decent gig for someone who is in college and needs flexible hours. There is also an opportunity to work in the pharmacy."
good,I would recommend this job to anyone that’s not in school or with any other responsibilities cause it really takes up your time but the job is good you get paid good as a new employee
good,"job culture was poor, shorten employee hours, not as much team help, management wasn't as supportive, short year I was there overall it was decent workplace for first job"
good,Constant reductions in store payroll drives the morale of the team down. Week to week workload is consistent however labor payroll changes each week with no rhyme or reason. Overall the company is moving in a good direction and will hopefully put money back into the stores.
good,"My daily work would include the following."
good,"Initially my time with Rite-Aid started off quite favorable, as I quickly learned my job and grew accustomed to the practices of the job I prospered. Then came the day of the dreaded merger that was announced after sometime of my working. Store morale dropped, but I tried to stay positive, but I no longer had the same job security I thought previously before coming. Now I currently try to seek other employment before the start of the merger as the store I currently will probably be getting closed down as we are within a few hundred feet of the nearest Walgreens. My most memorable moments will be with my last manager as we celebrated holidays together at the store. I'll always remember enjoying meals with my co-workers as we all treated each other like family."
good,Rite Aid pharmacy kept you moving and on your toes. If you are willing there are lots of areas of the business to learn. Becomes a family atmosphere and you learn something new each shift you work.
good,"I worked at Rite Aid for two years. They treated me well, but being a manager or having responsibilities would be stressful. The costumers and standing around on the job are the worst part. It is easy work, but boring."
good,"As long as my store manager was worked as a fun & loving person, I believed that even though my employment was short winded my whole experience taught me to be a good employee on my next job."
good,"Not busy in pharmacy most evenings when I work. it can be stressful when I leave one job to go to rite aid, I'm not able to make it to work on time most days, l then have to ask the manager to punch in my time."
good,"Not much advancement very stagnant. I really like the customers that come in on a daily basis. A full time employee will not receive 40hrs unless you are a Assistant Manager, respectfully."
good,"There is no support system with this company.  From other store managers to the District Manager, Loss Prevention, HR manager none of them really help you at all.  They come in rate you tell you what your doing wrong and leave, emails go unanswered."
good,"Not a huge union supporter and Rite Aid had a mandatory union.  Most union promotions weren't for pay raises, but better medical benefits.  Advancement was difficult."
good,"Front end could have potential to grow pharmacy customer. Pharmacy staff encouraged front end products for purchase. Team work was a a must between both front end and pharmacy, as well as between other Rite Aids. Fast paced work environment. In store management was helpful and understanding. Upper management was a little more difficult to work with. Most days were enjoyable, however working with sick patients can sometimes prove difficult."
good,"Working for Rite Aid can be a rewarding, but incredibly stressful job. The stores are constantly understaffed, making the small staff they already have do the work of 2-3 people instead of just the one. Even if the stores have staff the hours corporate allows each store to have is so outrageous it's almost impossible to get everything done and not fall behind. When your store needs help, you usually get told to ask nearby stores which are almost always also understaffed and unable to help. "
good,No Place for advancement .never any payroll to hire always short staffed.time off limited .training resources limited overall it's a ok place to work at
good,"I love the people that I work with at Rite Aid, all of the employees at the stores are super friendly and down to earth. The company is broke and doesn't pay it's employees what they deserve. If there was more money, this company would be great but not sure Walgreens will be the same vibe."
good,I learned how the medication field works and all the different medications are there and some of the customers are really nice.  The most enjoyable apart of the job is meeting different people and it was busy.  The hardest part is dealing with the Management.
good,it was better working here as a student intern than as a licensed pharmacist. The pay was competitive and many times it was higher than the competition. the only flaw was upper management was lacking and rarely there.
good,I do not have a review to give about Rite Aid. It is a position that either you like where you are or you do not.  If you do not then its time to find something else
good,Corporate does not care about their employees.  They do not pay well or give breaks to those who work in the pharmacy.  Hard to work with no or little help.
good,"This position has challenged me in ways  I would never have experienced at any other employer. It has helped me to overcome situations using my improved customer service skills, as well as, my experience in the pharmacy industry."
good,Ask too much of employees for below average wages. Can make more at Walmart or Walgreens doing the same job. Job culture depends on which store you are hired to. Benefits suck.
good,"After working for Thrifty Drugs for 15 years , the change that took place when Rite Aid overtook their stores was deplorable. There is no training, bench to recruit from and the stores are understaffed and overworked. A manager cannot train or oversee the work and productivity of others while at the check-stand 50% of the day."
good,"Learned to accomplish work task thru teamwork. "
good,The work is fine though they can overwork you a little bit. The hours are good but it lacks in terms of management. The job is easy overall you get a thirty and fifteen minute break depending on how much you work.The customers are relatively easy to deal with.
good,"good job to begin your work career"
good,I have worked for this company for over 15 years.  They are not great with personal advancement.  I work between 32 and 39 hours a week.  I do everything that is required of me.  They do not advance their workers even though they are qualified for a new position.  I start my day with cleaning the store to make it presentable for the customers.  I take in the truck deliveries and put away all of the products.  I also cash out customers for their products.
good,"The company is good. Work load isn't as much as long as you set a boundary on the things you can and can't do. If you're a good worker, the management will give you a lot of things to do..that's because he/she knows your capabilities and what you can get done. Otherwise, it is a good company. UNION job, plus."
good,Never take anything for granted this is corporate America at its best.  You will work hard.  Minimal support will be provided.  Upper level management rarely recognizes or appreciates hard work.
good,"great team to work with, they train you as you go. they help you get registered with the board of pharmacy.  great manager, the team cares for their customers. you can learn about medicine as you go as well. difficult to get promoted. overall a great place to work."
good,"Working at rite aid was the very slow. I learned a lot about different medicines, proper disposable of medical wasted. The worst thing about this job was the pay and the hours."
good,It's all about management in pharmacy's so I can speak on all Rite Aid pharmacies. I had a great hiring manager and after she left because the rite aid culture we were replaced with a not so good first time manager.
good,"I was young and they gave me a chance. I would have become a manager due to my work ethics but was ""too young to sign off on liqueur orders to the store "". Over not a bad place to work as a kid."
good,AI was hired as part time as I already held a full time job and they worked me just shy of 40 hours a week. I did this for ten months and then I quit.
good,"The company needs more incentives to make their employees feel valuable and appreciated. For example working as a supervisor, the pay wasn't that great. When minimum wage was bumped up, I was only bumped up to minimum wage, making the same as a cashier who has no responsibilities. I had to email the higher ups just for a raise."
good,"Rite Aid is a company that needs improvement. They preach safety and being a ""with us, it's personal"" type of company. This just isn't the case. After 13 years with the company I know this is a dead end job. They make you work alone all of the time because of continuous cuts in operational hours."
good,"Provided certification"
good,first day and week well be easy but boring since you have to do computer based training for starters. After that you'll learn cashier work and basic cleaning. rite aid is all about customer service.
good,"Meet people"
good,"Work was fine, but the company seems to put in obstacles to make it harder to do your job."
good,"no work balance or life balance, expections are overwhelming with the fact of poor pay and poor hours and scheduling, work loads or extremely unreal under circumstances where you are against all odds."
good,Retail is retail. More work fewer hours to work with. I'm pretty sure it's just the nature of the beast.   Gets frustrating when young people would rather play on cell phones then actually work. Hard finding quality associates with the drive and work ethic needed.
good,"I worked at rite aid for quite some time, they compensated decently well however the hours were endlessly fluctuating and i never received the hours i was promised at my time of hire. I also had my property damaged by an angry customer and the corporation refused to assist me in repairing the damages even though it occurred on company property. Overall it wasn't terrible, its an easy job for some decent money."
good,"The best part of the job would be all the different people you will meet on a daily bases. A typical day is very busy for the time you punch in till the time you leave, I've learned so much from being a pharmacy tech, I've learned how fill prescription, to take doctor calls, but most of all I've learned patients."
good,Rite Aid has really great values and there are plenty of opportunities in the company. The potential merger with Walgreens has many employees unsure of their future.
good,A typical day at work for Rite Aid is very stressful. They give you minimal staff with a tremendous work load. I've learned a lot from the company and am thankful for that. Definitely poor management and training. The hardest part of the job is trying to meet the needs of every customer while completing your tasks without going over your scheduled shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is customer service and getting to interact with wonderful people.
good,"Rite Aid is a good place to work if you are a pharmacist and an ok place if you are a technician. The pay isn't great, and the hours weren't great either. It can get stressful when its busy and it's only one pharmacist and one technician working."
good,"A typical day I counted and filled scripts, answered customers questions, rang customers up and attended to the needs of customers. I learned that the customers needs are most important and that a detailed knowledge of drugs and clear sense of time management is needed. The hardest part of the job would be corresponding with the insurance companies. The most enjoyable part of the job is ensuring the customer was always happy."
good,"my typically day would start of by saying the daily announcement "
good,"typical day involved me on register , tagging items, replacing stock, helping customers, cleaning the area, and at the end of the night counting the receipts all by myself"
good,"The day was usually always full of many different tasks, we learned to be better at what we do, talking to customers explaining where everything is located. I was a cashier so I didn't have too much responsibility but I do know the rules and job of an assistant manager and the tasks they do. I've been them multiple times before. The environment of where I worked was excellent, never had a problem with unsanitary things. Hardest part of the job, didn't have one because I loved all my employees and customers were always nice, most entertaining part of my job was talking to customers and getting to know them from their point of view."
good,Company challenges you to be your best.  Can be frustrating at times but upper management does make an effort to know each pharmacist and work with them if problems arise.
good,There is a lot of multitasking and not enough time to complete everything. Its a semi-dirty job and I feel that the customers don't truly respect you or the work you do there. Management most of the time lacked sufficient people skills and professionalism when dealing with employees or customers. The best thing was taking care of good customers and getting out on time.
good,Cashier experience necessary. Need to be organized. Able to use computer. Cash handling. Dealing with peoples medication so 100% accuracy is a must.
good,"I had a marvelous time working for Rite Aid, however, I did struggle at times with a lack of communication on managements side as well as sometimes, my supervisor didn't seem to understand what my position even was. This was difficult but it did not stop me from striving to building business and increase script count. I did notice that many of the pharmacy technicians didn't make as much as other pharmacy technicians and this was a little bit of a let down as I have seen first hand how hard they work to deliver the best experience possible at Rite Aid."
good,Working with Rite Aide made my customer service grow stronger and I've learned to be more professional. Customer service could get really tough but as long as you're a good team player and have a smile on then it could get what a takes to be a best part of Rite aide customer assistant.
good,"Great co-workers, very helpful. Pharmacy management in this particular Rite Aid pharmacy was not very helpful. Extremely busy pharmacy, no time for training."
good,"A typical day consist of stocking/restocking the shelves, handling cashier exchanges,light cleaning. Management kept a close eye on the cashiers.I enjoyed dealing with the regular customers as well as helping elderly ones.The hardest part of my job would be the standing in one place for long periods of times."
good,"Shift supervisors should make more than a dollar above min wage, if min wage goes up so should everyone else's pay. no hard part to the job except for maybe having only 2 people on a shift because hours are cut all the time. customers are great and usually satisfied when the come in, but disappointed when the shelves are not stocked enough with a sale item, rainchecks aren't always good enough. cx would also like price matching, see that rite aid is the most expensive of the drug stores it doesn't seem hard to price match with competitors. also cx should not get the same discount as employees"
good,The work day is nothing strenuous in any form.  The only difficulty is the interactions with unruly customers and fellow employees.  The work load clearly rolls down hill to the newest employees while the veteran employees still complain about doing basically nothing at all.  It's frustrating doing the most work with the least pay.
good,my co workers are great people and.  I have learned a lot from this job. I am able to better communicate with people and have learned a lot from working here.
good,"I was hired within March 2006 when the company was still listed as Eckerd. While Eckerd was an adequate and prolific company to work for, Rite Aid's lacking management policies ultimately reflected their poor decision-making and financial burden when purchasing/merging Eckerd with themselves."
good,"I believe rite aid is a good company and has its ups and downs .I believe that they should give there employess more room for advancement more raises ,longer work breaks hire more associates they are lack of help.my boss is amazing she is a good boss who does her best ."
good,"Rite Aid is a Chain Retail Outlet that deals on Drugs(Pharmacy) and Grocery with the exception of Dairy or perishables.It has Branches in virtually every State in the United States .My Job entailed Receiving Customer, Engaging Them and Assisting them with choosing the product they desired. It also Includes Handling all Front end Transactions like receiving payments for services rendered. Handling ,Cash,Check, Credit and Debit Transactions by the use of the Electronic Cash Register.I also Handled Western Union and Money Order Transactions."
good,In my experience this company is more worried about being seen doing something rather than doing something of worth. There is a lot of wasted time and money that would be better used for recruitment and employee benefits. Management is working with the minimal hours needed to run the store and rarely get the chance to take their breaks.
good,It was fun working there as we had a good team at Caldwell store. I got a good training to become an Assistant Manager. My most enjoyable part of the job is freight processing and helping AP Agent to minimize shrinkage.
good,"They are going through many changes right now that make it hard to do my job professionally.  They are merging with Walgreens,"
good,typical day hmmm well depends on what your job title is. As a cashier you just go in clock-in look at a work bored see what you have to do and then go do it make sure your taking care of the cust. while your on there
good,New Pdms are on you like a hawk and never give you a break or congratulate wins. little to no help is common and no support from management.
good,"A typical day is not very stressful. It only becomes stressful if you make it that way. Overall, people are friendly but every now and then you'll get a negative Nancy."
good,It's a good place to get customer service experience and basic work experience. You also become more knowledgeable on health.
good,"I was cahier most of the time for the first 3 months at rite aid , i was sometimes lucky enough to have stock duties which consisted of being in a freezer stocking ice cream , sweeping and mopping the entire store, cleaning ice cream department . my experience at rite was OK."
good,I like working for Rite Aid. The people I work with are great. I like how it always is busy and always work to be done.There is just not much room for advancement and growth. We are not union like all the other rite aids so we fill that we don't get as much help or miss out on some benefits.
good,"Good company. Weird culture. I would recommend it if you are just getting a job. Not so much for a career. If you dont like retail and dealing with customers, this job might not be for you."
good,Never able to take a lunch or break as the only key in the building and there were many days that wound up being 18 hour shifts without proper staffing.
good,Rite Aid was a good informational place to work at but i didn't desire to work for long at there in attempts to move up. I've learned alot there which i feel could help me with many more jobs as i move on
good,Rite Aid stores are equipped with all facets of life.  The staff are helpful and pleasant.  The professional technicians and pharmacists are very knowledgeable in speaking with the customers.
good,Rite Aid only cares about the numbers. It is not the worst place to work but if you want to advance find another job. The benefits are okay. They did not give me my vacation time after my first year
good,"Management was okay, they had problems with getting the schedule out to their employees. I would stock the shelves and do inventory, also mark new prices for sales items."
good,A typical day at Rite Aid is very busy. The cashiers have to check in all medications as well as put them away. We have to also return medication that has been ready for a customer for 13 days or morel All while helping and cashiering customers. The work environment is very fast paced.
good,graet company if they would get managers to be fair and treat equally. looking to leave as soon as possible. to much drama at the work place
good,"Easy job not the hardest, but can become very difficult at certain times of the day, hardest part is working in the morning and dealing with difficult customers on daily basis. Otherwise the job is simple and easy to do. Best part of the job is working on the floor. I learned how to handle and package equipment's doing recalls."
good,"learned how to deal with issues and deal with customers, Co-workers were always willing to help out. The hardest part of the job would be getting called in on a day off."
good,The customers that you meet are awesome. As long as you have a very positive attitude and great work ethic you will be successful.
good,The then District Manager was always changing what he wanted from the week before. It made for a not so productive environment.
good,Clientele can be tough to deal with at times but the job itself is not so bad. Good starting job. Short handed however and no overtime is allowed not a lot of room to move up the ladder.
good,It is a good place to hold as a part-time job to bring in extra money. There is a lack in working personnel. The co-workers are great people and it has a warm and friendly feeling in the store.
good,"Good co-workers, loved the customers, great location, hours management needed improvement, but having been bought by Walgreens will solve that problem"
good,"Keeping up with customers is a very overwhelming part of the day. The co-workers there vary frequently, I learned about stocking, and how to maintain a store. I enjoyed the peace and quiet of pulling things from the basement and working them into their required locations. I kept track of all the stock in said basement and the flow of products that went through it."
good,"Great pay and have a lot of hours, but your really slaving yourself everyday for managers that don't even care about you. They very quick to turn on you if mess one thing up. Not worth the hassle"
good,"I must say that there are bad and good times at work. Some customers can appear to be extremely difficult at times, so I maintain my posture an be calm as I assist them with their needs. As a current cashier at Rite Aid Pharmacy, I have learnt a lot but the one that mainly stands out in my eyesight, is being patient. Some of my coworkers are hardworking and willing to help another but for the others, I tend to get no response. The hardest part of my job is mastering a new task but that's just for a time. The most enjoyable time at work is when some customers help you smile after having a rough night or morning. Managers tend to be difficult at their staff sometimes but to me, it is a pushing point to become successful."
good,"Working in a pharmacy the day is very full, and extremely busy. I work with a great team that really makes a difference, but at times it still gets overwhelmingly stressful we find it very important to joke and laugh to help the day go by and enjoy work a little more."
good,Working at Rite Aid was my stepping stone in life. It got me all the experience I'll ever need in the future. I've met so many great people.
good,"Our name tags said ""with us it's personal"".  I found that I was not to spend time making good customers out of new or plain customers."
good,"Often understaffed, because of 2 drive thru windows, in-store customers and the oversized square footage-this made it difficult to handle so many stations."
good,"Fall, Winter, and Spring isn't bad but the Summer is rough because of the heat index. This job is for hard working people who are willing to transfer throughout the building at any given time."
good,"Every day is a new day with different tasks to accomplish. Dealing with deadlines, customer service, and facility appearance. My team is getting stronger with the consistent training on a daily basis to meet the companies needs. The best things of the job is the fast pace and dealing with the employees as well as the people of the community. The down side of the job work and life balance, it is not the ideal company when you are trying to raise a family and be involved in your kids lives."
good,"Working at Rite Aid made me more efficient when working with customers, and as well as improving customer service related skills. I have learned a a lot of skills such as handling cash, inventory, and customer relations."
good,My typical day is to intake perscription fill medication also to resolve insurance claims. Handel inventory and stock. The management team switche three times in the time i was there. My co-workers were just that co-workers. The most challenging part of the job was too make sure we met our daily script quota.
good,"Stocking the shelves, Answering phone calls, Providing answers for customers and ringing them up with there purchases."
good,"Typical day is answering phones, greeting and helping customers, and managerial tasks; such as opening and closing the store, money handling, working photo department, inventory and straightening merchandise."
good,"extremely helpful and hardworking coworkers and staff. Learned something new everyday, grew as a person and a pharmacist. Enjoyed interaction with customers. Hard part of the job was the long hours especially when understaffed."
good,"Rite Aid is a pharmacy retail company that requires you to be hands on as soon as you come in the door. It's is a job like any if your store manager builds a strong team. All Rite Aid's run well based off the store manager. If your store manager is strong, as a co-manager, or shift supervisor you will enjoy your time. It is a lot of customer service opportunities and it allows you to provide training. If your store has a challenging, non-engaged store manager it will be challenging. Additionally, if its a 24-hour store, if you are applying for the overnight, ensure there is a understanding of how the process is going to work."
good,"Fast paste business, need to multitask, my co-worker are very nice and hard workers, good job for college students. the most enjoyable about my job is i can interact with customer face to face."
good,"Was a back-up cashier."
good,"Overall Ok place to work.  Extremely high focus on numbers, i.e vaccinations and payroll to the point of sickness.  Sometimes more focus is on them than the pharmacists or staff.  Strict on policies for store staff.  Must be 100% or written up, if say 90% adherance at write up must be 100% on next check, does not take inconsideration of shown improvement."
good,"*After getting through very strict security, then getting to location of time clock to get in line to punch in it is all hussle to get your required peice count. after 4 hours we get a lunch break, then work till 6:30 am or longer depending on how many people call out on day shift and total out of order from entire warehouse. If other departments need help getting the job in that department finished we may be required to go to that department which may result in overtime as well."
good,The working enviroment was very fast pace and multi tasking was a must for success along with knowledge of company operations.
good,"Warehouse environment.  Abundance of work, no time to get bored; work could be challenging it gave me the opportunity to work in an advanced distribution warehouse system.  The work force is   multicultural and diverse and if you can adjust to work in a  rotational shift you are in the right place.  Adjusting yourself to constant cross-training is the hardest part but at the same time it could be fun"
good,"I'd open the store at 7:45am, set up the newspapers, and begin taking care of customers. A second cashier would clock in around 11am-12pm, and I would take my half-hour lunch break. When I came back, I'd be stuck up at register; hardly ever on the floor. I'd clock out at 4pm-5pm, depending on when my relief came in."
good,"A consistently busy atmosphere that allowed managers opportunities to continually teach, train, and develop associates into more valuable assets for the company. The atmosphere was very family oriented which allowed workers to be more unified and determined to meet store expectations.  Upper management was very demanding and often neglected to consider personal family life or health as necessities for a properly functioning manager.  Could have been more opportunities for managers to become more developed and prepared for advancement opportunities."
good,"I was hired at 5 months pregnant by one manager who quit after my 2nd week. The new manager took me off the schedule when I was close to delivery and told me it was because I told him I had a second job and it was their ""policy"" that if an employee gets a second job to remove them from the schedule. Thus ending my employment with this company."
good,"Ringing up customers, stacking shelves, maintaining inventory.  Every other week, truck would come bringing new merchandise.  Bring merchandise and place in shelves."
good,The company continues to make strive for great customer services
good,"a typical day at work was to get all the prescriptions pumped out as fast as possible, this was my first pharmacy job where i learned it all.  how to bill insurances, how to set up prior auths and handle customers, this is where i learned that i have great customer service skills and am good with people. the hardest part of the job was that even though we got the work done it wasnt enough for them. we someone had to always advertise and get more more more. but thats a chain pharmacy for you. i still enjoyed them."
good,I assist customers by helping them choose a product and I use the register to help them pay. I also assist in uloading the delivery truck.
good,"My experience with this job was pretty good, a lot of regulars which made the job fun, but the management always had their own little pets on the job that would be able to get away with anything. Towards the end of my experience with the store itself, almost seemed that it was going towards a sexist store, treating all the males like nothing and letting women do what they wanted."
good,"the management was shotty, with no real communication and a lack of team effort"
good,"Signing for received packages and letters, defective/ outdates, stocking shelves, facing aisles, knowing location of items in store, assisting customers as well as management with what they asked of me."
good,I enjoy working at Rite Aid. There is a lot of room for advancement and a lot of diversity. Working in my community is what I really enjoy. Costumers from the store see me in the streets on a regular basis and are very polite and friendly.
good,"the job is low stress but it is also low in pay. You have the freedom to do things your own way but there is also no possibility of advancement in the company, no one above you moves so neither do you."
good,Rite Aid is a good first job for younf adults. You do alot of straightening and stock put up. The work schedule is very flexible.
good,"hours are bad and so is management. Some co workers are rude, very fast passed"
good,Avoid Employment. Unsafe & Dangerous Work Environment .Work typical  12 hours shift.
good,Not much room for advancement within company. A lot of work required for little compensation.
good,I did data entry to fill prescriptions. Waited on customers. Used registers & drive thru pharmacy pick up window. Would restock medications & do daily cleanings. I learned about the different medications & medical terminology.
good,Rite Aid has its pros but too many cons. They don't appreciate their people and they overwork you. They pay more money to those that they have to spend months training sadly. Instead of compensating those that already know the company...
good,"Great first job, I learned a lot from them.  Rite Aid taught me how to always put the costumer first."
good,"In my 11 years working for Rite Aid there were 5 or more different regional vice presidents that came and went. Each one had a different vision of what a store should look like, so there were many times when a job had to be done more than once to make the current RVP happy. Payroll in the store was constantly being cut even though the sales were increasing. This made for long hours and constant physical work for store managers. Most managers are salaried so there is no overtime pay, you can work 70 hours a week and only be compensated for 50 hours. Basically store managers for Rite Aid is a glorified stock person/cashier."
good,"I am thankful for the experience & eager to leave asap! "
good,"Love retail, this store is a fast-paced location in a high crime area that is the hardest part of the job."
good,Realizing that others are not as dedicated or hard-working as yourself.
good,"typical workload requires systematic process execution, lack of autonomy in decision making for field leaders; environment is risk adverse, however associates are extremely engaging and committed to success."
good,"Rite Aid was a good job to have during my high school life. I was flexible and good with hours. On a typical work day I was a cashier and stock shelves and do customer service. I loved the people I worked with, they made the job so much more enjoyable."
good,"Rite Aid was my first job since I was 16. I have learned to grow with the company and work with all the team members to finish up projects. Throughout the years, the higher management has in my eyes, been ridiculously expected miracles. A lot of work has been expected lately, but with less hours being offered. This causes the store management team to have to do more as a one person project and not getting much done. Overall, for every other reason I have enjoyed working with my team."
good,"A typical day at work demands care full observation of customers whether there intentions are honest or dishonest, in relation to purchasing items in store. I have learned to discern different body movements and perception, of different people I come in contact with. As far as management my store manager and I have developed a very good communicational and observational relationship in working together to prevent shoplifting. My co-workers are great to work with, great team work. The hardest part of the job is making the arrest and detaining customers, that are caught with great amount of stolen goods, then waiting for the arrival of the police, then doing the report of the initial events that occurred. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you can convince a person to be detained, give their information and acknowledge that what they had done will require certain consequences of being arrested. And finally last but not least pay day."
good,My duties include: prepare the workrplace for customer and write the activity sheet for the day; pay invoices and enter store credit; check my e-mail daily. update store information in store portal. i learned how to satisfaiy customer service and how to lead the team and let them work as one. also i was able to build a good team that can work together.  the hardest part of my job was the shop lifters because the location was in a very bad area. the most enjoyable part of the job is to work as a team and understand the circumstances for every one in my team.
good,It's a good place to start when your just starting in the work field.
good,"Lack of instruction, management. Low pay.  The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to know the community through the customers."
good,"A typical day at work includes processing, transcribing and entering patient information in the software system in order to produce a profile for patients.  Then I pull and process prescription orders and create labels for the medication containers and patient instructions.  I also answer phone calls, stock and organized medications, and place supply orders on a weekly basis.  I complete cash, check, and credit card transactions using a POS electronic cash register system."
good,"Room for advancement, training available for advancement, co-workers okay, hardest part of job is keeping customers satisfied, most enjoyable part of job is keeping customers satisfied and building a personal customer base"
good,"Constantly changing hours. Close one night then do load at 5am the next day."
good,"Average day in day out Retail Managerial."
good,I have been with Rite Aid for 9 years and would like to pursue the same line of work as i relocate in Virginia.  Working with people is fascinating for me...discovering all walks of life and being able to serve them in a field where they are at a disadvantage...not feeling well or needing medical consultation.
good,"I did enjoy working for Rite Aid. I loved my co-workers, but the management I can't say always seemed to favor me. But I didn't let that phase me because I was a hard worker and did all I could every time I worked"
good,"Rite Aid is a good company for advancement. The atmosphere of each store depends on the managment and their relationship with the other associates. I enjoy interacting with my boss and my co-workers and helping people does give me a certain satisfaction, but the job is very physical and mentally exhausting. The pay and benefits are not enough. Typically i go in and organize the day and delegate the jobs to be done and by whom they will be done; unless i am closing the store, in which case i would have left a detailed list of tasks to be completed before i arrived. i spend my day doing necessary tasks, managing the store and the associates on duty, dealing with vendors, helping customers and mentally preparing for the days to come based on what has or has not been accomplished in the work day. the hardest part of the job is balancing the needs of the company with the needs of the customer and the needs of the associate. It is not easy to manage the store and lead the team and be accountable to the powers that be. the most enjoyable part of my day is the interaction i have with the other associates."
good,A typical day at work involved filling prescriptions off the work queue
good,Very busy and chaotic.
good,One day we had a customer who paid with a false hundred dollar bill. She was arguing that its a real bill and she wants the product and the change. The cashier couldn't handle it so as a manager I had to handle it. I came and explained her the situation and literally showed her one of my hundred dollar bill and her false one to prove that she was given a false $100 bill from where ever she got it. She realized it and said sorry and thanks. I learned to handle critical situation and good management. All my employees were very friendly and co operative with me. The hardest part was to handle different kinds or customers from different ethnicity. The most enjoyable part was when I used to satisfy the customers.
good,a day in life as rite aid manger is exciting and fast paced from time you start till you go home .the value of just saying hi to customer and listing to there needs . Upper management could practice little more respect work like we a team instead of adversaries. My co- works were great and professional . Hardest part of my job is not having enough resources to preform daily duties.best part of my job was working and interacting with different cultures and peoples getting know them on first name
good,"Picking thinks from assembly, talked to friends. The heat was the hardest part to deal with. The most enjoyable part was making friends with co-workers"
good,"Fun Job, besides Hands-Off policy. makes it hard to apprehend shoplifters."
good,i stock shelvs cleaned bathrooms unloaded truck the management was fair i learned how to unload truck there co workers were hard working most enjoyable would be lunch time with every one
good,"Was treated good,good pay,good benefits,my hours were good,no weekends"
good,"Pay was ok, but the stress level and hours required to work took a toll on my family. Not only did I miss special events and holidays, but the drama ran over into my home life. Also, it was all about who you knew and not how hard you worked. Very immature. I did learn a lot of things there that helps me deal with people better."
good,Managed several employee's and maintained all aspects of ensuring customers had what they needed
good,I helped set up this brand new store for opening. I waited on customers and ran the cash register. I helped check in freight and put it away. Management was unapproachable. I couldn't get fulltime hours.
good,"The typical day for a store manageer starts with assessing what needs to be done that particular day and what has priority. Assigning tasks to the associates that are scheduled that day according to abbilities, also taking time to train new skills. Making the deposit and going to the bank. Processing invoices from merchandise delivered from outside vedors and mail. Reviewing sales from the previous day, week, and month. Tracking payroll and time cards, making schedules. Executing marketing plans. Keeping proper records of employees. Auditing to ensure company policy, and laws are being followed. The most enjoyable part of my day is having one on one time with the customers, being able to be the smiling face that greets them and makes sure they were able to come in to my store and find any thing they needed. The hardest part of my job is balancing my work life and home life. Even on my days off I feel obligated to answer phone calls for questions or possibly cover shifts that other employees may miss."
good,"All I did here was stand behind the cash register. If there were not any customers, that is still what I did. It was quite a while ago and that particular store is gone but relocated. It would have been better if they had something for you to do while waiting for a customer to be ready to check out."
good,"Hard some hard workers, customers to remember, rite aid teach you on a very hard work place. Yes you will learn from it."
good,"The days went by fast as we stayed busy. The staff was good to work with. I learned alot about differnet medications, how to read sig code, healthcare insurance and how it works, customer service, and retail."
good,"It's a neighborhood store with alot of the same customers, and I could walk to work and could run to the store in a few minutes if needed. When I started it was Eckerd Pharmacy and Rite Aid took over shortly after. The transition was stressful on everyone but we learned valuable skills. In this job I was given the same responsibilities as the Store Manager in every way. I received more experience there then any other management job I've had in the past."
good,"Even though the compensation and the possibility of advancement were slim to none, I loved working there. Besides the irate customers not having their prescriptions ready before they even walked into the store to hand it to you, (sarcasm) the co workers were all very nice, I enjoyed doing that aspect of the job, I am trying to go back."
good,A decent job for the pay. The management could be easy to work with. Able to complete tasks easily and do more.
good,"great management, good place to work for when your trying to get in the habit of working."
good,The job itself is quite challenging and difficult. You need a good understanding of math and weights and measures. You also need an attention to detail and high focus ability. It is also a very physically demanding job. That said customer service is very important. You interact with patients and doctors everyday.
good,"I worked as a pharmacy technician, so I cannot comment on front-end employment or experiences; the pharmacy team is always a dependable, helpful group of educated individuals working together as efficently as possible to help patients. Direct supervisors are a pleasure to work with and for (higher management, such as district managers or the corporate office are unattainable and faceless)."
good,i enjoyed working there but the hours they were giving me was just not enough to make it through.
good,"Help desk work can sometimes be fun. This was no exception. Great co-workers and decent management. Made many lasting friendships from this job. Initial job training was adequate, but the on-going training lacked severely, much like the antiquated equipment used by the company. Much job training was self educated and co-worker tutored; however, the work environment was laid back. Good worker moral for the most part, except when the air conditioning goes out on a hot summer day..."
good,I have worked at Rite Aid for six years and have had some great experiences. It can be hard to balance work and personal life there because of the hours. I am in school for Social Work because I want to experience a different field.
good,The harder you work they just used you to fix everything and don’t appreciate you they need to care about the employees as well not just the customers
good,"Always nice to meet new people, easy work pace. Typical day is straighten shelves, restocking and making sure the store is order for day to day customers."
good,Overall the company is ok. Stressful at times. Metrics that need to be met make it less desirable at times. Not much incentive to progress within the company
good,I work fast get the job done and do what I need to do to make sure the customer is happy and gets what they need! Also make sure their prescription is counted correctly. Or when I’m working on the floor I stock shelves and wait on customers!
good,"It really is a fun environment some days and The job itself is easy but working every weekend; Friday, Saturday and Sunday, That part is frustrating. Lots of favoritism. The schedule caters to those in school or working another job so the rest get stuck with whatever's left. The pay is insulting but if you want to pick up more hours you can volunteer at other stores"
good,"Everyone is very friendly, however you are working with the public so that is a struggle at times. But as long as you put in the effort and work as a team, its a great place to work"
good,Rite Aid is a good place to work and grow your skills. There are advancement opportunities and leaders want to help develop others. Growth and talent are Rite Aids priorities.
good,"Company is challenging, and the staff is really hard to train once they are set their ways. Constantly moving managers around. Over work their managers. Dont show appreciation towards their employees or the hard work that is put into the store."
good,"I have been with rite aid for over 5 years and it’s an alright place to be. The pay isn’t competitive but what do you expect from a company that has been bankrupt or had many debts. They are gradually trying to become better. The work atmosphere so far is good! You can create a lot of meaningful contacts. The amount you can learn is great as well. When it come to promotions, if u get the experience you want you want don’t stay longer than 5 years  but don’t make a career out of it unless you hold a high position."
good,"A typical day in the pharmacy at Rite Aid was, for the most part, a fast-paced retail pharmacy, with some big short staff issues which made for upset customers having to come back to the pharmacy a second and third time until their prescriptions were ready."
good,"I honestly have nothing outstanding to say about this company. There aren't many locations in my area - though further out and across the Bay they seem slightly more prominent. Prior to employment, I didn't even know they existed! I know they are more active on the other Coast. Management is very supportive of its employees and will have your back when you are treated unfairly, be by unruly customers or other employees.  Just be warned, while the Thrifty dip scooper-gun-apparatus-thing looks cool and is iconic, an hour of using it can really cramp up your hand, so switch off with another employee after a while."
good,productive environment. usually helping the cashiers to understand why there are different tasks. help customers with their different needs. receive different kind of products.
good,"management could be more respectful when it comes to training. No training hours are allocated for associates, its difficult while running a store process. Low pay and not equal to all employees. I was paid less than other assistant managers in the company"
good,"The pharmacy was poorly ran and managed, With a constant change in management every couple months, couple that with the incredibly disrespectful client base and you get a bad place to work. However, I did learn about medications and procedures during my time."
good,"A good place to work if you can work alone, have open availability, self motivated, responsible and productive. "
good,Standing behind a register for 6 hours then going to unload a truck is too much vertical strain on the body. A chair at an appropriate fixed height to greet the customers would've been lovely.
good,"For  the time I worked for Rite Aid I was very happy with my day to day duty's.  There was great support within the team that I worked with every day as I supported those. The work could be stressful at times, but it could also be gratifying too. As a strong team player I enjoyed being a mentor to new team members. I was fortunate to have a great boss that gave me the ability to plan my day to day activity's as I seen fit to preform my duty's."
good,"Don t know how they are  now, but wanted to offer me a store mgr  position ONLY after I accepted an offer with Longs drugs..The district Manager at the time was a hardass.."
good,"Job itself was great...store manager lacked in ethics and moral judgement..she was also embezzling funds...and was arrested.  At times it was a hostile work environment..  I tried to notify the corporation and HR due to the environment  ..and which nothing was done.  I had enough, turned in my keys and left."
good,We get busy through out the week due to many customers coming to receive there medications and Grocery’s. Some Days can be rough and others can be very slow with very little to do.
good,"I worked overnight and it was always hard to juggle the constantly contradicting messages from the store's manager and the assistant manager who came off as lazy and entitled. I was always told that facing the store should be my primary focus unless there were incoming items to stock but the assistant manager would be angry if we didn't finish small tasks like placing labels or whatever thing she would have to do if my overnight team didn't accomplish. At one point, they cut the hours for the other overnight person and I would spend an hour alone in the store every shift in addition to however long it took for the assistant manager to show up to relieve me (she was once 40 minutes late)."
good,"Our store was pretty big, as Rite Aid’s go, and only mildly busy. We were transitioning into becoming Walgreens. Corporate has this thing where, if the store isn’t making as much money, they don’t give the scheduler more hours. Because we were transitioning into Walgreens, we didn’t carry a lot of our usual products so people stopped buying them. So our hours were cut significantly. As I said before, we had a larger than average store, but there was only one person working the floor and the registers and then a manager at one time. This made the store impossible to maintain and we would get in trouble for it. They held our hours hostage and blamed us for it. It was awful. But I loved my coworkers, so I don’t regret working there."
good,"I worked there probably almost a year. A typical day would be very very fast paced, which meant many of us would get frustrated with such a low staff. Customers also weren’t the nicest, as well as SOME staff not all. If you’re new just keep in mind to have patience as well also keep in mind your staff might not be as nice ( they forget your new and treat you as if you know everything already) but other than hat just try to keep a smile on your face and work through it."
good,"Management staff is based in California.  Benefits and expectations are what you would expect from a retail pharmacy including counseling, MTM, vaccines, and customer service."
good,"This company offered training, which is very helpful in setting employees up for success. They continued to provide this and other training throughout the tenure of staff."
good,"As the title said, the job duties aren’t too bad but I had to basically threaten to leave to make $10.50 an hour as a supervisor. "
good,"Rite Aid was always behind on filling scripts which created extra stress and difficulty pleasing customers. I learned, however, a lot about the process of working in a pharmacy and gained knowledge about pharmaceuticals."
good,"Was able to change a shift when needed and assignments. Listened to the employees, we had a round table conference once a month that allowed us to voice our concerns."
good,"rite aide was not a bad place to work, however the store I was at did not rotate shifts.  I was told weekend shifts and closing shifts would rotate. however that apparently is a store to store option"
good,Everyone in the rite aid store i was in are very outgoing people and have bright personalities. The only downfall of this store is that it is very laidback and at most times you don’t have anything to do.
good,They promise you 8hrs a day. (maybe maybe not) you know what time you come in but never know from day to day what time you are getting off. therefore it is hard to make doctors app.
good,The store that i worked in had very cool people working there. The managers were very involved with us all. One problem i had noticed is that Rite Aid does not have good management in the higher-ups.
good,"Not a job for someone who has bad anxiety, high stress levels or, high blood pressure. A very stressful job Customers can be rude. Management isn't so great. Pay is alright and the benefits are pretty good but would not recommend this job to just anyone. Constantly selling liquor and checking ID's is stressful when customers don't cooperate with the rules."
good,I enjoyed working there but the management needs help to be more honest and understanding of their employees. But I am grateful for the experience in retail.
good,This company no longer cares about it’s employees. The workload is extremely heavy with only 2 ppl to a shift to handle it. The company also allows. Wet little time to train their new hires. They are just thrown into the store and expected to keep up with the pace of the store.
good,"I appreciated all of my co-workers, and managers they were always nice and we got the job done. The pay however was state minimum wage which for me was 7.25 and you get about a 10 cent raise annually so wasn't anyway to live in my area with that kind of pay."
good,"The hardest part of the job is being able to keep up with all of the customers and patients. Unfortunately, the store was understaffed, so it seemed like too much work was placed on each individual to compensate for that."
good,"there is not much to do most days, when a truck order comes in everyone works to stock the shelves, taking money, taking passport pictures, keeping the front organized"
good,Working for Rite has been really good for me especially when working under a great management team. The only down fall to working for this company is that when something goes wrong there really isn’t a whole lot of help. You have to jump through hoops to get what you need.
good,"I love working for this place, love interacting with customers, and my co-workers are great, but...I don't see any room for advancement and there pay schedule is way lower than what it should be, which is the only reason I want to look for a better paying job.  Previously to hiring, I was told there would be yearly increases, which I have not seen in the last 3 years maybe .20 but that is harley a pay raise, not worth the effort to work so hard and gain so little."
good,I just wish that Rite aid will increase our vacation hours or im hoping we can take our full 3 weeks straight vacation instead of only 1 week at a time.
good,"It was a fine job for what I needed as I was going to school."
good,"Great experience, lots of work, weekends and holidays. Lots of heavy lifting on truck days. Some co-workers call out on holidays. Dependable and team playing necessary to advance."
good,"During my time working at Rite-Aid, a typical day of work included dealing with customers at checkout, making sure there was plenty of stock on the shelves, organizing stock, cleaning the floors, cleaning the checkout table, taking out the garbage, and collecting all the carts.  "
good,"My review is based on the fact that I openly admit to not knowing or fully understanding how corporate America works. That said, working here is like a lot of entry level jobs and I could compare it to working at a fast food place. The pay is not good. The idea is that front end sales associates and pharmacy techs are easily replaced. There is not need to pay much more over minimum wage because of this idea."
good,You would come into work and go into the office to see what the tasks would have to do for the day.  Mostly cleaning out the back storage unit to stock the shelves and twice a week you would get a truck delivery and provide customer service at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and working with the team.  The hardest part of the job was fixing all PI counts for inventory. You had to go through every single item in the store because the counts had to be exact. Management would do their best but was not organized. I learned that you always have to be fast paced but always making sure to always make the customers happy that was most important
good,I have been with riteaid for 5 years and I was happy and content working there until this pharmacist got hired and went downhill from there. She kept getting me in trouble and I was always getting written for being late when everybody else there is late as well and never got in trouble. There's definitely favoritism. The manager can be rude and mean. He reprimands me like I'm a little kid.
good,"It's retail. Most customers were pleasant but every now and then, you get a rotten person who's only purpose in the store is to torment the clerks. Minimum wage with very small raises annually."
good,"I worked at rite aid for 14 years when I left I was making 8.00 a hour, we worked our butt off for little pay, I transferred to the pharmancy and they never sent me to take my tech test to be certified, because they would have to give me a raise.  I turned in a 2 week notice and got another job."
good,"I used to work as Loss Prevention and had my position terminated due to budget cuts. They have since reinstated Loss Prevention and even though I really liked my store, the coworkers, and the managers , I wouldn’t go back....simply because they are all gone now. It’s an entirely new staff. There’s is only one original person who is still there. Overall, it was a great job and I thoroughly enjoyed the freedom I had as Loss Prevention. Good Luck to all who secure employment. I hope you make it in your career path."
good,Love the people i work with but the setting is unprofessional the hours suck they dont want to give enough hours to pay enough workers so the techs they have now are too over worked they dont allow some to go to school or advance their careers
good,"The job pays well and the benefits are great, but they work you like  a dog. Its very difficult to balance a home life and work. There is mandatory overtime every week on your days off. Although you do get paid time and a half the job is very tiring. It eventually starts to take a toll on you body. Ive been there almost 6 years im in my mid 20s but I feel like I have the body of a 50 year old already."
good,this job was a great environment to work for. I liked coming into work everyday. The only downside is the pay. It was worse when everyone thought i was getting paid more money that minimum wage
good,"Very fast paced. Had to always meet goals in setting planograms, floor displays for Christmas, Halloween, etc. miss the fast pace of this job would love to go back"
good,"My job really just consisted of completing the required drawings assigned to me on a daily basis.  occaisionally there were special projects, but always assigned projects in my designated area."
good,Ok to start with but pay is very poor for the amount of work and responsibility. I did learn a lot from them and the computer system is very easy to use.
good,"A day at work consists of various merchandising or freshness work as well as cashiering. I learned about various business aspects such as money handling, merchandising, and customer service. Certain management is lacking, and every employee knows it. There are no hard parts of the job, everything is very straightforward. The days can be long and drawn out, depending on how much work there is to do"
good,"Love the people working for Rite Aid. Hate the customers shopping at Rite Aid. Despite a ""one store one team"" mentality, front end and pharmacy didn't get along well. "
good,"Its good company to work for a first time employment, there is room for growth in certain areas. Long term, however, depends on your financial needs and location. Benefits are ok."
good,Rite aid is not a bad place to work for if you have adequate staff to help. However normally this is not the case because there is such a high turnover rate of pharmacy technicians. The reason for the turnover rate is low pay. It is a horrible and viscous cycle. Eventually the staff gets tired of being underpaid and overworked.
good,"Assisted the Pharmacist, answered phones, filed papers, stocked medications, and vials; cashiered when needed on main floor, maintenance work, provide customers service, organized retail merchandise, and closed out registers at end of night."
good,I've never had any issues working for rite aid.  Just never seen opportunities for growth with the company. Management was always helpful and friendly.
good,the work was light but the mangers had favorites hours where political and there was given to the favorites but i did enjoy the work i liked seeing the costumers and helping them with any thing the needed
good,"At Rite-Aid your in charge of most register operations as well as customer service. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the necessary tasks during times of high customer volume. Management could have used improvement, rude and aggressive leadership is what i believe caused high turnover with cashiers. However from this job i learned much about conflict resolution and customer service."
good,"not too many hours, pretty slow, usually just one cashier and a manager on. Main manager is usually in a bad mood and schedule is sometimes late, and they mess up requests"
good,"A good pharmacy chain overall, but very sink or swim when it comes to learning policies, procedures, and the computer system. It has a lot of good features such as an automated system that calls the patient when prescriptions are ready."
good,"IT's a fun and nice place to work, I just wish the management communication skills were better. I also did not like the point system that they have set up."
good,"to help pharmacist to fill priscription  data entry, product despensing , put the order, ordering over the counter medication, basic customer service  answering phone"
good,"You will be working a minimum wage job, not really much else to say. $11.50 an hour and you will be putting up with a lot of bad attitudes and customers who believe that their personal problems are yours to deal with."
good,"There isn't a lot of payroll for stores so this means you work twice as hard to make sure tasks are complete while still trying to help customers and make sure they are happy and content. Some managers are great while others can be very vocal and mean right in front of customers. The insurance benefits used to be decent but has recently been an argument over whether they will cover services that they have covered before. It is very rare to be able to take a break and sit and eat because there is no crossover coverage, especially for managers. The best thing about working here is the regular customers that come into the store and the long term employee's become like family to each other. And don't expect to be paid a livable wage for as hard as you work. Raises are 2% each year for everyone regardless of how hard you work or not."
good,the job was pretty relax. customers seemed to be a priority at the location i was at. i worked numerous stores in the district. this company just merged with walgreens pharmacy.
good,"All Rite Aids in Georgia where purchased by Walgreens."
good,Some managers are good. Others are only there for a check and not good leaders. Hours are always scarce for non managers. hardest part of the job is always working in an understaffed store.
good,"Easy job for someone who is fresh out of high school. Typical day of work includes greeting customers, maintaining the store at closing hours and managing a cash register"
good,Not a lot of one on one contact with store mgr. I did learn the inner workings of a pharmacy/convenience store. Unloaded a supply order shipment truck was the hardest part of the job. The moral at the store was not very high due to being open on holidays. Working face to face with customers is what I liked most.
good,"Rite was my first real job, learned about customer service and the people worked well together and it was a pleasant experience, relaxing culture and very patience with new workers."
good,"I wanted to go back to school and they did not want to work with my hours. Then i had to relocate to the other side of the city and they did not want to transfer me, So i ended up quitting because management was not trying to be helpful and I was not getting any hours."
good,"I ready for change with benefits. I work hard and I feel I’m not appreciated "
good,Rite Aid is quick paced environment with many long days and some required Saturdays.  I have learned to work with other associates and departments to make the work go smoothly.
good,Right it was not very consistent of the training program for management we were understaffed and high and Theft and no protection for the associates but under staff
good,It's a job it's fun at times but it's gets boring at times as well. But I'm a peoples person so it's fine I enjoy talking to different people and meeting people.
good,"If you enjoy walking back and forth down the same 4 or so isles its a job for you. When you are stocking shelves you are assigned to a section of the store to work and that part of the store is your job to upkeep. I've worked in the same section for a year, and it makes sense that you really get to know what goes where in your isles but I still don't know where everything is in the store or whether or not we carry a specific item because I've rarely worked in them. Also, one problem that I had was scheduling. the schedules are made every Tuesday for the next week. So if you wanted to make plans you had to wait until the schedule was put out to know what days you were off."
good,"Normal schedule, they have overnight pay $1 more truck comes  3 out the week overall good place to work until u get your career. The can fired you for simple things"
good,"The company itself is great to work for, but it really depends on the department you're in and the manager you work under. Some are better than others, as with any company."
good,management was more friendly than strict more of a push over. personal business was always talked about by management. a lot of drama within the job..
good,"It was a good job until to many people from outside got involved."
good,"The shift supervisor position is an entry level management position. I started during a time of a lot of employee turnover, but the store flow is pretty relaxed with a few busy moments. Depending on your location and staff will determine your experience."
good,It's retail so it's the same no matter where you go. Not as fast paced and stressful as CVS.  Workflow was a little different but it worked. Not as many techs on at one time but it's slower paced so that is ok.
good,"Rite Aid warehouse is not the place for me. You are doing the same thing day in and day out. The pay was ok to start, but for how much you are doing you should get a raise."
good,"Retail pharmacy tech- customer service, multitask, fast paced.  The pharmacists are wonderful to work with and the manager of this pharmacy is the reason why patients continue to use the pharmacy.  He knows the patients by name and will go out of his way to ensure everyone is taken care of."
good,"very stressful, unorganized, management was not held accountable. low pay for the type of work being conducted and confidential information. I would not recommend Rite Aid for employment"
good,"Very stressful, hectic  work environment.  Stores are chronically understaffed. Came into work and hour early and usually stayed an hour after closing to keep the place caught up and I am not considered slow at all in fact I am considered very fast."
good,"it is what it is,,, it pays the bills."
good,"There were times that I felt I was in a position to learn about the business and advance, but there were also times that the store manager was not helpful at all. It was like they were making it difficult for me to get to the next level. I wouldn't have thought that kind of attitude would exsist in a pharmacy retail chain but I guess you can find those types anywhere."
good,I have to say that in this company you get a lot done. There's always a lot of work to do and returns and train cashiers etc. In this company i have to say that you do learn a lot and get to meet so many different people.
good,"If you are going to work in the toxic, soul-sucking chain retail pharmacy industry, Rite Aid is a fine choice. You will not be treated any worse than if you worked at any other chain; it may be even a little better as Rite Aid is too incompetent to be as cutthroat as CVS or WAG. I would never leave Rite Aid to work at any other retail chain. There is nothing wrong with this company that isn't wrong with the whole industry."
good,"My pharmacy team was one of the best. I loved working with the people I worked with. It truly is like a second family, and you will always have a support system. However, there are few raises and no room for advancement or promotion within the company. My job was also extremely stressful, especially when there were circumstances beyond my control, like backordered medication, brand name limitations, insurance rejections, and the work load to employee ratio. The pay is not adequate for what you are expected to deal with—customers repeatedly berating you for things that are beyond your control."
good,I loved working at that specific Rite Aid. We had a Strong team from the front to the back. But working for the corporation itself was horrible. No room for advancement no matter how hard you work. This job is for high school to college age groups. If your looking for an actual career go elsewhere. Or you will be working there 15 plus years getting paid peanuts.
good,Working at the warehouse is steady work. As long as you make your production and keep your points down you will make it here. But the place is a revolving door. Just can't keep people the way they used too. The overtime is ridiculous. When the volume is low you are still gonna work 2-4 hrs overtime. People have children they can't work those long hours. For the work you do the pay should be higher.
good,"The job was easy enough, though very repetitive, and  the hours weren't bad. There were also employees discounts, so that was nice. It's a very physical job."
good,The manager was lazy he always wanted me to do his work for him while he stays in his office and one co worker stayed at the register her whole shift she never wanted to do restock items and asked me to do restock all the items that customers didn’t buy.
good,A very demanding job that works you but does not pay you what you are worth. While upper manager makes tons of money they give you scrapes and their expectation is for you to do their jobs for less.
good,"Pharmacy is what you make of it. Rite Aid provides the opportunity to interact with patients, perform MTM services, provide immunizations, and provide pharmaceutical care to diverse patient populations within long shift hours with no breaks, thin technician and pharmacist hours."
good,Responsible for the operation of 33 RA pharmacies in Western Penna. THis included 40 pharmacists and approximately 50 technicians in the highly competitive Pittsburgh market.
good,"Good benefits but salary not competitive"
good,management was always looking at what you were doing it felt like you weren't even allowed to breath. you werent allowed to talk to co workers unless you were on break. Not a good place for someone who is going to school and trying to have a better life. coworkers are always judging you and customers. hated the job.
good,"i feel like the management could've been more professional, they did not handle certain situations in a good way. some managers would speak badly about workers in ways they shouldn't it was just very horrible."
good,It was a good place to work on certain nights due to the volume of customers and the way the store was managed. I would consider returning if the managed differently and if the pay was better.
good,"I fell in love with my job the very first week and even plan to go to school  for pharmacology because of it. The customers can be wicked cutthroat people sometimes, while others become like family to you. You'd be surprised how quickly we learn your name and even birthdate by heart. The job is very fast-paced and stressful, but also very rewarding at the end of the day and requires a lot of thinking. You get a lot of funny stories out of it from customers! The benefits aren't that great and the pay is terrible. (Minimum wage with only a 17 cent raise after the first year for me) The company is always putting more and more pressure on their pharmacists and make them work long unfair hours. I've known a handful that have developed depression and anxiety and actually work with a pharmacist that had a mental breakdown in the pharmacy, but didn't even get enough time off to fully recover before having to come back. To see them suffer makes us suffer. The hours allotted to the technicians reflect on how many scripts are done and sold, but there's never enough help without us doing overtime (and the company frowns upon that)  Because of this, we never have time for an actual lunch, let alone a break, so we end up shoveling down a bag of chips in the back corner of the pharmacy for some energy so we don't pass out. We can't even keep enough medications and supplies in stock without our pharmacy manager getting an email telling us not to do so because it's ""wasteful"", even though we always end up using it, running out completely for awhile, ordering more, getting complaints from customers"
good,"I enjoyed working in the healthcare field and enjoyed some of the people I worked with, however I was under-payed for the work I did and it's not where I want to work any longer."
good,"I had a great time working with almost all my co-workers and loved helping our customers. Front end staff was awesome to work with. I can not say the same about a few staff in the Pharmacy. overall it was a great working experience for me. I definitely suggest working front end and not Pharmacy, main reason is because there were a few associates in the Pharmacy who focused on what my job duties were instead of  focusing on their own and I felt really uncomfortable working in this type of atmosphere."
good,"Working at Rite Aid is a typical retail experience at a small store.  You deal with customers at the checkout or on the floor, manage the inventory, and set up displays every season.  It's not a bad job, but your not really going to go anywhere with it."
good,"I will say when I first started working here, I was a few months pregnant. The further along I got, the bigger I got and every single employee was so great to me. Letting me sit, take often breaks and giving me time off if I was sick. The pay wasn't the best nor the benefits but it paid the bills!"
good,"I manage the inbound, outbound and replenishment operations within the facility a long with Inventory control and the Customer Service departments."
good,There is a lot of turnover at this company.  However the starting pay is average for other jobs of this nature compared to other companies in the area.
good,"The job was ok, fast pace and a bit stressful due to management. Retail is always a hard place to work. The manager there was a bit high strung and seemed to be always stressed."
good,"I would show up each day prepared to catch and many people stealing as possible. I was an undercover agent so I would wear normal clothes and act like a shopper. After catching someone, I would attempt to get them back into the store to fill out paper to get their information to do a report to send it into the system. The Rite Aid legal staff take over from that point. I would also make sure any high theft or expensive item had a protection device on it."
good,it was a hard day everyday we picked pack totes run up and down stairs we cant never go fast enough the company is never satisfied with a person work its not good.
good,"Main manager was lousy with time schedules and made the other managers pick up after him and stress them out or yell at them for not finishing his work."
good,"The pharmacy side of the company is very competitive, fast paced with alot of traffic. their will be many issues that you will have to be intuitive in and must resolve. You are dealing with the public with which are mostly sick, in pain, fighting addictions, or other aliments. You play an important role making sure the get the right medication while protecting there information and the interests of you company."
good,"Overall decent place to work. For someone's first job, staff could've been friendlier and more supportive. Did not deal with management to often but overall okay"
good,if managed better it could be great there but the atmosphere was tense and things were not done to code. there was no positive reinforcement so it was hard to stay positive and be energetic at Rite Aid
good,Can be very stressful during certain times of the year. Great coworkers to work with. I learned a great deal of retail compliance. The hardest part I would say is the scheduling of 60 pharmacist throughout the year around various vacations and holidays. The most enjoyable part was the great set of coworkers I had the opportunity to work with which can be rare in the workplace.
good,"Fast paced.  There's nothing very hard about working at Rite Aid.  But there is usually no room for advancement.  Lunch breaks are short and depending on staff scheduled, you may or may not get to get lunch."
good,"typical day a rite aid would just be coming in and clocking in just either stay behind the counter and ring up customers or just restocking aisles. I learned how to deal with retail customers and how to cope with every little complaint. In addition, rite aid was my first job so it really opened my eyes when it comes to leading and multitasking. Management was horrible to be honest, my manager wanted everything to go his way or the high way, if you dont do stuff the way he likes for you to do it then he will yell at you in the middle of the floor and just make you feel humiliated. The culture at this job is just multitasking and being excellent at customer service, I have always been a people person so customer service was never really an issue but since this was my first job, multitasking skills I gained over time. The hardest part of this job would be the fact that you have to be attentive towards everything such as cameras , who was next or not, any stocks that had to be refilled. The most enjoyable part would have to have been having a good relationship with my co-workers and assistant manager because they would distract from time to time and time will go much faster when you have someone to talk to."
good,"Very busy and fast paced, but the days went by quickly working with some of the best coworkers around. The upper management for corporate are not as friendly."
good,I enjoyed working for this company for the most part the only real complaint I have for it is about the pharmacy hours and running low or out of scripts easily because then the Customer give the entire store and staff a hard time
good,"A good starter job, but don't look to advance quickly, even if you have the skills. The pay is not that great, but I can't complain too much, as I was treated fairly most of the time."
good,Very fast paced and some what stressful work environment. Most of the store management was awesome. Loved the relationships I formed with customers that we helped. Hardest part of the job was dealing with really crabby people and having to constantly explain why it takes so long to fill a prescription.
good,The work is very fast paced and you have certain amount of time to get everything in order. Customers are very friendly and a joy to the store and do business with but the associates and work environment can be nonfriendly mostly and that can tend to be a problem. Very stressful especially when your self trained and don't have the reliable resources to help you along the way.
good,"More technicians needed to complete all aspects of patient care.  Many expectations with little time to confidently complete."
good,"I had a good time while it last but, the overtime and lies got to me. On the application I was told my hours were to be 7:30pm to 3:30am. Once I work my first day that was my last day of 8 hours. The supervisor had favorite that got away with everything and could do whatever they want. I got tired of busting my tail and people was get away."
good,"Definitely not a high paying employer, average position with pay slightly above minimum wage, workplace culture is decent, management can be difficult to work with, corporate seems out of touch."
good,"show up, do your job.  do everything you can not to be noticed, except for the fact that you ARE doing your job.  don't get too comfortable with co-workers, cause as soon as you get a good crew, they're gone."
good,"data entry, processing and typing prescriptions,filling prescription,answering phone, customer service, filing. inventory. management is usually nice. hardest part is nasty customers and the pay. most enjoyable is the coworkers."
good,"The experience at Rite Aid differs at every location in my opinion. Rite Aid was my first job out of high school so I learned a lot about being professional, handling money, and general customer interaction skills.  A typical day at Rite Aid depends on your position, work shift and tasks given to you by the managers"
good,Upper management turnover rate was excessive resulting in constant changes. Employee morale could have been much higher. Raises were minimal although duties were constantly added on for all employees while payroll was frequently cut.
good,"In the pharmacy you learned a lot about medications, dosing, compounds and side effects.  Every day was a new learning experience.  Customer satisfaction was of high priority as was quality of service and accuracy of dispensing medication."
good,It's a nice starting job for people with no experience or people who need health insurance but once you start to look for more high paying jobs or a career look elsewhere.
good,I like working with my co workers and pharmacist but the company simply doesn't pay technicians enough. They keep cutting pharmacy hours constantly. You can't support a family while working here as a technician unless you have 10+ years with the company.
good,"Rite Aid has had it's series of missteps and poor management decisions over the years, but overall it is a fine company to work for.  It's just like any other retail chain."
good,Nice job good store clean work place nice people good product all way can find what u need all could the days I need off and family friendly. Good customers service
good,It allowed me to travel the city just to gwt there by light rail because it was so far but i loved working the line the people was nice but the job didnt stay.
good,"The hardest part of the day can be at night when you're trying to do your duties, and make sure the staff is doing their job as well.  Once all work is done, and you've checked the employees work, they can be released to go home.  However, you must check them before leaving the store because employee theft was a BIG problem."
good,"I was able to learn how to drive the Forklift, Walkies Riders. The management only look up to what they need; money for the Company and don't take to consideration the welfare of the employees. The hardest part of the job is to to stand for 12 hours busy picking, packaging etc with speed and accuracy. To serve as Supervisor or Manager and to ride and of the machinery. I also learned the process of working very hard to earn what you need. That is the goal of the Company must be met each day.There was no day to enjoy at work during my stay there. We worked seven days a week with five days off after the period. Workers just focus on doing the jobs and no one has time for the others except those who originate from a common place."
good,"company is possibly selling to Walgreens.  The limited payroll makes it difficult to staff the store.  Hopefully, the company will be bought by Walgreens and the employees can keep their employement and be able to grow with Walgreens"
good,"The work is good and there is never a dull moment. If there are not customers waiting then there is always something to do, so there is never any idle time. Breaks are 30 minutes when you have a longer shift."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Rite Aid, but I felt that there were requirements that would involve higher pay for the position. I was a cashier doing work of a shift supervisor because the environment was so slow-paced, and I like to have something to constantly do at work."
good,Great job for a new manager needing experience as a manager on duty. The job duties are not hard and are essential duties for a retailers operations. There are opportunities to grow with in the company.
good,"The pay is not worth the amount of stress that comes with the job. People and managers are good however, upper management asks for too much. The hours are flexible though. No benefits though for part-time workers"
good,"Greeting customers and checking them out,  Restocking shelves.  "
good,"Mostly a decent place to work, but always room for improvement. Always work to be done, need a more efficient way to receive freight. It was a great place to learn and grow. Prepared me for futures retail positions."
good,a typical day would be called in on an off day at work because we were always short staff truck delivery at least once a week only two guys at most hauling in a whole truck by ourselves in set amount of time always expected & pressured to perform above average. At the time i was just a high school student it caused a lot of stress and sleepless days.
good,With the pending merger with Walgreens the environment was very stressful to managers. Many left because of the uncertainty of the company future with potential stores closing and potential loss of jobs for all managers when restructuring starts .
good,"Overall it's a decent place to work if your a student in school rather than working full time when you've finished school. I don't receive benefits because I'm part-time, however I do receive a 401k  matched up to 6%. I like my boss because he's detail oriented and we have family life in common, he has an baby who's over a year and my son is 10 months. Turnover is very high here, so we are constantly understaffed and its super stressful to get everything accomplished especially during the summertime or during the holidays. Holidays you receive 1.5 just like any other company. I really like most of my employees I work with and that's what is making me stay here."
good,"Loved being able to learn something new everyday.  Fast paced and challenging.  Company overall not run well.  Some good programs were started, but no thought put into how to run them or maintain them long term."
good,"DM in our district is easy to work for. Understanding and always available."
good,The company is way understaffed so unless you are management you will be stuck up front the whole time. The job itself can be frustrating but rewarding and there is a lot of room for advancement.
good,"Rite aid is a decent enough place to work but we got no raises and there is  no chance for advancement at this company "
good,I like working at Rite Aid everybody is friendly.... I have really great coworkers they motivate me and make me feel like an asset to the company. Rite Aid is a good company to work for.
good,A typical day at work would include interacting with customers and providing exceptional customer service. Handling register tills and money. Making deposits and going to the bank. Completing tasks in a timely manner.
good,Rite Aid was a great learning experience. It helped me rise to the level of Manager I am today. It has a friendly atmosphere. Room for advancement is limited.
good,"Very fast paced work, and little time for breaks if you want to survive the rush hours. Although it can be stressful at times, if you have a great team it is a great place to work."
good,"Limited payroll to manage day to day operations within a store.  Little support from the upper levels, they are more worried about making bonus and providing harsh criticism."
good,"A little unorganized and under staffed when I was there. Stress levels were high and some people were unhappy. However, I worked with great people that made the experience much better."
good,"good retail job to have on the side while having a main job just to get extra income and also gives out alot of hours at the time i was still in high school and they werent willing to comply with my school schedule at all , management only cared for topics that were convenient to them."
good,pharmacy tech at rite aid can be a nice job for someone just starting in the field of medicine. but if your are not in school to be a pharmacist there is no advancement for you
good,Have to be able to multi task and work under pressure. the hardest part of the job is not letting customers get under your skin. The actual work environment is comfortable and professional.
good,Started out as Eckerd's which was really good place to work for before transitioning over to Rite-Aid. Became extremely demanding as forks operator-felt rules changed too often.
good,"At first Rite Aid was a wonderful company to work for. Over the past years, it's become harder and harder to advance within the company and still express yourself. They claim diversity is welcomed and encouraged but only if it's within their guidelines. Speaking your mind no long feels encourages and your opinions have very little value if any at all. Depending on the location you work at, you can have a fantastic and fun experience, but overall you'll find it harder and harder to deal with the demands of corporate."
good,A typical day at work would be at the cashier and organizing in the halls. I learned how to be better when working on the cashier. The workplace culture is very calm and quiet. The hardest part of the job would have to be when the cashier gets very busy and have to deal with a lot of customers. The most enjoyable part of the day is in the morning when its nice and quiet and not a lot of people are there.
good,Enjoyed working with people from the area I lived in. They cared about there customers and knew most of them by name. Store was always very neat and clean.
good,"corporate atmosphere ... like CVS but without the success "
good,I worked for Rite Aid for a while and did not like it dreaded everyday going in actually would not recommend to anyone that would like to further their careers
good,For me it was fun but not a career job for me. Unless it was full time theirs a chance. If you like multitasking and being around people this would be the job for you. Theirs a lot of things you can do to keep yourself busy. I highly recommend someone who wants this job especially there first job.
good,"customer interaction, cash handling, team work, inventory management, friendly co-workers, fast paced, customer oriented, focus on customer satisfaction while maintaining a clean and positive shopping experience, payroll"
good,managers are over worked and underpaid but kids in school treated decent. flexible hours and scheduling was okay as an associate etc
good,"Very Busy"
good,Job is not bad but management is terrible and and warehouse is unorganized and a lot of unnecessary overtime. when you ask off for emergencies they act like they don't believe you. ther no set time to get off you work til you are done.
good,"Staff are friendly and always willing to help each other, pharmacist there were fun and friendly. Rite aid pharmacy is  always very busy because is the only one in town."
good,"Not a horrible place to work, enjoyed my in-store co-workers and loved my customers.  Corporate offices however are not supportive or available. Very little training and no room for advancement, unless you are part of the ""in"" crowd. Pay is the lowest in the pharmaceutical retail industry."
good,"A day at work would be clock in and get to work no hi or how are you from your bosses. They all tell you do this and that today, that  would be the first thing to come out of their mouth and with no curtesy being said."
good,My typical day at work as a cashier included helping customers find products and process their purchases. Management was very laid-back and friendly.
good,"A typical day at Rite Aid means multi-tasking, assuring all areas of work is completed while ensuring the best customer service. Teamwork and excellent communication amongst your colleagues is a must where work is divided amongst each other while working around the clock.  Certain quota's need to be completed in order to keep the store running smoothly. Though the communication amongst the employees are great, Rite Aid has a tendency to promote excessive supervisors. Each one with their own incentive but when 3 or more working under one shift, their communication amongst each other has no direction, no uniformity. Most of the supervisors are so busy supervising, work is getting build up and  lack of work is being done, so more work is being distributed amongst the employees.  There's are employee meetings and CBT that are very clear but I feel perhaps the management/supervisors meeting are not distinct.  Over, the years I've seen them become less professional and directionless. One of the main reason so many employees are leaving.  Yet ,the best part are the customers. To have them call you by your first name and request to only have you serve with their needs."
good,"work would be slow,"
good,"I was a manager @ riteaid. It was a baby sitting job where there was never enough help, and the manager was stuck with thoughless tasks that hourly employees should have completed. Wasn't a bad job just blah."
good,"cool, easy going, hours are decent, depends on your own schedule, no one to answer to .. come and go as you please office cleaning and vaccuming, mileage pay, jobs are broken down into a couple hours at a time, so you can get to one and another"
good,"It is a fun place to work, the staff is great. I have learned a lot in this position. I have learned to be patience and I have learned to deal with a variety of people in  different situations. I have learned teamwork and I have learned to work well alone. "
good,"Many things to do in running a store. Not enough help a lot of times to complete all the tasks of the day. Physically demanding work. the best part was the job was helping the customers find the items needed to make their trip to the store a productive one. Merchandising the store with new products and seasonal merchandise. Balancing registers and doing the banking.  The upper management was not helpful, and very critical and condescending. And shoplifters paradise,because the lack of help allowed on a given week do to payroll restraints. You need to run a business for the customer not about cutting budget so the DM makes more profit for their bonus. Pay rate for new hires is terrible.  And they would always restructure store bonuses so a manager  has no hope in receiving much for there hard work."
good,"I was a new employee ,  so  for me that time was a very busy all the time. trying to learn everything. had a great pharmacy manager. very helpful."
good,"very nice place to work, stressful at times but overall great job. Customers are nice, the pharmacy is a nice place to work"
good,A typical day at work would be me standing in front of a computer typing up prescriptions while answering phones and also greeting costumers at the drop off area. I learned a lot about pharmaceuticals and terminology and what a corporation wants from you. My co-workers were definitely what kept me there and in a good mood everyday at work. I think that and also getting out scripts on time and in a sufficient timely manner were the most enjoyable parts of the job.
good,"A typical day at work is taking care of customers and fill their prescription in a timely fashion, to make sure the patient hasn't waited for a long period of time and to make sure the customer leaves happy. The goal is to make it their best experience so they could return.  I am bilingual, besides English, I speak Portuguese fluently. I translate for Portuguese speaking customers. I would say the hardest part of my job is trying to make a customer happy who has walked in already angry or upset."
good,Every day ranges from 8 hour shifts up to 13 shifts depending on your store.  Some days can be extra hectic with unforeseen problems arising and patients that are problematic.  However there are also good days interspersed when everything seems to go smoothly.  Working with my co-workers was great since I have worked in different stores that do not always have well trained or competent employees.
good,A typical day at Rite aid is taking care of the customer and making sure all their needs are met. I have learned that it is always important to keep the store productive and inviting for the public. I love working with co-workers. I am a people-person and I enjoy learning new things and training new personnel.
good,"Recently the company cut hours across the board and it has hindered productivity which has impacted sales and growth."
good,The task that some managers are assigned they turn around and assign it to the lower employees. Associates and managers work doesn't really differentiate.
good,Work place was very hectic. Staff was good but stressed. Management was poor at best. The hardest part of the day for me was the prolonged standing.
good,"Fun work place with a good management, Decent amount of red tape  and politics, but this is excepted. Not all about the number but how you personally grow and develop."
good,"Although I loved being a barista, the management was not the best. It was a family owned business so there was defiantly favorites. As well as the safety factor of working alone at night."
good,I loved my coworkers. They were fun and helpful. Corporate always tried to push us to make maximum goals with minimum staff. It was frustrating and always left me feeling defeated.
good,Rite Aid has a lot of open opportunity for individuals who are in pursuit of higher management positions. I wouldn't recommend the retail side of this company to individuals who value family and or are attending school. The amount of pay is not worth the stress of the position responsibilities. Yet the rewards of your hard work are greatly appreciated and recognized.
good,"It was nice working for the pharmacy, but unfortunately the managers frequently gave false promises of being inserted in to the Pharmacy Technician program."
good,"Help customer with there shopping needs. I would set store company stander, input invoice, do all banking, balance cash reg. Make schueal for all worker. Open close store."
good,Learned a lot here in time management multitasking and maintaining patience. Skills I believe I can take anywhere in life.
good,"Friendly and helpful employees, knowledge of merchandise, clean store. "
good,"Hard work life. No flexibility. No Job work/Life balance Good pay"
good,"I was a Sales Associate.  A typical day was assisting customers, answering questions, giving directions or leading them around the store to locate specific items.  I also worked a cash register.  I also processed freight when there was a truck delivery, usually once a week.  I had some problems with the management although there were two mangers that I felt were fair and appreciated my hard work and with whom I had a good rapport."
good,If you looking for a great place to work with levels of growing this is the place. The only downside is that the executive of the store can careless about your problems and everyday life.
good,"Worked overnights. Quiet in warehouse and supervisors are vigilant. More warnings are given employees if there is any error on part of employee. It is very hard to see the Human Resource personnel in center of warehouse. Depends greatly on his supervisors, zone leaders and managers."
good,Working mandatory overtime year round for no reason. Sometimes vto if lucky. Pay and benefits are good. Plenty of drama to go around for everyone due to  500 employees..
good,"Riteaid has its pros and cons. About the only pro is they offer very good benefits if you are full time. The workload can be very hetic and stressful. The hours are always getting cut so most of the time it is a shift manager and a cashier. Most of the days includes freshness, backroom pull and planograms. The only thing I enjoy within my job is setting up displays when needed. While I do like my co-works some of them are very lazy which leaves you doing most things by yourself."
good,"The job was okay, the people were great. I also enjoyed working under the manager at this particular Rite-Aid. "
good,"It's not a bad company to work for. There not a good company to work for either. There is no opportunity to advance past the Store Manager position.  They are always filling these roles from outside the company and those people seem to always come from Target.  You do have to expect them to treat you as a tool at there disposal.  They have no training program at any level and they are a cash poor company.  You will have no overlap on the schedule. The work load will be more than the hours available.  You will work with good people, but as a store manager you have more to do with that with your hiring practices."
good,I worked for them and it was all fine in the beginning and as these things tend to go a revolving door of people. Then you end up with a bunch of people who don' work well together.
good,"Rite Aid has come a long way in recent years but continues to miss the mark when it comes to valuing their employees. Often hiring from outside of the company, very few managers feel as if they have any room for growth with the company."
good,Worked as Manager/ Training Manager for company. Had very little home life.Went around to other Rite Aids doing resets and filling in for vacations. Left there for better paying job at PharMor
good,fun job typical day was productive and steady learned alot about customer service traveling was convenient. coworkers were nice
good,"Fast paced environment where multitasking is a must.  Schedule varies by store, and company is very program driven.  Direct management is easy to access for questions."
good,"Being a long standing pharmacy tech wal-mart was a bit different for me compared to other retail places. The nice part is a lunch break when the pharmacy closes the window. However, the back lash from this was not always worth it. I didn't deal much outside of the pharmacy world which was very nice."
good,"Benefits are great, co-workers are great. Over-all its okay place to work for"
good,"A typical day at work involves checking cameras, assessing questionable individuals as possible thieves, reviewing internal theft reports and integrating new anti-theft programs.  "
good,"I am currently a supervisor at Rite Aid, it took about a year and half to get promoted from cashier to supervisor. The required age is 21 I'm 22. I have work at Rite Aid for three years and it was my first job. I have been through ten managers in my time with working this company so I would say everybody is disposal. So the typical day at work is upon your arrival I would be bombarded with questions from customers and employees (we have a uniform so we are easily recognized). Next, when you have enough time or enough coverage I can count the safe and determine if its all good or not. Next I would have a list of duties from my manager of things to do, I was in charge of many things at the store like: supervise the employees, cashier, determine damages, go through recalls in the store, order makeup and female based items, reset of displays and aisles and help with new sales signs (AD) and occasionally help with freshness reports. As you can see very many things to be in charge in  a eight hours in a shift on top of that helping with customers, covering lunches, watching over employees and reconcile registers at the end of the night. Rite Aid is a very fast paced store and is very dependent on the much older customers with the customer service. I've learned so much from this store that I am confident that it will help me in the retail business, I am very grateful that I was one of the lucky ones to be looked at and for them to see that I was willing to learn and work hard for it. For the most part I did enjoy my time at Rite Aid and I did learn so much from working there. Not recommended"
good,"Opening store, getting drawers ready for day, stock shelves with items listed that sold prior day. Receiving new stock from pop, beer, wine or milk cooler stock, and putting on shelves, Giving breaks when needed, computer work and data entry daily. Keeping store clean and organized throughout the day. Night shift had cleaning and chores to be done, walking store, making everything looked clean and tidy. "
good,You needed to be 2.5 ppl for the workload.  I learned different applications.  The management is not worth talking about. My co-workders were great.  Hardest part of my job was the workload and the most enjoyable part of my job was the ppl I worked with
good,"Typical day can consist of taking the register or being on the floor assisting customers "
good,"not a lot of customer flow, very little co-workers, You do a lot of self work"
good,I enjoyed working there.  It is a good company to work for.  Benefits are not very good.
good,I work with a pharmacist. I deal with doctor and nurses on daily basis and including customers that come into pharmacy
good,"very politically correct company.  tells you what you want to hear, true or not."
good,"Rite Aid prefers to hire outside of the company rather then promote from within. It tends to be a some what stressful work day, depending on the customers that come in that day. Middle management is good, upper management is very distant. The best thing about this work place is the customers who are so grateful when you go out of your way to make sure they get everything that they wanted."
good,"overeall good company to work with, less support from management in emergency case."
good,I had a lot of fun working here and met some highly educated people. It was very challenging at times and I overall had a very enriching experience.
good,I have worked at store level as well as the regional level and throughly enjoyed both.
good,"As an LPA a schedule was submitted in advance to the Loss Prevention Manager and Store Manager. You were required to work hours that matched the store needs with a minimum of two closing shifts a week (staying until the store close / employees left for the night). If you have a 24 hours store, you were required to work some overnight shifts. You were required to work hours on holidays as theft tended to be an issue on those days. You work on your feet all day on a hard floor so it causes pain in your feet, knees, and back. Some days you were required to install /repair CCTV equipment which could mean carrying heavy ladders or being up high on a ladder. Sometimes you had to install cameras covertly without the store knowledge while the store was closed. You work very independently and must blend with customers. You will be ordered into court to testify or must go to the Prosecutor's Office to sign charges against shoplifters as necessary (area dependent). Wages are low but raises are given during review time. There is no room for promotion in Loss Prevention outside of become a Loss Prevention Manager which would first require you to become a Store Manager and obtain certifications (on your time and own dime). LPM jobs do not open frequently and require long hours and frequent travel."
good,"Although Rite Aid offers a great computer based training for their employees, actual on the job training varies with location and personnel.  The store structure and policies, corporate wide are consistent for the consumer."
good,"For being a shift supervisor your task can range from planograms, recalls, tearing signs down or placing them back up. You also have to stay aware and be constantly helping associates and customers as well. You are also required to take care of finances and since I work the night shift I am constantly taking care of closing deposits, garbages and straightening the store for the next business day. While this is all fine and dandy and part of my job, the pay doesn't necessarily fit fairly with the job that you do and what you have to go through every single night/day! While everyone else sits back I feel as if the ones who actually work hard do not get recognized and having a union who does nothing for you is even worse! I love where I work but for the pay it's definitely not worth staying. It's actually quite insulting."
good,"I learned that even a fake smile makes the day seem better. Project a positive attitude and you will likely get positive energy back. "
good,"In a give day I typically did everything from sweeping the parking lot, cleaning bathrooms, stocking shelves, scheduling, entering invoices and customer service. Worked mostly with one other employee. Being a manger for almost 15 years has helped me breeze thru most of the business classes at college.  At the time all managers were salary, so I missed a lot of important dates, funerals, weddings, and birthdays."
good,Average to good co-workers - good managers - To much time for the PIC having to due paperwork and inventories and no help.
good,I've learned how to cope with unsatisfied customers as well as co-workers. The hardest part about the job is nothing. The best part of the job is seeing the smile on customers faces.
good,walking around looking for theft around the store and protect the store.i learned that even when you doin your jobs it can still go wrong.management was rough and distance.co workers was helpful and kind the hardest part was confronting kids protect everybody
good,they could have lot more better for associate and customers
good,They have cut so bad that when it came to unloading the truck after hours I had to do it alone due to lack of payroll.  A lot of times I had to be cashier due to payroll situation
good,"I applied to rite aid for a assistant manager position but I didn't get the position, but before I said ok thank you the store manager said that she will recommend me to the pharmacy manager. I got my interview from the pharmacy manager and started days later. Working in a pharmacy is a first time for me so I was a little nervous but the staff there was awesome. They helped me with understand the pharmacy terms and helped me study for my certifications. After two years the manager that interviewed me has ended her contract with rite aid and for four months the pharmacy didn't have a manager. I started to help out and started to work 9 to 10 or more hours six to seven days a week. By the end of October we got a new manager who just graduated and barely got the pharmacy license things was still shaky. As a single mom with no family to help me it started to get really hard to work and take care of my kids. I asked the new manager to help me out and see if they can get others to work as hard to cover shifts. But no luck they couldn't find help and certain co workers only wanted to work in the mornings and certain hours. I waited for three weeks and still the routine was the same and so I put in my two weeks notice. When I put in my notice things got bad to worse, the store manager and the district manager was upset with me for wanting to leave so in return they put non rehire able on my file. I loved working with my coworkers at the pharmacy and the store part at rite aid with the laughter and joking. The hardest part of the job is working with other coworkers who only thinks bout"
good,"Learned a lot about customer service, basic selling strategies and a bit about how management works.  Id have to say the hardest part of the job would have been getting up early for deliveries, but its a necessary evil and not that bad when your co-workers are there with you.  My most enjoyable part of this job would have had to be working the cash register and having small chats with employees.  It was a small store so we got to know them decently well.  A typical day at work would include, stocking shelves, doing price changes and working the cash register while working on other projects."
good,"I love my team mates including my Supervisors. It's a good job, although; very high stress. I've noticed that upper management is always wanting more but never giving credit to my Pharmacists and staff for a job well done. The upper management seems uncaring and it puts my Pharmacists under a lot of unnecessary stress."
good,management was terrible but the job was easy and If lucky you can get pharmacy training
good,moved boxs to one place to other on forklift how to drive a forklift management was some what good but not all co workers i miss working with them
good,"I worked for this company in two states and ran several different stores in each state.  Each manager should have an assistant and up to 5 ""keys"", employees who can open/close the store and have some management responsibilities.  In my last location I didn't have an assistant and only 1 key.  Driving an hour each way and working basically open to close 6 days a week was not something I was willing to do.  When I approached my supervisor about getting help he said the district couldn't afford it."
good,"The day would normally start out with me counting out 2 drawers for registers to make sure they were even at $100. Then I would go check the messages that were left on the phone from previous evening by customers and address those customers issues promptly.  After that was taken care of then pharmacist and I would start working on what was on the computer screen as far as work and taking care of the walk up customers as well. All the while answering phones, taking messages, new prescriptions, etc. Tat was the basic duties for 10 hour shifts increments."
good,"Rite-Aid Pharmacy provided me with a foundation to adhere to and to practice sharp and courteous customer service during the work shifts.  During my tenure at Rite-Aid, I was mostly responsible for tallying customers' purchases, for assisting them in locating and finding essential products and services, and for general store-display and clean-up functions.  Managers and co-workers were respectful and obliging for the most part.  The most challenging part of being a cashier is dealing with dissatisfied and/or irate customers while simultaneously attempting to understand, to sympathize with, and to fulfill their particular needs; conversely, the most enjoyable parts of the job are being able to address and to solve their issues, getting to know them, and having them patronize the store via return visits."
good,"In the Facilities Maintenance Department, we deal with all maintenance requests for the Rite Aid stores.  This pertains to the smallest request for a new cabinet handle to a major emergency such as a sewer back-up.  Every day is different and we always need to be ready for the next call.  I personally handle maintenance for vacant and tenanted surplus properties, as well as maintenance issues that are Landlord responsibility per the lease agreement.  I spend a lot of time reviewing leases for repair and insurance responsibilities and must interact with many departments within Rite Aid, such as Legal, Real Estate and Construction.  The most rewarding part of my job is helping store managers so they can concentrate on doing their own job.  Most are very grateful when they know someone from the Corporate Office cares about them."
good,"The days were busy and went by fast. I was there for a little more then 13 years and I learned a great deal... palletizing, pick to light, etc... The most meaning thing I learned is that I did find some dear, dear friends. The management is typical workplace management. The most difficult part of the job was the hurrying through lunch time to return to work on time, (the building is huge and a distance from the lunch room to the work site is far so it takes away from the 30 minute lunch time). The most enjoyable part of the job was taking breaks and lunching with co-worker.  Most co-workers seemed like family to me."
good,I enjoyed working the graveyard shift there while they had it. I got to learn new things often because they were always adding something new to the product line. I also learned how to relay an entire store to make room for that new product.
good,"Helping patients/customers  with drug information, interactions with other medications gave me great satisfaction on a daily basis.  Immunizing and providing preventative  medicine advice to my customers for healthier outcomes is also as important. When you show  a customer/patient that you care about them more than just filling a prescription, you will have a customer for life, they really feel wanted, and also will show you a high degree of respect. My co-workers were important to me.  Teamwork made the day go smoother.  Balancing staffing and customer service is important to reaching goals and meeting company expectations."
good,"A typical day at work was scheduling staff to complete daily projects,"
good,It was ok here sometimes I would work 2 weeks straight with no days off. I would travel to another store to help out on go to the bank for change. 
good,"A typical day at work includes processing prescriptions and dealing with insurance companies if a problem arises.  As a technician this is a very fast pace environment and you have to know your information when relaying it to customers.  The management is okay, but could be better.  I feel that there is little guidance when it comes to the pharmacist.  I work side by side one other technician who I get along well with but feel that he could step up a bit more.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with n upset customer, and feeling that you cannot fix the situation, because I like pleasing all of our customers.  And the most enjoyable part of this job are the happy customers we serve on a daily basis, and the compliments and ratings I receive on doing a job well done.  "
good,"Like any big box pharmacy, it's not run very well at the overall level. Our store was managed fairly well at the store level, however, and I had the pleasure of working with many really competent and nice people both in the pharmacy and front store."
good,"As a member of management you do it all.  I perform multiple tasks daily from opening and closing the store to janatorial duties.  Some duties I perform are cash handling and operating the register, unloading truck and stocking, counts on merchandise to ensure PI accuracy, shelf re-sets and planograms and loss prevention as well as managing the One Hour Photo Lab along side normal store management duties.  I am responsible for development and printing of all 35mm film and digital orders.  I also mix the chemicals needed for processing and perform repairs when needed. I also work an additional 10-25 hours a week covering missing manager shifts at other location throughout the district. "
good,"I worked at three different locations, they were all different. the first was the best experience! co-workers were agreeable, store was very clean and daily operations were smooth."
good,Can be slow and fast paced at times.  Learned to be independent and great customer service.  Management is okay some more than others.  Some co workers are quiet and not friendly.  There is nothing hard about the job.  Most enjoyable part of the job is being independent.
good,This job was a good first job because my manager worked with my school schedule well and the culture in the store was great.  The people I worked with were excellent to me.  There were no raises offered to me however in my two years there and no advancement opportunities.  This job was good for a first job but when it came to make more money and advance through the company there weren't many opportunities
good,Summers are crazy with all the tourists. We are a big family at the store I work at and are a friendly bunch. We truly want to help our customers/clients find what they are looking for and serve them in a friendly and efficient manner. Our store has a lot of local repeat business that helps us over the 'slow' time of winter.
good,"-A typical day at work consists of going into the cooler for an hour, serving ice cream, sweeping and mopping,work on load, working the cash register, cleaning the bathrooms, customer service, carry-outs, filling the cooler and 3 gallon ice creams, straightening the store, and taking out trashes."
good,"A great part-time experience in order to gain real world, face-to-face, client relations experience."
good,"i was hired as a store manager given very little training in the system in place. there was a lack of communication between the dm and store management. and the wasn't many resources for management to rely on. hours where cut badly leaving managers to put in more than their fair share of of with no compensation. but they wanted customer svc to be top notch with a lack of employees to do such. on the plus the store associates where hard working and very attentive to not only customer relations but also more than flexible with their schedules to try to promote the business, at least m team was.There wasn't a person in the neighborhood who wasn't recognized by any of the store associates. their needs met to the best of our abilities given the working conditions that upper management gave us. i myself have had great reviews from the majority of our clientele and remain in contact with my client base. they are more than willing to write letters of recognition for both myself and the staff on board."
good,through my experience working there I sometimes find it hard to accomplish goals because of lack of support through management
good,"I was at the cashier, somedays I had to open the store. Somedays I had to close the store. I learned to use the register and store items away. I really wasnt so hype about my coworkers. They didnt stay to long. Hardest part of my job was being hired as a Cashier but was taken advantage of. I had to open the store and be the only one at the register for almost 1.5 hours. . and when I close the store I (again) had to be the only only at the register at 1.5 hours. . then they wanted ME to put ALL items away that is returned. Not only mine. But the other cashiers that had left early.. It started to be a habit for them till the point where they wanted me to stay, at the job, putting returns away, with NO overtime. Sorry I was not staying. The only good part of the job was maybe I didnt really have to go to the corner store for anything and I had discount."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working with the pharmacist and other pharmacy technicians in filling prescriptions in a timely manner for customers. Besides dealing with customers directly, I would also frequently contact insurance companies and doctors offices to either settle a dispute for a customer or request more refills from the doctor. I have learned to work with others in a teamwork-like fashion in filling prescriptions for patients. I have also learned a great deal about different medications, how to fill for them, coding in patients' insurance, and which medication is generally prescribed for which medical condition. Management always stressed working at a concise speed to fill the maximam amount of prescriptions each day with minimal room for errors. Co-workers were always excellent as everyone worked together, helping each other when needed to achieve maximum production each day. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers when they could not get obtain the drug requested either from medical restrictions or insurance issues (medication refill too soon being the most common). The most enjoyable part of the job was working with co-workers to fill prescriptions each day and interacting with happy customers face to face."
good,Do the store banking. Open & close store. get the store ready for the day. Or if closing do the closing chores. Get along good with customers & coworkers.I learned the job from cashier to Shift Supervisor. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning new things & meeting new people.
good,"Very busy atmosphere, challanging at times, customers were awesome, my bosses were the best, co-workers were team players,"
good,"Working here was great until upper management changed. Too much micro managing. Also, management is always in peril of losing their jobs."
good,"I learned how to effectively complete monetary transactions, returns, and exchanges. My co-workers were friendly and very helpful."
good,Morning duties must be done every morning.
good,"Lots of work of work,expect to do just about everything from mopping to management. Can be very rewarding in the right environment with the right District & Store Manager"
good,"My typical day of work consist of helping customers on their medication and making sure insurances are billed correctly. I help assist the pharmacist on imputing and outputting prescription on the a daily bases. Picking up calls, helping patients out on the store floor. Making sure the patients gets their correct medication and giving them the best customer care. The hardest part of this job is that most of the time you are working alone with the pharmacist and it becomes overwhelming when you are typing and ringing up customers and answering the phone all at one time. Multi-tasking would be my strongest feature. I love my co workers because they are easy to get along with and they help me get through my day. The most enjoyable part of this job is to see customer appreciate your work and help to get them their medication and actually showing the customers that we do care."
good,"Its a fine company. Ive. enjoyed my time there. Rite Aid has good products,"
good,Experienced variable challenges typically everyday.
good,"my job consisted of stocking product into slots for distribution to customers, i learned how to use a hand held computer system of locating products throughout the warehouse, management and co-workers were very helpful in training, there were times when the workload was overwhelming but i stayed strong through the numerous days of working in such high heat and dust, the hard work was something i enjoy doing and wish to continue working in an environment where physical activity is recommended"
good,"I was promoted at Rite Aid, but the pay was still very low. I left as soon as possible."
good,A typical day at work was stocking and making bank deposits. I also trainied new employees. Another part of my day was checking vendors in and out. I releived the sales associates for breaks and lunches. Greeted Customers and handled complaints.
good,Management was rude and unprofessional. They did not make working there something to look forward to.
good,"Rite is a company still needs growing in all areas although they do learn from there mistakes they still have yet to let go of old values that don't hold true to what this growing country has become. If you plan to work for them expect to work very hard for very little and not have the support to finish the task. Big down fall to rite-aid spending all funds for promotions and theories that simply do not give back but take. employees need to be giving proper raises and wage to do the task, and neglecting these areas will cause a business to fall and struggle continually."
good,"Rite Aid is a high-pace environment, where you need to provide excellent customer service skills and manage your time well. It is a good work environment as I get to help customers daily."
good,I loved working with the company unfortunately it was a misunderstanding and I was terminated but they definitely kept there word to me about giving me good reviews when I put them as a reference
good,They job was really isolated. I didn’t too much enjoy working there. I had a nice lunch break but no one was really upfront with me and didn’t really make too much of a concern for the front
good,It was a nice place to start off my career as A pharmacy technician. The people and the pharmacists are very nice. I will miss them all very much. It was a nice place to work
good,Started as a cashier and then trained as a pharmacy technician.  Work as a tech was rewarding and I enjoyed helping people. The pay was terrible but the benefits were good.
good,Ten years with this company and this year was the worst raise I've ever seen. They're continually asking for increasing excellence and they only deigned to give half a percent to the pharmacists who are executing the plan to pad their bottom line.
good,The company doesnt seem to be growing. Bot sure what the future holds for the company. Years ago there was growth but not sure now. Loved my coworkers and my customer base but the lack of management growth and promotion was slim
good,"Great job for new workers. Skills learned are time management  and customer services. Stocking,  money management and time delegation as well. Overall great beginner job"
good,"Good job, spent many years there, would recommend for starter up job to get wharehouse experience.  Friendly co workers. Respectable pay and benefits."
good,I worked any shifts and came in any time I was called in.  I had the most  experience and was past over when an assistant manager position came open. I had been promised the position when I transferred to Nashville.
good,This job was very hands on and fast paced but management chose favorites. But are willing to work with your hours if you have another job. Employees are like family
good,"Data entry of new rx's"
good,Alot of opportunities to interact with and make positive impact on patients well being.  Some days can get overwhelming with workload but is usually manageable.  Staff are nice and easy to work with
good,It is  very short period of time. The manager was very supportive. I learned go use different scanner and gadget for inventory purposes. Learned how to deal with customer on a daily basis.
good,"I chose to become a Pharmacy Technician to stay near the pharmaceutical field and healthcare as I took a hiatus from Nursing and continued my education. At this job my experience increased concerning medications and their uses and side effects. Plus also learning how to process scripts and submit through insurance companies. Reconstitute medications and utilize great customer relations. I enjoyed working with this staff. We worked well together in an efficient productive manner."
good,"Information given regarding my interview was with Eckerd Drugs (which is now Rite Aid)."
good,"""Rite Aid operates on big company policies"""
good,"Balanced work environment with a flexible schedule, great staff and management crew and well maintained clean store environment. Great opportunities to move up in ranks within the company."
good,"It was overall a great place to work but the pay was a real problem honestly cause, but the training was exceptional it did teach me a lot about being a pharmacy tech"
good,"the most enjoyable part of my job was helping to put stock on the shelves and customer interaction. I would come in sweep all the front end , Stock the shopping bags put the carts back."
good,"Not much to tell. Very slow paced, stocking shelves, viewing new items and chatting with customers was about the extent of the entire job.  I left because the employees carried a little too much drama."
good,I worked my way from hourly to management.  I was involved in 4 merger/acquisitions as hourly and salaried associate. Created a positive work environment where associates thrived.  Collaborated with other managers to develop short and long term goals. Partnered with HR to resolve associate issues and used an associate recognition program to recognize a job well done.
good,"The Corporation had deep financial issues at the time, and It had a negative on the overall on the business operation. I was recruited by Bed Bath and Beyond to work for them. It was a better situation and higher salary. It provided me more time to spend with my family."
good,"A typical day involved preparing and counting medication, stocking medication, cashiering, cleaning, and customer service. A drawback is long hours and standing."
good,Pretty much like any other pharmacy. It depends on who you work with rather than the actual job. If you have good cooperative and helpful coworkers everything else is manageable.
good,Rite aid could be a good company to work for if it wasn't for the poor management. A team mentality is not a priority. Pay scale is decent. Hours are flexible
good,it was an ok job co workers where cool .learned a little could have learned more .i enjoyed the experience wish i could do things alot diffrent now that i have more experience
good,"When I worked at Rite Aid, I did enjoy it. I only worked on the weekends from 8:30-4 or 4:30 PM and I was in highschool 5 days a week so it basically felt like there was no flexibility. I wasnt put on schedule to work during the week because at the time i could only do 4 hour shifts or 8 on the weekends so I was put on the weekend. The management wasnt awful but it didnt seem like they were understanding or encouraging. It always seemed like no one actually enjoyed the job and they were just doing it for the money, which is why I quit because I wanted to work in a productive work environment who saw potential in my work ethic."
good,"The main thing I enjoyed about my work experience there was my coworkers. My manager was a very nice, hard working lady. However, there is no pay raise for long time workers. Even management positions don't get raises. To be fair though, some managers have good benefits, like paid vacations. If you enjoy working in retail, then it may be the place for you. But if you aren't a huge fan of it, then I wouldn't recommend it."
good,Hit a level with income and I can’t live that way ... also reached my plateau for advancement. I have worked in customer service since the age of 16 and that is definitely the positive in my job. I grow as a person interacting with people and I learn new things everyday.
good,Company was okay to work for; though it did not have any compelling incentives for doing so. It is closed now and the corporation is converted to Walgreens.
good,"Productive and effiecient workplace with opportunities for growth within. Compensation was considerably lower than other companies, but internal management was supportive and positive."
good,"Typical day at work."
good,"Rite aid was my first job. I enjoyed working there, decided to move on to find a career that was better suited for my personal goals. I loved my customers. Management was okay. I could go to them if I had any questions."
good,Rite Aid has many good employees who work hard and it is a team oriented place.  The upper management (executive levels) are out of touch with people and do not care about their employees.
good,If I can work at walmart for 11 I should get similar money doing this. Just not happy getting paid 8 dollars. Some get paid even 725. Ridiculous. Everything is good except for the pay.
good,Work included a typical 8 hour day. I cleaned shelves and greeted customers. I sometimes traveled to other rite aids in the surrounding area and always felt very appreciated when I did help out.
good,Has its good n bad things. Mgrs stresed cause of the demand on them. Hours cut and have to get same quality of work done.i loved my job and working with customers ...not enough help sometimes..you can get promoted ..its a union job ..
good,Fast paced. Good management. Great communication between management & workers. Flexible hours. Willing to teach & move up in company. Team work. Nice environment
good,"Worked with a great team. Fair policies. Typical workday consists of customer service, restocking, receiving vendor orders, entering invoices, maintaining cleanliness and safety, loss prevention, etc."
good,Rite Aid was an ok job. It was my first warehouse job and it was a good experience for me. Pay is terrible but the job is easy. People come and go quick.
good,I think the health benefits are great. as far as how they value their employees I'd give them a negative. Every time it comes around to negotiations between our Union & Rite Aid they both seem to be in cahoots with each other when Union is supposed to protect the employees not kiss the Employers butt.
good,Working at Rite Aid as a pharmacy technician is great for college students looking for a part time job as it allows you to pursue you degree while working around your class schedule.
good,"Working for Rite Aid was a great experience. I learned a lot and developed well in stressful situations. Only thing that was tough was that my particular store in Alta Dena CA, was a very high volume store and we were provided the same amount of hours as the low volume stores."
good,"Honestly, the company is a joke, as is the case with most places I've worked thus far in my life. Also, I have severe anxiety, and I only took the job so that I could have some money because I had been previously living in a tent in the woods. This is a time-consuming waste, this mandatory review-writing, for the record."
good,"It's a cashier job, anyone can do it. It is not anything special. You work there to have a job or for the people, nothing more nothing less. That is all."
good,Out of Business.  Rite Aid eas a good place to work. The management was very nice and understanding. I enjoyed working and learned about nthe drug business
good,Very understaffed. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I am able to interact with every day. I enjoy the new innovations and advancements the pharmaceutical world is evolving to suit the changing world and problems we now face. The retail stores are cutting hours and sacrificing customer service.
good,Pretty chill u move around a lot from store to store. So ur dealing with different managers for every store. Long as u do ur job and prove u can make a lot of stops they'll get ur RESPECT. It can be fun if u make the best of it.
good,Managers work with the employees. They have a big lunch room on site.  Most of the employees are very nice and kind. Human resources employees are very kind and understanding.
good,Just constant moving environment dealing with different customers whether good or bad. Potential shoplifters but besides that just a regular day dealing with customers who are usually in a perky and loving mood.
good,"It really depends on the area you work within. Some locations are better than others. They all have a common theme however, the customers are more on the non desirable side. The security is below standard and the shoplifting is rampant. This goes for all the Pharmacy drugstores in the area. It's just a dirty business"
good,difficult to move up in the ranks. friendly staff however they are union which could sometimes be difficult for poor performers. constant workflow with little downtime
good,Rite aid was not a very good place to work. The supervisors and managers played favorites and were very gossipy. Would show up to work and be told I wasnt needed that day without them even calling me which I feel is very unprofessional.
good,"In summer its really hot and in winter its really cold. You have to be able to handle these conditions. "
good,"Data entered prescriptions, inventory, customer services. Always busy but productive. Most difficult is that there was no team work at all. And management does not pay attention to staff's positive ideas."
good,"My favorite thing about working at Rite aid was how flexible they were with my hours while I worked there, but management was not the best and they rarely promoted people for good standing."
good,Some of the people were very helpful and understanding. But there were times when information wasnt given freely to help you with day to day functions
good,"It's been a few years since I worked here. The Asset Protection department was OK, but I didn't work long enough to see how good or bad it really is. The company was bought by Walgreens after I left."
good,"My boss & coworkers were great to work with except for 1 employee who made it known she did not care for me and I knew it. I tried to win her over for 8 mos. to no avail but that's ok, I tried."
good,I worked at Rite Aid over 10+ years ago. It was a decent place to work with opportunities to advance. It was stressful but was a good work environment most of the time
good,"As much as i enjoyed my job, most days were the same, making calls day in and day out,  My  work environment was quiet as i did work out of my home.  Rite Aid/ Health Dialog is a great company to work for, with excellent management skills and a friendly work place"
good,"it was fine at first, but then i started to question about my benefits because i thought i was full time and turns out I wasn't. I fought the union rep for years and he still couldn't get me full time. The pharmacy team is great but dealing with upper management was painful"
good,"Must have cutomer services skills, along with great communication skills. Always treat customer very well. Never say the customer ia wrong, let them prove their poin."
good,"This job was an eye opener into the casual workplace. Rite aid has the best in deals around the area, but what it lacks is appreciation for customers and the simple things."
good,"I like my job at Rite Aid but when I was promoted to Assistant Manager I was transferred to the Newtown Square,PA Rite Aid. The manager there is very unappreciative of all employees.  All he is concerned about is business and making money."
good,"This job is challenging! The pharmacy is a hectic environment. Fast-paced and customer service-based, this job requires the ability to work efficiently and quickly. The hardest part of the job was not having enough employees to fully ensure customer satisfaction. But the patients are loyal and if you win them over the job gets much easier. When the patients know that you try your hardest to advocate for their wellbeing, you spend much less time explaining all of the nuances of the job and can get right to work on fixing their problem."
good,"Started there as my first job and worked there for 10 years.  It is what gave me my base and drive in my working career.  Also, gave me the skills to move on to other opportunities."
good,"I can't remember much about my last job. It was 9 years ago. Some days were slow, some were busy. I think the toughest part was keeping up with things sometimes."
good,"Every day was a relaxed day. It picked up during rush hour. It only got difficult if it was ""truck day"", a shipment of products, or during Saturday night and Sunday was when we had to put new sale signs under products. The cashier had to handle floor and cash register during those days."
good,Rite Aid has fallen behind on being competitive to their field. The pay isn’t competitive compared to Walgreens or cvs. The technology they use is outdated and they are severely understaffed due to these reasons. They need to make some serious changes if they want to remain competitive against Walgreens and cvs.
good,Rite was a pretty good place to work.My only complaint was I in need of full time employment which they were unable to offer me due to them employing several college students.
good,"Responsibilities are not great, just standing on your feet all day. as a cashier you are responsible for resupplying candy and other stock items. busy work."
good,Is not the worst company that i have worked for and is willing to promote if you are good with retail u will shine there can have a lot of oversight that is sometimes not needed but overall would recommend working there for experience
good,"I started off at the bottom and worked my way up. the company went from very family based, fun environment, and positive energy to very micro managed. once i changed positions from management to a admin it has been better once again."
good,Worked at a small store with less than 10 workers. Too much work for just a couple of people. Corporate expects too much of workers. Corporate always has something to say about our work.
good,Stay focus and always be alert don’t be scared to ask for help rite aid is a family Organization so they try to treat as such and make sure you be on time
good,usually stayed on a routine  if you work nights you're cleaning the store. some days you stock shelves and ring the register. People you work with are cool and the management is pretty good.
good,"The retail area of the store is fast paced to complete planograms, maintain inventory, store cleanliness, assist the pharmacy when called upon and provide excellent customer service."
good,"Here, you are given the proper training to be a cashier at Rite Aid.  Although the shifts they want from you are long, management is very helpful if you are in need of assistance."
good,flexible hours but poor pay for a lot of responsibility.  People there are great to work with but poor district management.  Basically overworked and underpaid
good,"But other than that, I loved working here. Their hours, pay, and benefits were great. "
good,Good place to start out and get retail experience with room to advance. Retail comes with hours that aren't so great and compensation that is lacking but I did like working there.
good,"Working in Rite Aid was a challenge since you wear a lot of hats. You will be a cashier, put up stock, and an ice cream scooper. Along with the fact that people were shoplifting a lot it can get a bit stressful."
good,"Good customer serivce"
good,Started there seven years ago but looking g to move on to a position with more job advancement  opportunities and better salary. Nice management  but very stressful and no place e to advance to.
good,I did not like working for rite aid because i when to school during the day and worked at night. I worked 5 days a week and i learned how to balance the finical books as a nightly duty.
good,This company is workforce could improve overall. A typical day here was satisfying as long as the customers are satisfied. They offered flexible hours to fit anyone's schedule.
good,"Working at Rite Aid as a cashier was simple, but manager was very rude and closed-minded. Human Resources never solved my problems whenever I complained. Without these issues, being a cashier at Rite Aid was an easy way to make money quick."
good,"When I first started Rite Aid they were a good company to work for, over the years I see many changes in the company and not for the good, especially in the corporate offices it just seems like they just stopped caring for their employees"
good,"I do not agree with the pay scale... an employee who has only been here for 4 years makes the same pay as someone like myself who was here for almost 15 years. The amount of work they expected us associates to pull off some days was a bit unrealistic. They would force us early some days, and therefore on occasions our checks could be shorted up to 8 hours. That is the main reason why I finally chose to leave the company. I couldn't meet my responsibilities financially."
good,"Fun and productive environment, fast paced environment. New challenges , great teams and leaders, great benefits with good pay. And extra hours on holidays"
good,"Rite Aid provides good benefit for the employees. Because the employees are unionized, the management is checked and balanced by the union. The company provides safe working environment."
good,"Management is not that good because they promise something and never fulfill it"
good,"It was a smaller store, slow for the most part, could get super busy. I enjoyed working there. They promoted people to key managers fast.Good management team"
good,A lot of responsibilities for the staff as well as the management for low pay. However I enjoyed working with the people and assisting in anyway I could
good,"I worked for rite aid for a couple years, I was the lead tech and never had any issues.  customers were great and pharmacists were very knowledgeable and taught me a lot."
good,"There's much to be said when dealing with your staff and managing different personalities. When it comes to the relationships at my store or the lack there of because it seemed to be nonexistent. There needs to be more attention given in the areas of serving the people who's jobs are meant to serve others. Whether it be with some small tokens of appreciation like coffee for the team, a thank you for staying late or cover a shift can certainly go a long way."
good,Rules are to be followed and if you could face termination.. need to be able to be accurate in counting money tendered of money given back.. need to be engaging with customers
good,"It's all about being productive.. and staying busy.. whether you have work to do in your section or dept. or cleaning your working area/space.. depending on where you have to work at and where you take your break depends on how much time of your break you actually get to spend eating,lol"
good,"hard work,work alone,think on the fly. Check work orders for the day. plan in other to finish the job. Get feed back from management team.Check the team for the day to help others with work."
good,Being that it's retail it's best to use this job as a starting job to introduce you to retail and customer service. It's an okay job if you're willing to reach for a management position. You'd just have to show the resolve and dedication.
good,"Nothing unique. Similar to other chain retail pharmacies - script count, vaccinations, third party reimbursements, long hours, patient counseling, be a cashier"
good,"great coworkers "
good,"I had a really bad experience, I think treat was unfair, a lot of favoritism and poor management. New employees have no support and no opportunities to grow in these company."
good,"How to take care of customers and as a supervisor,make sure all team are happy and do hard work and make sure they know how to t=do their best for company"
good,"Waited on pharmacy customers and filled prescriptions. Made phone calls to and took calls from physicians offices. Made pharmacy orders, took inventory and assisted on the retail floor when needed."
good,"As a pharmacy technician at Rite Aid I typed prescriptions into our rx system, filled prescriptions, and rang up customers at the cash register. Some of my duties included cleaning, using the cash register, ordering stock, counting stock, helping customers find items in the store, and provided excellent customer service."
good,"Allows me a super flexible schedule to what I can work on a daily basis, some days I can work 9 to9   mostly 9 to 4  3 to 4 days a week  they are very easy to schedule.`"
good,Job was very slow paced co-workers a very miserable the managers aren’t really the best group of people either they don’t really train you as well as they should have
good,riteaide is a pretty good place to work if thats the work youi lovr to do . fast paced some stores are in bad areas and makes work stressful dealing with customers .
good,goal oriented environment with multiple pick mods with multiple levels. Labor sharing across departments and servicing of 100 plus stores a day. hours range from 8 to 10 hours a day.
good,"Fast pace environment with goal oriented objectives"
good,"I was a low level pharmacy tech."
good,"I open store or I close I over see employees work gets down in a timely manner. Do bank deposits, nightly reports, merchandise and help customers find what they are looking for. Do Damages and outdates and process them for going back to the warehouse."
good,They could improve their training programs.  I found it very lacking and saw managers fail because of this.  I also struggled but was successful at figuring things out.
good,"I learn how to improve myself in the company and move forward, I learn how to be a better manager and how to corporate and listen to ideas from my co-workers and employees. This company is very diverse and accept a lot of people from different places and cultures and they are very open. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers, making sure their needs were met and satisfied and making them feel welcome and safe in their shopping environment."
good,This job was fine for a college student to get a little money. Can't comment or benefits as I didn't have any and wasn't thinking about benefits back then.
good,"it is very hard to climb the corporate ladder. pharmacy and retail management need better communication and should be treated the same, salary and schedule for example"
good,"Mangers vary from the understanding to the we're short staffed, so I'll schedule you anyway even if your unavailable. The hours were ok, but the pay kept everyone looking for another side hustle."
good,Rite aid was a good place to work for a first job. To me this was not a place to stay for a career. The job duties can be all over the place but you will learn al lot on the job.
good,friendly workers and all items are easily found great discounts for seniors. hardest  part of the job was not having medication available are ready for pick up when the customer arrived.
good,I learned a lot while working for Rite Aid. I was given the opportunity to fine tune my customer service skills. Rite Aid encouraged their employees to succeed and grow.
good,"A typical day at work for me is to get on my designated area do my job,keep everything clean and organizer as much is possible, mind my own business , Stay out of trouble follow the company rules and regulations, finish whatever task I have and at the end of the day clean my work area and go home."
good,Good for a first job or someone looking for a part time job in college. Days are pretty slow; lots of restocking and cleaning takes place during the day.
good,I was a manager for Rite Aid they basically threw me into the position with little or no training I taught myself by the help of other managers but it taught me that I was stronger and it was a challenge but I did it I enjoyed the customers and the other employees it was a great atmosphere to be around but you have to make it that way yourself the company didn’t help I am proud of my performance as a manager others that I trained became managers I was very proud of them we were a tight nit bunch with care and compassion for our customers and each other.
good,definitely a better work atmosphere and if they had better management team they could excel and the rating would speak for themselves a decent work place
good,"Working at this establishment, I was able to meet many different people. I was able to get my foot in the door to see what’s it’s like to be in the real world, even though I was young when I started working here."
good,"The environment would be an even better place if the people there would have one mind set is to make money and go home to their family. "
good,I worked in the pharmacy department and worked side by side with the pharmacist. I learned a lot about different types of medication and had the opportunity to work with the customers
good,It was a job and it got me paid. it has its days that can be stressful but that's with any job. I made friends there and met cool people as far as customers.
good,Working at rite-aid was great for me. I was in high school and they worked around that so I would still have good hours. It was typically slow paced and the management was superb.
good,"The Company is going through changes, and is very unsettled. "
good,"I worked periodically as an Intern many years ago.  I have no opinion of the company, as my employment was temporary and long ago.  I enjoyed the people I worked with at the time, and some of them are at the same store now."
good,Very underpaid and understaffed company. Not enough employees to get the job done efficiently. They do have flexible hours and good decent management.
good,"is a place to work and make ends meet You dont have a life of your own. We work long hrs due to short of employees. "
good,I how to make sure that the customers come first I also learn how to do the prescriptions work the cashier also working the drive-thru i also learn how to take orders for prescription refill filling prescription/ counting meds acting as a cashier and accepting payments for prescriptions
good,"While the life expectancy of Rite Aid is uncertain these days, they have always take efforts in recognizing and celebrating their employees.  This helps with establishing co-worker relationships."
good,"You had to endure a lot of error and fault within the workplace, I particularly loved helping the other managers but often times we were carrying all the weight of the stores success with little aid from the district. I was often told ""that's just how business is""  but that was discouraging when having to bend my own needs in a snowstorm to ensure the store operated via generator."
good,"My role in rite aid was with cashier, western union transaction, inventory loading, shelfing. I also used to work in overnights too and the payment for that was $11 per hour which was a bit better then my daytime schedules."
good,"I was with Rite Aid for 12 years overseeing the liability exposures of the corporation.  Rite Aid did business in 31 states at the time.  These claims included general liability, commercial auto, and pharmacy malpractice exposures.  Rite Aid was self insured with a very high retention level.  I truly enjoyed my job as a I had full autonomy and reported to the General Counsel."
good,"It was a pretty good place to work. there was plenty of overtime, but since its a warehouse its hot in the summer and cold in the winter with no in between"
good,I've been on this job for over 20 years now. In my experience it hasn't been perfect but I do have seniority which has it's perks. The pay is decent not the best nor what I should be making but i'm comfortable so I can't complain too much.
good,"To many hours a day to be standing in one spot. For that kind of damage to a person's body, one should be at least  compensated a higher level of pay."
good,"I enjoyed working with the staff. The store was never that busy which caused for long days. Nice, flexible and understand management. Good job. Not super stressful."
good,Rite Aid provided me with the tools and skills to move forward in my career. The pharmacy staff was very helpful helping me gain and also improve my skill set.
good,"In the time I have worked at Rite Aid I have answered multi line phones, computers for customer scripts, handling money in different aspects from collecting money from customer for transactions and purchases to Western Union, stocking shelfs and checking prices and marking things down as needed."
good,I have nothing to say except that I wish they didn't sell to Walgreen. I love the people I worked with at Rite Aid. The company was a decent company. I had no problems working for Rite Aid. I don't know what else to say.
good,I have worked in worse places. Friendly people but not much opportunity. It has been a long time so I'm not sure about the current state the Loss Prevention department is in.
good,Its been a long time since working there but it was a great enviroment to work. Get to know the patients personally after a while. when working with the same people all the time they feel like family
good,"Working graveyard was very productive."
good,Management does not follow through.  Been waiting to be moved to full time since September 23 to receive Benefits. Still hasn't happened.  They take there time
good,"Productive with lots of overtime. Worked as a team, fast paced worked different jobs everyday as needed. Monday thru Friday with great pay. Got paid weekly and had great benefits."
good,Rite Aid was my first job and it was pretty ok for me. I worked part time as a cashier associate and the pay was alright. Customers are pretty friendly most of the time. It is an alright starting job for students attending high school or college. I did not get a lot of hours so it was difficult keeping up with knowing what is expected there. I give it a 7 out of 10.
good,Overall I can't complain about rite aid it was an great work experience gained more experience on the forklifts and cherry picking machines but the biweekly pay sucked
good,I really enjoyed working at Rite Aid it was the lack of pay for what I was doing.  If the pay was better I would of had stayed good I'm management all around.
good,"-As this was a 24 hour pharmacy with drive thru, used to be very hectic in the mornings."
good,I had a great experience at rite aid. I worked there as my start of experience in the pharmacy field. Unfortunately the pharmacy manager who is now my mentor left not to long after I was hired. I worked there for a little over a year and decided it was time for me to move. I appreciate Rite Aid for giving me my first experience in pharmacy. The new pharmacy manager didn't seem to care as much that I was there to learn and began to take advantage. I was originally told that they would be flexible with my school schedule and that didn't happen so it was time for me to resign.
good,"the company was a good place to work, would have liked it to be a full time position. More opportunity to move up in the company would be nice. Need a janitorial crew."
good,All locations are different as far as business but my location is very busy. They have worked well around my busy schedule with kids and college. My biggest complaint is the pay scale. The benefits for full time techs are pretty decent however.
good,good company to work for. I met a lot of good people. The work hours are flexible. management can be improved but over all it's a good place to work. I enjoyed it
good,"Enjoyable to work here, not enough to live off of though it’s a good part time job for people in high school. I recently graduated and I am trying to advance and move up in life."
good,"Truck delivery comes early in the morning.  Truck has to be unloaded to stockroom, merchandise needed on sales floor gets put out on shelves throughout the day. Deposit has to be taken to the bank, and I get enough change for the week.  I make sure the store is clean and ready to go when I unlock the doors.  "
good,you are promised full time but seldom make your 40 hrs. pay is low and at the time I worked there I couldn't afford health insurance. but they can be flexible with the schedule if you need time off
good,not a bad company work hours can be too much overtime hot don't pay enough for work you are doing supervisor are rude and unfair good food hours are ok with out the ot
good,They require much overtime and standing on your feet in a fast paced environment.  The benefits are not too bad.  If you cannot meet their quota you will be history!!
good,"All Rite-Aid's aren't the same. The one I worked at was not all that good. When I first started I thought it was a good opportunity to advance in the company to the Pharmacy area. After a week or so, I learned that the business was closing, which wasn't really fair because I came to the business hoping to advance and come to find out it was closing because Walgreen's bought them out."
good,The clients was generally older and we catered to there needs as much as possible. The only drawback was once the corporation started downsizing no one was guaranteed job security.
good,"The job wasn't in the best neighborhood and the customers weren't amazing outside the morning ones being okay. Coworkers were fine. Over all, I didn't have any  real problems in or out."
good,The job was okay. I hated standing at the register with no one there. I would have liked to be helping out with everything around the store instead of standing.
good,"If you're looking to get into management Rite aid is a great stepping stone. You have to be careful not to get yourself trapped in a position though, otherwise it's very difficult to advance."
good,My job training program landed me an internship at Rite Aid where I completed a paid 110 hours. My overall experience with Rite Aid is that I wouldn't mind working there again.
good,productive  workplace where management worked along side other employees to get daily task done. There were not enough payroll hours to schedule enough employees daily for task that needed to be accomplished.
good,Not a bad place to work I enjoyed my job as a pharmacy tech there. I never had any issues other then a couple of employees who worked up front and never realy did thee work.
good,"Assisted with the operation of the retail store including leading associates through the execution of company business plans/objectives to drive sales to be profitable and provide a superior customer and associate experience. Facilitated company strategies and employees to achieve objectives in areas of sales management, store development, and store support. Executed weekly sales ads and price changes, recalled, damaged, outdated, and transferred merchandise. Manage front-end operations to ensure friendly and efficient transactions at checkout."
good,Rite Aid was a great company to work for. The job as Store Manager was challenging and rewarding. The drawback was working on weekends and holidays. The people were great.
good,"Everyday is different, cash handling experience, how to deal with management or lack there of, workplace culture there is not much that i can say about that,"
good,This store was close to Las Vegas Jr. College and was a target for theft often. At that time we didn’t have any security and I had to work alone in the front quite a bit. There was very little I could do about the theft.
good,Overall a good place to work. They pay could be better but most of the time you are able to pick your own hours so this is a plus. This is a good 2nd gig.
good,"I worked there for 2 years (was supposed to be full time pharmacy technician but ended up being both cashier (mostly at the front end) and only a pharmacy technician once a week. The boss of the store was never there, they had 5 other ""bosses"" to run the place. The place is a mess most of the time, rude coworkers, rude bosses, very chaotic work place. No one follow orders and everyone does what they want. Customers often left complaint, bosses never cared enough that you need to perhaps go to the bathroom once in a while and went either on a cigarette break, into their cars half a day (instead of working), or never picked up a phone to unblock a register's problems. It was a horrible horrible experience."
good,i had originally applied there to be in management but was told i needed at least 6 months of experience. The whole time i was there i was treated like a 2nd class citizen and had to do my superiors job for them most of the time.
good,Anybody can work there it’s an okay job. Just that the pay rate is not how much you expect it to be. I left that job because I started school and I wanted to make more money.
good,overall was good the coworkers was helpful from time to time doing security some problems would occur but was easily solved with the help of lps and undercover cops
good,"Rite Aid Corporation did not adequately reward their Pharmacy Managers, Pharmacists, or Staff members for going above the call of duty.  The 12 hour shifts with the 2 days on and 2 days off rotation with every other weekend was very tiring.  Rite Aid did not allow for enough Staff hours to have adequate Technician and Cashier Coverage and the Pharmacist was frequently tasked with filling the Prescriptions and running the Cash Register.  The toughest part was the 12 hour shifts.  The most enjoyable part was that I had enough knowledge from Relief Work as a Pharmacist to know when the pricing structure was incorrect."
good,"Perform computer entry of prescription information including but not limited to: patient search, prescriber search, drug selection, prescription interpretation & entry, insurance billing and basic problem resolution"
good,"My manager was pleasant to work for. The customers were diverse. I enjoyed that."
good,Overall I learned a great amount of people skills working for rite aid as far as knowing how to speak to honest and dishonest customers. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the dishonest customers and convincing them to comply with me. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping honest customers get what they need and want in the store and seeing smiles on their faces as they thank me.  Management was very understanding and as helpful to me as I was to them.
good,"There was always something to do.  In fact, there was more than you could realistically be expected to do.  In addition to the core pharmacy functions, you were expected to process returns using several procedures, etc."
good,"Basically you get your section or work area for the day ( depending machine or stocking)."
good,"great people and love the music they play, didnt like the hours of open then close and open then close. pharmasict should get people skills and smile more"
good,Rite Aid pharmacy department is a very busy place to work. There is never any downtime. Must be able to be on your feet all shift. Must also be able to multitask.
good,"Job was never stressful "
good,Depending on the location and the staff can either make your experience either possitive or negative. You must be a team player and have a very flexible schedule
good,"You will hate or love this job depending on location and who you work with. As a tech you in my location you can work at a retail store and make the same amount or more. So you are not in it for the money"
good,"While I have greatly enjoyed training and shaping so many young minds in what would be their first job experience, I have never been adequately compensated or recognized for my work.  My team relies heavily on my full support.  I take my responsibilities very seriously, and have imparted a world of knowledge that could not easily be paid for, but it would have been nice if they had ever tried."
good,This position was stepping stone for me and good to obtain technician experience.  Management was poor which resulted in a high turnover rate and low morale of employees.
good,I would typically work two 12-hour shifts in a row with two days off following that. I would also work two weekends out of a month. My typical work day would consist of all the duties expected of a pharmacist.
good,"learned to observe to prevent loss "
good,It was my first job as a cashier and it was just an okay experience for me. I would have liked to work longer to get to be a better cashier but other than that it was okay
good,"productive sorting medication and data entry, with drive thru and dealing with prior auths, unloading orders and stocking the shelves. enjoyed the people."
good,A very rewarding career orientated pharmacy. The company was very flexible and really took care of its employees. The people that made up the company is what made it so special.
good,"typical day at work is long...very long. the most enjoyable part of the job is the people i work with. i love the them, and i love the medicine part of the job but the pay is horrible. technicians really don't get paid enough to deal with the stuff they have to deal with daily. we are expected to do so much and bite our tongues when customers are rude and cuss us out and get paid less than $10, and that's for someone who's been with the company 6 years."
good,From what I remember working there years ago I was only managing 20 hours or less a week and you never had set days to work. Scheduled consist of mornings afternoons and mid-shift.
good,"The front end staff are typical retail workers."
good,Rite Aid no longer exists because Walgreens bought them. Ever since they took over Eckerd's they were headed straight down the toilet because they spent too much money buying Eckerd's out.
good,"I do not know the current situation since they were purchased by Walgreens well after I left the company."
good,"8am to 9pm Mon-Fri, Sat 9am to 7pm and Sunday 10am to 6pm."
good,hated my time there but the hours and pay were good. Management were excellent at micro managing which was tacky and stressful. Good job if you only need it for a couple of months
good,This is a nice company. Its been awhile since I was there so I really am not sure of the current state of affairs with the company.   I had great people working for me.
good,As a  manager you work over 50 hours per week  Since most reports are low wage earners there was a high turnover. Very competitive retail pharmacy industry. Senior management is very rough.
good,"was a great place to work at , the food was great, the people that work there were great, the only thing i would complain about is that they didnt give me alot of days"
good,Just a typical day at wok get alone with your co-workers very well show you through the process of things. I have learn that it is very easy to get alone with people that you barely know. The hardest part of working at Rite- Aid well its nothing really hard about working there its very easy.
good,Working with patients of the pharmacy and customers shopping on the retail side is very rewarding for me. Though the lack of hours is stressful since taking an actual lunch break is slightly impossible when you're the only manager on duty.
good,"A typical day at work was enjoyable and was usually not rushed. Employees worked together well to get jobs done in a timely and correct manner. There were many opportunities to learn new skills and move up in the company. Management was always helpful and informative. The hardest part of the job was when information was not effectively communicated and you would need to backtrack to find where the error occurred. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of community in the workplace , everyone was a team player."
good,"Working for Rite Aid was fine at the store level. I enjoyed the staff and job well enough. Upper level management was a mess, took a long time to respond to questions, and was unclear on decisions and expectations. Additionally, there were too few staff in the store to manage it."
good,"There is a healthy balance between busy and slow work days, you have downtime when it's slow. Managers stay in their offices all day and only come out when called for."
good,"I learned to be quicker around the holidays, got to know many friendly customers. I gained work experience and was learning to become a shift and they staff is very helpful."
good,customer service is key in places like rite aid. i enjoy helping customers out. i also enjoy helping my team becomes comfortable with one another. i use to stock the store overnight. i enjoyed that alot as well.
good,The company exudes positive energy. Management is very transparent and supportive of your contribution to the company. They make an effort to know each employee.
good,"I worked there for almost two years and started as a sales associated and got promoted to shift supervisor within about 6 months of me working there. I loved working there mostly because I got to know a lot of the customers personally due to it being a neighborhood store so it was really easy to assist them.I learned almost everything about how to officially run a retail store, I learned more efficiently how to make deposits and deal with money, how to train associates and process inventory. The hardest part of the job was probably being the only manager on duty in a whole shift due to small management team, there was too much to do for only one person and sometimes we didn't even have enough associates. But for the most part we communicated very well within the management team and got things done accordingly."
good,"Rite Aide Warehouse is a good place to work. It is one of the biggest warehouse in Maryland. you get a five day off work schedule, and a six day on work schedule."
good,"It's a great experience working at Rite Aid Pharmacy and I'm gaining a lot of knowledge everyday. The environment is great. I can be stressful at times, but the people I work with evens it out."
good,Great company to grow with with until they dont want you to grow anymore. Advertise growth within the company first but will hire ones whom have no experience with the company. Career advancement is on there time.
good,A nice place to work for convenience. Was lucky to have kind co-workers and manager who helped and seemed understanding. Decent discount. A variety of different costumers and regular customers.
good,the long work hours was due to being a manager and for the most part the staff was young collage students... 2 senor personnel which i could count on but it could get hard to keep a staff on hand which would leave me to cover the hours if need be...at the time a new supervisor was changing the culture so hopefully things have changed
good,Rite Aid afforded myself and family with great benefits including 401k and health insurance.  I very much enjoyed working with our customers and the great coworkers at this store.  I did not enjoying opening the store by myself and spending countless hours trying to help customers andaccomplish my job duties alone. I do not believe this provides for a very safe environment.
good,it is a fast paced environment with a large work load you can learn a lot of good well rounded skills that can translate into any other retail setting.
good,"A fast paced work environment with very little benefits and not enough hours. It’s okay to start here, but I suggest working your way up to something different."
good,As a technician the pharmacy required a lot of work for very little pay starting at minimum wage. Rite Aid also required a ton of pushing various programs that became quite annoying. I was also not able to sit down there were no chairs in the pharmacy. Very understaffed as well.
good,My team was wonderful. I had to relocate due to my house burning down in fayetteville. I could not transfer to ohiladelphia because my store in north carolina was converting to a wallgreens and the stores in philadelphia were not converting
good,"1:Managers suck "
good,I didn't mind the job. I actually miss it from time to time. I actually wish i didn't quit. I just wasn't getting enough hours and i got along well...
good,I think over all Rite Aid is a good job and place to work. I got promoted after only 3 months of working there. The staff is friendly and you get employee discounts. Plus they have an option to be part of the union.
good,I didn’t think I got paid enough for everything I was doing. No one gets paid fairly. The schedule was not set so you couldn’t really plan any events with family.
good,Management in this place can be a lot better. I can say it was the most diversity. All races worked here and that made it easier to communicate with customers.
good,"Part time job.  Manager was excellent, kind and caring.  Job was at times faced paced.  Pharmacy staff and front end cashiers were kind and made you welcomed"
good,"A typical day at work for the Rite Aid Distribution Warehouse consisted of trying to keep yourself busy enough to last a whole 8 hours.  Even though there was a manager there to give ""direction,"" it wasn't enough to let you know specifically what to do.  The so-called training was a joke."
good,"I'm having a great experience at Rite Aid,"
good,"A typical day at work would either be cashiering, go backs, customer service, western union support, stock and add or doing load, breaking down the pallets, unloading the totes, wheeling everything out to the floors and unloading all merchandise onto shelves. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to commute with the customers and help them find what they need. The hardest part of the job would be having to do load. Depending on what store you work in the management style is different."
good,"* Manage control substances inventory, overstocks, outdated, recalled and audited"
good,"It was so long ago now, it was an ok support job. We had good people and some ok training. worst was that they sold the place out from under us. But the stipend to stay was worth it."
good,"Only worked there approximately 1 year, so can't say all that much ... Business management was always fluctuating with retail health care market ... Recently bought out by Walgreens and Albertsons"
good,The store managers were fair. The security was inadequate which made me feel unsafe. The regional manager wasn't supportive. The stores weren't very culturally diverse.
good,Great place to work but no chance for advancement there. There really is not much to say... Its a chain store so they all run about the same. Clean wirk place though
good,"Pharmacy management was the best I ever had. The Pharmacist was such a wonderful manager. Very professional and all of the customers loved and trusted her.  She was very fair with all of her employees. Unfortunately, the profession and job itself was very stressful and not for me."
good,We are busy all the time. We have to deal with insurance problems. We have to have good customer service. I like interacting with our regular customers. I like the people I work with
good,"I worked at Rite Aid for 9 years in three different capacities. While I do not regret working there, it is a difficult place to work at especially given that stability in the company has decreased over the years."
good,"my experiment with this company is so what left a sour taste in my mouth. its wasn't the company per say. its were the management, some of the manager, the whole idea of how they treat their employees."
good,One of the better retail chains to work for. I had good management at my store. Store had great staff including technicians and clerks. Front end managers were supportive
good,It was a  basic pharmacy/ corporate job. All the employees are nice and helpful and the pharmacists were great at their jobs. Our seasonal sales were also good
good,Good place to work;extensive and ongoing training;workload can be challenging at time but rewarding;good benefits;friendly associates and peers;systems are up to date
good,"a lot of multi management and tasks to do, but helps build good character and a good experience for young people working. Can be a little too laborous but its alirght."
good,"Fairly slow, proper resources. I would certainly recommend over Walgreens, CVS and similar major chains. Overall, I enjoyed my experience here, learned a lot"
good,"Typical retail environment. Long hours and a lot of stress. "
good,The work was good. The people were great. I liked my manager. He was a good listener. He ensured that we had the needed supplies to do our work well. I liked working here.
good,Rite aid is fun and fast paced. Not many people work at one time. Most of your co workers are helpful. Only downfall was the hours and some rude customers. Overall I loved it
good,"a variety of jobs to do so you don't get bored. Customer service can be a challenge sometimes, Very micromanaged company so your creativity is limited. Having to work nights, weekends and holidays on a regular basis is the worst part."
good,"stressfull job, no fair payment, no overtime payment, lack of staff. however my manager was really good with staff, its just the cooperate that make the job become hard"
good,"I enjoyed working there, my coworkers were a family. Management had an open door policy, Jane truly cared about us as people. The store had a mom & pop store feeling about it."
good,Compensation is comparable to industry. Work life balance is challenge. Hardest part of the job was to keep the patient/customers satisfied all time while ensuring that my team is motivated too
good,"Workloads were generally good most days. Some days, work go smoothly, some days not so smooth. Most customers were nice, but some were demandings and that ruin my days."
good,Busy work  environment. Some days were slow. There's  always something to do. Friendly co workers. Must have a team player mind set. Need to be able to work well under pressure and multi-task.
good,"As an assistant I opened and closed the store worked with the staff on stocking shelves, waiting on customers, office work, taking deposits to the bank."
good,Very fast pace.  Can be very stressful if you allow it. The job can get very tedious.  Customer service should be number one priority but sometimes it gets pushed back due to lack of labor and too many added projects.
good,"Rite Aide was a great place to work, and despite their low wages as compared to other companies, the raises are pretty regular making it fairly easy to get more money."
good,This is a okay company to work for if you are just getting into the work force. I would not come in if you are over 25 and have a family to support. Great for highschool and college freshmans.
good,The best experience I ever had in a pharmacy. Working for Rite Aid felt like a family environment. I met great people during my time working with the company and I still keep in contact with these people today.
good,"It was the customers that made the job difficult, and only one or two employees were difficult to work with. It is hard to work in a place that has policies most people dont agree with because the associates are at the forefront."
good,I enjoyed all of our customers. Most of the pharmacy team was great to work with.  Many different goals were set for the pharmacy and were given few technician hours to help meet those goals.  During the possible Walgreens merger and subsequent sales of stores employees were concerned about company stability.
good,Manage several stores and advanced to Merchandise department.  I relocated for Rite Aid to convert Gray Drug stores in Florida.   I advanced to Crew Lead and had my own team that I worked with and developed to advance to the next level.
good,I did a variety of jobs at rite aid. I unloaded trucks and put the merchandise into the computer system. I stocked the lines with product and took the product off the computer system. I also picked the product and sent it to the stores.
good,"I worked as a picker, unloader and stocker. Any job they needed me to do I did. From unloading trucks and putting them into the computer for inventory. To cutting open boxes to fill picker slots and taking them out of the computer inventory. to picking the product for stores to be shipped out."
good,not a bad place to work. Typical Chain pharmacy. Long hours but pay was decent. Had a decent pharmacy team that I worked with.  Team Morale was very good.
good,"Retail job providing customer service. Working in the pharmacy is one of the harder parts of the job that entails a lot of multitasking. Rite Aid was a good company, but seems to be trending down with selling of a chunk of their stores to Walgreens."
good,I do not see why this is even required because I feel it is personal and should not be required for me to update my resume. So i don't have anything positive or negative to say.
good,"Work was typically the same everyday. Check doors, check EAS Panels, and check all anti-theft device (including CCTV). The only part that was different daily was if someone would come in to attempt to steal."
good,"Rite aid had been an interesting experience. It has been so far back that I can't remember details though. "
good,"Rite Aid was a good place to work as a stagnant, complacent job. The treatment is fair but the pay was much less than deserved . The management was efficient but always understaffed."
good,Location I worked at was located in Auburn.  Mid-Volume store that wasn't very stressful.  I had a great manager and team that was supportive. Electronic system is decent.
good,"The pick line is loud and needs to be oiled or replaced in the location of Mod 1 and 2. The rollers on the pick line make it hard to push the containers, due to the fact that they are not well maintained.  "
good,"It's like any other retail job, not much to say. Employees work most holidays and weekends and the main focus is providing good customer service. Nice place to work."
good,"Not bad of  place to work and grow. If you want to learn and grow you will have the opportuity to do so here. It is a great place to learn the in's and out's of the industry yet being able to interact with customers regularly. It is however challenging given the climate of the community,but worth a challenge if yu have a heart for people. Its not enough to say I am an employee and not go above and beyond to help meet the needs of the people."
good,"From what I remember (worked here 15 yrs ago) the staff was friendly for the most part. A few bumps in the road, but for the most part my experience here was enjoyable."
good,They promised me 12$ an hour when I first applied but that got bumped down to 10.75 on the second interview and 10.50 when i actually started working. the work is easy but the management is inept
good,I enjoyed my time at rite aide. I learned a lot about customer service and how to maintain a store. There was always something to do at the Job. it was my first experience
good,"great starter job for a techs. hours are flexible and co workers are helpful. management is very stressful trying to reach make quota but "
good,"Long work for little pay. Customers could sometimes be rude. Work hours could change. Management is friendly with workers. Good first job, quick and easy learning process."
good,Rite Aid is a great job if you love retail.  If you do not see yourself working in retail for the rest of your life then I highly recommend looking for something else.  Rite Aid is probably one of the reasons I decided to go to law school.  I could not imagine myself spending the rest of my life working there.  At the end of the day there was more negatives then positive things I was taking away from that experience.
good,"not enough help, seem to be more concerned about volume and quantity. But they always stressed patient care but no enough effort to provide that care---no time for individual consultations and lack of tech help made matters worse---everyone stressed out way too much"
good,"Good for long term employment, however the distribution center closed in Poca, WV. I worked at the facility for 20 years, there was a new facility built in South Carolina which resulted in our dc to close."
good,working in a drug store as a cashier and putting things on the shelf for people to buy and answer questions from people who have questions.  also checking people out at the cash register
good,"I worked on the register mostly and I did stocking.  I interacted with the customers on a professional level  and enjoyed talking with people. I learned a lot about different products and what the purpose of the items were so I can let the customer know about the  products, and how to use them if they asked me."
good,A typical day there is filled with many challenges. There is never a dull moment. Every day there is always a new task that need to be done. Working in the front there is more room for growth in comparison to working in the pharmacy.
good,This was a part time job for me during college and I enjoyed the team I worked with.  The company as a whole is very corporate and did very little to show appreciation to its employees.
good,The job was stressful at time but it push me to get the job done in a timely matter. This job ended at June 15 2016. my typical work day when everyone show up for work to make everyone job easier. what i lean not to cut corner finish the job right. my management i never had a problem he made the job kinda stress free for me but still expect the work to be complete. my workplace culture was very positive. The hardest part of job was leaving. The most enjoyable part of the job was Team Work if someone was sick or had to leave they have no problem of picking up the slack
good,"A regular day of typing new prescriptions, refills and answering phone calls and faxing refills request to md office, and giving customers there medicine. I always kept learning new medications and laws thy kept us up to date. The hardest type of the day would be not having all meds and we cant fill. the most enjoyable thing is when you helped all your customers and all your work is done."
good,"Loved working face to face with customers. I was not provided help during rush hours which was stressful. The store manager had to help run register while I filled prescriptions and if not I was stuck doing everything from answering the phone, filling prescriptions, running the register and counseling all while I had 20 prescriptions piled up and customers waiting."
good,This is like a high school job for like a kid who has never gotten a job before and still live with their parents. So if you have a family and alot of responsibilty this is not the job for you. They require so much for so little pay and the benifit is just sad.
good,"Rite Aid, is really a middle of the road sort of job. Its nothing horrible, as you would expect from a retail setting with irregular schedules, holiday influxes, weekends, ect with the manual stocking of shelves, cycle counts associated with the job."
good,Rite Aid very fast paced. Difficult some days to do the job. Stress level was high at times. Not enough tech help most days at most stores. It was a job at the time.
good,"Usually i have a good day, I love talking and helping the people.Also helping them guid in the directions as they need help lookink for items.The management was pretty good and decent.work inviorment was nice and clean,Hardest part was when someone stole and trying to get them.My most enjoyable part was greeting and helping others."
good,"great first opportunity to learn the pharmacy field.  Horrible pay and opportunity for advancement.  i didn't want to leave the manager that i was working with, but unfortunately, the cost of living here in the district is higher than rite-aid was willing to pay."
good,"not much help is given from management, expected to fall in line and do things their way or get fired, hard hours with no breaks and no time to eat lunch"
good,working at rite aid is not something I would recommend but if someone is in need of a job and doesn't mind working retail this is not a bad job to have.
good,i would mostly service people's item at the cashier. As a cashier i would have to accept the task from my supervisor or manager to help with stocking the inventory that has to be filled in the shelf.
good,The job taught me a lot.  Many managers in this company have compassion and concern for their employees.  The job can be stressful but it's all in what you make it.
good,This job is what you would expect for working retail. It's very demanding and fast paced. I enjoyed my customers and my co workers but management kept you overworked and under payed.
good,Very fast paced. Busy with customers. I learned how to be more customer friendly and how to work well with others. Hardest part about the job would be dealing with irate customers.
good,Great team work and friendly management team. Opportunity of advancement. Diversity that encourage acceptability and tolerance. Absolutely supportive in safety matters
good,"as usual with retail pharmacy poorly paid staff, ever increasing workload, no breaks or lunches permitted, staffing hours cut"
good,"Its retail, what else can one say.  It wasnt always a bad place to work, the patients made it worth while.  Constantly under the thumb to meet our quotas and deadlines."
good,Ok place to work. Sometimes long hours. Paid vacations and holidays. There are advancement opportunities for managers and other positions. Payroll is limited.
good,"You can have great management who help you with anything, but if corporate won't sign off on any advancement, project, etc. good luck ever finding advancement or increased pay. Additionally work-life balance is at an all-time low, management cows to patients who are rude, inconsiderate, and otherwise wouldn't be tolerated but will instead bend over backwards for them to maintain their script volume. Low support staff, frequently working by yourself, asked to accomplish additional goals and tasks with less and less hours- it all leads to burn out."
good,Good jumpstart to management duties . Flexible work hours and duties . Pharmacy career path as well as front end operations .  Adequate locations and straightforward job duties
good,"I can't say I loved the job . However , the store I worked for accepted tattoos, piercings , hair color and in away was it's own family . It was quicked pace and plankgrsms were fun. However, it was relatively understaffed and the clopening shifts were miserable . Lastly, I couldn't stand how they would made the flu shot a game , not just with customers but it's own staff . They once offered a pizza party to the first store to have all of their employees to get their shots and would scold the pharmacists ( who I knew fairly well ) if they didn't convince the staff ."
good,"Nice people, busy store.  Everyone I work with likes to have fun but work hard and are competitive with the surrounding stores.  Although, I am starting to find it difficult to keep up with the changing hours required in a retail setting and do not feel the salary is adequate for the position that I am in or the skills that I can bring to the company."
good,"This job is fairly routine, but fun coworkers make the day go by with energy and laughter. I have learned how to improve my leadership and team building skills."
good,"The work was intermittent but sometimes challenging, I felt that because of my location I was overlooked in many aspects such as extra training or help there seemed to opportunity for advancement since you were perceived as a contractor nothing more. The more difficult part of the job was trying to keep the customer happy within your operational means. I was always difficult to order repair parts without any issues, there was always something causing an issue. The workplace was fun as I was assigned to the Boeing Company and that work environment was fun."
good,very fast pace work environment with high call volume will be filling medication under the supervision of a pharmacist answering phone calls third party billing medication refills.
good,Though I worked here the longest it wasn't because I really enjoyed it.  It could be stressful at times and there was a period where I felt like I was running the store.  I did learn quite a bit about business while working there.
good,"Many stores suffering from inability to keep staff, which can make hours and weeks stressful and make one feel overworked, but otherwise a very average retail company to work for."
good,"No real raises, very low starting rate, high volume of work. I adore my pharmacy manager. He is the best boss I've ever had, and he is the main reason I have continued to stay with the company."
good,"Was fun learning the 1 Hour Photo lab procedure and all the aspects of retail business, from inventory to cashiering. Meeting and serving the diversified customers in the area was enjoyable."
good,low payroll. not enough associates to get job done. often left covering shifts when associates call out. not much help from hr or dm to staff the stores. constantly adding tasks without adding payroll to accomplish.
good,when they did not have the work backed up it was a nice and easy job they had a lot of opportunities for employees to progress in the careers they had
good,"High stress, fast-paced job that rarely lets you catch a break. Some customers tested the limits of a persons willingness to stay courteous but extremely rewarding when assisting those in need."
good,Fast paced work. The hours can change greatly depending on the time of year. Certain actions that happened in the store forced me to look for other job options
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and was just hard balancing family time. My overall experience was good. Very tight staff. Had good relationships with other managers.
good,"The job is easy in and of its self. just stocking shelves, facing. helping customers. Removing expired items from the shelves. Cleaning up little things."
good,"Work days were very slow, no raises were given. The managers weren't very sociable with the cashiers. The only good thing was the 20 percent discount. Would not recommend."
good,"Working there was like any other job, good days and bad days, but more good then bad. I enjoyed the customer interaction and the relationship dynamic developed from the repeat customers. I learned a lot from this job that I have used in other jobs I encountered there after this one."
good,District managers are allowed to be degrading and rude to anyone they encounter. I would still be with Rite Aid had I not been treated poorly by the district manager.
good,Enjoyed working here. Everyone works together as a team. I enjoyed having different things to be responsible for and completeling those tastes in a timely manner.
good,"Although I enjoyed working in the pharmacy and all the customers, there was one pharmacist that made the job unbearable and made the customers lives unbearable and unfortunately, I couldn't stand around and continue to be taking advantage of nor see our customers being taken advantage of."
good,"I honestly enjoyed working for rite aid. They gave me an awesome opportunity when others wouldn't. I was great at what I did. Things could've obviously been better for the company if things got done like they were supposed to. Both with fellow associates and management. Needless to say, I did learn quite a bit from this company. Wish i was still a member of the team and currently working on possibly becoming one once again.Things are worked on basing off our by percentage and rate here, and my rate was always exceptional. Average 30 to 40%  higher at times, above what was needed. I worked hard when I could. All in all its a good place to work just be ready to work."
good,"Good place to work if you are into customer service, and you love working with people, the management is good depending on their personality, the hardest part of this job is not being able to fulfill customer needs, while the most enjoyable is being able to meet new people and care for patients."
good,I liked this job. i learned many new things about medications and how a pharmacy runs. i was busy for the most part and the people were pleasent to work with.
good,"Very fast paced store, Very busy.  High prescription count. Very nice customers. The days were very busy. Not enough help some days. some days could be very stressful"
good,Rite aid is a friendly and positive work environment. It is a high volume store always busy their is always work that needs to be done. You would have to be able to work under pressure.
good,"Rite aid is a good place to work but not much caring for their employees,would like to see more appraisal, More involvement from supervisors and management.I have seen first hand that the company will take the word of a customer instead of investigating or even speaking with an employee before counseling them."
good,"This is a very fast pace location being that it was a 24 hr location, feel as for security they need to really have more supervision because location is in a pretty bad neighborhood, schedules need to be done o time. I was never trained as a overnight manager my training was more like 2 days and then on my own. Management needs to communicate more. Apart from these flaws I really enjoyed my line of work and working with my fellow co-workers and the customers are awesome"
good,"Great place to work. Managers are awesome. Benefits can be improved. Quality assurance may be approached in another way. Attracting enthusiastic employees will make it a great place to work,"
good,"Rite aid pharmacy technicians are some of the lowest paid in the field including both hospital and retail pharmacy. I had to fight to receive $10/hr. If I do go back to retail, it will not likely be to work for Rite Aid"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of taking care of customers at the drive thru or inside register, counting and labeling prescriptions, inputting prescriptions, facing shelves, sweeping floor/cleaning counter tops,putting up the order and making sure every customers is up to date on their immunizations. There's really nothing hard about being a technician, it's just the fact of doing so much for very little; my team and manager make my days worth while and for them I'm thankful, but it's time for me to branch away for something anew."
good,It's now a company being bought out by Walgreens. Don't know if it will exist in 5 years. The government will decide to approve the merger between Walgreens and Rite Aid in the next year.
good,Company provides online training monthly to keep employee updated on changes. The company also follow up with the front line crew members to ensure each person understands what safety really means.
good,working at rite aid can be very stress full but working with the patient and getting the job done is what work every job and being professional should always be at the top of the list
good,"it was ok working here. it's really demanding and fast paced. customers are mostly elderly. stocking shelves, cleaning shelves, serving ice cream, customer service"
good,all I remember is thursdays when we's get our shipment. It was a lot of heavy lifting and work for minimum wage. Not my favorite place to work but fortunately I wasn't there for long.
good,"greet customers"
good,The work place atmosphere for the most part was fun and energetic but some people did more work than others. Always had happy and easy going customers that made it fun.
good,"Great coworkers to work with.  Great workplace.  Needed to move on for a better opportunity.  Rite Aide management recognizes hard working employees, and extended training."
good,Good job. Stocking shelves and facing the items in the isles isn't too bad. The only thing was the overnight. Hard to stay awake. Very few customers walk-in. Ok overall.
good,"It's minimum wage when I was working.  It's definitely great for a starter job, just something to put a little cash in your pocket or to help out while in school, but unless you really like working there, it is probably something you will want to leave eventually.  Get the experience and move on, there isn't much room for advancement, but opportunities do come about. However, it may not be within the store you are working at, so if you don't mind traveling, take the opportunity you'll advance faster."
good,"Each day was busy and full of customers, which allowed me to become skilled and comfortable in social interactions. Management was strict and enabled me to be in a disciplined environment. My overall experience was positive and I like learning new things."
good,"I had more support at Rite Aid, better pay, better benefits and management was more supportive and caring as compared to Walgreens.  A friendlier group of people in general."
good,able to change schedule with no problems.  must be able to multi task. as long as you have a good group to work with the days just fly by.  occasionally not welcoming workers.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking merchandise, providing excellent customer service, controlling inventory, assisting with general maintenance of store, preparing deposits, handling customer transactions, and ensuring that all products are to date. I learned to develop excellent customer service,  to work together with other associates, organize stock, and manage tasks as well as supervise store associates. Management was very good and was very vocal to all employees about importance of teamwork. Workplace culture wasn't bad but could have been better. Many associates lacked motivation. Hardest part of the job was making sure every customer was always happy and satisfied with his or her purchase and that their shopping experience was always enjoyable. Easiest part of the job was working together with other associates."
good,"Positive work environment with fully functional staff to assist customers in everyway. Pharmacy is fast, friendly and efficient with competitive prices"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is using the medication therapy management (MTM) software to provide better patient care for our customers as well as provide vaccination clinics
good,It's a food starting job.  Easy enough. Was close by to my house. I got to meet new people.  Room for advancement. The training was well planned. The company hass really improved
good,"For the longest time, there was no PDM to manage the district. With a busy store, there are days without enough staffing to take care of scripts and patient care. There are not enough time to cross-train among techs. Parking is difficult to find in Oakland. Paid parking is not compensated for staff employees. Park at your own risk on the streets which sometimes car get broken in."
good,The job itself is easy. It is for anyone who is looking to become a pharmacy tech without much experience. You can really learn a lot because usually there is only 1 tech.
good,Come in and set what jobs the manager and cashier will do for the day. And then follow up with the cashier and make sure they are doing what they are suppose to be doing.
good,it was a good warehouse to work very easy job just had people that thought they was better then others and didn't know how to treat some people but other then that very easy job
good,"This is a good job to get your foot in the door if you are not yet completely sure what it is you want to do yet, long hours and very little pay if you are not certified."
good,Being a pharmacy technician can be very rewarding.  You are providing the general public with medication that is necessary for their everyday life.  However some customers can be very difficult.
good,"RITE AID was formerly Thrifty Drug.  "
good,Okay workplace depending on management will transfer you if you ask to be transfered fairly easy to move up if you choose to.  Union is also helpful if you have a problem.
good,"They offer cross-training so you can keep busy all the time.  I operate a forklift, perform battery maintenance, perform shipping and receiving functions, and many other jobs."
good,A typical day at work would invlove me doing everything an assistant manager does but getting paid as a shift Supervisor. I learned how to enter invoices and how to enter payroll.  I have been working for  Rite Aid longer than my current manager. I am currently training him. The culture in our work place is of caring for our customers. The hardest part of the job is working 8 hour shifts without a break. If I am the only manager on duty I can't take a break. I have to be available for the cashier on duty at all times. The most enjoyable part if my job is meeting new people and learning new things.
good,This was one of my very first jobs which made me understand the value of a dollar. Very friendly environment but a lot of stress for a 16 year old work and school life. During this point I didn't have much time off because I was the only person to answer the phone when and if somebody called in no matter where I was or what I was doing I would always manage to be there when they needed me. Only part time so no knowledge of full time benefits.
good,It's a very typical retail environment where everyone has a small task that they need to do every shift. There were periods of extreme slowness that resulted in standing around.
good,picked orders for the different stores     opened boxes    priced and inventory items   damage and inventory control   cleaned area  drove  stock picker forklift   and pallet jack     we had to be fast and efficient  we got monthly report cards  we speed and accuracy was the priority
good,"great work environment, respectful employees, hardest part of the job was working at an extremely fast pace, answering calls, and working the drive through"
good,"its really strict , safe , hot and depending on the shift the people in charge are really rude. but its workable. its clean and have available activities to enjoy youre break"
good,"worked insanely hard, never really had any time off. The building was always closed on weekends, but everyday of nightshift was mandatory overtime which sucked."
good,"The front end management team is responsible for good customer relations and getting out freight in a timely manner."
good,Management always changing. Some very slow days. I enjoyed interacting with everyone customers and employees. The hardest part was being written up for being ten cents short on the register. Employee discounts were good.
good,While working as a manager and assistant manager for rite aid it was quite stressful. While I was there the business was looking to cut costs so it always seemed as though we never had the ability to complete tasks asked of us because we were focused on cutting costs.
good,Rite Aid Pharmacy used to be very big. However it started dwindling down in Prescription orders where hours started getting cut/ reduced. Over time I had no choice but to look elsewhere.
good,"I start my job by filling perscriptions , I will  answer the  phone and look customer up on the computer to see how I can help them. I call the customers up by phone to let them know their medications are ready to pick up. I will call insurance companies to resolve problems filling customers perscriptions. I enter data from Dr.'s into computer filling perscriptions for customers. Cashiering is also part of the job along with excellent customer service. My goal is to help customers and keep them happy."
good,As a shift supervisor at this company I was able to begin my journey of management and being a leader in a professional environment. I also was able to build a great relationship with customers both new and regular every single day.
good,"Working in a high volume store a days work required handling multiple phone lines, drop off and pick up counters, script data entry and medication dispense. I learned to work in a high stress environment, be able to handle multiple problems, handle stress, work in a fast pace and be organized. the hardest job was to handle frustration and try to make sure the customers are satisfied. the most enjoyable was to be able to get everything done on time."
good,i havent worked there in 12 years.  at the time it was a very busy pharmacy.  prescrptions were filled as quickly as possible.  pharmacists were friendly
good,The job is easy and very understanding.  You get decent hours and it requires good customer service. The coworkers are great to work with and they do their part.
good,"Entered new patient profiles and prescriptions into medication input software system."
good,If they had enough help work would be smooth and easy. The employees are very kind and friendly. I learned how to deal with just about everything in the pharmacy department. The management there is very understanding and helpful.
good,"At times the job can be very stressful, not enough payroll hours and the job is very demanding.  At times the job has high turnover ratio due to the lack of pay."
good,"typed up prescriptions, make phone calls to patients and/or doctors offices prn. the work environment is always so busy because i had been working for a 24 hour store. the management could have been better for the simple fact that i believe we should not mix work with pleasure and on a lot of occasions our supervisor's had more of the attitude of a friend toward the employees rather than that of what a manager/boss should have."
good,"RiteAid is a good first-time job for anyone looking to build job experience. The job itself is relatively easy and it helps build your confidence in the workplace. People working on the lower branches are willing to give you guidance. However, if your looking for a company to move up in then I would not recommend RiteAid. The process is long and if you don't continuously pursue upper management about rising up the corporate ladder; you will most likely continue to stay in your current employment area."
good,Wellness Ambassador position was very gratifying position I believe it was very helpful to the company and the customers appreciated the help. Flexible hours and great atmosphere to work in.
good,"union provides pretty good insurance benefits, etc "
good,This is a nice place to work and start off.. Easy job to get the hang of and grow. I learn how to be more customer-friendly. It helps you Be​ group friendly work as a team. Supervising employees became easier after learning how everyone works.
good,"The job is a bit stressful due to mix ups of customers, doctors and prescribers. But other than that pharmacy hours are pretty good and the work is fluent."
good,I liked working in the pharmacy it provided me with the knowledge of knowing what medications are for what and sometimes one medication treats more than one illness
good,they are an ok company they have a good union and benefits they work you hard but you dont get paid enough for your efforts i liked that it was full time and had great benefits
good,I started as a cashier and within a year I became an assistant manager.  While there I learned to make a schedule keeping within the alloted hours for the store.  I also learned the process payroll for the pay period.
good,I enjoy working in the pharmacy and helping others.  My issue with Rite aid is  they do not compensate hard working employees.  I feel that I can earn more working for a different company.  Employees aren't treated equally
good,"This specific Rite Aid was extremely busy; always something to do. Great for those who love fast paced environments and interacting with others, especially college students."
good,I just wish I had the opportunity to grow in the company. The company was so different 11 years ago. I had a great work experience for the most part. I enjoyed the coworkers and customers.
good,"Never a dull moment working in a urban area, Due to the high theft it was a fast paced job. But had to work along sac PD was good cardio after chasing down criminals."
good,It was ok I stayed to myself and worked. The hours were ok. The breaks were I'm ok and the people were ok I guess. As I said I stayed to myself and my work station
good,it was a slow store that I worked at. I learned how to use the cash register and change price tags. the management was unprofessional. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customer.
good,Not enough pay for ton of work that need to be done by the end of day. Need more payroll if they want things to be done especially the stores in the low income neighborhood
good,It was a job. One I now know is not meant for me. The pay was not very good and a lot of responsibilities fell onto me when it would've been helpful for others to contribute.
good,"Made good friends still till this day. Some stores where cleaner than others. Not easy dealing with the public, some customers get out of hand. Some stores are located in bad areas."
good,"This job is not a bad choice. It can get hectic at times, especially if you're in the pharmacy. There are a lot of thing you have to learn to be a Pharmacy Tech."
good,"A typical day consisted of communicating with customers while they are purchasing items, looking for items and entering and exiting the store. This was my first real job so it was my first time experiencing the workforce. The hardest part of the job was having to make sure that every item in the store was positioned correctly on their respective shelf. This wasn't really hard but it was time-consuming. What made it worse was that we were multi-tasking. We had to help customers and when there were too many people at the counter we had to go to and attend to them. I feel like maybe they took advantage of their workers being young. When under 18 you aren't allowed to work over 40 hours a week but while working there I worked a little of 40. I didn't mind because I wanted the money but laws are laws."
good,Working at Rite Aid was a nice learning experience. Taught me many skills I had forgotten and how to handle the new generation of kids coming into the work force. I really enjoyed having the opportunity to help customers on a one on one basis. Sometimes I did feel that there were just not enough hours in the day to get things done and be as helpful as I wanted to be. that is where balancing my time had to come into play.
good,"Hardworking environment, team work. inventory management. courteous colleagues and . A strenuous and multitasking environment. Stock monitoring and replenishment"
good,"Because I was the new worker I couldn't have no holidays off no weekends off , I had to cover anybody shift that wasn't covered if not I'll get suspended, horrible job"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job has been getting to know my customers and taking care with their health.  I strive for excellent customer service every day and make it a point to remember people and their names after meeting them once or twice.  Customers are pleasantly surprised when I see them and greet them with their name and a smile.
good,Manage daily operations of the store. Customer service helping with anything customers may need. You learn a lot of different things in particularly dealing with the difference customers and also the different changes that take place in the company. Management is particularly pretty good overall. The most hardest part of the job is spending allot of time by yourself and trying to make sure that you also can give the best customer service in the process. The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers to me in my particular store.
good,"Work week hours over 50, Do more with less the perceived motto. Not in a position to learn, all is spelled out. Creativity not important asset to have."
good,Not a bad company to work for. But nothing special either. Worked there for years and always preached about hard work and teamwork. But when it was time to reward you for such actions they hardly ever did.
good,"Encompasses any and everything you knew that you'd not want to ever do with your life; certainly not after obtaining a pharmacy degree and license.  Of course, anyone going into retail should already know that."
good,Typical day at work involves prescription filling and customer service. I learned team work is key. Management was understanding. Workplace culture is a typical pharmacy environment. Hardest part was handling insurance issues. The most enjoyable part was working with the team.
good,Good entry level establishment for processes and Fast pace friendly environment at times with a supportive HR department.  Advancements are possible..
good,"Customer service front cashier. Responsibilities also includes unloading truck when arrives, stocking products, set-up displays, cleaning restrooms and store."
good,"Job can be quite difficult. Must unload truck some weekends very early in the morning. Good employee discounts. Great former manager who retired, new one is different. Medical/dental benefits good."
good,Management was kind and meant well but did not follow through on promises at hiring. I worked for a summer in the middle of a store remodel and the schedule was hectic and the environment was often stressful. Would not recommend in similar circumstances.
good,"Being a pharmacy technician, there are customers who you see on a monthly -- or sometimes weekly -- basis. These connections are what make this job a rewarding one."
good,"Productive and busy, dealing with patients from all walks of life. Everyone going through different things, having different kinds of days and challenges. Yet and still they all appreciate good, respectful customer service. Getting patient's their prescriptions as soon as possible. Making sure they current insurance information is current. Going above and beyond so the patient can have the best customer service possible every time."
good,A great place to work and the customer interaction exceeds my expectations. I look forward to seeing my customers weekly. also its like working with a family
good,"The people are wonderful and with us its always personal."
good,"The interview process was pleasant and the job started out alright, however the training was not as complete as I would have hoped and in the long run it turned out that the position was only seasonal, which I was previously unaware of when I was hired on."
good,"It was a great first job, I learned about how to work with customers but also keep store policy in tact, If i say anything about this job is that its a great first stepping stone."
good,I was a Pharmacy Technician at Rite Aid and I learned a lot about Medicine and Insurance.  The most enjoyable part of the job was returning customers and meeting new people.
good,When I worked here I was always managing to do the slack work that nobody would do. It was very frustrating. A lot of high schoolers worked here which made the situation worse.
good,They were very good at being flexible with my job hours and the coworkers were fun to work with. You are constantly busy throughout your day and there is always something there for you to do.
good,"technicians get under paid and are asked to take a test to become rite aid certified to get the pay that you deserve, knowing that you're already state certified."
good,"Rite Aid is a great company but needs to learn to improve compensation for employees across the board. Great opportunity was presented at the entry level job, but there was no growth from there."
good,An OK place to work. Not the best. Got blamed for things I didn't do. Meeting new people was fun. Learning new tasks and stocking new items was fun was well. That's about it. OK for a starter job.
good,Prices in the store make it difficult to support selling things. Several rules that don't seem to make sense or matter. Flexible schedules depending on the manager. Truck days were a lot of work. make sure you can lift.
good,"Banking during the opening day, put in registers, open building, assign task to staff or do them yourself, customer service, cover breaks, approvals and closing procedures 4 hours before end of business. You have to do everything as a member of management. Hire, train, review and retrain if needed. To build your team and staff."
good,"Very busy place to work, learned how to be a good customer service representative.  Most enjoyable part of the day is helping customers to understand their medications and insurance plan's coverage."
good,"Working at rite aid wasn't bad, i learned most of the patience i have from here. You come across a lot of difficult people but the whole point is to have those difficult people leave satisfied and with a smile! it was the best part of my job, meeting the customers needs!"
good,"Rite Aid is where I started my life over after my divorce. I can say that they saved me when I started in Vermont, Linda Flores is still an extremely important part of my life. Once I moved to Connecticut and I was working for the Wethersfield branch, it was hard to advance or even get a raise."
good,I loved my job but they don't give technicians full time which means no benefits. Also didn't like the management or the inconsistency between pharmacists. And no matter how many hours your shift is you don't get a break.
good,"Rite Aid offers great opportunities, if you're willing to learn and have the determination and drive that's the place for you.  Management ensures that everyone is treated equally.  If the see the motivation in you, you will be promoted."
good,I would start my day with working in the Pharmacy. I would check the status of my emails and then start the process of cold calling patients that have no yet picked up their prescriptions. Its a priority to offer vaccinations to patients and front- end customers in the store. Working for Rite Aid encouraged me to self train myself for my position. I learned to go above and beyond  to get what I needed to function. I enjoyed working with my Rite aid team.
good,Making sure shelves are stocked and ordering of merchandise was complete.  Assign jobs to employees and do whatever is needed to keep the store running smoothly.
good,Wonderful people to work with costomers were even better i enjoyed my time there and worked hard. Had many complements on my customer service
good,Advancement and wage increase on merit is tough because it is union.  Workplace is great as long as you do your job. Great starter job. You can pretty much find a rite aid in every town. You can also transfer.
good,Customers are usually fine. Some of them not. That's retail though. Scheduling is quite flexible. For some people working here is pretty good. I personally just don't like doing sale signs and truck.
good,Rite Aid is a decent place to start off in the customer service field with cashier position. Nice and clean environment and well established with in community.
good,"A typical day at Rite Aid, there is a lot of customer service involved. You learn how to deal with the consumers needs. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my cashiers happy."
good,Great place for quick learners that like to be on their feet and on the go being able to keep up with a fast paced environment.
good,The company has its ups and downs being that there is a potential merger occurring. The everyday workload is based on the demands of the customer and corporate management.
good,"Where I worked had a couple of great managers, but the district officials were completely detached from the needs of the individual stores."
good,"There is a lot do in the position I hold, but sometimes you don't feel appreciated unfortunately. Not a bad place to work, Happy I have a job and things can always be worse. ."
good,"Rite is a good company, but things are about to change because of the Merger. I have worked there 13 years and well paid. Its not stable anymore thus the reason for the buy-out."
good,"Had a good time working at Rite Aid, the management was very helpful. It was my first job so will always remember that experience."
good,"This location was very busy, but it made the day go by. I enjoyed meeting all of the new people. It was nice working with the different pharmacists. The other technicians always covered for each other when needed to."
good,"Job consisted of opening/closing of store, processing daily deposits, balancing drawers, assisting customers, and working the floor."
good,"Assist with sales, provide customer service by answering questions about products and services, perform high volume cash transactions and duties as a cashier, assist with unloading delivery truck filled with merchandise, manage a hand truck around the store with crates containing merchandise, stock shelves, conduct and control inventory."
good,Working for the company is good but l disagree with the amount of work that has to be done with the rate of pay and the amount of hours per week is not good
good,"I learned to hire associates and all the necessary paper work that the state and company required."
good,It was an ok job. It was not my dream job but it fix my life style at that time in my life. I enjoyed the customers and I enjoyed the ability to learn new things.
good,its a good job just dealing with the public can be a challenge sometimes but I learn a lot through it. I enjoy working for this company.
good,"I learned a lot of things at the pharmacy. though they were understaffed and over worked. the people were nice but due to poor management, the work experience was not the best"
good,"Not good hours"
good,I work with great customers even when few customers would come in unhappy. I love working with the public. I did everything the manager and assistant mgr accept the hiring. The coworkers were awesome.
good,"provide customers and patients with the best products, services and advice that meet their unique needs. available RediClinic and Health Dialog."
good,"The program is a great and excelling. Patients, overall are satisfied with the program, provides an innovative way towards a lifestyle change. My time here has been very rewarding,"
good,Good Job to help me get through school. They worked around my school schedule. Management was ok to work with and the benefits were very little. co-workers were great though
good,"Typical day at work was making sure my area was clean, shelves were stocked, and the aisles were safe for customer passage. I learned how to work with customers. Management was fair. Co-workers were very welcoming. Most enjoyable part was earning money!"
good,A productive and fast paced work environment that can be enjoyable. At first there was a lot to learn with a large learning curve but now I feel there is no room for advancement or further growth.
good,"¥	Provided quality patient care and fast and accurate medication dispensing. "
good,typical day of work in the pharmacy was stressful. I learned a lot about the different medications. management was helpful. co-workers were helpful. hardest part of job was dealing with cranky patients. enjoyable part was serving the patients.
good,"Each day consisted of restocking shelves, rearranging shelves, cleaning, and performing cashier responsibilities. Management consisted of two people that were not on the same page which was frustrating. I had little interaction with people which was my least favorite part of the job."
good,"A a  floater Pharmacist, I Had great time with my co-worker and I miss them everyday. I learned about customer service and how to multitask at the pharmacy every day."
good,Like there is people here and I have a cold it hurts all over and we have to listen and talk about stuff words oh wow such words
good,I worked here years ago so I'm not exactly sure how they opperate now. I'm sure they have a higher pay. Works with school schedule. Requires uniform. Rubber bottom shoes. Fast paced environment.
good,Good place for growth in management . You learn alot from upper management there a great time with alot of insight on current situations and there goals on making the company great.
good,"They do not really care about their employees however, i learned a lot from the pharmacists. Customers are very harsh but we try to give them the best customer service"
good,At first when starting the job the manager was not so friendly so I was quite discouraged at first. I even thought of quitting on like the 3rd day of work but somehow I pulled through and things started to look up for me.
good,I was a cashier and I did stock and inventory as well also got to help ring up customers in the pharmacy area it was a interesting job and I enjoyed it and the customers
good,Rite aid is a good place to start your retail journey. The management there is ok. Not much room for growth in the company.
good,At times it is a little difficult to do things because we dont have enough people working. The employees we do have dont like to do much so it falls on others
good,"Working at Rite Aid is not too bad. Aside from many things to get done and not enough hours in a scheduled shift to complete them. Above all else, the payday: If you expect to get paid on time and paid how you selected to receive your pay. You would be sadly mistaken. For a company that wants you to provide an exceptional customer experience but can't pay you on time or send you your pay the way you have been receiving it for months. Is really ludicrous and ridiculous."
good,As stated Rite Aid is more task oriented once you really get to work. The patrons that visit everyday are usually very friendly and fun to talk to. Compensation is a little lacking but it does make ends meet.
good,It was a good to work at one time then time  changed  N all the good time went away when the Manangement changed then the  Company  Went out of business n we all lost our jobs if this not good  enough  For u then I don't no what u want
good,Rite Aid is a good place to work you can exceed in the company if you have older kids being that they don't close on any of our national holiday
good,It was a very fast pace environment. The coworkers were ok. the management was pretty good.I would consider working there again.
good,This was one of the most stressful jobs I have ever had. We were always very busy and there were never enough employees scheduled to work. The employees mainly gossiped about other employees as well as customers.
good,Customers are great but not enough workers. This job is hard to please everyone with very few workers. I won't suggest that this job should be your first job.
good,"Rite-aid was a great company to work for, great customer base. Co-workers were amazing as well. Management isnt the best. also the pay isnt good at all"
good,It was a great experience as a shift supervisor. Responsibility with the company and my co- workers.  Learned how to run a store.
good,"Never a dull moment, always something that can be done for the grater good of the store. Never the same task two days in a row."
good,Its okay for those who are in high school as a summer job. You can Grow there if you wanted to. It wasn't an organized company.
good,Got retail experience and learned how to use computer systems involved with pharmacy.  Learned to read the short-hand that doctors use.
good,"I had a rough time working at Rite Aid, as it was my first job and eye opening experience to how people as customers can really be. Possibly it was the location, but the customers were awful. However, it being my first job - I learned how to work a register and was taught how to provide customer service and maintain a clean and organized store. My co-workers were all older than myself, as I did not bond closely with many of them. The hardest part of this job was being the lowest on the totem pole, as it seemed all responsibilities were given to me and I would sometimes be the only one on the floor and have at least five people on line and expecting to be out in a timely manner. The only thing I can say I enjoyed about this job was the discount."
good,"the hours were terrible, the work was very hard and tedious, and the managing team was not the best. I do not ever wish to work there again."
good,My typical day as a pharmacy technician included working with patients to find an appropriate insurance coverage.  I also dealt heavily with filling the prescription to be checked by the pharmacist.  The most difficult part of this job was the stress of being perfect with the medication.  The most enjoyable part was dealing with the customers and my fellow employees.
good,"Good place to work, supportive and hard working work staff. Great place to work if your attending college, hours are flexible, staff and management work hard to ensure you have the hours you need."
good,"A typical day includes filling prescriptions, fielding phone calls, contacting insurance companies, handling private health information, maintaining a clean work environment, and providing excellent customer service.  Retail pharmacy is one of the highest regulated work environments where saying something too loudly or putting something in the wrong trash bin could land you thousands of dollars in fines, jail time, as well as being fired, which is the hardest part of the job.  My managers have all been really accommodating and supportive, and co-workers helpful and kind.  I've honed my interpersonal skills greatly by working for Rite Aid as well as my ability to multi-task.  My pharmacy in particular is one of the most fast paced in the state and daily I am expected to handle numerous orders in a fast and efficient timeline.  The best part about this job has been the family-like environment in which I operate.  Without my co-workers I would have looked for other employment long ago."
good,"When working retail and closely with the public, I have to be on you A game. Be able to adjust your attitude to the customers is key. The customer walks into a retail establishment wanting my help or attention and me being able to help and assist them is what I do best."
good,"When your at a funeral and your going to be a little late, you call your boss to let him know that your running late and he hangs up on you telling you not to even worry about coming back in on the day of my best friends funeral. NOT SO GREAT!"
good,"This was a great experience and I learned plenty. However, the company does not guarantee advancement, so your place may be stagnant."
good,Rite-Aid was my first job as a pharmacist and I am grateful for the experience I gained from working at Rite- Aid. Working at Rite-Aid helped me learn a lot.
good,"my last 6 months were not good, but before that, it was great. I got to know the people in the neighborhood by name, and I was able to run my store as I saw fit, I had an excellent staff, but got moved, and after that every day was a struggle."
good,"If you're looking for a long term position, this is a good place. Although the pay is low, it's a good place to learn. If you're looking to get into the health field this is a good place to start. It prepares you into seeing the patients after the hospital visits."
good,"Open the store, count the cash drawers, check in vendors ,change product displaces, close the store, add up all the drawers and complete a store desposit."
good,Awesome place to work if willing to sacrifice time with family. Friendly atmosphere. A typical work day begins fast and ends slow. Everything is basically laid out for you to do in a day however not enough people at hand to get the job done as corporate would like.
good,"Just a stepping stone, as an employee you must such for something better. pay is good but it can be better. policy or policies contradicts the other. that is the only con."
good,"Lack of organization with insufficent team-work. Overall, a comfertable work area if you are looking for part time work."
good,"Overall good company. This is, however, a very fast paced and high pressure environment to work in and you must be able to work well, both independently and with a group, under these conditions. The schedules are semi-flexible but only because it's mostly shift work.  Management tends to be strict but reasonable and coworkers were always friendly and helpful.  Keep in mind that you are an at-will employee and advancement takes time with this company but it is available."
good,A normal day at Rite Aid consists of counting and logging money. Then helping customers and delegating responsibilities of subordinate employees as well as merchandising product and cleaning up the store.
good,A typical day at Rite Aid consists of greeting and helping customers enjoy their visit. I get along with all of my co-workers. I enjoy interacting with the customers. The hardest part about the job is the unstable hours.
good,Learned how to communicate with all sorts of customers no matter what kind of attitude they give. Working overnight was not so busy but we all had our work cut out for us. The management was great and so were my co-workers. We would make sure after our assigned work was completed we would help whoever needed help. The hardest part of the job was that it was overnight and it interfered with school. Talking to my co-workers was a very enjoyable part of the job to me because they were so friendly and funny.
good,"open at 9 am"
good,I enjoy working for Rite Aid Distribution Center due to their work schedule and the people are easy to due business with.
good,Day to day tasks keep you busy but are not challenging at all. You learn a lot about the community you work in from forming bonds with your customers. My co workers and I hold a family like relationship with open and honest communication. The hardest part of the job is not being able to please absolutely everyone.
good,"this job was alright. i learned alot from it."
good,"As per the usual with retail work, a typical day would consist of anywhere from 250-400 prescriptions being filled. Although my coworkers were helpful and taught me much, every day is stressful to a certain degree due to the ebb and flow of customers. Have 1199 as a benefit provider, or I would, if they didn't make me wait a year to receive benefits. It's kind of worth it in the end though, especially when you form a repertoire with the patients."
good,Rite Aid is a new experience each day.  Everyday you learn something new.  There is always something changing in the pharmacy world.  There are always things that can be done differently on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I helped someone to the best of my ability.
good,work crazy hours. don't have a steady schedule. fighting over getting days off. not worth moving up in the company. everyone is stress all the time
good,"I managed all shifts and all aspects of store openings and closings including cashiering, customer service, unloading trucks, and merchandising. I also was involved with interviewing and hiring process."
good,I made the best of this job. It was not in my pay range but the staff was awesome. I've met some of the best people I've ever met on this job. I'm thankful for this experience.
good,"I have nothing to say about rite aid. It was a job that I did enjoy for the most part. I loved working with that people I did, they were all helpful and nice."
good,I enjoyed working at Rite Aid and the people I have met. Most of the customers are nice and pleasant. The required work was not difficult to do.
good,My job while at Rite Aid was a cashier. As a cashier I had to be knowledgeable of current sales and product inventory. I dealt with numerous customers on a daily basis. I was responsible for opening registers and closing registers.
good,"there is always something going on. ,My co -workers are amazing, I seen people come and go, even mangers, over the 8 years I been there I been though like 8 mangers it's a hard place to manger and work, but we get though the day as a team."
good,This job can be frustrating but overall not bad. this is a job best set for a High School student or College student who wants a job for some extra money. A lot of work and different rule changes. Enjoyed my time here.
good,Regional offices micromanaged everything. Too much work for the pay that you received. But on the plus side to was close to home.
good,This company has a strong customer service practice. I have learned how to make customers happy to continue to shop in my store. I have great associates that I work with.
good,"A typical day at work consist of cashiering, accurately filling prescriptions, answer multiple phone calls at once, going through faxes and filling prescriptions, filling prescriptions from WIMO and the data entry, correctly maintaining patient profiles, hanging up prescription bags in the correct spot (last name alphabetical order), and help answer customer questions and concerns or direct them to the pharmacist. My hours fluctuate from a four hour day to an 11 hour day with only a half hour break or no break. I have learned a lot about multitasking and quickly solving problems in a professional manner. I have also learned how to look up customers profiles accurately. The hardest part of my job is trying to learn all the important information I need to know in such a fast pace environment, also the fluctuating hours make it a challenge to schedule anything outside of work."
good,"Typical retail, great for experience. Especially if you get to do other jobs and different task to write on your resume. Most positions are union so also a plus."
good,"I stocked store items also providing great customer service. with the help of my management team, with a very friendly environment."
good,"I have only worked here for a year, so far not bad..I like the people are work with, very helpful, you get the training you need"
good,A great place to work. Although I got spend only my teenage years here. Co-workers were supportive. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I shop there all the time still .
good,"I do not really enjoy retail pharmacy, I think I would much prefer to work in a hospital or compounding facility. My co-workers were usually pretty nice unless they were in a bad mood. I learned how to deal with customers and conflicts, how to work in a team and share work load, use pharmacy program NextGen. The hardest part is when patients are angry and having issues with their prescriptions."
good,"fun place to work. Only downside they only schedule "" full time"" workers around 30hrs a week. Also at 9.85 an hour the pay is on the low side of the spectrum."
good,"This job sucks, you have to tell customers they won't be getting their drugs, why they won't be getting their drugs, what are their options, listen to their complaints, etc."
good,Working for rite aid has been a great learning experience and advancement in the management field. I am ready to get back to the profession I love and advance in it.
good,Most days run smoothly but there are a few that some customers can change it into a nightmare. I have learned to  deal with all kinds of different scenarios and how to keep the customers happy and to keep the other associates Happy.I am not really happy at the present store I am working at bc of some of my other co workers so that makes the end of my shift the most enjoyable part of the day. I have worked at a lot of different stores as a shift  so I have gotten a lot of experience working with the public and  managing  other associates.
good,"Worked with some incredibly genuine people, consider them a second family. Unfortunately not a job that I wanted to keep any longer because of the less than adequate pay and the constant night shifts."
good,"Normal place to work with supportive management. The office started to get crowded as the day went on, normal work flow. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with up-beat employees."
good,"Typical day at work for Rite Aid includes preparing medications by reviewing and interpreting Physician orders, counseling the public on prescription and over the counter medications, Administered immunizations such as influenza, zostavax, pneumonia and tdap. I learned how to become a better communicator by working for this company. Management was always there to listen to you and provide feedback on your workflow, co-workers were there to be supportive and work as a team. Personally, I think the the hardest part of the job was seeing customers that I have known and develop relationships with pass away. With that being said the most enjoyable part of this job for me was getting to know and help customers on a one to one basis and interact with them on a daily basis."
good,The people i worked with we're nice and easy to work with.I really liked that the people i worked for we're very helpful. I wouldn't mind working here as long as i can as long it's more than 30.hrs plus per week.
good,I really enjoy working at Rite Aid. I enjoyed working with my managers and co workers and meeting new people every day. Management was very understanding.
good,"My experience with this job was pretty good, a lot of regulars which made the job fun, but the management always had their own job duties that would make the shift easier to finish task."
good,"rite aid had more than just work. they allow you to come back and enjoy all the activities such as family fun day,fund raisers ect."
good,"it was fine no problems. management were very professional."
good,"It was mostly a fun, fast paced work day. I enjoyed working for RA, and would most likely work for them again in the future. I always got my tasked done and if help was needed, I always got the proper help for the task at hand."
good,Daily grind of customer service with patients. Same routine as any customer service position with the add bonus of pushing vaccines.
good,Rite Aid as a company it an ok place to work.  I learned that sometimes the people you work with may turn out to play a negative part in your job
good,"It was my first job so I was excited. Didn't like the fact that she cut only my hours and everybody else was getting more hours, just don't"
good,"A typical day at work would be greeting costumers and checking them out at the cash register. I learned how to work as a team, use the register, and help costumers in the store. My co-workers were very nice and if I had the opportunity to work with them again I would. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude costumers, but I always came out of the situation with a smile on my face and not giving attitude back. The most enjoyable part was helping my costumers."
good,"love the job and care very much about the work as well as the patient"
good,"A typical day at work I am self motivated to get things started and doing it with grace. I learn everyday how to communicate in new ways and how to perfect my duty in each transaction. The way things are managed are that duties are to be fulfilled. My co - workers believe in team work. The hardest part of the job is doing a task that i haven't been trained on. I enjoy working with customers and providing good services, as they leave and walk in with a smile on their faces."
good,The cashier stays at the register and the manager of the day is on the floor taking care of everything else.  but the benefits are good
good,probably the worst part is customer service along with a side order of bad management. the only good thing is a flexible work schedule
good,If you have ever worked in a large chain pharmacy of any brand you pretty much get the same thing here at Rite Aid.  It offers everything most chains and perhaps 1% more of something else.
good,"had a good time here, everyday had something different to do, got along well with management and co-workers, only downside we got the delivery truck at 3:00 am."
good,it was a fun work place got along great with all my coworkers very supportive when it came to work when I needed help with something or a day off for a doctors appointment. All about the customers at this job and that's what its all about making people happy.
good,"Mediocre. Advancement is possible, but hours are unpredictable. Not the best position for those who want to spend time with their family."
good,"check the cooler, fill the cooler, make the store look nice, do my instruction list, straighten the store, and run the cashier machine."
good,I loved working for Rite Aid. Very understanding and lenient company and the people are usually nice. My co-workers were fun and helpful. We were very close.
good,A typical day at Rite aid was making sure the store is cleaned up very good. My co workers were fun to work with and making sure the customers are taking care of was the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,"was a good work experience, great co workers and clean store did it for about 2 years and good tme at work etc etc etc etc ec etc etc etc"
good,"Great place to work."
good,I have learned how to work with all types of people. I am a great sales person. The hardest part of my job is not getting 40 hrs and the pay rate. I love about my job is im able to meet all different types of people on a daily bases
good,Place has set goals but lacks management leadership. Place has great staff but expected to do a lot of work outside of job description
good,"Nice place to work, decent atmosphere. good benefits. Immediate pharmacy supervisor not very people friendly. Poor human relations skills with customers explaining insurance rules which caused problems for everyone else defusing irate customers. Retail Management was great."
good,Management is descent and the workplace overall is pretty fun. The only thing I don't like about Rite Aid is the Job Security that's it/
good,Best place to interact with people and create connections with customers. There is so much to learn and great work flow.
good,"I love working with the patients and enjoy seeing them when they come in to pick up their medications!"
good,"Cashiering, stocking, customer service, cleaning were my daily routine at work. I got along great with my boss and co-worker; management was hectic occasionally and unorganized."
good,"I worked the night shifts from 11pm-7:30am. a typical day of work includes helping bring in totes off the trucks and into the storefront. Next, opening the totes and placing items on the correct area of the shelves in their respective aisles.Great people to work with in the environment and excellent management team"
good,"A typical work day would consist of interacting with people to meet their needs, putting away inventory(stocking), answering and transferring calls and making and promoting sales. I've learned how to operate our spa gun in order to process transfers,recalls,and damage out inventory within the store.Management varies being that we have a high turn over rate. I've had three general mangers since I've worked at Rite Aid, so I am well able to adapt to change within the workplace. I work well with co-workers,though there are problems with teamwork on the job. I don't allow others  to effect my work ethics.The hardest part of work would be getting paid less than what you offer the company. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help and assist people."
good,"I enjoyed the day to day interaction with associates and with the general public. However, I grew tired of regulations on business as well as retail in general."
good,Great company to work for! The people are friendly and very helpful in helping you move up within the company.I have been working there since 2014 and it is one of the best companies I have worked for.
good,productive experience helping those in need. but I would not recommend this job to anyone unless they genuinely enjoyed the works of a pharmacy technician
good,"Stressful enviroment, no time to balance home life and work life. Does have job security though. Not enough about the assocites. All about customers and making profit."
good,A typical day at Rite Aid for me is conducting Audits and Hazmat in a retail establishment. Some management is ok to work with however you have others that are just shift supervisor who wants to be the captain. The hardest part of my job is being in compliance at all times. The enjoyable part of my job is being up to date with hazmat.
good,"When I worked at Rite Aid, we were an extremely busy pharmacy. "
good,"when I worked there people were always goofing around and didn't take stuff seriously, they would make gross comments and noises  and had many complaints from the customer about it. it gets very busy and usually there are only one - two cashiers at a time. there really is nothing hard about it. everything is really easy to do."
good,The work wasn't especially hard for the most part. My coworkers were great so it wasn't bad working there. I enjoyed the customers I met. Everyone was so friendly. The hardest part of the job was not having enough workers. I enjoyed the time I was there and the people I met.

good,"Nice to work with and talk to the customers that have been a part of Rite Aid for a long time."
good,"This place was ok to work, but you're not paid enough for all the hardwork you do. I can say that it's not a place that I would like to work again."
good,This is just a job to help me get through college. I am very content with where I am at. I wish we closed on holidays.It makes life easier for those who have families in other cities.
good,If you have the right management team in place at the store then it would be a great place to work. the hardest day is truck day .
good,"Clock in and make sure all shelves were properly stocked. Dealt with customers looking for items on the shelves,counted my til before and after work. I enjoyed working with my fellow employees they always made work fun."
good,The customers are wonderful people. You run into a lot of great people. I have learned a lot but I think I could learn a lot more especially when I know there is more to be learned. A typical day is filled with meeting lots of people and also learning how to stay positive with some people who are having a bad day and take it out on you.
good,"Working at Rite Aid was fine. There are a lot of issues that prevent people from moving up in the company. I worked with a lot of people I liked, which is the only reason I liked working there. Outside of the friendly co-workers there were not many benefits to working for Rite Aid."
good,"can be a better company to work for, but too much favoritism. hourly at the pharmacy can improve. learn new techniques for insurance billing everyday."
good,"I did everything to run and maintain the store.  I hired, I fired, I ran a register, and everything else in between.  I did planograms.  I continually kept the place clean and well managed."
good,"•I finalize transactions on the cash register and provide customer service. "

good,A typical day at work woudl consist of me greating the customers and growing the business by helping the customers not only find products but get their immunization shots. The hardest part about the job was to get customers get the immunizations. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and helping the customers.
good,"This was a decent ""chain"" pharmacy  to work for, not crazy like most chains. Only thing the pay was not what it should have been."
good,"Open store and start performing morning activities like getting cash registers ready, taking care of product, taking care of pharmacy, and retail truck, ect. I did learn to be better at customer relation and helping in finding out and fixing a customers  problems, Management i felt was somewhat lacking in that i wasnt able to move on due to the management not wanting to give up any responsibility to let me move forward. My coworkers were fine, i could trust them to do there job in general. The hardest part was dealing with an irate customer who no matter what is going to listen to any thing could tell them. the customer and my coworkers were the most enjoyable part of the jobl"
good,"Very friendly and hardworking coworkers. Sometimes unorganized expectations from corporate. Pretty empty, not many customers."
good,Was a low paid supervisor for over a year and was treated with worst shifts. Never got time off and rarely got requests off.
good,"Friendly pharmacists and dedicated technicians keep the patients coming back. Techs seem very approachable in regards to training new hires and provide proper pharmaceutical education for techs useful for studying for their PTCBs,"
good,"I learned how to be able to fully help my customers."
good,"Rite Aid is a company on the move and growing, its a fun place to work and they expect more and more out of the employees. Its difficult to get promotions as they tend to hire outside the company for those."
good,Nice work environment.  They really allow you to practice your profession.  Management was good here. My workload wasn't overbearing and I had a great supporting staff.  Only moved on because the salary was less than some of their competitors.
good,"I for the most part enjoyed working for Rite Aid with the fellow worker, but the management had misplaced priorities and didn't care for the employees.  I was totally utilized for something other than what I was trained for, a Pharmacy Technician, and was utilized more for a retail clerk than a technician.  My skills were not utilized at all when I worked there and I felt not appreciated for those skills.  My customer service skills were more utilized than my technical skills."
good,Great people to work with learned a lot of how to run a business and gained management skills. Once again worked with customers and clients to learn how to resolve problems and enjoy the rewards.
good,Customer Service oriented pharmacy where the customer is the most important aspect of the pharmacy enviroment.  Very detail oreinted and multitasking; inventory concious entity.
good,"My typical day at work consisted of transfers, ordering products, re-calls, working with customers, price changes, checking for product freshness, and planograms . The hardest part of the job was the truck day, where new products were shipped to the store and we had to get them on the shelves as quickly as possible. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team. My co-workers were wonderful individuals."
good,"not enough help, and unrealistic targets. always hard pressed to deliver things in the stipulated time."
good,Receiving stock items and shipping items orders to stores.  Inventory stocked items for reordering.  Pricing items for store.
good,"Union job that schedules based on seniority. Worked fairly well with school schedule. Not much of a challenge, I liked just being an associate with very little responsibility while going to school. Union pay scale pays better than minimum wage, with steady raises based on hours worked."
good,"Fill prescriptions, customer care, team work environment"
good,Rite aid has much work to be done when it comes to culture.  Associates are not respected by middle and upper management. Compensation for field associates is not as good as you would expect
good,"I work the cash register, help customers in photo department and I scoop ice cream"
good,Upper Mangement was not helpful.  The company does not seem to care about wellfare of staff.  Only care about cutting staff hours an bottom line.
good,I did not care for working in retail. And big corporations with millions seem to under staff there stores. I found it hard to get back up when it would be the busies time of the day.
good,"A typical day at work would be.  I come in we prepare the pharmacy for the day. We retrieve all script refill put in the nite before we print paper work, pull drug,s count, label, and, send to the pharmacist for final check. We proceed taking in prescription form patient throughout the day cashing out patients calling  patient reminding prescriptions need to be picked up. as our day comes to a close we wrap up but restocking and ordering inventory and returning stock from will call."
good,"I've worked in all in-store departments at this company.  Seems easy from the outside, but it's hard work.  Between putting up product, dealing with customers, inventory etc...you stay busy...which helps the day go by.  Upper management is disconnected from the store associates.  They make changes and you don't know until it happens.  They put alot of stress on store managers who in turn pass it down to the lower level employees. But the same can be said about anywhere.  Once you get the hang of things you are able to deal with the day to day antics."
good,"A typical day at work would be setting display and interacting with customers through the day. Stock and promoting new merchandise; helping each other. I have learned to work and fond a bond over the two and a half years of working there. The hardest part of the job was getting recognize for the hard work that you put in. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting an award for the ""Most Checking for ID"" and a gift card from the manager."

good,It is a fast pace you have to willing to learn some things fast
good,A typical day on the job would be a few hours on the register and organizing the front end and rest of the day spent organizing the rest of the store while another associate covers you on the register. Always staying on top of price tags on all merchandise. I learned how to work better with customers and understanding to meet their needs to achieve perfect customer service. Co workers are always there to help when you need it and always available. hardest part of the job would be shipment days because we get very busy with customers meanwhile putting all new merchandise away. most enjoyable part of the job is all the customers you get to meet and see every day.

good,Very nice customers. Management was nice. Staff cared about personal life. Work good hours. Worked around school schedule.
good,"it was ok. did inventory management, bank deposits, unloaded new inventory bi-weekly."
good,"It was my first job. Being new at any workplace is nerve wrecking. You want to do good but at the same time, you're never trained. I was only trained through a computer, the only hands on approach I had was a few hours. Overall it was an experience that I do not want to do again."
good,"While Rite Aid paid my gas bills throughout high school, I cannot say much else about the corporate company. Little respect for employees and pay and benefits were insulting. As soon as I graduated, I looked for employment elsewhere."
good,I already reviewed this company.  Awesome company awesome people great benifits
good,"A good atmosphere under the right manager."
good,"Most days can be stressful when the manager is around but for the most part, work isn't bad. Most coworkers work together, others don't take responsibility for their part of the job and blame others for their own wrongdoings. Co-manager makes work feel more easy-going by helping out more than most of the management."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of assisting many customers, straightening up aisles and carefully operating a cash register. I got along very well with my co workers and managers, closer with my managers because I worked with them more often than I did with my other coworkers. The hardest part of that job was the photo lab feature which I was not familiar with and didn't deal with often enough to become extremely comfortable with the machinery. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team work atmosphere."
good,My co-workers were fun and very helpful. I have learned how to be patient and humble during my time at this company.
good,"Order, banking, stocking, cleaning and cashier. how to be calm with tough customers. management was great! the bad area when I had to close at night. Love most of my customers."
good,"I think it needs a lot of improvement, its an average company to work for. They don't offer a lot of opportunities to grow."
good,was the front end supervisor for all cashiers. helped and solved customer's questions.
good,"There are some great employees working at Rite Aid, have made many friends.  I have learned many things over the 10 years that I have worked there.  There are some great managers within the organization and there are those that will do anything to get ahead in the company.  It is easy to be disillusioned with the organization when you have to deal with a manager that does not know how to manage but bark orders and expect them to be met, no questions asked.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with the issues that arise from non-communication with managers and associates."
good,management was a 3 out of 5 not to bad but not to good either a typical day at work would be helping customers all day doing tasks that the supervisors didn't want to do and greeting customers
good,self-explanatory if you've worked in retail before. nothing spectcular
good,"My typical day at work is to provide excellent customer service, cashier, and on different occasions stock and build displays."
good,"Gives you full time hours, my co-workers were fun to work with, I learned how to use their registers. The most enjoyable part of the job was having funny co workers to lighten up my day. Management was okay to get along with."
good,"Dealt more with third party agencies and billing. "
good,"*The day starts by reviewing the sales and performance of the store the previous day.  Create an action plan for the employees to follow the rest of the day.  Take care of customers and Employees."
good,"Typical day at work involves general running of the store, taking in vendor orders, customer service, managing tasks. I've learned a good deal of patience from training new employees and handling delicate customer service issues. Immediate management and co-workers are wonderful colleagues however, as a whole the company is not very welcoming to employees. Hardest part of the job is the monotony, most enjoyable part is collaborating with my co-workers to finish tasks."
good,"After establishing a routine, work was fine. Management was great at the location I worked."
good,"It was a job, that held me while I was in college. The customer interaction was nice. But, it isn't a career move."
good,Push sales for baby dept merchandise. Helped customers load merchandise

good,"fine place to work"
good,I have only been working at Rite Aid for a short time  but I like it so far. I appreciate it as a part time job.
good,Rite Aid Pharmacy is always changing up the game plan to try to be on top of the pharmacy chain. A day in the life of a Rite Aid employee is hectic stressful and enjoyable if you have a fun hardworking group of coworkers.  The hardest part of working at Rite Aid as well as any customer friendly establishment would be disgruntle customers.  Because i love working with people the best part of my day is when helping a customer goes smoothly everything is in stock and they leave happier than when they came in.
good,"As an Asset Protection Agent with Rite Aid, I was required to walk around for my 8 hour shift to prevent/deter theft.  We were not trained on register or in any other area of the store.  I worked closely with the store manager and with her consent took it upon myself to get involved in many inventory processes that lead to bringing the known theft from roughly $8,500 to $4,700 in my 5 months at this location.  I learned a lot about external theft.  My store manager was extremely helpful and engaging but she was not my boss.  My boss was difficult to get in touch with, did not respond to e-mails most of the time, and when I sent my letter of resignation due to an out of state move (1 months notice) I never heard from him again.  The hardest part of the job was not having all of the proper tools I needed to do my job and having people wanting me to do things differently than policy states.  The most enjoyable part of the job was engaging the customers, making a difference in the inventory, and working with the pharmacy manager who was amazing.  I would work at Rite Aid again if I knew I could change some procedures in the company."
good,"Fine job if you are where you want to be, The advancement in my experience is limited and sometimes there is a struggle to reconcile what has to be done with what they want to be done"
good,although the pay is not the best. the people are great and the job is rewarding.
good,"Everyday was different, different customers. Learned how different medicines were used and what the were used for. I had great managers and co-workers."
good,This wasn't a bad place to work but had issues with managers. The co workers were a good bunch to be with once you got to know them.  A day was typical of performing sales transactions and assisting in the photo department and helping customers find their items in the store.  Its a good starting job for teens and college students getting their feet wet in customer service and job oriented lifestyle.
good,good job but not place to advance...and was on a progress or time per piece which I did keep up. lots of overtime but do not ever say you need help. I had people who disappeared or let go quick for asking.
good,"Working at Rite Aid has been beneficial as I have gained experience in the pharmacy field."
good,"A typical work day at Rite aid is a very high energy fast paced , but very friendly at the same time its a place where everyone knows everyone.. My current coworkers are very friendly fells like I'm apart of a team. They're very helpful. The hardest part of the job would be all the multi tasking of the job, it's not for everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be helping the customers nothing better then helping people get what they need..."
good,"cashiering, inventory customer service How to assist managing a store,people great, taging for new start of sales.  Customers compliments"

good,"good"
good,Maintaining a store environment that is a pleasant experience for customers by managing many employees at once.
good,"this was not bad for a first job straight out of high school. a typical day would be taking care of customers at the register while maintaining store appearance. i found myself unhappy working the front end so i was offered to work in the pharmacy area. it was easier to manage, the clientele was friendlier, and it was more peaceful. i decided to leave this job after getting a better opportunity at 48 hrs video."
good,"its a very busy place to work , you work under a lot of pressure but the good thing is i have a very helpful co-workers and a great manager which was the enjoyable part of the work ....... i learned a lot about the laws and the regulations for Rx process in the united state ....."
good,I come in and make sure my work space is clean and has no defects while the head pharmacist looks over his\her orders.

good,At Rite Aid I learned how to handle money in many different ways such as debit/ credit and western union. The management at Rite Aid sucked but my co-workers were awesome. The hardest part of my job was doing stock  inventory and the  best part of my job was going home.
good,Rite Aid and other big box retail pharmacy chains are a good place for someone who in just learning the pharmacy technician trade to learn.  It can be very hectic and a lot of times you can find yourself with lots of problems and no one to turn to for help.  If you are good and learning stuff on your own and not needing to be spoon fed everything then this could be a good fit for you to step up to working as a tech or certified tech elsewhere but I don't recommend working at a store like this is a career.
good,"Open or close the store, count tills, do a deposit, order milk, help customers, ring a register, superior customer service, planograms, freshness, damages, unload truck, put truck away, face the store, get change, and do endcaps."

good,A typical day consisted of mostly ringing up customers at the cash registers and attending to customers' needs. I learned how to handle myself in various situations when dealing with friendly and not so friendly customers alike. My co-workers ranged in age which helped me to feel like more of an adult with this being my first serious job. The hardest part of the job was obviously dealing with the various disgruntled customers both regular and spontaneous. Though the most enjoyable part was building a pleasant and lasting reputation with the many customers that visited on a regular basis.
good,When I first started I had a great time and the management was awesome. But as changes were made the inexperience if the new management made things difficult to learn and grow.
good,"I don't always like how we are treated as employees. The benefits aren't that great. But there are always hours available if needed, even at other stores."

good,"Typical day at work starts first thing in the morning. I clear out the scripts that were recorded during non-business hours and doctor scripts faxed over during that period as well. I make sure the pill counting robot is functioning correctly and help any customers that come to the counter. Depending on the time of year I will organize scripts for flu or shingles shots of patients coming into the pharmacy through out the day. I will answer the phones and receive calls from patients, doctors offices, and insurances companies. I usually have to make a handful of calls to insurance companies to verify a claim or to have question answered, I also will call doctors offices if there is an error on a script that needs to be clarified. I will also help customers if they need help finding something, and answer any questions I can (legally), if the customer has a question pertaining to medication I will get the pharmacist for them.  I take in scripts dropped off by patients and fill them according to wait time. I record control substances used in a log book as they are used. On Wednesdays we have truck day.

The most difficult days were when I needed to stock shelves, wait on customers, and process film all at the exact same time."
good,Fast paced community with a high demand. Great PIC. easy going coworkers.
good,The culture and values of Rite Aid are fair. Its management is ok. My co workers are wonderful. I've learned so much about customer service working at Rite Aid
good,There isn't much do which can make it boring however that makes the job easy.
good,It was a good experience learning how to conduct a cashier and also help customers while shopping t the retail company . Also providing discounts to satisfy the customer .
good,"A typical day is checking in vendors. Counting the tills. Doing the deposit and going to the bank for change. Take care of freshness (outdates.) Take care of overstock in the back room. Cycle count the inventory with the Symbol gun. Price changes weekly.Helping with the photo kiosk. Developing 35mm film. Fixing any of the store equipment when it would break down. "
good,I went there when a management team was absent and i worked on their in new environment i felt like i belonged to that store a while when found most of the customer call me by name. 
good,"Pros:"
good,"The company does a fine job of providing its pharmacy teams with the knowledge and resources they need to perform their duties successfully.  There is, however, not enough support for the top performers who would like to advance their careers.  As a result I feel ""trapped"" in the store"
good,Good steady job with good benefits.  The crew I worked with was efficient and I was able to learn a lot.
good,"It was an externship for my Pharmacy Tech program. I loved the hands on experience, but I wish it lasted longer. Also I wish the staff could of been a little more helpful during my stay."
good,have been working wit rite there were a lot of challenges or people that would like to challenge u I learned by working for this company how to keep a positive attitude even at times it was hard. being a manger was very challenging because it seems as if u had to be there to answer every question or solve every problem. the hardest part of the job would be having to deal with rudely customer that likes to push your buttons but at the same time its all bout holding your composer. co-workers some were good to get along with an some were very hard to get along with but at the end of the day there is a job that has to be done. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with the customers an helping them with whatever it was that they needed to keep them coming back to your business.
good,Duties include cashier and stock. Provided great customer service and made the check out process of products as smooth as possible.
good,"Overall, my time here was good.  I worked with some people who were hard to work with and get along with and the company had some policies and procedures that I was not fond of, but most of the time my managers were good and worked around my school schedule."
good,"A normal day includes inventory tasks, restocking shelves, rearranging displays, running cash registers, counting down the drawers and completing the nightly deposit. Most of what I do was learned on the job."
good,"Typical Large Chain Drug Store with high volume of prescriptions and very little help. Long hours (as long as 14 hour shifts) and almost no break. Better than some of its competitors , but still wears on its employees eventually."
good,"Rite Aid lives by the motto: ""The beating stops when the moral improves""."
good,"My duties included filling prescriptions, answering phones, and assisting customers. Management was great, but unfortunately, there was not room for advancement. The staff was unpleasant and generally unhappy, which made for a long and stressful day. "
good,Rite Aid phamrmacy is a fast place envirnment you have to be on your toes and make sure that everything is done in an time frame.  Greeting customers with a smile and make sure that they have everything that they need before leaving the store. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy patients whiether it was over there prescribtions or they were taking their bad day out on you.  The most enjoyable part was meeting people and they still know who you are even thought I'm no longer working there to this day.
good,"A typical day at work is usually very busy and fast-paced. I am responsible for data entry of prescriptions, answering the telephone, ringing up customers using the drive-thru and inside, and assisting the Pharmacist with anything they might need help with. Overall, I have learned how to become very aware of my work and my skills have improved over the last 3 years where it lead to a promotion of becoming Lead Pharmacy Technician. My co-workers think very highly of me and we all help each other on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job is working at a place where we are under-staffed, but I have learned to manage. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that doing a simple task can make a big difference in someone else's life."
good,I learned a great deal about customer service under a few great Managers but most of the Upper Echelon management were not particularly in touch with how to run the store efficiently.   
good,"typical day at work is helping customers, filling prescriptions, doing ten key, skills have enhanced, enjoy working with co-workers, working with insurance company, working with the customers."
good,"Productive work environment, not too mch time for personal life. but what else is common in retail...."
good,"Overall it was a good experience, I did alot of manual labor such as stocking, cleaning, disposing of trash, recycling bottles, using a bale to crush empty boxes and also alot of cashier work. Some days were busier than others."
good,"This job was excellent first job. Learned organization, multitasking, customer service, order merchandise. "
good,"good starter job, good for a part time if you like to work when you can."
good,"One of the busiest stores i've worked at, everybody I worked with is very nice and easy to get along, the pharmacist is very knowledable."
good,a typical day is usally full of laughs from customers
good,"Open and or close store,value of customer service,followed directives from district manager,open door policy for employees to help them with training and problems,finding the right people for the job,satisfying customers."
good,"Filling prescriptions, counting, labeling, insurance problems, Love the feeling that your helping people out with medicine. Love my job overall."
good,Worked in their warehouse in a team of 4 internal auditor interns. The work force is not very supportive for interns.
good,"I've learned how to become a better leader and manager at Rite Aid Pharmacy. A typical day at work involves opening the store, preparing the daily deposit, logging on all the registers for when the store opens, and making the sure store in good clean condition for opening. After all of that is done the daily routine, which is completing the pull report, freshness report, zeros, and straightening, is done. Throughout the day plan-o-grams, price changes, resets, and recalls are done as well. The co-workers are different, helpful and can be like a family. Management is helpful and set a great example of how Rite Aid should be ran on a daily."
good,"like working here. good place to start off with your life. great company, they really love they workers"
good,"I enjoyed interacting with customers on a daily basis. I learned how to operate a register, Telzon gun, multi-line telephone, and how to give excellent customer service. I got along very well with co-workers and management. The most difficult part of the job was cleaning the bathrooms after a customer deliberately destroyed it."
good,"Handling cash , filling prescriptions, and customer service. You learn to multi-task."
good,Rite Aid Pharmacy is a good place to work. I enjoyed my stay with the company. The only problem there is that no lunch break for the Pharmacists. You eat as you work. The store is not closed for lunch. But I got used to it and I did function well in that situation. I could get the lunch break but work piles up especially if not enough help.
good,I love the team I work with but unfortunately I am not paid fairly for the work I do and after a year of being there I have still not gotten the $3/hour raise I was promised when I was hired. I was a nationally certified pharmacy tech when I was hired and then Rite Aid made me take their certification course and I was told repeatedly by many different people that I would receive a significant increase in pay once it was complete. I completed the course in October 2012 and it is now March 2013 and I have not received any increase in pay. I have told my immediate boss that I have to find a new job and he is doing all he can to try to get me the money I was promised because he does not want to lose me but unfortunately his hands are tied. I have read some other reviews of Rite Aid online and it seems this is a recurring theme. It is unfortunate that they are more worried about the corporate bottom line than actually keeping good employees.
good,"Everyday at work, I count and validate our deposit. I count and validate the cash drawers and safe before and after my shift! The hardest part of my job is the drive to get there. The most enjoyable part is being able to satisfy my customers. My co-workers are excellent and always stay on task."
good,"There was always something to do on a daily basis. There were many busy days and it was very difficult on days when we were understaffed. Most customers were hard to handle but we always stuck to the rules. The managers were great and followed procedure and assisted customers above and beyond what was required. It is a lot of hard work and there were customers that preferred not to cooperate and gave us a hard time. The hardest part of the job was remaining patient with difficult customers especially on understaffed days and the pay was pretty low. Hours were shortened for a few months out of the year as well. Despite those moments, I learned a lot about different medicines and how to run the pharmacy and about customer service."
good,Most of the people I worked with were friendly the benefits were ok pay could be better store was generally clean.
good,"Rite Aid is a very good organization that went through some tough times in 1999. Wall Street has never forgiven them for the acts of a few tainted executives. 80,000 people still trying to do great things in a tough market. Retail pharmacy has been pressured by very tight margins and excessive costs. The Retail Industry has seen some very challenging years, much in part due to the excessive cost of brick and mortar properties along with rising labor costs. Government pharmacy programs have been cut back over the years. All in all, I would welcome the opportunity to work at Rite Aid again, if compensation was competitive with the market for similar jobs."
good,I loved being a union member. If able to work for the company in the future I definitely will.
good,Love the experience.. I learned a lot of medical knowledge/
good,Stocking shelves and working the cash register. Low stress but expected low pay as well. Managers were good and personable and listened to problems. Co-workers ran the gamut from professional to less professional. No one area stood out as particularly hard. Some customers and co-workers made day pass by quickly.
good,"My day consisted on having a heart attack from upper management expecting perfection. The constant bombardment of nasty customers was also a nice touch. Also, having to give people breaks and lunches during the busiest parts of the night from being understaffed was just amazing. From what was expected, the pay was not reasonable. The best part of the job were my friendly co-workers and when I got out of work (usually about two hours after I was supposed to get off due to the store having to be ""perfect""). Upper management finds everyone under them easily replaceable and worthless, even those working there for years. If it wasn't for the union, many would have been let go for not making the store perfect. All in all it was hard work for horrible pay."
good,"The Rite Aid I worked at was a good company, but some of the staff was rude to work with. They had started me off at full time and moved me to 1 day a week without notice."
good,Nice company to work for as a beginner job. Descent pay for the amount of work required as well.
good,i Loved working with everyone there. Very fast paced area of the store to work in.
good,"I worked with some really great people, whom became more like family than co-workers."
good,I loved my job and the customers just not the inconsistent work load.
good,Very Hard work but rewarding knowing that your responsible for products making it to various rite aid stores throughout the western united states.
good,Rite Aid acquired Eckerd so I joined Rite aid as a pharmacist
good,"Working there was very sluggish. There is poor management, they ask you to do stuff that you were not told when hired. They do not have enough member coverage so they destroy your schedule a lot. Its not an ideal part time job."
good,"I worked for the company as a floater for over 9 years. Initially I was to float between 4 or 5 stores, but it ended up that I floated for the entire district, 25 or 30 stores. I was on occasion loaned to other districts that would require overnight stays up to a week at a time. As a single mother, when my son was younger, this was difficult. The most difficult part of the job was the length of the day, the shortest day being approximately 10 hours with the drive time, and the longest days were often 16 hours and MORE. The district went to Johnstown, Dubois, Uniontown, and often one day I would go one direction, and a totally different direction the next day. Also I never had a set schedule. I received my schedule 2 weeks at a time at the most, often one or two days before the start of the schedule. But because I covered emergencies, my schedule changed at the last minute. There were times I would be headed in one direction, driving for example to Derry and get a call while driving to head to Ebensberg instead. I worked the majority of weekends in the years for the company. It was rarely possible for me to make social plans and be able to keep them, even during the week. The schedule was never such that I had the same days off each week. The most enjoyable part was that somehow, the company managed to hire warm, caring, friendly employees, and I cared for them all very much."
good,Each employee has a decent amount of respect for one another.
good,"I had the pleasure and opportunity of working at numerous stores. I enjoyed each and every day so very much. I loved the challenges, the obstacles and the opportunity to help someone during their time of need."
good,they pay you what you are suppose to get paid. They dont pay according to what you work.
good,"Fun place to work, emphasis on speed and accuracy. This job helped me learn both skill sets. Compensation was lacking."
good,Normally work with one other shift supervisor.Good pay. The hardest part of the job is keeping busy because it's an incredibly slow job.
good,"Opening making deposit, putting out registers for the day. I check in vendors, check outdates. Put up stock. Check emails, work on todo list.keep store straight and cleaned, reconcile registers at the end of night."
good,"my co workers were nice, very high volume of people that shop there"
good,Working at Rite Aid I was always meeting new customers. I enjoyed interacting with the customers as well as staff.
good,Be prepared to work with little or no staff. You will probably be the only cashier on a shift. If you are management you will probably work a shift without a cashier.
good,"A typical day for me involved helping customers find the products they needed and informing them of what the product does, and any sales that could exist. Also unloading delivery trucks, working the cash register, and organizing the store. Other duties included cleaning the store, the stock room, and processing money and coupons at the end of the day. Once in awhile I would also cover as a pharmacy technician if the normal pharmacy technician was not available."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was working with the cashiers. This store was always very busy and very understaffed. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck.
good,"With Rite Aid you are a team player. The many programs that they offer revolves around the Pharmacy. Daily chores include cash handling, stock counts, survey's, product cut-in's or total resets of planograms, customer service. As a member of management you are also expected to maintain the work environment, answer many calls and solve problems with electronic equipment and of course customers. The job that I had was not hard, just frantic most of the time. Not a position for someone who cannot multi-task. I did love the interaction with the regular customers."
good,Working at Rite-Aid has giving me a more open opportunty when it comes to customer service. being in a place a work in that field you're always working with the public. it's a non stop customer service business. The almost hardest part of the job is once a week when we received truck and stocking my shelves. I been working there for 3 years now and i've grown in the company starting off as a cashier and working my way to become a shift manager. i've learned so much about myself while working there. for example my attitude changed alot. im more open when it comes to speaking to customers. and i've learned how to cope the rudness of each and ever customer. The thing i enjoy the most in this company is the staff i work with. they give me a reason to want to wake up and go to work every morning.
good,"Customer & co-workers were great, met alot of wonderful people. Learned how to treat people with respect."
good,I was a cashier. Not really much to say about that. the job was for some money while I was in highschool.
good,"Enjoyed the staff, but a hard store to work at, due to many summer vacationers and reduced hours for help. Also was traveling an hour & 20 minutes one way."
good,"I was promoted to store manager after a month in training,but was transferred 7 times during my employment with out ever receiving the raise from trainee to store manager."
good,i loved working there because i worked with people i hung out with i had a child and still managed to take care of my son and go out occassionally. the management team was worth working for and the most enjoyable momentwas working with people whom i had known
good,"A typical day at work at Rite Aide consist of handling money, light cleaning behind counter, organizing lines when line would get over crowded. Management was unreliable, picked favorites and treated many good employees badly. Co-workers got along nicely and never presented themselves as unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was ensuring reasonable working hours."
good,As a LPA I enjoy investigating internal and external theft.
good,"If you leave out the front end of the store and just focus on the pharmacy department, it was always a pleasure to be at work. I learned how mean and immature some people can be even though they are supposedly adults. My co-workers in the pharmacy were fabulous and most of the co-workers from the front end were awesome too, but some were just mean people. The hardest parts of the job were trying to explain to some customers how their insurance worked and the drama created by a couple of the front end employees. The most enjoyable parts of the job were working the pharmacy department and helping people."
good,"they have good benefits, health,life,dental,vision, and a 401k"
good,"An ordinary day at rite aid was very challenging. I worked as a closing manager and had a very set routine to get the job done. At the start of each shift I would have to verify the deposit and send it to the bank. Afterwards I would work on some projects for the day. This would include: merchandise product, organizing inventory and working inventory out on to the shelf. During this time I would also have to cover breaks and managing the cashiers with any help. I would also have to tend to the needs of the pharmacy and photo department as well. Everynight I would have to clean up the store and count up all of the registers. For the amount of work I was doing, I was getting very little respect or compensation. However, it was reliable work and it was too bad overall. There is really nothing that stands out in this company as a great or terrible place to work at. Slightly below average in the challenge level of the work and above average for the amount of work given to an associate."
good,"I worked part-time in a very fast paced environment, with inadequate number of employees to cover the volume of customers. I did learn to prepare prescriptions for customers, and how to successfully explain delays in fulfilling customer's requests for prescriptions."
good,In four years I gained vast knowledge and skill in the customer service field. I learned that hardwork and dedication can yield great results.The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers I deal with on a daily basis.I love coming to work and meeting new people and doing whatever I can to help them.
good,Management was helpful and co-workers were friendly and helpful. Learned about medications.
good,"Not the easiest compnay to work for, but I did stay there for 10 years and got the bills paid"
good,"I performed all the tasks that a pharmacist would do except for taking verbal prescriptions over the phone. I filled the prescriptions in the computer system, counted out medication, labled the medine bottles, and worked the cash register. I also took monthly logs of all of our controlled substances, and ordered medicines as needed."
good,This company was a nice place to work at. The employees were very close and made it feel like a home and family.
good,A typical day is from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. I will have processed approx 250 to 300 scripts. I make it a priority to treat each customer as they were a family member. I have great respect for my pharmacist and knowledge that i learn from him and will not turn down any challenge that i am faced with.I have a great store manager and can go to her for anything. co-workers are great we are like family. The hardest part of my job is making sure that each person that comes in no matter how busy we are; gets the personal attention that they need.The most enoyable part of the job is when customers call or come back and ask for me and want me to take care of their needs.
good,it was good and they were great with the customers
good,Today was a very fast pace day. I worked as the pharmacy cashier and i enjoy everyday i work with this company. My manager started off hard but we had to learn each other. Now hes a great teacher as well as other co workers at my work place. I love working with my customers including the one with nasty attitudes. I believe this job help strengthen me and the way i feel about people. This job makes me want to help people more each day. I have learned to work with a more positive attitude. I also learned how to work the computer systems when it come down to putting prescriptions in and typing the information in the computers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with insurance claims and the most easiest part is working with my coworkers.
good,it all depends where the rite aid is located. sometimes i didn't even get to go on break. not a fair business
good,"I've learned a lot at this job. I've learned how deal with customers on a day to day basis. The co-workers at this job help to make this job a very fun, and enjoyable job. We all work together to get different tasks done and make sure they're completed in a timely manner. The management team at the job also help to make sure the coworkers are comfortable and they treat everyone equally. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be learning new tasks day-to-day."
good,i loved going to work i like talking with the outside world. i learened alot that i nerver knew before like stocking doing paper work taking outdated stuff off shelves.
good,Manage store operations on a day-to-day basis. Good starting spot for retail oriented people
good,"Responsible for providing excellent customer service by assisting customers with their shopping needs, answering customer inquiries, and resolving customer complaints. Complete customer transactions on the cash register. Ensure the appearance of the store is pleasing to the customer. Stock store shelves and end-caps with merchandise when it is delivered to the store. Assist with the operation of the One-hour Photo Complete inventory counts and order merchandise based on the results. Additional tasks as assigned."
good,I had gauranteed hours and was able to be a self-starter. I gained most of my customer service experience working here.
good,"The company was great when I first begin to work for them. However, the company would not allow me to grow. I liked working for RiteAid but to move I could not move with this company. They felt as if women were incapable of doing the job that I was doing."
good,"good company, and ok pay, loved my co workers. i worked in the pharmacy and I love helping peolpe,other thing i do have to say about the company! is my manager was very rude to all her employees...Thats why im not there anymore."
good,"Rite aid was fun Didn't really work there for that long, Relocated."
good,"truely enjoy working with customers, and coworkers are extremely helpfull"
good,Great managers that provided great work ethic experience for me.
good,"I love what I do for my customers. I went through rite aids ptu program, overall is on ok company l. Just wish they appreciated what we do for our patients. I go above and beyond and dont feel appreciated for all that I do"
good,"Typical  retail environment , can be a fun place to work depending on the team you work with. Benefits are good when your a full time associate. It is nice to see customers and and be able to help them. The best day is freight day when you re-stock although totes are very heavy."
good,Folks there are nice and easy to work with. I did not get 40 hours of work each week. Some of the customers were difficult to work with because they wanted more than the laws allow.
good,I loved to interact with the customers. The management was very lenient & professional when it comes to serious moments. Also they made it possible to work around my schedule.
good,"It's retail, hard to find enough help that is willing to work.   Can be flexible if there is enough staff.  A lot depends on how much work the manager wants to do."
good,For several years the company has suffered and our position was never secure. Work environment it’s very Pleasant. Management listen to your opinion and upper management are open to suggestions from field technician
good,"In my time as a tech, I was on a roller coaster going from a great boss to a horrible boss to a great boss at the end. I enjoyed most of the other employees. The only big issue with working pharmacy is the lack of employees and constant turnover. You were always busy becuase you didn't have enough help."
good,"Gained many different job skills from working here to run the store efficiently, and answer customers questions about the products available in store."
good,It’s a nice place to work they just need to recognize people who really help out but it’s up to your managers to do that and they don’t only because they want it to seem as thou their doing it they also should do away with productive cause all zones pick differently and bring back leads for they know which pickers know how to pick fast and where to place them because the manager is in the office and not out on the floor a lot of times
good,"If you need experience working with customers this is a good place to be. They don't compensate their employees very well which hurts the workplace morale. Overall environment was good."
good,"Wasn't a great place to work, but it isn't terrible. They care about their employees, I once got sick at work at they did everything in their power to get me coverage and get me home. Not a great part of town, people stealing from the store all the time. Also open unnecessarily late for Christmas time."
good,"A typical day at Rite Aid was slow, but productive. We always got our work done. I enjoyed the management I was with and I learned how to deal with people and some things about HIPPAA."
good,"Management needs to improve, morale is very low. Co workers are very good. Benefits are very good. Corporate is very easy it get along with and helpful."
good,There was no typical day for management. Most of the time was spent working on inventory related duties or customer relations. Store was located in food desert neighborhood. The customers were happy to be able to shop locally without having to commute across town.
good,"stressful, management was horrible workplace culture was ok the hardest part of my job was to learning to work all station at one time and running the drive thru"
good,"Store manager was spiteful and vindictive but everyone else was good.The store was old but it was fine, it wasn't too busy. I liked all of middle management."
good,when I Started at Rite Aid it was my second job and it fit my daily schedule well cause I worked the night shift. after a while my cost of living went up so I had to leave cause the pay wasn't enough.
good,It's fast paced. Had to do so many things in a typical 9 hour shift. You have to receive product. Put the product away. Help both customers and patients.
good,"Without a team effort, working for Rite Aid can be difficult. Luckily, my experiences have been pleasant with the team I am currently apart of. Positivitity and cohesiveness is the only way to keep the environment professional and smooth running."
good,I worked in Pharmacy and front end as needed.  The hours were consistently established as part time so as to avoid having full time employees even though many worked 37.5 hours per week.
good,"slow paced work area, everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Great worth ethic with all the employees, and were very helpful and knowledgeable about product information and resources."
good,"Overall I enjoyed the atmosphere, working with the public and  employees, job description, and flexible hours. Enjoyed traveling and working at different locations."
good,"Nice place to work. "
good,Good place to gain experience and fair wages with benefits.  Not much room for growth and budget cuts are constantly occurring. Feel like corporate is not in touch with store needs and operations.
good,"Rite Aid Is an ok gig especially for starters or for anybody thats looking for something just for now sake, locations are conveint to get to and most stores are pretty busy so you'll get your hours"
good,Labor was a big issue with RA and they left Cincinnati. They did allow us to have autonomy but didn't support us with much technician help. We had some tech advances but could've used more.
good,There was not much work to be done and there were not many costomers.  I did a lot of four hour shifts and would usually have not much to do except face shelves and stocking and a few costomers to help.
good,Rite aide was a nice place to work the personal touch we added to get to know all of our regulars by first name making them feel like they are apart of the rite Aide family
good,"At a typical day at work, I've dealt with repetitive tasks that involved purchases and customers.  It could be information about an item, sales or even if it's locating an item.  I would always made sure that I got an accurate information for the customer."
good,Good place to work nice people grate teamwork lots of communication within one another time is great love the people and an amazing building for lunch breaks and all good management
good,"Receive prescriptions through various modes, transcribe, fill prescriptions, counsel, MTM, OTC sale, community visit, , immunize, unpaid corporate meetings on your day . Too many paperwork , minimal help. I loved my customers and a lot of them think the world of me."
good,"The rite aid t I worked at was professional, I was a Pharmacy tech and my managers were very understanding and professional. Only issue was the low pay. I personally drove nearly 25 minutes to get there, however it wasn't any trouble for me. "
good,"Being a co-manager at Rite Aid has been a very educational experience. A typical day at Rite Aid includes a great amount of customer service, cash handling, vendors, planograms, freshness reports, recalls, and even plenty of janitorial duties. I've learned so much from my years at Rite Aid, like how to deal with certain customer situations and how to never let a customer leave the store angry. I've learned how to adapt to working with difficult people and management. I've learned how to overcome working for poor managers and how to rise above and still be a successful co-manager. Rite Aid is a great company that pays me fairly to do the jobs I'm required to perform."
good,They really work with the hours that you can work but litttle to no job movement. The benefits were nice but other than that it’s just very stressful.
good,"Busy, but enjoyable day. Mostly understaffed which makes for a hard day's work as you have to man the telephone , drive through and fill and check prescriptions in order to stay on top of the work.  Most enjoyable part of the day is interacting with clients."
good,My only criticism was the pharmacy manager was very difficult to work with. Other than that it was a good experience. I enjoyed the customers I worked with. I also enjoyed the doing the flu clinics.
good,The staff I got to work with always kept me busy and always wanted to help me learn and help me out when I needed it. They were supportive and understanding.
good,My experience at Rite Aid was good. It is a decent place to work. The pay is a low compared to other Retail establishments. There are periods such as around inventory times that you work a lot and then other times when you work a pretty normal shift. The benefits for a health company were not good.
good,Days at Rite Aid are pretty much smooth and slow. I work on stocking or customer service on certain days. The store manager is very nice and flexible with hours and days to work. The workplace culture is family orientate and happy and work together. There is never really no hard parts of my job here. The most enjoyable is seeing customers satisfied and happy.
good,"There was nothing special nor dissatisfactory about the Sales Associate position. Some stores are better than others depending on your management. Corporate structure as a whole is fair and does above average training for retail. The part-time hours are staggered throughout the day and most Rite Aids are 24/7 so holidays are required. The skills gained from the job were minimal, but it was obviously not a career and just a position held while going through college."
good,"It was busy in the pharmacy, but working the front is unbearably slow with not a whole lot to do besides stock and clean."
good,"There were definitely good and bad things working for the corporation"
good,Most workers in stores want to succeed and advance with the company but corporate is ruining the work environment by limiting them to very few hours a week.
good,Managment teams are great. Working for the company was a great experience to get me prepared on what else is to come. I have been with the company for a while now and I still love it.
good,"Working for Rite Aid taught me the fundamentals of the working environment, how to be a leader, and follower. Typical day of work was stressful but always had fun and kept me motivated to try my best and learn everything I could in order to improve on my skills as a leader, merchandiser, and forward thinker. I always enjoyed walking out of a project knowing that the end result was part to do with my hard work."
good,"Provided a good atmosphere to work in, enjoyed my 20 years of service where I made valuable friends. At times Rite Aid lost its focus, not sure where you stood at times."
good,"The job requires a lot of upkeep and attention to datil with product always coming. New stuff all the time and rotating old product."
good,"As a shift supervisor, the standard retail experience is to be expected. If a problem with a customer comes about, it falls to you to figure it out. You deal with a lot of task management, making sure what work is supposed to be done gets finished, in addition to whatever outside influences might impact those goals (vendors, customers, field system support, ect). "
good,"they needed better security!!!!!"
good,"RiteAid had great opportunities if an employee wanted advancement, but because there were only 3-4 managers, time off was often split days and sometimes a weekend"
good,Rite is a very friendly and professional place to my patients are number one priority whether its be to fill a prescription or answering questions about over the counter medications or insurance i have many things here i have found the pharmacy for many patients can be stressful and even scary place i would think to think i make and enjoyable and comfortable place for them that is the most enjoyable part for me is being able  to get know my patients and putting my self in their so to speak because we al could  be a patient at anytime. The hardest part is that i cant make everyone happy but i try to help as much as i can. I believe Rite Aid gave me the confidence learn and grow.
good,"Rite Aid distribution is an easy going, yet active work environment which allows you to make some somewhat descent earnings  with easy yet psychical work. Management is pretty good but the work is boring but yet productive. Would rank Rite Aid as one of the better places to within the local area."
good,"Great first time job for those looking for some extra income. Often times there is lots to do with not enough time to do it all in, but management is often understanding."
good,"The managers that I had were very laid back and nice, but I know a lot of awful managers at the other stores. I worked at a high volume store so it was pretty busy but it wasn't that bad. Kinda bad hours only got 2-3 days a week, no opportunity for part time managers or shifts."
good,"There were 4 pharmacy managers in the three and a half years I worked there.  Great last one.  No paid sick days or holidays if you did not meet 40 hours per week. When my son was sick I had to take off and was not paid.  It lowered my hours.  So then I was not eligible for sick pay or holiday.  The insurance would be revoked if you went under 40 hours for a straight 3 months so I did not get insurance through the company. I opted to keep that money in my pocket instead of paying and be kicked off.  Therefore had no insurance.  You had to have 40 hours every week for three months  straight or the insurance was gone.  Then another 3 months of 40 hours for it to be reinstated. Terrible.  Needed the job and stayed as I knew I would be moving out of state and leaving the job within the next few years of being hired.  The manager of the store was rude, condescending, and just plain mean to the customers and employees.  One employee, who still could not understand the system completely, slowed down the technicians because we would have to stop what we were doing to assist her.  She just basically worked  the register.The employee was there before and after I Ieft.   Very frustrating.  Liked the work.  Gave me good experience for future employment.  The company should have paid for our licenses as the pay was low.  When a dress uniform was implemented they could have given us a stipend to pay for at least part of the cost of the new clothes."
good,Company is currently being reconstructed. It will probably have to be sold off to Albertson's for the remainder of the stores which weren't bought by Walgreens.
good,"I was the only full-time tech before I quit. Before taking the required courses I need to get certified I was told that I would get a $1 raise. Instead, I got a $0.20 raise. (ending salary in 2016 was $10.00/hr) I didn't feel like I was paid accordingly because I was literally doing a job for 2-3 people.I like fast-paced jobs but not when I'm not getting the valued amount. The only time work was a little easy was when the pharmacist helped out). I'm sure a lot might have changed since I left considering they're apart of Walgreens now."
good,"With the constant change in Management, reduction in benefits, hours/pay, lack of security and over job requirements (including heavy lifting, stocking of shelves and Lavatory maintenance) Rite Aid was at the time not a favorable place to be or work."
good,good people to work with take forever to get a management position
good,"This was an extra job. I worked full time next door. This job was very easy. I serviced a lot of the same clients I already knew.I checked people out and answered the phone. I had various other duties as needed, My customer were happy to me at the pharmacy as well."
good,"Interpret prescription from physicians, communicate with other healthcare professionals and patients, work with insurance companies. Work as a team to provide the best care for our patients as possible.  Counsel patients on necessary medications, while staying organizing and providing their medications within a timely manner."
good,Experienced managers have been passed over for better opportunities and promotions for people that have come from Target. Target experienced District and Regional management tend to recruit and promote exclusively people with the same background. Morale amongst managers from drug stores is extremely low.
good,"There isn't much to say about the work environment as it is like any other retail job. Much of how the day runs is reliant on the type of customers that come in. The management is wonderful and very accommodating, but overall, corporate doesn't provide any benefits to their part time workers and cashiers don't get full-time positions. It's a great job if you are up to multitasking and dealing with customers on a daily basis."
good,Pretty cool place to work. Work and life balance is good. Good for if you have kids. Pay not so great not really an advancement type of culture. Benefits for part time and full time
good,"a typical work day would start with me coming in did arming the alarm, logging on the registers , making and validating a deposit , counting the safe , doing the pull sheet report which is bringing anything that we sold the day before from the back overstock to the shelves in the store, then I would proceed to doing a  to-do list from the general or district manager. I learned a lot ab inventory and just everyday learning register work. the hardest part of the job for me was honestly dealing with irate customers. the most enjoyable par of my job was honestly my coworkers , a very motivating and learning enviorment"
good,Overall Rite Aid is a great place to work. The only negative thing is the pay and benefits. The only people who receive bonus are managers and they don’t allow you to receive overtime.
good,"Day was relaxed but accomplished "
good,"They do not hire ""Full Time"" unless you are in management. Part time means 7 hour shifts, 3 days a week. But the schedule changes every week so you're not able to have a second job under any circumstances and you cant live off minimum wage for 21 hours a week. They will not set a regular schedule so that you can have a second job. This job is good for students or people who still live with a parent or spouse... not for a single person supporting themselves. The work is easy enough (although I was told I would not have to come in at 2 am to work 'truck day' which involves moving a literal ton of boxes of store stock, and yet I was made to do this on 3 occasions, once even after closing the store the night prior). The management and others were great to work with (though they only have one cashier and one supervisor or mgr on each shift). The customers are sometimes frustrated by the computer system or the pharmacy, but generally good to deal with."
good,"My day started at 5 am  stayed very busy from the start "
good,Good pay but very long hours when you have a small child at home. You never know how many hours your shift will be until your already 2 or more hours into the shift.
good,"it was challenging because each day was different."
good,"work at rite-aid was ok  , slow at time you had to restock shelves and clean to store cleaning bathroom and store  not much to tell at store."
good,Rite aid is not a bad company to work for if you can follow basic instructions. Some of the sales expectations are ridiculous but you get past that.  Discount is fair but pay sucks.
good,"Although I love my job, it is getting increasingly more difficult to perform the duties expected of you with the amount and caliber of help you are given. Training is non significant for our technicians."
good,"Bad management. Not really anyone to talk to there. Its actually really boring. And its always just you up front and a manager in the back. They are very willing to let you go to the bathroom though. Sometimes I even got the chance to help in the Pharmacy. No benefits, and very little hours."
good,My biggest issue with Rite Aid is that there is not much room to move up in the company. My district manager doesn't seem to have much knowledge about how to actually run a Rite Aid and gets grumpy when you ask him any questions. If you do not get along with his favorite manager he will not like you.
good,Very fast-paced by then slowed down at certain parts of the day. Received training on many things while working here. Is ran by cegood management. Some co-workers help while others not so much. Working in a place where there is always stress and no sense of humor makes it hard to enjoy your day. Loved to see how patients reacted to all the hard work you would do for them.
good,Some days are great and you are always busy doing something and there are other days that there is nit much to do and you are trying to finds stuff to do to not get bored.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with regular customers who you really get to build a relationship with. "
good,"I was pharmacy tech for 10 years. I learned a lot and enjoyed it, however, they pay minimum wage. I left after school finished. It was nice being in the pharmacy, but I would have preferred better rate of pay; 8/ht is not enough to live off"
good,"I love my job as a community pharmacist.  My patients put a smile on my face when they come in for a visit.  I'm there for them for everything from a minor cold to a major post-op.  I became a part-time pharmacist 2 years ago due to the growing demand of family life.  (It can be really hard working 12-14 hours a day without a lunch break or any break.) Even though I still love my job, I don't like floating from store to store as a part-time pharmacist."
good,"I worked for Rite Aid many years ago, so things may have changed, but at that time, the company was very cheap.  Pay was low, raises were few and far between and non-perishable seasonal items were packed up and brought out the next year instead of being sold at a discount."
good,"Employees (certain) ones just stays to close to all management. Cig breaks together , lunch with management , laughing together only very get that privilege."
good,"I worked for Rite Aid for almost 10 years.  Disliked it after the first 2 years but tried to stick with it for advancement.  Stores have very low payroll.  Company has structure for job descriptions and responsibilities but is not followed.  Bonuses are almost impossible to receive.  I got one bonus in 10 years.  I left for a Store Manager position at Harbor Freight Tools, much younger company and has far more structure that is actually followed."
good,I learned a lot working at rite aid and i am very great full for that but you are over worked and under paid. turnaround was very high where I worked .
good,"Rite Aid is a good company to work for they do offer Health, Dental and Vision Insurance they also offer a 401k and life insurance. "
good,This job is very high demand but managers and coworkers are great to work with and very helpful. I learned new processes and became proficient in them. The hardest part was pharmacy scheduling but the most rewarding part was building relationships with a great set of people.
good,"I liked that the job was not difficult, and it was easy to pass time by always doing something. I liked that the regular customers were familiar and relatable people."
good,"Working at Rite Aid was a great learning experience. I enjoy working with the management staff and co-workers. Fast past job , Stress free environment ."
good,I am not happy with this company anymore.  They do not value their employees.  I have worked to this company for a very long time and it has changed so much that I no longer want to work for them.  Pay scale is terrible compared to other same type business.
good,"Rite-Aid paid the bills, but it wasn't much else. My biggest complaint was when management hired on new associates over preexisting associates at higher wages and better benefits. I wouldn't recommend working there for the long-haul."
good,"The hours are fine. however very little opportunities to advance. love everyone I come in contact with and got a great deal of customer service skills, small staff makes for work place hostility. there is no standard on how things should be run. I just want a more professional company."
good,Always met expectation my my parents is always good always there my attendance was spotless my attitude was excellent. Along with everybody and always met expectation and go beyond in above
good,"This job is not difficult. It is more on the slow paced side, and the environment is not too terrible. However with the managers there is a lot of favoritism and unfair treatment. Some will get punished for things that others would not be punished for."
good,"This is a good first job to get your feet yet. Most of the employees I worked with were great. My main problem is the scheduling. My Rite Aid is union so people with more time in get the best schedules even if they don't deserve it. Also since were union, forget about performance based raises. Even if your busting your butt to please every customer your only gonna a 25 cent raise twice a year."
good,"I temped there for only a short time but it was very nice.   The management was very nice and offices were good, good equipment and fun people to work with."
good,"Rite Aid is a typical corporate retail pharmacy.  Each individual pharmacies culture is slightly different based on the staff and what they make of it, but the general culture is corporate based.  Patient interaction is the best part of the job, that face-to-face time that allows you to cultivate relationships and provide ongoing counseling and advice."
good,I love working with customers on a day to day basis. I enjoy working with numbers so balancing lottery on the mornings I open the store is an Enjoyment.
good,"Upper Management disconnected with what really happens inside of ground-level stores. Plenty of demands without knowing how said demands will impact stores. When you succeed there is plenty of online ""congratulations"", no real incentives where it matters."
good,"the work load is stressful and constant from the moment we started work. they kept cutting the pharmacy tech help, so every minute was loaded with decision making and checking prescriptions, helping someone find the butt cream and giving a vaccination...."
good,"This was my first job and it was fine to start with. It was fairly boring at my store and there was a lot of theft issues, but overall, I am not too picky and it was only for a short time."
good,"The management had a very blatant case of favoritism and it was unfair to associates. Hard work delegating my associates, taking care of funds, making sure everyone was doing their required task"
good,"My coworkers were a joy to work with. After some time I realized that management lied about the potential to move up in the company. I noticed people were being promoted who really weren't qualified. Also the work became mundane and repetitive and found myself getting bored quickly. Overall I would recommend this company to anyone who needs a job, but I wouldn't recommend it for a career."
good,"Rite Aid is an okay company to work for. However, there is no room for advancement, and the pay is not near enough for what they expect their employees to do."
good,"My management was great but employees don't seem to be rated very important to the company itself. I enjoyed my co-workers and my manageagement, but they can only do so much for you. It seems impossible for them to fire people who aren't doing their job, so you have to overcompensate for a lacking team member without extra pay. There's a lot of uncertainty from Walgreens buying them out as well."
good,"Depending on which store you are at, you can either have an awesome job or a stressful one. I worked at three different stores and the culture/environment changes significantly. My home store was a balance between enjoyment and stress. You interact a lot with customers/patients and you really have a chance to help people out. On the other hand you are expected more responsibility for a smaller pay compared to a manager or administrator."
good,I loved the environment it was a daily joy to be there. If I was asked by any individual that has an interest to work there I would recommend it.The part of being​ with company was that it only had part time positions so no benefits.. Management was understanding and the pay was fair when I was there..
good,"I enjoyed working but our store in one of the busiest pharmacy in our district, and most of the time we are short of employees, and not able to finish all the work for the day and it's so stressful."
good,Stressful and overworked. Not easy to solve problems through management. Everyone is not treated equally. The employee turnover is too high. Not a lot of opportunities to progress.
good,"Been working at Rite Aid for over five years, and have an excellent store manager (the only reason I stay)  The work is very trivial and easy once you get the hang of multitasking.  Finding new employees at my store is next to impossible, and the help we do find is either garbage, or they quit after a short amount of time.  Compensation is atrocious, as I make minimum wage. (the menial raises I have gotten over the years were wiped away by the increase in minimum wage, and no further compensation was considered.  No motivation to go above and beyond with the horrible pay and high job expectations at times (1 person is expected to do 2-3 persons jobs)  No benefits for part timers.  Was offered a promotion, but even shift supervisors compensation is garbage, and the amount of expectations and bs is tripled.  No matter how long you have been with the company, you are still expected to ring on the register, and are treated as just a number.  Only stay because of great store manager, and my few friends that are left.  Need a real job soon though......"
good,I was looking for work and had no desire to work there permanently.  But I had an amazing manager. He really looked out for you if you were a good worker.
good,"Enjoy learning and having the opportunity to have hands on experience staff member was awesome and willing to work with you teaching new technique, very fast work environment"
good,"Hard work but fun "
good,Rite aide was a good place to work with advancement opportunities. Its a fast paced job which I enjoy because it makes the time go by faster. This job will definitely keep you moving!
good,A typical day as a cashier was just to stay in the front waiting for the customers and staying busy by stocking some of the shelves near by.    Management depends which store you are at.  Where I worked my manager tried really hard to have everyone productive but always fell short. All the employees were really friendly but the hardest part would have to be dealing with management.  It always seems like you are not working as hard as you can to anyone above you.
good,i have worked for two stores one which was ok (the 2nd one i worked for) however the 1st rite- aid i ever worked for my 1st official job sucked they were so racist and horrible
good,Very busy and productive environment. Goal and task oriented company. Customer service is a top priority. As going through the ranks of porter/cashier/key holder I learned a great deal. Such as handling the public and being able to defuse any situation that may arise. Co worker were hard working and make the job more enjoyable.
good,"There is always productivity in rite aid they're almost always work to be done. Dealing with a lot of different kinds of customers, putting away totes and totes of many different items, management was fair, my co-workers were pretty decent people. Everyday was always a pretty fair day for the most part. I've had a lot of crazy days also like being robbed all the time. I guess that's why they closed it down."
good,Rite Aid wasn't a bad company to work for. The offer advancement to other and higher paying positions. The only issue I had with Rite aid was that it was a very labor intensive job. If you aren't a fan of strenuous labor this place isn't for you. It is nice for temporary work until you find something better.
good,Very long hours. Low pay. Least favorite job that I've ever had. Wouldn't be eager to work for Rite Aid Corp again. Poor management.
good,"High volume business demanding professional perfection as duties were being redirected towards new adventures, while further reducing manpower, creating an atmosphere of absolute work overload. Patient contact time was very limited, if not non-existent. Image, as reflected in stats and advertisements overshadowed true patient care. Upper management was so engulfed in goals and objectives, they lost sight of encouragement and success of the employees."
good,"Typical includes filling prescriptions, answering questions about medications, adminisering immunizations, directing technicians. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers find an answer to a question they have about prescription or OTC medications. Hardest part of job is dealing with unreasonable upset customers."
good,"Typical day dealing with customers and their needs, making sure everything is rotated and put in its correct place, answering customer phone calls, learned how to handle situations with customers"
good,"A typical work day includes stocking, organizing and waiting on customers. I had to break down boxes on the delivery day and check certain sections to ensure proper ordering."
good,"Helps up front when needed and in the pharmacy. Hours change constantly, can work mornings or evenings, sometimes back to back (evening to morning shift)."
good,"Worked there as a cashier for a year. Very low-stress job, but with little pay. Enjoyed helping elderly customers find what they needed. Most co-workers were nice and got along well. Did get boring after a while as my job was being a cashier in a very, very slow small store."
good,"Setting end caps, unloading trucks, price changes, photo lab, and cashier work. My management was great at the store I worked at but I cant say that about all stores. Our team of coworkers were the best and worked really great together. The customers were great also everyone knew everyone."
good,working at Rite Aid i have a met wide range of individuals from different ethnics. it help to me interact with them learn about them a little more and gave me an opportunity to respect them.i have also met a wide range of customers and using my good customer service skills i was able to assist them to the best of my ability and ensuring that they had the greatest experience ever and making sure they were satisfied.
good,"I liked all the people I worked with and meeting new people from all states, I was a receiver, and packer, so I got to meet a lot of drivers from many places,"
good,"It was a nice place to work the customers were pleasant most of the time, but sometimes the management was an issue. They were very unorganized and a lot of the time were passive aggressive which made it hard to be happy at work. But my coworkers were awesome and the store itself was nice to walk through."
good,"A great place to work to get some work experience, what I've learned working here is how to handle a customer that isn't satisfied and to help them leave happy. The hardest part of my job would be reaching my flu shot goal because it's a small store we don't usually get any new comers"
good,I had to answer phones calls and paper scripts from customer on new and refilling prescriptions.  Then go on to computer to fill and package these prescription.
good,"•	Provide customer service while maintaining our store standards."
good,"Its a okay starter job. It gives a young person good job experience, and develops people skills. It gives the associate time and money to eventually leave for their more permanent career."
good,"I enjoyed working here. Any job can and will be difficult but with the right people working, it can be a great place to work. I enjoyed most of the people I worked with. On an average day I would ring up customer sales, stock as needed. Occasionally I would process film for customers, serve ice cream, zone front end. There was nothing really hard about the job."
good,"I must say I have really enjoyed working for Rite Aid over the years...7+ years at this moment.  I have done a lot, been all over Washington, met a lot of great people.  Depending on which store you are at you may have a story to tell everyday, so never a dull moment.  Can be very high stress depending on your job title and store location.  I watch people commit felonies all the time, their policy on shoplifting and returns is worthless...have yet to see any positive results from their policies.  Just some fired management."
good,"i really enjoy assisting customers with finding items on shelves, calling insurance companies, processing, selling, and counting out prescription requests, answering phones, filing paper prescriptions, making sure prescriptions are hung in alphabetical order."
good,"Greeted customers, assisted in the purchase and selection of merchandise, issued receipts and change to customers, maintained friendly environment,"
good,I loved working there and enjoyed the people I worked with. They gave me a great learning experience and understood the type of person I am.
good,basic employee's and supervisors aren't paid fairly however they are provided good health benefits by the union. I started from the ground and built my self up so if you are hardworking advancement is possible.
good,Great place to work for. I had an excellent and considerate manager which made me love working there more. They had training videos which helped me further understand the expectations and qualifications to working there with the process of how to carry out individual tasks. They had a clean lay out of the store and efficient software to prevent any confusion among the workplace making the experience working there efficient and well organized.
good,"-quality of life very low"
good,This organization taught me a great deal about myself as a leader and as a member of a team. I learned to be assertive when necessary and to compromise when the situation warranted it.
good,"Rite Aid corporate management was horrible. I didn't really liked how they did things, and I felt as though it is a lot of favoritism that is shown."
good,"- learned how to deal with the public"
good,enjoyed the customers and other employees loved the customers attitude and appreciation when helping them find all they needed to have.
good,Overnight staff is great. We come in and joke but always work as a team and complete work. what is work if you can't enjoy it? Truck nights may be a little difficult depending on the arrival of the truck. I have learned how to scan in vendors and overstocked items. Management is cool for the most part and the co-workers are like family.
good,"It was a good work place but you work all the holidays and weekends  and pay was low."
good,"I enjoy working with some of my co-workers, but the constant interruptions do to some of my responsibilties (getting change for the cashier, providing back up for the cashier, providing overrides, lottery machines issues, photo machines issues)doesnt allow me to focus and concentrate on my current tasks. It can get very frustrating being interrupted every 2 minutes."
good,"Open store: Log in Registers, count safe.  Walk thru list, print reports.  Go over list for front-end associate. Confirm that they understand all their duties for their shift.  Help customers.  Complete back room inventory report and product freshness report.  Check for and completed price changes and recalls.  Prepare tills for RX Dept. and assist when needed. Checked in vender deliveries.  Worked as a team with my co-workers.  A great bunch of people!  The hardest part of the job was truck day.  Having a time limit on getting all product put away, scanning in overstock,  Getting all totes off floor and placed on skids outside for next day's pick-up while stopping to help customers was the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers.  What I learned was, what works for me doesn't always work for someone else."
good,"•	Prepared refrigerated medication orders for shipping utilizing freezer packaging"
good,"Overall a great company to work for.  The benefits available are quite good compared to other similar companies in the area.  Management staff are great and very well rounded.  It is a very fast-paced environment with plenty of opportunities to learn new things.  I work there for over 11 years and loved it for the most part.  There are always positives and negatives with every job, but for the majority of my time there the positives out weighed any negativity."
good,Rite aid is a good stable retail pharmacy with wonderful friendly employees and a customer satisfaction first attitude that is good for the local community
good,"Nice place to work. Room to move up the ladder. High energy, very clean. They also have perks for working for this company."
good,"It is a great place to get a first job. It is an fast paced environment, but it is also very demanding. You have the opportunities to move up. However, it is for doing more work with roughly the same pay."
good,"I've worked for Eckerd/Rite Aid for many years. Although I'm having a hard time trying to leave, I know its best."
good,"I was part of a family in the seven years I worked there, but because of my restrictions I wasn't able to take this job to the next level."
good,"I start my day by making sure everything is put away and that the morning duties go finished before working on the night duties, I have learn quite a bit about what its like to work in a pharmacy, different types of medications to insurances. My management up front is fantastic and kind while trying to get us to motivate us to be better, pharmacy is slightly more stressed though still very efficient and hard working co-workers. The hardest part would probably be when the customers medication hasn't been finished and they are quite upset."
good,"patience is the main thing i can take away from working at rite aid, great workers everyone willing to help achother if someone is falling behind"
good,"I was supposed to be trained to manage a store I was sent to someone who did not have the patience to train me and made the comment I don't know why he sent you here that tells you she didn't want to train me, its a shame because I feel with my past experience and my people skills I would have been a good manager, but she was to busy outside smoking all the time to train me, and when I ask her a question her answer most of the time was I already showed you that figure it out, I really liked my district manager and wish I could get another chance with somebody who wants and has the patience to train somebody, my district manager said she turned great numbers so she was a good manager it takes more than turning numbers to make somebody a good manager."
good,"You do not need previous training or schooling, they will train inhouse, but you must get Nationally cerified. Very busy and stressful workplace.  Poor pay for the job responsibilites."
good,"As a picker to fill orders daily to go out for distribution in totes and up to the line belt were the tots would be zip tied and set down to the trucks."
good,"Great environment to be in , management is bad , customers are very nice and co workers are great to be around, I enjoy the hard work people put in this job."
good,"Much slower days than Fred Meyer. I learned all my pharmacy skills from Rite Aid, Mostly by Pharmacist that  wanted to see me succeed. My co workers were very helpful with my growth as a tech. The hardest part of my job as a new tech was working with insurance. Again my customers made my job enjoyable"
good,"I began with Rite Aid as a pharmacy cashier.  Worked my way up to pharmacy tech, key cashier and then to assistant manager by the time I was 18.  I worked usually more than 50 hours a week.  I was able to work in every area of the store.  The hardest parts of my job were gaining the respect of my managers and employees due to my young age, and, working over 50 hours a week and overnight hours on the weekend while I was still young and wanted to enjoy life.  I enjoyed the pay because not many people my age made the kind of money that I did and I loved the hard work and responsibility that came with the job."
good,My time at Rite Aid Corporation was a nice time although I did get laid off my coworkers were excellent and I enjoyed what i was doing. Dealing with the pharmacy side of the business putting in codes to get prescriptions to go through the system and pay. Also would speak to the different pharmacies in the country to help with the above actions.
good,"Working as a grave yard shift isn't very fun at all, but because you have to make ends meet you just have to live with it in the meantime. Management wise is not very great. Some co-worker are like friends and families and some are just stranger, but you made it all through the day and night. As I mentioned in the beginning the hardest part of the job is by working graveyard, however I enjoyed  working with co-workers who work hard and who can work as a team."
good,"They offered me a great deal of advancement, I accepted the promotion they misrepresented themselves to me in my pay and my job title. After I had been in my new position for over a month. However I have stayed in the position because I consider myself to have a high  work ethic."
good,At the beginning it was very hard for me to get my foot in the door. It was a eat or be eaten environment. I had to earn the respect of the cashiers. As time went on it became more comfortable.
good,"Fun place to work, and enjoyed the people that came into our store. Not so flexible when it came to schooling and family. It just wasn't the job for me. Family comes first, and schedule was very disruptive for my family life and schooling.Besides that, this job was great with the public, and showed lots of leadership capabilities for future employment positions."
good,"Initiated and implemented projects such as Medication Therapy Management (MTM) and Vaccination programs."
good,hardest part of the job was running both the register and the photo lab
good,Go in in the morning around 9a.m. Call patients to remind them they have prescriptions ready to pick up. Help customers on the sales floor and make sure they are aware of the services we offer. Go out for about a hour or two do business to business outreach. Speak to different facilities about setting up clinics for employees or senior residents. Help customers fill out questionnaire forms so that they can receive vaccines. Answer questions use ipad to look up information when needed. Have a 10 minute huddle meeting with pharmacist to let her know what im doing and let her know when and if I've set something up during business to business outreach. Set up Blood drives and other in-store events for customers. Make notes and fill out e-forms.
good,"It was like family at rite aid, i love filling prescriptions and the customers were friendly (most of them). The customers became family because they regularly had prescriptions filled. The co-workers really believed in teamwork and we joked and filled prescriptions which made the day go by fast."
good,"TA typical workday at Rite Aid was to oversee the everyday transactions of the company, which included dealing with vendors, manage a staff of 15, the most enjoyable part of the job was the day to day interaction with customers. The hardest part of the job was the amount of hours I had to do during the week, my week included 60 to 70 hour work weeks."
good,"My typical days at pharmacy was great, and working with different pharmaciest and pharmacy technician. I learned many things from pharmacy and my pharmaciest. I learned how to data entry of original prescription, and heading customer services, and phone calls. The management was not that great at rite aid because they updates some many things in less time and that make for employee hard. The time schedule was not great also because they are open on weekend and i was working in busiest pharmacy ever. I worked with many different co workers, and i tought and traning them also, overall, it was great time working with them. The hardest part of work was sometime we have lots of work with less employees, and that make more work with less employees.The most enjoyable at work is sometime we finish work on time and so we can to something else that has to finish."
good,"A typical day consist of customer service (answer phones,work cash register, assist customers at drive thru window), process prescriptions(enter into computer, counter meds,send  to quality control then ready for customer pick up)stock meds on order day and return meds to stock after quality control is complete."
good,ancillary help was minimized; working conditions were adequate; lunch and breaks were emphasized and timely.
good,"A typical day involved Inventory Control Administrative tasks, customer relations, customer support and cash drawer responsibilities. I learned tons of medical names of medicine I also filed insurance claims. I love working in the public trying to help others through their day. My co workers and I really where more like family . The toughest part of the day was mostly in  the winter time dealing with sick people , when your sick most people are very grumpy but somehow I always managed to put a smile on their faces by telling how good they look or just by listening."
good,"A typical day involved me imputing new scripts into the computer system, running them, solving insurance problems, answering the phone, working with patients and the inventory, answering questions, and running the register."
good,"I like my co-workers, managers, and i love working there as a whole, but there aren't any benefits for cashiers. Hours get cut without an early notice. the company as a whole doesn't care for or take care of their workers."
good,"Working at a Rite Aid Pharmacy was very challenging especially in the downtown of Lancaster Pa. We grew to know many of our regular customers and worked as a team to ensure a quality experience at this location. the only real difficult part of this job was the weekly ""truck""day which occurred usually around 3:00 AM and lasted throughout the day. We received our weekly merchandise supply once a week and were tasked to stock up to 16 pallets of inventory by the end of the day. Themost enjoyable part of this job was getting to know the locals and build a true friendship with many of them."
good,Rite aid is an ok job but it just depends on what you make of it. If your just getting out of high school and trying to make some quick money its the place for you but if you have a family and enjoy that family time then this is not for you because you will work alot of holidays and weekends typically nights. The only advantage is that they close at nine and its is kinda laid back.
good,"A typical work day consists of answering phones, providing excellent customer service, processing prescriptions, working as team with other employees, stocking, and clean up. Get along well with co-workers. I find it hard to see others not providing excellent customer service. Enjoy staying busy and the customer contact."
good,"It's a great job to be active and working with the public is also a great experience. But the pay isn't there, especially as an assistant manager. You have to work OT to really get some good money."
good,"I somewhat enjoyed working there, but what I did not like about rite aid was that I was teated very rude by both of my bosses, I was the only black employee there and have heard  alot of rude racial things. I wold never work for rite aid again"
good,"Cash out customers picking up prescriptions.  Help customers find retail items.  "
good,"A satifies customer is key to a sucessful business. I love my co-workers and employees they keep me going and helps make for a nice productive day when you have a group of people that enjoy working with each other. The hardest part of my job is when i do my best to satisfy a customer or employee but there are things beyond my limitations that I dont get to make a call on. "
good,"retailing is hard on it own,very hard physical labor. Management are being pressure too much."
good,This is a physically demanding job that requires a very flexible schedule.
good,"Very fast paced and stressful environment, but I had a great staff and we worked together as a team. Upper management pretty much left you on your own, which I liked, but they made themselves available if you communicated to them that you had a need or had a problem that was beyond ones ability to control."
good,I worked as a stocker overnight. I didnt really interact with people much. I worked in a section by myself.
good,"Overall this is a good place to work but, people have lives outside of the work day and schedules are never the same therefore its hard to plan your personal time.."
good,The job can be very frustrating at times but it's all about patience with customers and offering the best customer service.
good,"This was a good work experience. Each day started with making sure the checkout station was clean and full with product. Learned how to operate a cash register and how to dispose of chemicals and damaged goods properly. Good relationship with co-workers, very friendly work environment."
good,"With improved work flow, days were generally good, filling and checking prescriptions and counselling patients. Learned new skills in communication and counselling with patients and the ability to do patient immunizations. Management is good, but business goals are not always communicated properly. Co workers are fantastic, working as a whole team. Hardest part is finding time to do everything that needs to be done. Most enjoyable... helping people."
good,"the customer are pretty nice and friendly they love great customer service My favorite is Ms. D she one of the seniors and with her she likes me to walk around with her as she shops, to point all the sales items.there has not been a hard part to me i have been in management for years and one thing you learn you roll with the punches ."
good,"it was an awesome experience, You meet some interesting people depending on the location of the hotel."
good,This is a very good place to work.  Both management and co-workers strive to work as a team.  The customers are the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"I have 4 years of experience working with Rite aid, yet I have not been able to receive a raise to at least 8 dollars. The environment is great. But it feels like by job is not being appreciated at all. "
good,"Typical retail setting. The hardest part of the job was working with new staff with little or no experience as there was lot of turnover with technicians. The work environment was enjoyable though."
good,"Working at Rite Aid started off my pharmacy technicican career. I learned everything about being a technician there including, how to read prescriptions, data entry them, and the pharmacutical language. I also worked with insurance companies to make sure the patients had coverage for their medications. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new information and gaining more knowledge in this field of employment.  "
good,"I enjoyed working with customers over the phone. I helped them fix their billing accounts, and change the services the had on their accounts. I also helped them with service calls, and helped them with there equipment over the phone."
good,"wire / move new lan/wan connections, repair RF equipment and workstations, update data. Learned enthusiasm should be tempered with more adherence to policy. Co-workers were exceptional. Hardest part of the job was not quite enough hours in the day. The variance of duties was the best part, never a dull moment."
good,"A typical day at rite aid starts with putting away the new orders, then checking and filling electronic prescriptions, paper prescrptions, refills, and telephone prescriptions. Working the registers and drive through happen throughout the day. I've gained immense knowledge about medications and their uses. All employees work together in a drama free workplace. The hardest part of the job is multi tasking."
good,i loved learning everything about the pharmacy. It was always something new to learn it was always busy and the work kept me on my feet.
good,"A typical day work is you will have daily assignment's that need to b done asked by the company. You learn how to set planograms, blue dots, and cycle count, for example. Store management it great but high management sucks. don't be expected to be promoted anytime soon. One mistake and they will most likely fire you. The hardest part of the job is doing what the company ask you do but at the same watch the front because you are a cashier. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people who work with."
good,"I think working at Rite Aid is a good job, if you want benefits and want to work with team players. I found most of my co-workers were congenial and easy to talk to. Some of the assistant managers were really cool. Some assistant managers seem to choose favorites and give a hard time. Others feel like friends. If you are short or over on your register by even $2, they will write you up."
good,"My day begins with filling courtsey refills; this is when I automatically process prescriptions for patients three days in advance so they don't have to worry with calling in their prescriptions. In addition to courtsey refills, I am answering phones from patients calling in their own refills,doctors/nurses phoning, filling new prescriptions dropped off, cashiering in-store and drive-thru,and showing patients where items are in the store. My co-workers and I are like family, we look out for each other. The hardest part about my job right now is that we are short of help. The most enjoyable part of my job and the reason I'm still there is my customers and my co-workers. I love my customers; and I know they love me because I know a lot of them by voice on the phone and when I see them I don't have to ask their name. It's just a good feeling to see them smile when they walk up to the counter and acknowledge me by my first name and not just the technician in the pharmacy. I was even voted the Favorite Pharmacy Team Member in 2012."
good,"Something different that I liked. Taught me about retail and I enjoyed working with the photos, I felt like a professional. The manager really was like a father figure to all of us and I felt I had a place in the store. We were family for one year and I will never forget the family bond. The hardest part of the job is leaving to go back to Ohio."
good,"enjoyed the challenge of day to day tasks including merchandising, customer service,and general management duties. I learned how to manage associates and help them as well as myself set both personal and business goals. I believe that a persons work is always a reflection of who and or what they are. I welcome challenges and have learned how to welcome change on a daily basis. the hardest part of my job was making the adjustment of being a salaried associate to hourly and realizing i could no longer stay until my tasks were completed in the time frame i set for myself but rather delegate others to carry on where i left off. i most enjoyed working with customers and found it very gratifying to always help them find exactly what they were looking for reguardless of where that may be located."
good,"A typical day at Rite Aid in a Shift Leader position would be counting drawers in the morning to make sure there is the right amount of money in them, logging registers on for entire day, doing cash pickups, making change for cashiers, doing plan-o-grams, creating end caps, setting seasonal aisles, doing zero counts, price changes, unloading truck, stocking store, making deposits, counting drawers at night to make sure all drawers balance out, helping as a cashier in pharmacy when needed as well as pharmacy manager. I learned a lot about importance of being on time and being at work as well as responsibility for an entire store when I was manager on duty. The management was always amazing there. We all helped each other out if we needed certain days off and weekends off and knew what each other did on a daily basis so we could all understand each other's workload and respect that. Co-workers were also amazing. They were all very nice and did what they needed to get done and then some. The hardest part of the job was becoming so close to some elderly customers and then a few months later they would pass away. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely meeting different people getting to know our regular customers by name and knew what they would come in for every time they walked in the door."
good,"Rite Aid has provided many opportunities for me to gain knowledge in the field of pharmacy including but not limited to: communication with patients, medication therapy management, and administering vaccines."
good,Riteaid is a good business. I like my position but the area i work in is very uncomfortable to leave work from.
good,"typical day would be filled with un-organization and working harder than others, doing multiple tasks within the shift."
good,My last position with Rite Aid was a section supervisor with direct supervision of a staff of about 25. We selected orders for the Rite Aid stores and loaded and delivered the orders. I was in charge of a production section which selected orders for about 90 stores daily.
good,Rite Aid is a great place to begin a career in retail pharmacy because it gives you a crash course in what to expect in future encounters of being a Pharmacy technician. The co-workers and Pharmacists are friendly. the only problem I had was the low pay wages not enough to support a family
good,I would still be working there if they had not shut down the warehouse
good,Starts at 6am walk the start complete a to do list.
good,"A typical day at work is ringing up customers, talking to customers; and helping them find what they are looking for. In retail I have learned you have to be patient with everyone. Co-workers are nice, get along very well. Hardest part of the job is having not enough hands to get all of the job done. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know each of my customers."
good,"Being a team member at Rite Aid i've enjoyed myself, i've made everyday a new learning experience weather it's knowing a specific product that a customer needs or weather its providing a customer with excellent product knowledge. It is an exciting place to work especially when you have a group of young goal-oriented workers who strive to help the company grow."
good,"a great place to meet new people and and learn new personalities. there are many opportunities to move up. the hardest part of this job is actually scooping the ice cream, but the best part of the job is seen the smiles on their faces"
good,Great company to work for with flexible scheduling. Staff is polite and respectful to one another.
good,Great company to work with. The experience with bosses may vary.
good,The Manager taught us to be hardworking and dedicated to a certain task. I enjoyed working here.
good,they are basically mediocre. They change their rules about once per week on what you can and cant do. They do not stand behind their employees when the going gets tough.
good,The loyal employees are given the run around and excuses .  The management is being slaved because of the lack of commitment the employees have for the job.  I had to work as a supervisor without a cashier because the one on schedule called out and the morning manager did nothing about it.  Security is very poor!
good,No further Review. I have nothing further to state about the company. Everything is listed in the scores listed above. Thank you so much for your time
good,Growing relationships with almost every patient because most of them are there almost everyday. This is definitely a great first job if your starting off your pharmacy technician career
good,Good place to work holiday time can be very stressful because of work log other than that that's a fun place to work and management is decent to. its employees are on a bus line for people that don't have a car. at the end of the day you have a goal to do is to get local communities the product they need
good,"Working with people who love what they do. You feel positive vibes and knowing that others love to help. "
good,I didn’t care for Rite Aid as a company to work for but my pharmacy team was amazing  from the first day I was there to my last day. My team was always helpful and welcoming. Things just always flowed perfectly. My management always made sure we knew they appreciated us. I won’t miss working for Rite Aid but I do miss working with this team.
good,"Great Job With Good Experience, But Not Enough Pay For The Hardworking Employees & No Job Security With Not Knowing If They Will Go Out Of Business Or Not."
good,"Very nice people and decent working environment. As with most retail management jobs, longer hours and some weekends requested/required. Seasons and weekly truck unload and unpack etc. The pay was shortcoming as well as the lack of payroll/staffing possibilities."
good,"The only good thing about this Company was my boss, he was strict but fair and always willing to help out an employee if there were in a jam.  "
good,Everybody supports and helping to learn the work.management is good.there is a lot of way that you have to show your skills.and you get promoted very quick if you are able.
good,"The job itself is pretty standard, nothing particularly good or bad. Pay leaves a lot to be desired, especially compared to what other companies are paying. Can be a bit stressful and occasionally under staffed, but for the most part it is decent. It is a good job to start out at if you are new to pharmacy. Coworkers were friendly."
good,I would come in and sign on to my computer and greet the pharmacist on that day as well as my co-workers that where there as well. I would then begin my day by finding out what needs to be done.
good,"Wonderful pharmacists to work for, not so good company. Salary is petty and so are yearly raises. Insurance  is good if you can afford the high deductible.The pharmacy manager is wonderful and easy with scheduling. Hardly any over time allow. Holidays paid if full-time for 1 year.  You learn a lot by dealing with the public and the  health care system."
good,"Appreciable 9 years experience.    Good work culture, work force, industry-acceptable opportunities and practices. Nationally standardized wage offer and healthcare programs. Tough work but acceptable and manageable by means of discipline and dedication."
good,"The job wasn't all it was cracked up to be. The pharmacist was not willing to go the extra mile to help out a new person, nor advise them in anything of concerns. Total harassment and unprofessional atmosphere only in the pharmacy department. Rest of the store was great and the people who worked there are awesome."
good,Ok like the job. Have to watch work load for rate to be fair to myself. Co-workers good hires pretty good team members. Sometimes customers a little difficult sell huge volumes of liquor on weekends. Ok pharmacist very professional and no complaints.
good,"Aside from that, I enjoyed my job mostly. "
good,"Rite Aid overall is a good place to work for.  If you just need a job as a cashier than this is a place for you and if you are going to college than this would work for you also.  If you are interested in the Pharmacy department than this is also not a bad company to work for.  They do provide on the spot training to become a Pharmacy Technician.  Although you have to be a cashier in the Pharmacy first for some time.  The pay is OK, but if you choose to earn more will need to go to another place of work or get a degree."
good,Rite aid wasa good place to work for but as any other place always drama......alot of work not enough pay. Raises suck! Management are slave drivers. And not enough help.
good,"The pay at Rite Aid was competitive against the other companies in the area, but they did not schedule enough technician or pharmacist hours to cover our basic minimums. Most days were frantic and unnecessarily busy and it was sometimes hard to find time to eat lunch/dinner."
good,I guess. It was a retail job with retail job atmosphere. Not exactly something spectacular. Picked up a second job to make a bit extra cuz I couldn't get the hours i wanted but whatev.
good,"When the staff is short, I learned how to be flexible and help out in other areas where staff was short. I had the opportunity to work in the pharmacy department where I was able to learn about different types of medications."
good,"Retail is very high paced with high expectations with not always the appropriate staff. Fill rxs, answer phones, give shots, complete mtm's, "
good,"i had no idea that my job would primarily consist of selling the flu shot shot when in season. mostly this means setting up clinics with local businesses, a task that i find daunting, intimidating, and anxiety inducing."
good,"Slower pace, friendly service and customers,  management very laid back,  hard to work nights after working 8 hours at Target. Most enjoyable aspect of the store is the customer and employee relationships. I've learned there are still businesses that care about their employees."
good,"I was a trainee as a pharmacy technician. The management was very light on training, I had to learn by doing. I liked the people but felt slighted by my manager."
good,most days are very well managed and they try not to stress the staff but sometimes it can fell like you are walking on eggshells.but over all i would work there again if given a chance to.the only negative is that they tell at the very last minute when your being mandated to stay over which isnt a problem unless you have someone picking you up from work and they are already outside waiting.overall the job was a good job
good,Loved the company would come back for the right position and location with the knowledge and leadership that was in place when I was previously employed
good,It’s a alright place to work  it has a union that the only reason why I’m staying some departments will work the dog out of you if you let them the best shift is graveyard
good,"no break times, which no good for team especially when so much work; low pay; "
good,"As a floater pharmacist, I've had the opportunity to work in various stores. There is never enough help and a lot of times I am stuck working alone to fill an amount of prescriptions that is impossible for one person to fill with all of the other responsibilities that need to be completed. This creates for a very stressful work environment and poor customer service. I don't feel as if I am able to live up to my full potential as a pharmacist because instead of getting to counsel and help patients, most days I am stuck at the cash register for hours and unable to even fill patient prescriptions. I believe the workplace would be greatly improved if technician wages were increased so that stores had less turn around and more consistent help."
good,I started at Rite Aid as a fresh out of school tech. I went from full time with little hours to 40 hours a week. It's a job that requires a good listener and some times thick skin.
good,"I was the only 18 year old girl working truck with 2 guys sometimes alone having to lift boxes that was sometimes 50 lbs or more, meanwhile every other female worker worked as a cashier. If i was finished unloading and placing everything where it belonged before my shift ended I needed to go to the cash register. If the truck was full and my shift was over I was told to stay until the job was done regardless if my shift ended at 2am and I had to stay until 4am."
good,Rite Aid is a very Stressful company to work for. Management is always wanting more with no gratitude or giving praise. They don’t really care about the employees and don’t stand behind them.
good,"Overall the Rite Aid I work at isn't such a terrible place."
good,"Most of the time my job is very enjoyable. But I do have moments it's very fast paced. I have adjusted to it better day to day. We have very nice and patient customers. Only once out of a blue moon we have angry, inpatient ones. But overall it's good. Most of my co-workers are very helpful and kind."
good,Liked working for Rite Aid. Customer service oriented philosophy. Hardest part of job was getting tasks done with limited payroll labor. Seemed like at times upper management always wanted more accomplished with less and less resources
good,"was offered part-time 25 hours a week, then almost immediately dropped to 15 hrs. a week.  I was never able to get back to the original hrs."
good,"Working at Rite Aid, a lot depends on the customers. If they're decent and pleasant, the work environment isn't too bad. But bad customers, especially at the pharmacy, can make things extremely stressful."
good,"During the months I worked at Rite Aid I was not eighteen years old yet, and was not permitted to work behind the cash registers because cigarettes were sold, so my job consisted of general upkeep and interaction with daily customers. Each day of the week has a different purpose, Mondays are truck days, Thursdays are restock and inventory days, and Saturdays would be for taking down the weeks sales and putting up the next weeks' sales. Management was knowledgeable and passionate, always available and willing to assist whenever I needed help. Dedicated workers while I was there, focused and not lackadaisical. Being the youngest member on the team by eight years made relating to team members socially was the most difficult part of the job, the most enjoyable was interacting with customers, especially regulars."
good,"I would not choose to work retail again as it physically it is too taxing.  I LOVED my manager and enjoyed the team she built.  I hated working until 10 pm and it was difficult for me to stand for hours at a time.  In addition, Rite Aid pay was ridiculous as it was less than any surrounding organizations."
good,"I filled prescriptions, wrung up customers, stocked the shelves, assist Pharmacist. Sometime it can get very busy. Customers can get upset waiting so long and they sometimes want name brand drugs which only can be given out if its written on the prescription. Customers get very upset. You have to learn to handle them with payient and care."
good,My advice is that yes it's a solid job to work at but be prepared as it's not as easygoing as probably other retail places. If you're a part of the closing crew you'll be expected to fix up the store with as little as 3 people. All the while helping customers with their purchases questions and scooping ice cream. I'd recommend working here if you're strong physically and mentally. Otherwise once you endure a year or two you'll realize that this job may help you grow your character. It's definitely put me through the ringer but I've learned a lot more about people in general.
good,"The store is closing as will most of them. I enjoyed my fellow employees and some of the customers but as with all retail, there were some bad moments. Management was good and then meh."
good,Having the same customers return is one of the best part of the days and meeting new people as well. You build friendship and talk about life events. It's always busy there. Always something to do while cashiering.
good,"I liked working in the pharmacy, however they kept cutting my hours and cutting my pay even when I traveled over 50+ miles to get my certification. Other than that rite aid was an okay place to work at"
good,The management team could be more team oriented. There's a low ceiling for advancement within a distribution center but you continue to have counterparts performing and acting in cutthroat ways as if it's for advancement options.
good,The place is very easy place to work sometimes it can be a little overwhelmed I think they can do a little better with how they do this place and do better with treating there employees
good,"Every day is always something new. I can deal with hard to manage customers with a smile on my face. Some are more challenging then others but I have managed to never receive a complaint. Every day is a learning day and something new comes along and you have to problem solve. The end result must appease your customer and if not then you have done something wrong. It is a good place to work, very friendly and family oriented but maintaining professionalism at the same time."
good,"good overall job management was hectic at times but rewarding, they did set objectives that had to be adhered to and followed. they did provide most training to move up in company. overall not a bad place to work."
good,"I love working for rite aid. Every job has its minor annoyances, however, it also has memorable moments and it has taught me many skill and has taught me how to appreciate the little things."
good,"Pick and pull merchandise to send to rite-aid stores around the world. Very fast paced, if you coulsnt mive at a very fast pace it isnt a job for you."
good,"This was my first job, so I learned a lot about retail, especially from the management, I was always given advice, tips and little training when doing a new task."
good,A typical day at work would sometimes become long and tedious. You are required to work a 10hr shift but sometimes longer depending on the volume of work. Sometimes the co workers at work would be very unprofessional and lack any will do their job. Management did the best they could with the circumstances they were given. The hardest part about this job was making quota and getting the recommended volume of work out to the customers and stores on a time efficient manner. The most enjoyable part of my job was that when everyone worked together we got things done.
good,"a typical day at work is very fast - paced, and loud. You get pulled all over the pharmacy from customer service in person as well as over the phone, to counting, filing, restocking shelves, ect. The customers are our patients and that is the best part of the job knowing all the stress and hard work goes for the patient."
good,"I enjoyed it I like a lot of customers that came in,and a couple of employees were great team players. I just didn't line the area I worked at high theift."
good,Very simple retail job. Best as a part time job while finding something better. Management can't figure out how to follow their own policies. Tried reaching DM and HR on the matter but was ignored. Caught employee breaking serious policies that could give the store a lot of fines but nothing was done about it. Associates aren't held accountable for their mistakes. I have been told multiple times to drop the subjects when brought up. No punishments are ever handed out which has led to several associates to just leech off the system and still keep their job. Union doesn't care enough to help out when management breaks union contract until contract is up for renegotiation.
good,"The work load wasn't too bad, as long as you stayed on task. Customers were a nightmare but always smiled through it, and the hours were great and they were very flexible."
good,The money was good but the management was too highshcool. Def stay to yourself because all people do is talk junk n gossip. No new friends stay on task n keep your productivity high past there goal n you good...
good,The staff was good to work with and the customers were generally pleasant.  Management was willing to work with me to get time off as needed for school.
good,Managing a Rite Aid can be a very enjoyable experience.  Most stores are neighborhood stores so you're able to get to know your customers pretty well.  If you enjoy merchandising and working with people then this is an environment you will really enjoy.  My one note of caution would be that this is best as a second income.  The pay at this company is well below the industry average.
good,Rite Aid is a good first job to have. However there is not many chances to advance your career or go up in pay grade. The coworkers are nice people as well.
good,"I've worked for Rite Aid on and off over a 10 year time span and for the most part its a decent job. I've worked in the photo department, cashiering, merchandising, management, pharmacy and each experience has been good and bad. My favorite was running a post office in one of our stores; That and being a pharmacy technician/associate."
good,"A typical day for a cashier is to count his/her till for opening and closing. I learned how to work for a super, great boss that shared the same views as its employees. Rita, my manager, is a personal friend of mind after working for the company and say I may use her as a reference anytime I may ask for it. Working for a retail company created multiculturalism for the community being it was in San Francisco. The hardest part of the job was pulling in load and overnight when the merchandise department came in and did their inventories. The most enjoyable part of the job was making personal friends."
good,Just do your best and help the customers much as possible. Respect your managers and they will respect you back. The customers love when you know about the product.
good,"The coworkers and managers were extremely nice and understanding."
good,It was a fine/okay job.   I can't provide more as i was working with them long time ago and there has been many changes of pay and benefit coverage. It used to have a descent coverage.
good,"The people are nice but the system that is put in place is not really working out.  A typical day at work with Rite Aid was to prevent the store from theft In casual clothes, video review and burning a copy of video to a DVD if asked."
good,People that worked with you were the best part of the job. IT was a high stress environment with too many tasks to perform while keeping people safe and completing what was required of you. It was a good place to get experience.
good,"Management,Opening,Closing,getting everyone's register ready as well as final count for everyone,s register,taking in delivery ,putting out thing,s for delivery,s bank runs stocking as well as Great Customer Service.I have awards for Customer Service in B J Wholesale two years in a row.I treat everyone the way i want to be treated"
good,Store did stay open long but they were a good company didn't expect you to do the mangers work  if you where a key closer they trained you to do what was  expected of you
good,"It can be extremely boring to work at Rite Aid for the simple fact that, you work alone and most nights are not as busy!        "
good,Just a typical retail job. Not much more should be expected.  Advancement may take years which is fine but the pay is typical for the type of job.  Mainly depends on your location.
good,"good place to work, well structured, financially strapped due to heavy debt, Training needs improved with qualified instructor. pay is average with the market."
good,"The hardest part of the job was that my schedule was never the same, days, nights, and weekends.  Management had me working full-time hours, but never officially made me Full Time, so I never got benefits, even after 5 years with the company.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the positive change in customers over time after being treated with respect and genuine caring for them and their needs.  I loved helping the elderly customers which led to my next job   as a property manager for elderly and disabled residents."
good,no room for advancement at all. union based environment. compensation arranged by the union representatives and change in position or compensation without union approval
good,"I would NOT recommend this place to anyone for employment. Rite Aid here in Crescent City .ca has very poor management she has taken a very well trained crew and ran every single one of them out. The manager has No people skills and she treats her employees poorly. I worked with her for 8 years and everyday I Hated it. She knew i had a major problem and she should of offered me some help, but instead she just let it get worse and didn't show any care in the world."
good,I was an assistand mangager and I was being trained to do my job but I was being sent to other stores almost every week and I didn't get the proper training and I was not happy about that
good,"I feel that my time at Rite Aid is coming to an end. I don't feel appreciated as a hard working employee, and I don't feel that my pay rate is fair for the amount of work I do."
good,Not compensated for work expected. Company will probably not last the year. Upper management not supportive. Advancement opportunities and trading are poor
good,"Management could be more respectful"
good,Overall the job is easy to perform and fun majority of the time. However it doesn't pay to well so at times the work required will not feel well compensated on payday. All sites vary in business however some can beome very demanding and require multitasking at a very rapid pace. It can be non stop cashiering and restocking for the whole shift. It is not difficult to grasp the day to day challenges of the job so pretty much anyone can perform well .The only down side is the pay.
good,I have worked for Rite Aid for a very long time.  It used to be a great place to work.  In recent years I feel more like a number than a person.  Benefits keep getting worse and pay is not inline with other companies.
good,not too bad to work for but the management will blame anyone for anything aslong as they are not corprate. no room for advancement if you dont lie for the sake of the managers
good,"Work in Loss prevention keeps things varied enough to prevent boredom, but varying schedules can interfere with life outside of work. While work life balance if great at this position, there is little opportunity for advancement and even fewer managers that will assist with your overall career development."
good,"this was my very first job in high school that i held for four years. I loved my store manager and everyone i worked with was very friendly. the pay could be better, and standing behind a cash register all day was boring, but after a few years i got promoted to shift manager. good first job experience for me."
good,Long hours on your feet for minimum wages. Customers very but majority are very delightful in this area. I worked at other stores and the customers can be very rude
good,"every day is a different day walking into that place. when the store manager complains with your child is very sick and you have to stay home to take care of her. it really puts a damper on things. or the fact that they dont have if you have a set schedule and they dont go by it, plus they dont talk to you about changing something, they just do it. than you need to figure out who will babysit your child plus coming up with the extra money when it wasnt in budget for that pay period."
good,"Management was truly a delight, they were open to suggestion and very helpful.  I was trained in every area of the store.  I enjoyed learning new things it keeps your mind sharp"
good,"I only worked here because I needed a job flexible with school. This kind of fit, but then not only did they change my schedule, they also relocated me which I didn't sign up for. At the new location, one of the managers was really unprofessional to the point that a fight almost ensued. She was released. The store manager had her ups and downs as well."
good,"Management is friendly and youre always busy. The best part about the on the job training is that no matter what position you are hired for, you learn how to do essentially every job, so you become more qualified than you thought you would for your next position in terms of experience."
good,"If you work for one with a drive-thru... well good luck. Salary is pathetic at first, miserable later on. You get 8 hour vacation every 6 months. Certain work flow rules are simply stewpid.  The corporate folks are mostly mentally challenged . Floater pharmacists are a pain. They don't give a hoot about costumers or anything since it's not their own stores. Costumers, as usual, are complete loads of excrement at times and sweet angels on rare occasions."
good,"Rite Aid was a fine place to work. I started there right out of high school. The job was helping get my feet wet in the real world. Due to relocation, I had  to leave."
good,"I have worked at Rite Aid before in the if 1986 my life experience was working with customers as a front end cashier and customer service I have worked there for years i""'m willing to go work at Rite Aid again"
good,I love my job in my store. The district works well together and willing to help out eachother. I feel as though my personal performance and experience is sometimes un noticed and my growth in the company is hindered because of it.
good,"The staff constantly complains to you about other employers. Also when you are busy with your handfuls, the other employees will just stand there and yell at you to get the customers."
good,busy faced environment that keeps you on your feet at all times. must be able to multi-task and have great customer service experience. you have to interact a lot with customers and also know how to stock/face a store
good,My immediate bosses and coworkers are fun and friendly people.Upper management needs help and lacks in communication skills and the pay scale is ridiculously low.
good,I was only there for a few months due to the pay and only being able to work part time full time was not available. the work enviorment was nice and responsibilities were easy. I would say this isn't bad if you needed a part time job or just a little extra money. It is great for a starter job.
good,"Rite Aid is a neighborhood store.  Getting to know the regular customers' names and service their needs is the highlight of the job.  As a retail job, there are always many tasks to do.  This keeps the day going and the encourages the feeling of accomplishment.  There is opportunity for in-store advancement."
good,"Staff and coworkers are great. We get things done and have a great time doing it. The company does not care much about its employees, they don't pay much."
good,Rite Aid is a huge company and have many stores arround the United States. It's a very fast pace environment work flow. Before you get to the supervisor/management position you have to really know your way arround the store. For example knowing which items go to their isles. Also excellent customer service on cashier registers. Knowing how to use the register acurately. Coming to work everyday on time and always giving 100% of your work ethic you should be looking to get promoted to the next position available. So it all depends on how much work you put in to get positive work results.
good,The management was good.  The work is decent and the environment is good for students and people who does not have a job or looking for a job.  The pay is alright.
good,"Overall I love serving patients and working with my energetic coworkers. The work schedule was very flexible and the patients in which I serve were always encouraging and understanding, which makes the job much easier."
good,"Scooped up a job at the local Rite Aid when I needed a job badly. Despite the very welcoming and helpful management, it was a very busy job that only paid minimum wage. Very unfortunate."
good,"This job helped me gain the basics of work ethics and social interactions. I was able to provide service to the best and worst customers which helped me learn how to deal with situations I was not used to. I built a strong relationship with my co workers and manager which lead me to win certificates and pins for employee of the month and I did get offered a supervisor position that i declined because of the pay and i was still in high school so I could not work 40 hours a week. Overall, Rite Aid is a really good for building work skills although, I feel like with my work ethics I can work at a bigger or better company."
good,"A typical day of work consists of opening up the store, opening up drawers (front end and pharmacy), opening doors to the public at 8, answer customer questions or concerns, finish any duties left on my shift from the store manager or DM, Making sure the next employee gets on their shift on time and let the next person in charge know what you did and what you didn't get to finish, before you leave make sure everyone has had their breaks, take out garbage and clean up after yourself, then go home. "
good,I have worked for the Rite Aid corporation for 7 years. I feel connected to this company and its people and take pride in being a part of a company which has become a competitive player in the retail setting. Rite Aid is committed to staying relevant and creating new opportunities for pharmacists to get involved in the community.
good,"I liked it overall. However, I wish they took better care of their customers. Never join a non-union Rite Aid because they don't care about their employee's"
good,"To begin with the pharmacy staff is amazing we work our hardest to provide the best service we can, but corporate doesn't see what we have to go through on a daily basis. Apparently they assume we just play with our finger and toes or either don't want to do the work. What they don't comprehend is that we work our butts off mainly because we are the highest volume pharmacy in our distract what not a lot of help. We love all of our patients and we hate to upset them but when we don't have the help we need we can't give the best service possible. I don't like talking about pay because I don't want to be that person, but the pay at worth all the work I do on a daily basis. So to sum it up the guys on the lower part of the ladder like me are AWESOME, but those guys on the higher part need to be worked on."
good,"Customer service,stock,planograms. I really did not learn much because I already had experience. Upper management should learn to engage with their employees more. Co- workers are ok. Hardest part of the job is keeping the store customer presentable while doing daily tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying the customers."
good,worked as pharmacy tech for 25 years enjoyed my customers and job did all test was certified  started to get brushed off treatment youg people came in they let them take over computers put me on counter and drive thru i did not mind multi tasking but no one else did  not much pay raise after 25 years of dedication mom was ill had problems with management   still miss customers and some co workers it realy hit hard when management did not back.me up and pharmacist i worked with for 20 years pdms most did not care how dedicated you were
good,"PROS"
good,"Shared Quality Assurance, patient counseling, Medication Therapy Management, Medication Synchronization, Point of Care execution.These are all required to be done daily in addition to other tasks.It is busy and fast-paced."
good,I enjoyed working at Rite aid but was unhappy with fluctuating hours and minimum wage. I never had a problem with management and was always treated with respect.
good,"I have worked for Rite Aid for 6 years, my typical day involves directly dealing with customers and providing service. Inputting, counting, and various pharmacy duties. I love my co workers, however its the management that is the issue. I love the pharmacy, but the company I work for has turned their back and shorted me money that I have been owed. I have learned many skills in my time with Rite Aid, and I value my time with the company. But as financial situations grow, I am in need of a job that pays me for the job I am doing, and not for just a cashier."
good,My co workers are great people. Management is amazing and always available when needed. The store is a great environment to be in.
good,The learning experience was rewarding at the end. It made me happy to know I was going home helping another customer. Co-workers were always ready to help when I needed help.
good,"Your typical retail super-chain, employees are all numbers in the system, they ended up being bought out by a large competitor."
good,"It is a very large facility, with a lot of workers. It is fast pace and very easy to learn how to use the scan gun. The only thing I can say i didn't like was the level of productivity and the pressure"
good,"I assisted customers with their needs; helping them find what they are looking for. I stocked merchandise, and filed new orders. If there is any returns of merchandise from customers, I handle that."
good,"-Provide customer service by explaining our daily and weekly sales"
good,I've worked for this company for many years too many. They always want you to work with the bare minimum amount of hours yet have no tolerance for any type of customer complaints. They will not give you a raise unless it's a union raise.
good,An overall good company. Seem to always be shorthanded or under staffed due to a lack of given hours. Many employees come in obviously needing more training. Corporate does not seem to sincerely highlight or value the effort of many employees. Not much growth career wise for technicians.
good,"The pharmacy was great management, co-workers,etc..however, the patients can really give you a hard time. The job is great if you are sure that you want to be a pharmacy technician the rest of your life."
good,"At Rite Aid you never know what would happen on a typical day. I have learned that no matter how well you are doing your job there will be someone who will cause problems. Management at my work location seem to be a little lax when implementing rules. Some co-workers are willing to do their job the right way when some tend to cut corners. The hardest part of the job is knowing that the job you are doing is by the guidelines and others seem to not follow the rules and get away with it. The second hardest part is knowing that you work in a high crime, drug area and sometimes the security is not available during peak time. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing at the end of the day my work speaks for itself."
good,I come across various types of people throughout the day. I enjoy having a conversation with them and getting to know their personality. I think that is the most enjoyable part of my day.
good,Learned a lot about asset protection from the warehouse end. Great activities and benefits. My position had a lot of responsibilities on a large scale due to the size of the warehouse.
good,I covered an area that was a two hour drive one way and a 4 hour drive from one side to the other.  Rules and Regulations always changing.  Every project had a new manual created every day.  Went through a lot of earn as you learn.  For the most part I enjoyed the driving and meeting new people and learning the new equipment we were installing..
good,They are just trying to get too much out of too few and it is beating the employees  down. Pay is enough to get by on but that's all you can expect from this company. Every so often they do something to try and raise the moral but seems to be too little too late.
good,"A typical day working at Rite Aid consisted of assisting customers with any questions they had, working behind the register, facing all products in the aisles, restocking the floor, ordering product for next truck delivery, and organizing the store to company standards. I learned how to deal with aggravated customers since this was my first job, and when I became a supervisor I learned how to manage a team of people. The previous manager worked well with the crew and also knew how to mold managers, but when the new manager came the store began to take a decline. My co-workers were a decently put together team of young high school students as well as myself, but we learned to grow with the help of the right manager. The hardest part of the job at that time was working with aggravated customers since it was my first job. The most enjoyable part was the experience I gained from working there."
good,"As a shift manager I provided sensitive handling tasks and initial situation evaluation.  Once opening procedures were completed the days needs were laid out and communicated from central office and reporting tools outwards to myself and co-workers.  Management of associates, customer relationship building, and pharmacist needs for privacy concerns were a constant day to day requirement, Debriefing employees of new communication bulletins from central office, whether new workplace policies or shrink awareness campaigns, was a great way to establish connection and teamwork with associates in addition to maintaining company policy for the industry."
good,"This position offered excellent health and dental benefits, but no opportunity for advancement. Compensation was also not as much as I feel I deserve. I would like a career opportunity where I can gain more knowlege and advance within a company or facility."
good,"Rite Aid is a fairly typical customer service job. Some customers will be nice and courteous. Most will not. The tasks required are easy to pick up and there is a lot of downtime on certain days. The pay is minimum wage. Overall, this position is nothing special. Given the choice, Walgreens or CVS are better alternatives."
good,If you like a fast paced environment this is the job for you. always busy and you have the opportunity to meet a lot of great people.
good,A days work can go very well if everyone is doing what they are supposed to  i just do my job and go home.
good,"Worked for this company for 20 years. Until family members became very ill. stoped working to care for family. The best part was meeting new friends, careing for people who were ill."
good,"busy day, team work was good but supervisor sometimes very rude."
good,Greet customers. provide expertise on a range of nutrition products.. GNC certified vitamin specialist. given free range by corporate to interact and assist guests with whatever they needed. order special products.  required to organize special events monthly to educate on specific products and healt news.  outside sales rep for Rite Aid for vaccines and special promotions. community outreach. The only problem was the struggle to fulfill my duties dictated by corporate while being micromanaged by the in-store manager to complete her workload
good,"working her for me is a place to gain experience. its consist of me working with people and working on my customer service skills. my day consist of me working at the register, helping customers with anything they need. Its a place that can get very busy but you are supported with others."
good,this company over all rating is good.this company has good benefits and job security and advancements.The balance of this job is over loaded on daily tasks.the security of the store lacks in a plan to keep the employees and customers safe.
good,"fix shelf"
good,"Meeting the customers that came in store, Able to help them with anything, working with the workers,learning a lot with Manager,"
good,"Good job, depends on management staff. Normal experience with customers, will create close bonds. have to watch your step. Overall can be an amazing experience if you want to help people."
good,"I manage about 12 employees daily work load"
good,Customers and personnel were very nice.  Whole atmosphere was relaxed.
good,"A typical day of my work was filled with nothing but joy, I was able to offer people excellence in customer service. I have learned how to maintain a clean backroom, I have also learned about management, order placements. My co-workers were the best they knew what they were doing they also guide me in the right path, helped me when I had struggles. The hardest part of the job was unloading truck, also dealing with overstock and making sure all these items were scanned in the RF unit. The most enjoyable part of the job helping customers, guiding customers to the right isle, making sure they left the place with a smile on their face."
good,Its a good company just was in a bad location where commute started to become hard.
good,"well when i worked for rite aid I loved the store ,customers .  it was with sad regret that i developed cancer .and corp. let me go now other rite aid stores wont rehire me back"
good,easy paced layed back work space slow but great staff i injoyed my time there
good,"Worked for 24 years from being cashier, clerk, assistant manager."
good,"Many fond memories at Berlin. There were hard days, but we had many regular customers that made my day."
good,"inventory controller, basic management of million dollar inventory, worked with accounting to keep cost down and generate more turns in product, setting up blanket orders."
good,"I enjoyed working at Rite-Aid, for a part-time job it was fun and I learned a lot about healthcare. The employees I work with were great. Managers were nice and helpful if you had questions or concerns. I would work for them again any time."
good,"Enjoyable work place, and opportunities to advance. Able to develop other job related skills with work performed."
good,management was ok.the most enjoyable part of work was leavin work.
good,"Rite Aid is a great company, but the DM can really give you a very hard time. They have you walking on ""eggshells"" the whole time. You wonder what they are going to fuss about next time that will jepardise your job. If by chance, you can turn into the DM""s pet, you will be doing the ""backstroke"", but don't count on it."
good,"I felt that the computer system was easy to learn. When I first got hired, I learned Nexgen really quick. I found that each district does things differently. The people I have work with have been awesome. Of course, you will have a few that make things so difficult."
good,"Just started, learning and working as a chashier in their store and it was very nice when a district manager came walking in the store and made a big commplament and asked me if I've ever been a manager before? I was just doing my job (not standing around) out dating food, candy, cosmetics and getting rid of things on the shelf that should no longer be there and organizing things well for the customers. The workers were nice and friendly and I very much enjoyed my co-manager - I give that person a 5 star! But the main manager never told me if I didn't work for the summer or least put a few days in a week or month I would no longer be part of there team or to be able to work for Rite Aid! I took the summer off because I wanted to take care of my young child that didn't go to school in the summer. Two months later I went back to Rite Aid all excited and ready to work again but I was told I couldn't because I was gone too long and didn't put in so many hours a week or month! That broke my heart! If I would have been told that I would have found some way to do that. Why didn't the main manager tell me that? and I probably should have report it to the main Rite Aid!"
good,Rite Aid is an average company to work for. The faults and negatives overshadow its positives.
good,Rite Aide is a good company if your a student or a manager. Now that I have management experience I wouldn't mind going back.
good,I've been very fortunate to have very good managers while I've been at Rite Aid. They are nice people and willing to work with individuals schedule's. I've also have had great coworkers while working at Rite Aid.
good,"Multiple areas to work, store, field, District, Regional, Divisional Corporate level positions with provided training in some job codes. Tuition Assistance available for college & advanced certifications."
good,Enjoyed my job. Good group of people. I would still be there except for Walgreen purchased three of the distribution warehouses and closed two of us. My building was one.
good,Love the company but am looking for a next job because I have a family of two little toddlers and I need to work for a good salary wage because am a single mom.
good,"If you want to work at Rite Aid just know that front end works get paid about $7.15 to $7.50 an hour "
good,When working for this company right away I got a set schedule and full time hours. Which i loved. However it changed as well as as many hours I had previously.
good,"Rite Aid has closed down. We did not have much help. Pharmacists fill prescriptions and do a lot of non-pharmacy things like running the register."
good,"My time at Rite Aid was a great experience and I enjoyed working with the staff. However, the pay was not reasonable and the employees and pharmacists are way over worked. Also, this is a good place to pick up some part time hours if you are in between jobs, but apply at your own risk."
good,"I worked early and long hours and performed numerous duties, many of which were not part of my job description. As Pricing Accuracy Coordinator I had steep responsibilities that had a huge impact on store success, but I was constantly being asked to do the jobs of others, therefore leaving little time to complete my own. This sort of company culture may have been specific to my store (North Vasco Livermore), not to Rite Aid in general. At 18 I was also the youngest person in the store and working in a management role over employees aged 30 years old was a little difficult. I proved myself but demanding respect was probably the most difficult part of the job. My store manager was in desperate need of a PAC when the last one left the job with no notice so she promoted me. I was honored but quickly realized I may have been taken advantage of. The job was fairly intense (I could do it) but it may have been too much for a first job, especially for a full time college student with a heavy commute already. All in all I learned valuable lessons about how to run a retail storefront and interact with my customers and coworkers. It wasn't awful, it made a great first job, but I wouldn't go back."
good,Rite aid is a great company  to work for but the pay is really low .the training is not the best .the district  managers are great and very supportive.
good,Rite aid was a good job but the hours you get can really take a toll on you if you dont know how to mange your life but i know have change since iv been there
good,I feel like as a long time employee I have to do the tasks of about 4 people at any given time.  Pay is also poor.  While I have had some good management in the past in general it is understaffed.
good,"At the particular store I worked at, I really loved working for my manager. He is to date the best manager I have ever worked for. He had realistic expectations, was great about praise. We had a lot of work to do but I never felt like I couldn't get things done and I always knew I could ask for help."
good,"I enjoyed the day to day at Rite Aid with assisting in helping our customers with what they need. Making friendly conversations with peers and customers, and getting the job done!"
good,The work was very tedious and it is not a good environment if you are not a people person. I left the position because of the commute and difficult coworkers.
good,"retail is really what u make it . yes there will fast and crazy days depending on your store location .what makes rite aid , rite aid is the people you meet along they way . high turn over ,but team work make the dream work . they motivate u and keep u going ."
good,Decent place to work. Not great pay. Higher-ups are fair to work with. Great management staff. Medium paced environment. Union benefits as well as some paid time off.
good,Poor treatment from higher positions. None realistic company goals regarding shots and automatic refill programs. No career advances possible and very poor pay.
good,Learned a lot about working in a distribution center. Was able to re-organize the maintenance department and had the backing and support of the wonderful management team. Lovely people to work for.
good,Although a culture of friendliness is promoted. It extends primarily from store staff to customers. The culture between store staff and upper Management is one of fear.
good,"A typical day is started by clocking in and doing your opening manager duties if you are the opening manager, meeting with manager on duty for your daily duties if you are a mid shift worker, or meeting with manager on duty to discuss work done and work that needs to be done if you are the closing manager. I learned that time management is key with working at Rite Aid, at any position you are employed for. The hardest part was fitting daily duties with customer interaction and filling in for cashiers and backing them up, within the scheduled time. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people and getting to know each and every customer. Its very rewarding ending your day knowing you made a difference for someone."
good,"First job out of high school. easy work for minimal pay. flexible hours and great store manager. very fast paced work environment with many ""regulars""."
good,Theres a lot of walking involved and long hours. You dont get lunch breaks and your supposttoo. Management doesnt train very well you have to self teach yourself.
good,This job is a lot of work. Its a very face paced work environment. You have to keep a certain pace and you get weekly work reports. its a good job for a person that can keep the speed up.
good,Always a very friendly group of people that work their. I enjoyed the job and the duties. Fairly slow paced but did have days that were fast and busy.
good,"depending on the location of the store, it varies how busy it can get. Managers are expected to be available to work anytime but can make their own schedules. Room for opportunities to grow but stops at a point"
good,It had its good and bad days. Customers tend to be 55 years and older and can make things very irritating at times. But the company expectations were reasonable.
good,Rite aid is good to work for if you are in high school or something to just get you out of the house. But if you really like working retail it can be fun and the customers always keep you on your toes
good,"Great place to train as a pharmacy technician.  The phamacists are awesome to work with.  No matter what upper management says to your face, they really don't care about the little guy.  It doesn't matter how fast you are or how much you know and can do.  Still going to make less than the Dairy Queen workers down the road.  I love my job and the people I work with.  I love seeing upset customers relax and become calm because of how I'm responding to their issues.  I would never leave but my pay rate is not sustainable."
good,I have been a proud member of this team and company for several years but I feel I am ready for a better opportunity in my life. That will allow me to use the education I have acquired over the years.
good,I love working for rite aid but at the same time I hate it. If you work upfront the pharmacy closes early and gets special hours for holidays and such. It’s not fair and I’m pretty sure it the people I work with that make me hate it to
good,Couldn’t have worked for a better company. The work was easy and everyone usually got a long with one another. Great management! It was just hard to move up in the company.
good,Rite aid was ok job to work for i learn about how the company run how run a sale floor help me a better communicate with the customer and my co worker .
good,"A typical day at rite aid involved welcoming the customers with an friendly greeting and assisting them with any concerns they may had while shopping. The workplace culture was very uplifting because most of the employees welcomed me in like a teammate. The part i enjoyed most was that no employees held knowledge away from you. They taught you everything their was to know so you wouldn't be caught off guard. I learned how to break the registers down at the end of the day, how to do money transfers, and how to file the paperwork from the driver when we had a truck delivery."
good,"Good company"
good,"The main thing that made me leave this company was the bad management consistent through different stores. If you have a good manager you'll be fine, if not it will be a hassle. The typical workload would consist of pulling product from the back and packing it out, organizing planograms, scanning in vendors, making bank deposits and also packing out truck on the designated days. It's simple work and the best part of working there is knowing when you have a good team in the store, and everyone is pulling their weight and things are getting done. If those conditions are met then working at Rite Aid can be a good experience to learn about retail and also advance in the company."
good,"Compared to the work I am used to, Rite Aid was a very laid back place to work. The manager there was awesome, he was a very nice guy to work for and he'd always work with you for scheduling."
good,"I greatly enjoy retail pharmacy and all of my patients. I work at a very fast-paced and difficult store, which I love. Rite Aid has struggled to maintain good management in place at this particular store. They seem to have pharmacists, however, not all pharmacists are good managers. Being high volume, fast-paced and difficult, that means the store has went down hill over the last 3 years. It seems corporate has put whoever they can in these difficult managerial positions instead of putting in pharmacists that excel in those particular areas."
good,"A typical day a work would include  assisting customer in a friendly environment and always feeling secure, Always making sure customers needs and health were always first."
good,"The store manager I worked for, was good, but never at the store, he had multiple stores so he was always gone."
good,"Depending on the store manager will depend on how good the environment and work place culture will be. If the store manager is respectful and open to hearing everyones perspectives on the business then everyone is much happier going to work. Its like a family. Unfortunately, not every store manager is great."
good,I enjoyed working here and the people I worked with. I would recommend working in the pharmacy for anyone looking for a somewhat relaxed job. Can be fast paced and stressful at times. If one is looking to go into the health field of any sort working in a pharmacy is a good place to start. You do have to be able to deal professionally with angry customers as well as with doctors and other healthcare workers.
good,"Rite Aid isn't the best place to work, but it's not terrible. It's typical cashiering and janitorial work. There is a side of fast food service with the ice cream bar."
good,"Rite Aid was my first job and I worked there for about 2 years. I loved all of my coworkers as they were friendly and all did their jobs. If i called for help at the register someone always came to help. The manager and assistant managers were very kind and it was a decent work enviroment. However, the customers were the real issue. People screaming at you, the strange stealing scams you had to look out for, the lottery ticket loiterers and the weird 30+ year old men who try to hit on underage girls."
good,I loved working at Rite Aid the customer interactions but Rite Aid does not offer the opportunity to advance and their pay is terrible. It does offer great benefits nonetheless.
good,If you are just starting a family it is a good place to work since the hours work well with your family needs. The pharmacy is fast paced and a great group of people to work for.
good,"Fast paced environment, usually understaffed, have to use all resources to succeed, learned a lot from the opportunity. Easy to get along with pharmacy staff. most wonderful dispensing program I have ever worked on, Nexgen. Supervising staff always helpful and supportive, Pharmacy district manager was great."
good,Days are usually stressful. There are quiet downtimes occasionally. Customer Service is the most challenging part of the job but also the most enjoyable.
good,Rite aid is a very fast paced environment there is a lot of work on your plate but I enjoyed the people I worked with and all my customers that I seen and helped everyday but the company itself does not pay like it should.
good,"Rite Aid is a good place to work, if you don't want a job thats way to demanding. The managers are all wonderful people, they understand their employees. The ice cream counter, can be a bit of a chore. Trust me though, it's well worth it. The smiles ya get when ya work it, it's awesome. Customers are generally really friends, and regulars are kind hearted folk, so long as your courteous to them. Common Sense. Common Courtosey. Heads up though, if you don't want to be part of the working union, avoid this job at all cost."
good,No raises and no overtime. My supervisor was fantastic and I'd work for him again anywhere. No advancement opportunities and the raises don't cover basic life expenses
good,"I walk in an greet the Co workers"
good,I was taught a lot and everyday it was something new. I was in charge most  of the time but i often asked others what would they do in a situation just to get others view. Only hard part of my job was if i started something and didn't get it finished i would be upset with myself due to the fact i knew i could get it done. So i just push myself harder every time to let myself know i can do it.
good,"fun good job to have flexible hours i would love it more if i could move up in the company.  cons hard to move up with the company and pay isnt that good,"
good,"I'm Understanding about working on a tight budgets, however,  working with a 2 man shift everyday, with no overlap is tiring, hardly a lunch break and unloading 12 pallets by hand and alone off a truck in the ghetto is very stressful, while trying to cover the store as well.. trying to get a day off with my spouse is next to never. Must work weekends and holidays, begging to have help on vacations and sick calls.. I'm tired of working here."
good,Pay is low but coworkers are great. I enjoy working at Rite Aid because it is a great environment for growth and learning. Most of my job involves manual labor.
good,If you are looking to get your foot in the door then Rite Aid is a place for you. You can advance in the company by working hard and being reliable...
good,"At typical day at my job is always alot. Everyday people were there alday everyday. although i lived the people and they loved me back. It was alot.  but good , experience because of the people"
good,I think this is the worst paying job for the amount of stuff we do! I do not enjoy working here! I feel like a slave at times! Management deffinatley has its favors.
good,Sometimes there is a lot of customers and sometimes there is not. but your always busy no matter what. Your scooping ice cream to shipping and receiving to cleaning restrooms.
good,"Fulfilling and enjoyable place to work, helped thousands of customers with their medications. Customers were very appreciative for my services. Worked with an excellent hard working staff, they made my job much easie.r"
good,"On a good day there were a lot work to be done. I have learned a lot from rite aid. The hardest thing on the job were the work load , it was a little bit to much for me at times.  The most enjoyable thing on the job were meeting the customers."
good,This company sells alcohol and cigarettes. Something that I don't like to do as a jobs. That's one of the big reasons why I'm looking for another job.
good,Great place to work and learn everything about business environment. Busy store but co workers and customers around make this job worth it. There were up and downs but really enjoy working at Rite Aid.
good,pharmacy is always busy no matter which one you go too. the problem is often its one pharmacist on duty. you have an over lap sometimes when a shift is coming to and end.
good,A great place to work with a focus of servicing customers through friendly associates who are trained with excellent customer service and communication skills.
good,The work environment is very good and the co-workers are amazing. Only downside is the very low pay for me since i'm a pharmacy student who should be getting paid an intern's rate/hour but rite aid doesn't like promoting.
good,I work there for over 20 years  everyone need to have the same rules. I loved the customer and making sure everyone got what they need.  Working side by side with the other the other co-workers and finish a project and seeing there face when they done.
good,it was a good job but standing all day even at lunch you worked while you ate. Their was never no breaks. people were nice had to be the translator.
good,"A typical day consists of ringing customers up, cleaning the store, and providing general customer service.  Weekly duties might involve setting new merchandise or replacing the past week's sale tags - as a part-time worker, whether or not I perform those duties in a given week depends on my hours.  Skills that I gained included use of a cash register and approaches to use in customer service."
good,"Rite Aid is a respectful and understanding establishment. The managers are awesome at working around my school schedule, I am a full-time college student as well. From the front end to the pharmacy, we all get along and work cohesively. The is also good communication between every associate. A typical day at work is usually easy-going, with only spurts of being insanely busy, but most of the time everything on our list of things to do gets completed by the end of the day. The hardest part of the job is when it comes to a thief in the store because unless you saw exactly what they took, we can't really do anything. The most enjoyable part is redoing a planogram or a specific section of the store, such as, convenience food. I like truck days, too."
good,"A typical day as a pharmacy technician includes being able to balance data entry, patient care and working with physicians. Working as a pharmacy technician has strengthened my ability to relate to patients as well as my knowledge in the medical field. "
good,"assistant manager I help my "
good,A typical day at work I would run the register. I would make sure the customer found the product that they were looking for and quickly get them checked out so that they could be on there way. While running the register I would also restock the front end candy and cigarettes. Some days I would help restock the store with the new order that comes in from the Distribution Center as well as help with planogram resets.
good,There's good and bad days. The management team is amazing but in the area I work in you always have to expect the unexpected.
good,"Depending on location, team characteristics vary. Many things to learn and acquire different experiences. Most stores are very fast paced and does not pay well enough to compensate with everything."
good,"Type and fill prescriptions, insurance claims, doctors and insurance calls, inventory management great customer service assistant...etc..."
good,I learned some valuable customer service skills that will definitely help me in the future. Overall it is a good job it just bored me since there wasn't a lot of customers.
good,"Got as many hours as i wanted (overtime), manager worked with my schedule, company offered insurance for pt employees."
good,"Excellent company to work for. "
good,"Meeting your patients and knowing them personally, helping them navigate the complexities of their medication makes the job satisfying."
good,Enjoyable to work with the managers at Sears. Not a very productive institution for the placement of the building was horrible and not much traffic.
good,"I would come in right on time, punch in my register, get to cleaning aisles, maybe even attend the customers either waiting to be checked out or that would by standing by with a pharmaceutical questions, handle any over stock, inventory, new sale signs were to be hung, keeping the pharmacy clean was a must. Hardest part of the job was dealing with co-workers who would bring their personal issues with them to work. It would be very obnoxious, but never anything to hold me back from my duties. Best part, was definitely the management experience."
good,"As i work in extremely busy environment,a typical day at my rite aid is pity busy,,"
good,As shift supervisor I supervised 10 employees at a time I was in charge of managing the money and providing customer service. It was also my duty to ensure that the store always maintained a grand opening appearance.
good,"on a typical day at work I just handled the register and the front end of the store if anyone needed assistance and I didn't have customers I would assist with the photo center or help the customer complete a western union transaction. I learned how to properly stock,price changes, and I also learned to handle money at a nice pace. management was frequently changed so it wasn't  that great of a relationship due to inconsistently. The most enjoyable part of the job were my shift supervisors, my coworkers, and my daily routine customers"
good,">it had its ups and downs"
good,Enjoyed my time here. Only complaint is lack of personnel. worked with a great team.
good,A typical day at work involves hands on training with employees and exuding excellent customer service amidst all customers. expeditiously one learns how to delegate and how to multi task. Co-workers as well as management learns from one another on  day to day basis however it can be difficult when dealing with a co-worker who doesn't  have the same passion for the tasks at hand as yourself.  The most enjoyable part of the job is a when a customer acknowledges the hard work being done and thanks me for great customer service and help.
good,really nice place to work but not very flexible management was kind rough i learned a lot on leadership and management the hardest part was when we would fall behind co workers were great
good,"A typical day at work was rather mundane, however some co-workers were definitely very fun to hang out with. I learned how to deal with western union checks. The management of the store could have been better. My co-workers were friendly. The hardest part was trying not to be bored. The most enjoyable part was sweeping the floors with the gigantic broom/mop."
good,Rite Aid is a company that promotes within giving their workers opportunity to accomplish whatever they like.
good,"Lots of different kinds of tasks, everything from doing office work, to stocking and moving product, to helping customers and running register. I enjoyed working with my coworkers, we were like best friends and worked as a team to accomplish the many tasks. Hardest part of the job was priortizing tasks and meeting the very strict deadlines of those tasks. I really enjoyed working with the customers, a lot of them I knew by name and was always very friendly, we could actually talk about things. I think that it made a difference."
good,I have a very good team of people that I work with at Rite Aid and I have enjoyed working there so far. I like interacting with customers and doctors but only drawback being there is not much career growth. I am looking to grow my career further.
good,Rite Aid has very dedicated and hardworking managers who I feel may be a little underpaid....
good,"I've worked at numerous rite aids across new york state, and all of the managers and pharmacists I've worked with have always had my best interest in heart. The company strides itself on recognizing personal achievement, and always makes sure everyone is on the same page working towards the same goals. The biggest issue with the company, however, is that, due to its size, it is truly hard to work your way up in rank. Employee turnover in all the stores I've worked at is rare, meaning that even though you may deserve a promotion, expect to wait another 2 years to get it. Along with that, pay is not great. Starting out, you about a .20 cent raise every year which is nothing. Overall, a positive experience, but not necessarily great for the long hall."
good,"A typical day of work, would consist of helping customers and making sure they found everything okay, stocking shelves, facing the store. What I learned most is how to multi task a lot better. For instance, if I was a first check, I would have to make sure to greet a customer and make sure that one was getting great customer service while I was stocking shelves or making a planogram. Management was very helpful and really understanding. The co-workers were super nice and made going to work fun. The hardest part about the job was in my opinion the planograms. The most enjoyable part was dealing with customers all day."
good,On a typical day my job was to provide customer service. It was also my duty to keep my area and the front end counter clean.
good,"scanning,cutting,stocking"
good,"I had various Jobs, I made sure that all 29 store had the adequate amount of tech hlep for the day. taught Infustion class for Company,"
good,"Ringing up customer, putting up sales tags and maintaining high level of customer service."
good,the job was very domading and i gave my all to the job but they was selfish
good,"A typical day at Rite Aid was always that of a moving quickly and efficiently. Being that customers were always within the building, I was greeting individuals while continuing to stay on top of my work load. If i was in the office I was doing a number of things from running reports, conference calls, scheduling, payroll, time sheet review, interviews, new hire paperwork, training, weekly sales ads, ad ordering, preparing bank deposits, balancing cash drawers, price changes, processed recalls,transfer merchandise, plan-o-grams, etc. While on the sales floor, I had to enforce policies and procedures, stay on top of the appearance of the salesfloor, interact and receive merchandise deliveries from our Vendors, inventory preperation, assist the pharmacy when needed, etc."
good,"It's a job and it's customer service. There isn't much room for advancement, especially in the pharmacy. Technician is as high as you can go. The management environment is stressful, especially when the front end and the pharmacy don't get along. You don't take your work home with you, though, which is a major plus."
good,"Always bussy, bad management, good co-workers. i donot like reducing help hours."
good,steady not busy day in filling prescriptions
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers and the customers.
good,"I worked in a steady work flow. I did computer data input, counted and packaged medication, billed insurance companies, dealt with doctors offices, planograms, customer service, clean and stocked"
good,"Its a good job with really nice workers. The management team is organized, and have well manner managers and they also respect their workers. Its not a hard job at all to maintain."
good,"Cashiering, customer service, one-hour photo, pricing, making displays, cleaning, and stocking."
good,The best part of this job is communicating and helping the customers.
good,"Love my job.. Wish I got paid more. Managent is good, always work around my needs and give me time off when needes. Work around my busy schedule all the time."
good,Great place to work. Helping customers with their needs. Can be challenging if you let it.
good,okay to work here just don't expect to move up as fast you want to. the older people whop have been there longer get the full 40 hrs so don't expect to get the full 40. great benefits they help with education purposes
good,Store was ver convenient and close to home which made it so much easier to work any hours. Loved my manager and customers. Only problem low pay minimal wage😳
good,"Great place to work. Advanced pretty quick through the store ranks. But I got hurt on the job, and that's when things went downhill. They treat you very differently if you get hurt"
good,I loved working there in the beginning I still do. I don’t like that your pay rate don’t increase enough for the time I been there I think my pay rate could be better.
good,"As a Rite Aid manager you are essentially a merchandiser.  Yes you have to watch your bottom line, Payroll, ordering, expenses, and a tight budget, but if you are adept in those areas, you will have no problem.  The job can be very monotonous.  Merchandising will take up the majority of your day.  Putting away deliveries, hanging an extremely large amount of sales signs weekly and several planograms to reset per month.  My experience with management has been  very pleasant.  I am still learning after 9 months with the company.  My training was very poor, but  having the experience with retail, most places throw you to the wolves after a few days.  All in all, I am happy with my position."
good,eas jon as long as your managers are cool.The pace at rite aid is very fast and abundant . Also very competitive although no room for growth. All in all it’s not a bad place to start out if your trying to build your resume and get costumer service experience.
good,"The management and other coworkers were awesome, some of the nicest people I've worked with. They were really a family there, and they cared about the customers a lot. "
good,Overall was with the company for 6 1/2 years but company was going downhill due to Walgreens merger and losing money. Many positions were eliminated as well as my own.
good,needs better management and less stress on the employees that work there. need to give them some feed back sometimes on how well there doing some encouragement always helps
good,"store management great to work with, like one big family.  had a good routine with other techs in the store.  very flexible with scheduling.  nothing bad to say."
good,Nice line of work with modern and leading technology for the sector.  Constantly working to improve customer experiences through innovation and technology.
good,"The corporate solution to any problem at the time was to throw money at it.  They had one or two good managers , the rest were poor at best.  Made a lot of money there"
good,"My experience at Rite Aid as a cashier is that it is a great job for people entering the retail world. Very simple and easy tasks come along but are seldom. As long as you’re there on time and do a good job it is not out of reach to move up as a supervisor and get management experience. That being said there are negatives working in a place like Rite Aid. The environment is very boring and depressing. You have the same regulars coming in daily. It’s not terrible but the job could definitely be better if there were more people on during a shift. There are typically two people working in the store excluding the pharmacy, which can lead to some running back in forth from the register to the floor to finish a task. This can be frustrating for not only the customer but for you as well. To top it all off you’re making minimum wage."
good,it is very slow going and very demanding for physical labor and mental focus for the cash and also helping customers with their need all in all it is a very nice place to work i would recommend it
good,This company promotes value and ethics for customers but not so much for employees. Hard working people are not rewarded properly and not compensated enough.
good,"I played a key roles in managing 31 stores in my district. We led in payroll and compliance metrics often. I had bright and eager employees. We became more than just associates but some as close as family. I wouldn’t change my experiences their for anything. Rather good or bad, because they have made me a better person today."
good,Working at Rite Aid while I was in high school was beneficial.  I worked between 25-30 hours a week and was able to maintain my school work.  The hours were good also.
good,"At Rite Aid it really depends on your District Manager.I was fortunate to work with the best...I did have some challenging DM'S along the way.I was always able to adapt, I am a team player an a hard,smart worker."
good,"I worked here after school hours part time to get some money and experience in the workforce. It was relaxed, usually slow during the night hours. Overall a good job for someone still in school."
good,My typical day at work begins with stretching and hearing announcements for the day. Everyone   gets assigned with what they need to do from the supervisor. Management is easy to approach to and everyone gets along. Rate and consistence are top priorities makes for the biggest challenge. Knowing the fact that everyone is easy going and the pay and worth the push plus working within close proximity to my home make it a good job and company to work for.
good,"okay place to work, had a lot fun days with great coworkers holidays got pretty busy, some locations are a bit better than others. selling liquor always brought up issue because they make you I.D. every customer and some people get fussy. otherwise the regulars there are nice"
good,"Great work place and culture in most areas, running business as if its your own, great system technology and training tool to get the job done. Customer satisfaction culture in unique...."
good,"Rite Aid is a great place to work, especially for those seeking a first-time job. The environment is very positive and the management works with your needs. However, after 2 years of working as a cashier I was never given a raise or promoted to shift leader even though I expressed desire for both of those things to happen."
good,It is a good company to work at. You have to work smart and not hard to be able to achieve all the work you need to do. The hardest part of the job is when merchandise come in the truck.
good,"fast paced, great staff, flexible schedules, paid vacations, paid holidays, no OT, holiday pay, good support from upper management, clear expectations"
good,It is a fun workplace. Keep in mind it is retail and customer service. So customers come first.  Otherwise it is a fun workplace to work at. The management is always good looking out for the team.
good,busy work place a lot of multitasking and i learn how correctly answer phones and multi task and how to properly greet people.the work places is very diversity and the haredest part about the job is making sure the customer leaves happy and the job has its reward see people smile smile and hearing about they day and putting a smile back on their faces.
good,I work mon-fri sometime alone with just one pharmacist. days can go smoothly or can be very stressful. been with the company for 9 years and there is no room for growth and pay is at a low for being there for 9 years.
good,It’s a nice place to work nice environment and you meet all kind of people everyday and you do have your regular people that shop with you all the time.
good,"Working at Rite Aid was stressful, however, I enjoyed the overall responsibilities.The stores are constantly changing layouts and I enjoyed setting up and bring down aisles."
good,"A lot to learn but worth it if one decides to pursue a career in pharmacy. A high-pace environment. A lot of interaction with customers. Friendly, enjoyable work experience"
good,I enjoyed my time at the company it was difently room to growth as far as moving and advancing in the company it was simply about what was you willing to put in.
good,"Very fast pace helping customers to fit their needs, menu projects to be completed on a daily basis. Everyday is different as far as required tasks to be completed. Great teamwork with fellow Associates. The hardest part of the job is having to multitask, and having two stop a particular task at hand and answer customer service calls whether it is at the register, telephone, or somewhere on the sales floor. The most enjoyable part of the job is our friendly customers and the dedicated employees who I work for with great teamwork."
good,Horrivle amount of hours for staff given to each store but its not a bad job. Chill management and stuff. Not much advancement available though. And not enough staff
good,"Not much to say regarding Rite Aid from a cashier's standpoint.  I wasn't mistreated, my hours were well-communicated and consistent, and my coworkers were easy to get along with."
good,"Multi tasking expected"
good,i enjoy working for rite aid i just am currently having trouble with the the scheduling it gets busy sometimes too busy and i am the one who is more experienced in billing insurances and filling prescriptions so every one comes to me and i have a hard time to get my work done because of this.
good,It was a great experience working for Rite Aid working with customers and co-workers has a team to get the job done everyday was a new adventure with all sorts of different  personalities eveyday
good,"I liked working for this company , they worked around my school schedule. They offer great benefits. The environment is nice. Everybody is friendly at Rite Aid."
good,"In the time that I have been working for Rite Aid Pharmacy, I have definitely learned that it's not a company for everyone. You definitely have to possess confidence, knowledge, and strong communication skills to manage."
good,Great environment to work in and the company really seems to care for their employees. Ability to choose a great work schedule and choose which location you want to work at.
good,I was responsible for opening and closing procedures. I ordered supplies and stock. I faced and filled merchandise. I really enjoyed working with customers and my co-workers.
good,"I was in management in Oregon. The people I worked with from the cashiers to the store manager, were a real family. They were by far the best crew I had ever worked with. They all helped me through my tough time. "
good,"overworked employees, overall good work environment with good benefits and job security. Should focus more on healthcare rather than just corporation"
good,Love the company and it is a great place to work with excellent benefits but I was commuting too far. In search of something closer to home.
good,"Rite Aid is an exciting place to work because I enjoy interacting with my fellow colleagues and the customers.  I have acquired numerous skills from working here, such as time management skills, customer service skills, communication skills, and pharmacy data entry skills."
good,"I learned a lot about customer services, management was great, there is room to move up the ladder but the pay is less than good. Should be making way more as a manager."
good,"- Running the cash register"
good,"Rite Aid is a place of strong values, loyal customers, and friendly workers who make the shopping experience of people an experience and not just a trip to the store. Since Rite Aid became a Plenti partner, our business has gone up and people can now enjoy great saving on items that they want and need."
good,it was a good first job. That taught you how to be responsible and act as a grown up. the hardest part of the job was off the loading the truck when a shipment came in. management was ok.
good,"I love Rite-Aid don't get me wrong but bosses are salaried with very low expectations. A chaotic environment where your boss goes home early and then blames the team for not getting everything done? Sounds like a movie to me, or Rite-Aid"
good,The customers are great. The managers can be unnecessarily rude but they do work with your schedule. The pay however is horrible I have worked here for a few years and don't even make 8 dollars. I have received a couple of rewards for excellent customer service and only get a gift card to rite aid. The raises are a complete joke. I would honestly apply somewhere else because its hard to make ends meet with this pay.
good,Good working environment. decent compensation. Get your leg in the door in healthcare if all you have is customer service experience.
good,Was fast paced. learned a lot. Managed my time well. Really wasnt a hard part. Enjoyed meeting all the new customers and filling prescriptions.
good,"make pallets and clean station"
good,this job was enjoyable for the most part everyone was very friendly to me and work was always completed on time. I learned the stocking and selling of prescription drugs.Co-workers were really friendly to me and kind. The most enjoyable part of the day was the am shift before it got to busy we got allot out the way.the hardest part of the closing time allot of customers trying to come in last minute and we were ready to go home.
good,Its very busy the work will keep you very busy but overall its warehouse work so it's work
good,I was left alone at the register a lot. Costumers still from the store and we call security but no one came. that's why they where all shut down in Las Vegas.
good,"Good day long as I was doing planograms or Mods, setting up of the aisles. Enjoyed my job"
good,I worked there as a cashier part-time. A typical day would be standing at the counter and ringing up purchases. I would also put up sale signs and displays and help customers find things. The manager and my co-workers were very friendly and helped out when I needed it. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I wasn't there full-time and I could always get the days off that I requested.
good,"Good Benefits and work environment"
good,Friendly people to work with. I learned to always stay positives even through the hard days of work. Customers made this job a challenge but also made it fun new faces and bright smiles always motivated me to be a better worker. The people i worked with is really what made this job  a place i wanted to work always smiles and positive attitudes. A typical day was being a cashier not the best place to be thats what made the day long and hard I am more of a hands on work hard dig deep type o f guy not a stand still type. 
good,Loved working for this company . Treated me like family always and we worked together as a team .
good,My job at Rite Aid consisted of dialing remotely into the stores and making repairs on  the equipment so as to keep the stores up and running. We became very close to the other co-workers and depended on each other to help on difficult situations. I dealt mostly with the California stores. In bad weather the company would put us up in a hotel close by so we did not have to weather the bad winter storms. It was a  new experience each and every day.
good,"Been with the company for some time and it has been a remarkable ride. Workload can vary from store to store. Staff members can also vary from store to store. Some pharmacist can be very flexible while some can be very challenging to work with, especially floater pharmacists who are only there for a day or two and heavily rely on tech's efforts. We are a busy little pharmacy pumping out 200 scripts on average per day with sometimes one pharmacist and two part-time techs with no cashier and w/o script pro filling machines! You are expected to follow workflow which includes typing, counting, filling, bagging will-call, daily returns, bi weekly outdates and overstocks, ordering, answer phones very frequently, make a ton of reminder calls, cashier, clean, insurance problems, file papers, flu shot promotions, vaccine promotions, discount program promotions, survey promotions, refill daily supplies, maintain printers, faxes, weekly stock unloading, medicare, county and medical billing, TARs, Prior Auths, 15-minute guarantee.., multi-task most of the day, train externs and pharmacist interns. Staying overtime is often required and sometimes you have no time for breaks esp. during peak flu season. Our particular location deal with one of the most difficult customer base who are very demanding and sometimes verbally hostile towards the pharmacy staff. Patients may often try to challenge you to give in to their wants and try to dictate your job/knowledge. There are those very few though who truly appreciate your care and concern for their health. Perks include health and prescription"
good,"I worked at Rite Aid for almost 4 years and I enjoyed it. I was able to work in the front of the store as well as the pharmacy. My managers and coworkers were great. I only made a little more than minimum wage, even after working for the company for years."
good,Enjoyed seeing new & regular customers on a daily basis. Very friendly co-workers. Hardest part would have to be unloading shipment/truck. Management was very friendly and flexable work hours.
good,"running register, stocking, closing down store, and providing good customer service!"
good,Honestly hated working there manger was very rude and hours couldn’t be flexible got very little hours couldn’t get off even if requested weeks before not alot of employees to help
good,Compensation as a pharmacist is competitive with other retailers. Great benefits and great leadership! I would recommend this company to my family and friends.
good,Worked with some really great people. Learned a lot of different things in such little time. Decent benefits. The hours were good. It didn’t take long to get comfortable doing my job there.
good,"The Rite Aid in East Stroudsburg is better than the one on N. Courtland St.  Great environment to work in the associates are great, helpful and they work together to make it a stress free environment."
good,it was okay and the people and staff for fast and friendly ... it really was not a chance to move up in the company for me but I really was not given that option either
good,Very strong teamwork inside the workplace but certain aspects pf the company will quickly turn you off or away. Employees are underpaid for amount of work they are responsible for.
good,Rite Aid is a family friendly place to work.  Everyone treats each other like family and is willing to help each other out.  They are very flexible if you have any issues with scheduling as well.
good,"Overall team is very good,  and everybody is very helpful, cooperative. I learned different new staff everybody. overall job is satisfactory. recommended."

good,Helps health care providers and patients by greeting them in person and by phone; answering questions and requests; filling perscriptions; pharmacy inventory
good,"Love the people I work with and how my store runs. The work itself can be boring for someone who is only looking at it as their part time job. But, it is good experience."
good,Working in one hr. photo all shift. Learning photo machine.  Working in the pharmacy. Managers were great. The hardest part was the photo machine was broke.
good,"Working there was fun and I have gained experience in sales, customer service, cashiering, making friends, teamwork, inventory control and taking the time to please customers"
good,"the work culture was okay most of the time. it was an equal amount of all races at this job as a team, but the only thing I don't like is that females can't do the same as the males."
good,"Organization skills, ability to multitask and problem solving is a must. Must be able to create new initiatives and ideas to increase revenue. Ambassador for all clinical events and company initiatives."
good,You can gain a lot of experience working here its a good entry level job but the job can get boring easily and the hourly pay isn't that good as well.
good,"Helping customers and taking vendors. I learned good customer service and how to delegate and use diversity. Management was fare and helped out a lot. Taking customers and keeping the lines moving. trunk days can be hard because its very unpredictable, it can come late early or even have extra palettes. I really enjoy helping and interacting with different people everyday as well as building bonds with my coworkers."
good,the customers are great the management and staff are absolutely amazing and fun to be around. The work is fast paced but easy to learn. Management works with you in order to create a schedule that works for you.
good,"was a good company to work for good pay good benefits,hours worked was not that bad had a lot of great people i met and worked with only reason i left was company was not doing great uncertain future"
good,"Easy, continuous work with great coworkers. Most customers are great, but some are difficult to deal with. You just have to know how to communicate with them. The pay could be better, but I think that is going to change in the near future."
good,Working by yourself a lot.  Work is good if you have reliable techs and partner pharmacists.  The hoyrs are long but the patients are polite for the most part.  Slow to moderately busy pace.
good,I have had good hours and great co-workers over the time I have worked here. The customers have been nice and pleasant to provide customer service for.
good,"Good place to work, was given a fair wage considering the job I was asked to perform. I was offered the opportunity to move up within the business but declined to pursue other career opportunities. Excellent health benefits for part time and full time employees."
good,"Typical days included planograms, reshelfing, product placement, changing sale ads and signs, cleaning, checking expiration dates, and ringing up customers. I learned a great deal. Learned how to use cash registers, serve customers. I learned how to interact with people in a professional manner. My time working with the pharmacy delivering medication taught me about pharmaceuticals, drugs, dosages. The actual driving improved my spacial memory and better learned the city. "
good,The people I worked with were wonderful.  Always willing to answer questions if I had any.  The customers were also great. I was sad to leave.
good,co- workers were very helpful and that helped me to work well with others in different organizations. management understood difficult situations.
good,it is good place to work. they have good work environment to work. actually I had good co-worker. we always help each others and we stick around and played good team work.
good,i worked there a long time injoyed it but rite aid is very money hungry and doesn't pay tention to the little ones liked it oooo kkkkkk oooo kkkk
good,"I work at a very busy Rite Aid, a typical day consists of answering phones, helping customers refill prescriptions and ring them up, counting pills, drive thru transactions, typing new prescriptions, and unpacking load and getting orders ready for that day. I love my co-workers, everyone helps each other and makes sure the day goes smoothly. The hardest part of the job is handling difficult customers in an elegant and calm manner, but I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is the regular customers that come in and you already know their name and you can just have a pleasant conversation and easy transaction."
good,My experience was a great learning opportunity . Its a lot of work and task that anyone determined to succeed in their pharmacy tech career should be able to handle .
good,"Keeps you on your toes with close to 400 scripts filled a day. Some days the harsh words of customers and sometimes coworkers can get to you, but the familiar and happy faces of our regulars always makes it better."
good,a typical day involves a lot of different task but customer service is #1. i like the flexiable hours and love having benefits. the people i work with make the job that much better. i have been working at many different locations.
good,"I enjoyed working at Rite Aid, my co-workers are very nice, we get a long well, I think this is a great work environment for students because of the flexible hours. However the pay rate is still minimal wage."
good,"Greeting and assisting customers, answering phones, packing out totes and keeping a clean work space"
good,it was very social and it keeps you busy. you meet new people everyday and the people are nice.the hardest part was the lines and all the people that came in.
good,"Food Rite makes available really great benefits including insurance and 401K. Most of the employees are teenagers and, for teenagers, the pay there is great. They are a christian company and you will have most holidays off or will get off early on those holidays. If you do what is expected of you, you will work there as long as you want. The management is sometime a little unprofessional."
good,A work day here consisted of being a cashier when it was busy and if not just restocking the shelves and phasing the store. On weekends i would place orders for the store. It was my first job and i feel i learned alot in it the only reason i couldn't advance was because i was still a minor. but i enjoyed it very much working here.
good,The most important part of the job is being able to work with people in my community. 
good,i actually enjoyed my time here. everyone worked as a team and treated you like family
good,"The Pharmacist's worked well with my school schedule. I was usually the only Technician so I was always busy. I was able to pick up hours by floating in other local stores.The management messed up my payroll and one Pharmacist's payroll a few times but the problem was solved and a check was cut in 24 hours. The rest of the store seems to think that the Pharmacy staff just stands there doing nothing but that is not true, we worked!! This happens at every Pharmacy from what I have heard. Saturdays I was out early enough to still finish school work and have a good night. Sundays I worked 9-7 with no break which was pretty rough. If you want to be a Pharmacy Tech, this isn't a bad place to start. There are Pharmacy Chains that pay a bit more to start."
good,"I ensured that each customer received outstanding service by providing a friendly environment, which included greeting and acknowledging every customer, maintaining outstanding standards, solid product knowledge and all other aspects of customer service. I accurately and efficiently rung on register and maintained all cash and media at the registers. I also communicated customer requests to management,   entered all media from register into the tally program.  Maintained orderly appearance of register area and supplies stocked.  Any other tasks as assigned from time to time by any manager."
good,It was a Eckerd Pharmacy before becoming Rite Aid .A good co. to work for advancement (Eckerd) Family Oriented/business. Rite Aid
good,Good workers and great management systems but overall I felt like I was the security rather than the cameras.
good,Fun to work there and learned alot.Advancement and promotions.
good,Everything was great except the hours and working weekends. Also holidays and being opening Christmas was the worst. Starting a family and I couldn’t do it anymore
good,A great job until I was laid off because of Corporate decesion. I enjoyed the hours and my flexibility with the workload. I gained retail experience as well as Outreach and got known in the community:
good,"A typical day at work is pretty relaxed. It is very slow, other than on weekends and holiday seasons. Working at Rite Aid, I learned how to be more alert when it comes to the workplace. I picked up a few extra skills that brings in more money. Everyone works together to get the job done.  The hardest part about being cashier at Rite Aid, has to be the standing on your feet for 8 hours (minus the 30 minute break). The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people, learning the regulars and what they always get. Developing a relationship with new people is always a good thing !"
good,"I enjoyed my job very much.Loved my customers."
good,"I loved getting to know the people you worked with. I had a good boss that would do anything to make you smile for the day. I enjoyed being part of the help process for the pharmacist. Taking phone calls, running the prescriptions, stocking medications, and helping as much as possible. Learning the generic prescriptions names versus the brand names."
good,"this company does a good job taking care of its employees. the new buy out with CVS is not going that well. I'm looking forward to working with a new company, and it will make me happy to provide this serve to my future employer."
good,This is a start up company that will advance in the future u will have a better work life and not to much stress some people are willing to help.
good,The time would fly by because I enjoyed working there! Co-workers are very kind and helpful! My favorite part of the job was to check the customers orders out!
good,"Rite Aid has it's pros/cons, I like working there because you get hours when you need them but I feel like they take advantage of the people who actually work hard, they over work you and they do not appericate the workers like they should."
good,"I like working at this job. It definitely has its good sides and bad sides. I like working with the people, and the fact that it is so close to home."
good,a typical day at work is systemic. working with Rite aid I've learned how to be diplomatic. I worked with a great team of managers and co-workers. The hardest part of my job was the unsatisfied customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the happy customers.
good,The pharmacist manager went an extra mile for the staff it was ok to work but wasn't really that impressive. The real thing that really bothered me was the organization of the medications as they had switched them at the last minute and it made things so confussing
good,"Depending on which shift you work, you will either open or close the store. I learned the following at Rite Aid. How to open and close a store in regards to the store alarm, setting up the cash registers, counting the safe and doing paper work. "
good,Being employed by RiteAid has been a great experience. As a Corp. it has taught me a little more about myself such as just how strong my skills of dealing with the day to day operation of a busy store  really are. I have learned some new methods of doing things easier and quicker.Its been challenging as well as rewarding.
good,Interacting with customers and employees.Everyone worked together to make the establishment a welcoming place to shop.
good,My managers were probably some of the best and nicest managers ive ever had. Great people. They made work enjoyable and taught you alot about the job.
good,During the time I spent at this employer things were very busy and slightly disorganized. This was due to a very high customer to employee ratio. Management was kind for the most part and willing to work with employees on scheduling. There was a mix of attitudes and backgrounds among employees but overall they were easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was getting the heavy workload done in time as well as balancing other pharmacy responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of the job was having an awesome pharmacy manager.
good,"As my first job, I have learned more than I can imagine at Rite Aid Pharmacy. Since my primary interest and goal for my future career is related in the healthcare field, this job served a strong purpose in making my first experience strong and supportable. Each day I learned information about different medications, wellness products, and GNC products. Along with continuous knowledge, I gained a strong experience in interacting with patients and customers and providing them with the best service. The best part of the job is realizing that you have helped many people. "
good,Lots of people are always developing memories and important moments in there life. My job was fixing and developing film and pictures through mp3 or usb. Also taking in and handling the stores assets of the film i develop and order new parts.
good,"Job is pretty simple. The main goal is customer satisfaction. Sometimes your day could be rough due to the customers that would come in. However, overall, the job was straight forward on your tasks."
good,"I went in as a temp and noticed right away they treat temps like there nobodies. They ask for you to meet a certain quote which is pretty easy but at the end they will let you go for the most irrational reason. Theres a lot of favoritism going on especially with certain leads and when you call it to the mangers attention they don't pay no mind to it. They make temps work harder then permanent employees, the rules practically get thrown out by permanent employees. Talking is a big no no which its understandable but certain leads make there temp employees feel uncomfortable, they will lie and deceive the mangers just to get you laid off and no ones speaks up because temps have no say so in anything. Certain leads are very unprofessional they just stand around gossiping about very one to other employees. They act like its high school.  Honestly over all its a great company they just need to get more professional leads"
good,"Rite Aid is a great place to work at its a slow relaxing environment. Thers always something to do runnimg the cash till, stocking the floor as will as helping out all tge customers who walk through the door. The best thing is all the employees work together, as well as getting along with each other as a team."
good,Nice atmosphere ppl great to work with always helpful team work was required punctuality and respect each other discounts were very convenient at check out
good,The hardest part is explaining to the customers that we do run out of medications. Another one is that people think medical covers everything.  The system would improve if there was a better way to document information.
good,"The management is kind and hard working. Customers are mostly elderly which can make transactions difficult. Like all corporate retail chains, the corporate heads are unwilling to listen to their stores."
good,friendly co-workers and customers which you normally interact with on a daily base. Multiple tasked which are being done daily and also learning about new products.
good,"Every time I would come into work I would first organize what ever I thought seemed out of place. Everyone was friendly and I enjoyed management and my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was during rush hour when everyone wanted to pick up their medication. The lines were long and you could sense the patients getting frustrated. So the hardest part of the job was making sure ALL of the patients left with a smile on their face. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet and build a relationship with the customers. If you're working with a great team, then you can conquer and face any issue with ease!"
good,"The vital and progressive experience that I have achieved in my job as a Certified Pharmacy technician at the Rite Aid drug store in Ashland, Ky. I have had a strong bond with my team. With the skills to work accurately and face challenges, I have been assigned various significant jobs during my tenure at the drug store."
good,"Busy work day, to be able to mulitask, leadership skills, not being able to take a break, when it was time to get off"
good,"The rite aid on Fairfield Ave in waterbury has the best front end manager ever, the current pharmacy manager not some much. If you want cashier experience I'd say yes go ahead but pharmacy well unless you want to work for a dictator that belittles you and doesnt train you then yeah go ahead otherwise I'd say no."
good,"Worked with my school schedule, good management, easy part time job for a young individual in school, decent company. Has low pay, expected to work most nights and weekends, customers can be difficult, some store policies don't make sense."
good,ii come in and i halp customer and i do receiving cash register drawers and preparing deposits and ordiering changes from the bankmy co -worker was good. the hard of the job try to make customer happy and the most in enjoyable thing in make them hoppy
good,"I worked here for a few years, the pay wasnt too good but the pharmacy personnel really are great. I think there could have been more benefits."
good,Not really any room for growth they will hire a outsider before promoting within which is not good. I was with the company 3 years.
good,I was there a little over a year and  just recently got let go for productivity.. which mind you I was never told about in my orientation.. exhausting job when Monday thru Friday u work 50 hours a week.. then they are making Saturdays mandatory.. heard the grapevine it's 8 hours.. how is it fair to only give us 1 day off and rest and come do the same amount of hours every single week..
good,"I think that Rite Aud is a great job to have but due to the lack of management and responsibility, I wouldn't recommend the job to my friends. I feel like I do a wonderful job but I am underpaid."
good,Greeting customers at the door as they walk it.Asking them if they need help and if so showing them the product.Ringing them up and ask them how are they.And just help management out with what ever they are doing.
good,"Young and energetic, great experience learning new things. Second job while in high school. Do I was excited about making own money. Overall really enjoyed working."
good,If you had better and understanding management even HR and all needs better training. If people were more open to change and how to make things better I would love to work there.
good,I really liked working at rite aid meeting new people helping were I was needed helping customers locate what they were looking for calling  other rite aid stores if  we were out of the product
good,"Well if you are a college student studying for that line of work its good. But if not, not good for a older person. Young people did not want to wait on the counter or drive thru. Was very frustrating. plus the pay is not great for all the work you do"
good,I  stocked 1 hr a day through the school year. it was a lot of fun i got to do work with friends from school bummer part was i had to give up my lunch hr.
good,"Working in retail setting handling day to day operations: filling scripts, inventory and waiting on patients"
good,Its ok to work if you need a job. Its almost a family there it depends on the shift. Some managers don't won't to work.I worked there to 2 years it was ok but them customers late night did it for me
good,Its an ok job for when you need customer experience. I liked the job but if you are unionized the pay is ridiculously horrible. The benefits arent really that good too so that is just something to take into consideration
good,This was really a stepping stone for me. After awhile I was ready for something more. My co workers were ok to work with but there were some areas there that can use some attention
good,my work here was mainly customer service. the scheduling was poor and would leave me to only be able to do customer service instead of other duties.  .
good,"Responsibilities were to file prescriptions, cash out customers, and answering telephones. Most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers, great people, great atmosphere. The hardest part of the job was not receiving many hours."
good,"A typical day at work. on the cash register"
good,A typical work day for me consisted of stressful long hours that werent on scedule 
good,"Assisted pharmacist in dispensing,compounded and counseled patient was very exciting for an intern"
good,Working at Rite Aid was a very interesting job. You got to meet alot of people. It also could be very stressful. One thing made me like my job is that I could help people.
good,The pharmacists at Rite Aid are very knowledgeable and it was a fast-paced work environment. You have to keep up with the weekly online training and the flu clinic customers.
good,5 1/2 years and the most horrible managers ever seen. Only benefit was that I was able to start my family (had 2 kids) while working here. Working for them sucked. Pay raises were not enough to keep up with what new hires were making coming in the door.
good,The customers are so sweet and there are many regulars. There was a big turn-over rate due to poor management who were very cruel and not understanding with their employees.
good,"Short hours a week, inconsistent work hours which makes it difficult to plan other aspects of life. Not enough pay to survive. The other associates  made work there almost enjoyable."
good,This is a great company to work for ..the people are nice and friendly..it is a well safe drug free environment..there is a grocery located rite next to the store.
good,Learned so much from this job. Management wasn't that great and they couldn't afford to pay you anything other than the bare minimum. There is no place for further advancement. State certified techs and regular techs get paid the same
good,"A typical day at work changes daily you can be a cashier one day doing daily cycle counts, monthly plan-o-grams or possibly evening facing. I have learned how to change a setting of a display, deal with a difficult enviornment, and handle situations in serious matter. I disagree with management often for reasons of the fact that there are managers who knows less than me and much of anything they are positioned for. My co-workers are my co-workers we are great team players to one another. The hardest part of my job is to walk in not knowing whats on the to-do list for that shift. The most enjoyable part of my job would to be to make people satisfied with the help I have provided for there visit in our store."
good,"Much of the work was put on only a few employees, not all employees finished their work and management did not care. Corporate favors men over women and starts men off at a higher wage and gives higher raises. The most enjoyable part were a few coworkers but most important my customers. I learned a lot about pharmaceutical when I would cover in pharmacy and enjoyed it very much."
good,"The job itself is rewarding, but the compensation is below poverty.  They work you a solid shift without breaks because it is so busy and management, while friendly doesn't know how to manage.  There isn't any work ethic."
good,"filled Rx"
good,"this was my first job, and after almost 2 years of dedication to it i was made to make a choice, either shut up or put up. and i didn't like  that"
good,I would have gladly stayed with the store if they were a little more giving with hours.
good,great in between classes job! very fast paced depending on the location the you work in. the job also requires a very keen memory in learning the different medicines.
good,Temp job for the holiday season. Manager did not work with well with the employees. All the other employees were great to work with. Enjoyed the work environment
good,"They would really work you until your feet hurt. No chairs, the benefits are bad and honestly they gave to many hours to a minor. The only thing that was really good was the coworkers. They also only pay you 7.35$ Everyone is underpaid."
good,This job was beneficial when I was living at home. I worked part time and was able to take care of myself yet still balance my personal life and needs.
good,"Working all the day on the costumer service and cashier and i learning with that how to handle the money , updates with the new systems, how to be creative and friendly with the customer. There is nothing hard on the job .the management is so helpfully.the most enjoyable part of the job the group that i working with them."
good,It can be fast paced very challenging. Pay could be better.  Management can get big headed. Camera systems are very helpful. Cashiers take long to back up other cashiers on register
good,"I liked that I kept busy, the unpredictability could be good or bad in that field. It always kept me on my toes and definitely taught me how to adjust to things quickly and on the spot. I had to have problem solving skills"
good,Rite Aid isn't the best place to work for yet it isn't the worst. Trying to understand the way your coworkers operate is key and asking for help is also ok just try not to ask the pharmacist first try and always use the pharmacist as your last source just because they have the biggest responsibility in the pharmacy other than that be kind and patient with your customers and you'll get through the day
good,"Rite Aid was a deacent place to work, but I didn't like some of the other managers idealologies, and the benefits weren't really that great. You will have next to no vacation time nor sick leave."
good,No room for advancement financially. Expected to handle all aspects of customer service even those which should be addressed to the Pharmacy Manager and work load increased without proper financial compensations
good,the company is fair. the hours are horrible. its constantly standing and often quite stressful. I do hoever like the work and communicating with the public.
good,"Coworkers were clicky and unprofessional. Cleaning was only done by responsible employees and grunts. The majority of employees were lazy and worked hard at trying not to work at all. The assistant manager worked way harder than the manager. More often than not you can hear employees saying ""not my department"" instead of being helpful when available. Understaffed."
good,"When I joined the company everything was blooming on the surface and prospects looked promising, but then it all turned around when the owners started negotiating the sale of their best stores.  I did like working there and was relatively lucky with my co-workers, but sometimes it was too busy for the chores."
good,The coworks are very friendly. When the big truck shows up once a week I will stocked. I meet alot regular customers that are very nice.  My car broke down so i had to quit
good,The job itself taught me so much but it was very demanding job for very little pay. There was too many prescriptions to fill for few few techs and only one pharmacist.
good,"I work at Rite Aid now, but store is closing on 5/30 S Walgreens bought us out. I am looking for a new job closer to home.When I first started at Rite Aid 17 yrs. ago it was a great place to work,  kind of like the home town pharmacy of old. After the recent Ceo took over there has been less communication, (in my opinion), more waste of money, and prices going up all the time."
good,"I've been working at my current store for 8+ years and it is one of the most stressful things in my life!  The store manager is absolutely horrible. Very unfair with the employees. But in the pharmacy, the pharmacists are AMAZING."
good,"I was quickly double titled as the cosmetics pro and part-time cashier by a very unprofessional manager who seemed to not take his job seriously. I however saw it as an opportunity to show my talents in retail and exceeding expectations. They broke several laws by giving me shifts that were five hours apart turning me into a caffeine addict in order to keep up with my schedule but eventually I had to leave because the work environment was entirely different than portayed. The team work was a power struggle and the employee's were constantly at each other's throats. Not the work environment I was able to flourish in, so after the sixth call from my managers mistress and supervisors spreadig rumors causing me to kicked out of my living arrangements (a renter's nightmare, a bedroom rental), I had to hand in my resignation."
good,"Union job which would seem to be good except for if you are hardworking the lazy person next to you makes the same hourly, which is pretty unfair . Ok to work for would like more pay for all that we do"
good,Rite Aid doesn't get a lot of customers. The pharmacy is the busiest area. Evenings are busier than mornings and days for front checkout. The best part of the job is working as a team with the great group of people there.
good,My experience working at Rite Aid Corporate has been GREAT!! The Asset Protection Dept from the VP to the newest member on the team look out for one another!
good,"My job is very unique, it is not for everyone, hence why I am looking for a new one. MY job consist of walking around, talking to people, helping them and trying to introduce them to the pharmacist. I leabred that I am very good with people but again, they want you to harass people into getting vaccines, buying another item and trying to get them to switch to the Rite Aid pharmacy. There's nothing wrong with wanting to increase sales and customers but I don't agree with the way they do it. The hardest part of the job is try and get people to want to switch to your pharmacy and to set up community outreach. The most enjoyable part is that I can be my own boss."
good,upper management don't know what they are doing sometimes. And they wants to work magic with no hours. They like to put so much things out without thinking how we are going to make it happen when they are not giving you any hours.
good,This company was great to work for and it was a fun job interacting with customers and staff. Creating award winning displays.
good,Riteaid warehouse is a nice place to work if you are a person who likes a simple repetitive job. but you hav to make a 90% quota every month
good,"A typical day at work consisted of ringing people up on the cash register. Every other week we put out stock, and every Saturday we flagged new sales for the upcoming week. The management was excellent, and the coworkers were amazing. The hardest part of this job was time management. If a large truck came in one week, it couldn't all be put out in one day. As for the most enjoyable part, I love being around people. I don't know a stranger, and I can put a smile on anyone's face!"
good,"I LOVED every aspect of my job at Rite Aid as an assistant to the District Manager. I thought I was doing well, until a new partner came on board. I found out there are no loyalties when your job is threatened. I would have retired from Rite Aid, but wasn't given the chance. "
good,A typical day at work was very busy. I learned most of my knowledge of a pharmacy technician from this company. Some co-workers were friendly while others stayed to themselves.
good,"I learned many things while working at Rite Aid, I was first a cashier in the front end and was able to advance into the pharmacy as a cashier, then become a technician. My co-workers are basically family to me, whether they work in the pharmacy, or in the front end of the store. My favorite part of the job was dealing with the patients and customers of the store; building a one on one personal relationship with each and every person. The only downfall about Rite Aid is the management wasn't very up to standards. "
good,I loved working for the company. But the disterect manager did not like me.I would wiat on custamers and go out on floor to check shielfs.I am still in touch with my old co-works.The dilling with the dronkes.
good,"i was running the cashier counter,stocking shelves and also helping people find products."
good,They offer good benefits like insurance. You will learn how to handle difficult situations while still having a smile on your face. I miss my regular customers!
good,My best experience with Rite -Aid was meeting and greeting the customers. I always received great reviews from my customers concerning my service and friendliness to them.
good,"This company was amazing to work for when I was there, but the older (senior techs) that have been there 20+ years have the processing time in computer and we younger newer people don’t get much time to learn the system."
good,"A good  place to work in terms of coworkers and information you acquire. However, for some reason, my pharmacy manager continuously hired college students during the school  year. This resulted in people being overworked to exhaustion, There were many days, especially weekends, when I worked alone with the pharmacists because no one was available"
good,"The role of Wellness Ambassador is being constantly misused and abused by district manager, who was absolutely rude to employees and wouldn't consider any career advancements unless it was in his own interests, Not fair working environment"
good,This company had its pros and cons but for the most part it was a job and the company was bought. Great benefits packages and awesome employees but in the end it wasn't the best environment.
good,Workers had to work hard.Slackers got to slack-on the job. Once they seen that you are a hard worker they made you work hard !!! You can talk about sports and not have to work much.
good,"long days "
good,"Easy work, great for a first job. Management is ok. Some Unprofessional management members. Pay is minimum. Not much advancement opportunities. Uniform is required"
good,I was a young adult when i worked there.  I started as a cashier and moved up to pharmacy technician.  It has since completely changed but i would have to say my experience was mostly positive.
good,work days were slow. I worked at a location where people would come and steal almost everyday and there was really nothing employees could do about it. This job can sometimes be boring the same music is played every day of the week.. the job is very easy and laid back though.
good,A day at Work at Rite Aid it's mostly okay. Some days are really stressful and just everything rushed. Management some times not so well with workers. It should be fun understanding and communicating well with one another.
good,"Working at Rite Aid can be busy or you trying to think of something to do. There were times where they would tell us, act like your doing something. Even if we werent."
good,Working at rite aid was easy and simple sometime it can get overwhelming dealing with some customers but must times it’s fun getting to know others and meeting new people
good,"Typically I would walk around the store and make sure customers would find whatever they needed.  I learned how to manage money better, how to watch out for suspicious dishonest people.  The culture was diverse and a relaxing work environment.  The hardest part of the job was trying to find time to balance all of the maintenance work the store needed."
good,"It's a nice working environment, great managers, very relaxed and friendly. Customer are normally very nice and friendly. Very flexible around schedules"
good,"The job is not hard at all. Once you get use to your customers it can be enjoyable to work there. However, I had bad management so things didn't go smoothly."
good,I've worker there for 10years so I've seen a lot. Its a really good place for a first job. has a gym and a cafeteria. theirs also a basketball court and volleyball court
good,"I liked my managers well enough, not enough hours, little to no overtime."
good,"A typical work day at work is stressful but challenging and that I like, a challenge. An average day you encounter several thieves you have to approach."
good,I feel like working at Rite Aid has been very stressful. I am a perfectionist and I feel like even if I did something perfect I still worried it was wrong. I do not like messing things up so I am constantly worrying about how I am doing. Nothing is ever good enough for anyone.
good,"I love the people I work with but I don't agree with how Rite Aid's chain of management works."
good,"I could remember one Saturday we had a horrible truck delivery, my co-worker and i had to offload the entire truck by ourselves. We only had a short amount of time to get the produce off the truck because  we had to also pack out the items on the floor. The reason being it would be hazardous to customers, if the totes are left on the floor."
good,"Great place to work,good people to work with.fun when you got to redecorate for each season.Learned how be a cashier and customer service.The hardest thing I did was give my 2 week notice."
good,"Nice to see new people learning to get out of your comfort zone of being shy and talking to people. Friendly environment, my supervisors and manger are great people, I really enjoy my co-workers. They are very flexible with my home life of being a mother and a student."
good,"At work i run the register my entire shift. On top of that I deal with helping customers find the items they are seeking. I use a price gun to make labels for items. I use the same gun to get rid of damaged items, and to check products coming in and out of the store. I clean the counters often throughout my shift and at the end of my shift i clean the store and pull everything forward on the shelves. I have learned how to use a higher grade cash register and pricing gun and the guns different functions. My manager is very nice but she lets some things go that she shouldn't. Mt co-workers are nice good people but they kind of slack off and it upsets me. The hardest part of my job would have to be truck day because not only am I putting up stock, but i also have to run the register and its a lot of back and forth all day and it gets a little crazy. My favorite part about my job would have to be the customers because i get quite a few older folks in there and i love the stories and they love me."
good,"In each store, there are great employees who love their job and are willing to help co-workers whrn needed. I enjoyed customer interaction and working at the front end."
good,"My typical day was waiting on customers and trying to please them! Overall I did it fairly well. I learned allot on how to please people. I did enjoy seeing my ""regular's"" there. My biggest drawback were the hours. There was really no rhyme or reason to them. The schedule was often put out a the day before the week that you had to work, so there was very little planning in your life.You couldn't count on any real paycheck there. You did get rewarded though when you did good work. And not just an oral comment. Customers often called in and you were given a pin for this. A nice thing as well....is if you didn't get along w/someone, chances are the way they did the schedule, you wouldn't be working w/them allot. As always management plays a good part of your working environment.....there were good and bad and you deal with it."
good,"I worked for Rite Aid when they acquired Eckerd Pharmacy. So my initial job was with Eckerd. Upon the buy out, our job security bottomed out. We had pharmacists in Atlanta, Ga. not receiving pay checks for hours worked. By the time I left the company to work closer to home things were improving and I do believe the company was trying to make things better. All in all I would say it is a decent place of employment."
good,"productive workplace with some very special customers and co-workers. i learned alot while i was with rite-aid. i had worked in retail before but it was many years ago. my former manager was a special lady. she took the time to train me properly, she knew what my family situation was and worked me around that. the hardest part of the job was when our store closed and we had to be moved to other stores. the most enjoyable part of the job was the special people i was fortunate enough to meet. i miss them so much."
good,"i would open store and prepare all deposits...put all cash draws in at front end and pharmacy. checked all emails and any issues needing attention was addressed. by this time my staff would start showing up, get everyone set up for day.check in daily venders go to bank .re stock shelvess,, did daily counts on inventory, planograms placements of some venders stock. bank run for deposit and change.. payroll scheduling customer service coaching and motivating staff"
good,was a store clerk here so the position was always changing enjoyed that.
good,The jobs i did was okay and pretty easy and i enjoyed working with all the customers. The management on the other hand was not so good. They were rude and unfair.
good,"I will come in at 11:30am and I will set my work area I will start typing prescription that were already waiting for me, then I will start receiving new prescription from new customer arriving, I will handle any problem like calling doctors office to verify prescription, insurance claims that were deny or not covered by insurance companies, I will look for the medications count them and have them ready for the Pharmacist to verify, I will then dispense the medication to the customer, Before my shift was over I will clean up my work area and make sure everything was ready and done before I ended my shift and left my work area."
good,"Rite Aid was a place where I put my skills as a Certified Pharmacy Technician to great use.  The job was very fast paced.  I learned how to verify insurance, prior authorizations, and other facets of a pharmacy in which the general public has no idea they even occur."
good,yeah it was fun. this place made me come out of my comfort zone
good,Overall I would say the management is good and coworkers are enjoyable.
good,Working for this company was fun and being around family. I got to know the customers and their families. I also knew what they where coming into the store to buy. My coworkers was my family.
good,"typical work day, consist of doin managers job, while asst manager sat at back door and smoked"
good,Overall its a good company to work for other than the rate of pay
good,it was an okay job wouldnt want to go back and do it because of the scheduling
good,"Management was a good learning experience, Maintained the customer base."
good,"Rite Aid is where I did my extern for school. I have learned a lot during this last year plus. Unfortunately, Rite Aid does not pay enough for the kind of hours that I work or the work that I do. While I do love my job, i need more of an opportunity to make the money that I feel that I'm worth."
good,i am entitled to my own opinions. i love the workflow and style of the company except not big fan of the uniform colors
good,Co-workers and supervisor were great to work with and for. I lived 2 minutes so commute was very short.
good,"i went to work behind the cash register and perform money transactions "
good,i am a ADM of maintenance my typical day is to see how the building is doing have meeting with team to relay what needs to be do and to see how all the shifts made out the night before
good,"Retail can be stressful. It is a fast-pace work environment!  In today's society everything is ""NOW"". As a retail technician you have to learn to be flexible, multi-task, and willing to take initiative. There will be a lot of external noise ( customers, store music, drive thru, phone). Staying focused and taking a deep breathe is vital. Understand that you cannot make everyone happy all the time."
good,"Overall the job is for people who like to be social. Some customers can be upset due to lack of understanding (lingo and other insurance stuff tends to not be stuff people know) so be patient with them. The customers at my store are some of the sweetest people I've met. My coworkers are great as people, but they're personalities and work ethic make it hard to want to go into work on a daily basis. They're relatively decent at their jobs, however not everyone pulls their weight and attempts to pawn off their workload and creates a vicious cycle of such as the other coworkers do the same. New bosses were brought in as an attempt to rectify the situation at hand, however they seem to only have added onto it for fear of retaliation despite the company boasting its ""anti-retaliation"" policy. The higher ups in the company don't get involved unless its something negative going on that would look bad for the company despite countless attempts of talking with them. The pay raise rate is only good if you're starting pharmacy end and even then you don't make all that much. Manager has us understaffed so we are unable to get days off for sickness, emergencies,etc. without exceptionally hurting that days production which bleeds into the following days."
good,Its ok has its issues like most places. Not enough employees and no support from the companys higher management. The wages aren't the greatest to start so we struggle to find people who want to stay.
good,"Like every retail job, however my manager was cool and very understand.  We learn how to stock inventories and price check. It's just like a typical day at work."
good,Rite aid was a good place for me as an intern! Friendly atmosphere where I learned a lot! Fast pace very busy store the one I worked in and the manager gave me a lot of hours day and night times where I was able to experience all kinds of customers and their different needs!!
good,"I've been at Rite Aid for almost 6 years at this point, and I must say it's a good place to work. I have flexible hours and my boss is very accommodating with my schedule if need be. The recent push from corporate to focus on more immunizations has been a little more than frustrating though."
good,Enjoyed seeing other places in the region but missed being home.  Work was challenging and sometimes difficult but satisfying at completion.  Meeting other associates around the region was fun and made some good friends.
good,I enjoyed my job in a professional environment and gaining new job experience. I enjoyed working with my manager and coworkers. The pay didn't compensate for the work at the time.
good,"The job itself wasn't to bad, it was actually really easy. I thought I'd be okay doing overnights, however I had a really hard time adjusting. Ultimately, I had to leave because of it."
good,definitely was a good experience working here. union benefits and job protection. started out a cashier and rite aide offered me pharmacy technician training. i became a pharmacy tech and continued my career.
good,it was just like working any other retail job clock in work clock out wasnt a bad place to work just understaffed so overall nothing really bad to say except that the manager and head manager were stealing from rite aid cash for a long time so maybe beef up security they were caught and arrested
good,"Pretty basic job, sold a lot alcohol.  Seen some crazy people. Pay was poor and raises were only like .5 cents a year.  This was back in 2004-2008.  Worked with a bunch of great people."
good,This store has Western Union and it causes the most trouble. I have to deal with some of the rudest customers here. Do not like the hours. Ready to move on.
good,Rite Aid is a decent company to work for if you are a highschool or college student where you can learn the skills of time management and responsibility that go along with being in the work force.
good,"This was my first pharmacy position.  I started as a technician intern and then was hired as full time.  I learned a lot from them, and I think starting out in a big corporation was a good thing.  I learned rules,  laws and systems that work."
good,i enjoyed working at  warehouse. even though it was in fast speed it was fun because there used to be goal to reach up to that is why it was in fast pace.
good,They only hire part-time if your not in management. Their duty list is organized and well taken care of. You can learn a lot about retail at this employer.
good,the job itself is challenging at times but gives you a sense of ownership.  being in charge of the pharmacy as well as the store as a whole means being on your toes at all times.  taking care of customers is the number one focus.  being efficient and quick in everything you do is highly required.
good,"My time with Rite Aid wasn't all terrible but wasn't all bad either. I think it is a decent place to work, except the benefits/time off could be better. As well as, the pay rates. Other than that, it is a generally good place to work."
good,"The climate of retail requires that managers work a great deal of overtime and Rite Aid was no exception. The environment was not fast-paced, but it was a very detail-oriented job. You not only had to supervise staff, but oversee every other aspect of operations. It was a challenging position, low-paying position; however, as manager, my work schedule was flexible."
good,I enjoyed working at Rite- Aid. It was a smaller store. All of my co-workers were great! Worked as a team to get products on the floor while providing excellent customer service!
good,the work on a day to day basis is always changing depending on what is needed to do next. There is a typical routine of things that need to be done on a daily basis but other than that the work depends on whats in that day or what sales are running. It is all based on what is given to us.
good,Being in management you get 35hrs or 45. Some store managers are great and some shouldnt be managers at all.  I love my cashiers and pharmacy techs..  district manager is amazing and really cares about his employees..
good,"Very slow! You get assigned busy work, Best for someone as a first time job or who is n school and trying to work. All around not a bad working place!"
good,It is a good experience working with customers. You get to count pills and deliver excellent customer experience to the drive-thru and counter registers.
good,"Overall, I really liked my job as a pharmacy technician. I learned so much about the different kinds of medicines that are out there, and what they are,can be used for. This job helped me when it came to taking a Pharmacology class in nursing school. I also learned how to talk to certain people, as, every patient is not the same. Some need more attention, or more help than others.l Some do not want help of any kind, at all."
good,"Overall, I loved my time at this place.  However, they changed management twice in my last few months.  I was in a new position with almost no training.  I don't think that they compensate monetarily for as much hard work you are asked to put in.  A typical day at work could consist as few as 6 hours to as many as 12.  You were trained to care for customer first, yet you were given an almost impossible amount of work to do in that time.  The most enjoyable part of my time there, was the life long friendships I gained with my coworkers and my customers."
good,"I've gone through a couple different store mangers at this job while working as a front end associate. The worthwhile of this job heavily relies on the people you work with and is satisfying because of the  opportunity working with amazing coworkers and customers. It is very satisfying to make people's days better. That being said, the job can get boring after a while because you do the same things over and over every day. Upper management and corporate leaders are very unhelpful and obviously do not care about lower employees. They only care about the surface stuff/appearances. But hey...what do you expect? You're working for a corporation. It comes with the territory."
good,If you are just starting out and are looking for a way to gain customer service experience then Rite Aid is a good place to go.
good,"I was always worried about someone stealing, I learned to become more aware of my surroundings, the management was consistant with things that went on in the store. The worst part of the job was worry if I was going to make it home, my most enjoyable part of the job was making just one customer happy."
good,"It's a great job but it can be overwhelming for people. Sometimes the pay is little for the work you do. As I have heard. A typical day for me as a shift supervisor is doing deposits, working on recalls/,damages and out of dates, setting up plannograms, maintaining the store to look presentable. Looking way to make more sells. Freshness on perishable items. Pulling and removing the advertisement. It is a lot. Also, obviously I deal with customers complaints. The hardest part of the job is dealing some customers and associated who cannot comply with rules. I have learned its a lot more than putting up things in shelves and scanning products. The most enjoyable part of the job is mostly everything, its not busy work. You are actually helping improving the store, helping customers save money and every time you help a customer. We are like a family here."
good,"Overall it was a good job experience. It was my first job ever, I left because I was going back to school full time. My job taught me how to work together as a team and good customer service skills."
good,"With all that takes place in a retail pharmacy, my coworkers and I are able to help out in what ever way possible. My customer are my number one priority. I engage in conversation with each customer I encounter. The hardest part of my job is leaving when I'm scheduled to. Most customer look to me for getting overrides done for vacation or just filling their script in a timely manner. Because of this its hard to say,"" well I got off 15 minutes ago"". I just hang in there and help them and once the coast is clear and leave."
good,"this is just as normal and as simple as it can be. this is a small box retail and 1 truck per week with a limited amount of works. "
good,"Retail is terrible. However, the store that I worked at benefited from a decent customer base, and good people in management. The location was a busy downtown area, but business was slow at various points.  "
good,"For the most part, i enjoyed working at Rite-Aid. With the exception of the Store Manager & Assistant Manager, I enjoyed working with the Supervisors because I learned very much about store operations."
good,"It all depends what a person look for in a job and what to expect. I, myself, love to make those I work with laugh because it makes a more comfortable environment."
good,"stocked merchindise, matched numbers and picked as a handler, loarded and unloarded truck trailers with their destination. "
good,"A typical day as a pharmacy tech;"
good,"It started off decent, I for one think the pay is too low for each management position. You are required to do so much work, for such little pay. It makes the job harder to really stay focused"
good,"The demand for prescription drugs has kept me feeling secure at my job. Healthcare is a very stable, yet increasingly stressful, field. I have learned so much and continue to be excited each day knowing my future is on the right path."
good,After having spent 3 years in retail I do not believe this is the line of work for me. I am looking to further my education and land a position in my area of study.
good,I did make a lot of friends working here and I did enjoy my work environment. I tried very hard to advance from pharmacy cashier to technician but I was denied every time. They tend to take ambition as a joke. It has been a long time since I've worked there so it may have changed since then. I did however enjoy the fact that they taught me enough to do so well at Walgreens. The compensation was not very satisfying though. I felt that I did more work than what I was paid for.
good,"Rite Aid is a very busy work environment. I am constantly running around between the drive-thru, the front counter, the phones, and filling prescriptions. The people I work with are pretty fun to work with. We all seem to get along well with each other."
good,"loved the customer base, and did not enjoy the constant changing managers, co workers were always willing to help with problems and if you fell behind in a task"
good,"As a pharmacy technician, part of my job is to collect patient data (HIPPA) and enter it into our computer system, get prescriptions ready for patients, and then ring them out at the register. A typical day at Rite Aid is hectic, fast-paced, and can be very rewarding when a customer recognizes the extra mile we went to in order to keep them a happy customer. However, there are also customers who treat pharmacies as a drive-thru and don't recognize that there are certain laws and procedures we have to follow, and this is the hard part of the job: keeping patient with customers who refuse to allow you to do your job the way it needs to be done. It helps to have a good team to work with. Most of the team at my store is wonderful. Most of them are hard-working and talented and really do their best to go that extra mile for everyone, including their other coworkers. There are a few that don't seem to be interested in lending that extra hand, which means the rest of us have to pick up the slack, but that's something I'm learning to deal with."
good,i enjoyed working for this company. The staff was friendly and very willing to teach me what I needed to know to function professionally as a team member
good,"Nice place to work, always something to do. Workers are nice. Management not the best. Has worker favorites.. Best days are stock days, because your constantly busy and time flies by. Overall, its an alright place to work for a while."
good,"Typical day doing plan-o-grams weekly to monthly, unloaded trucks weekly of store ordered, ordered store supplies, opening and closing store, keep the store neat and tidy and faced products, manage backroom overstock, cover breaks for my cashiers, cashiering, daily deposits, paperwork, getting change from bank, counting in/or down registers, receiving ups or fed ex packages."
good,I loved working here and the customers was great. Employees respected me as I did them but management was horrible. She was eventually demoted and relocated. I loved living and working in a small town. Work was good and fast paced.
good,"Typical day at work, come in hang sale tags, greet customers, stock when needed. clean when needed. Never really had a hard time with anything but the gun to scan items. Never had problems with co-workers/managers. The most enjoyable time was when the season changed, we brought more customers in around christmas and halloween. Fun to see the kids coming in dressed up. What I learned about management was that no matter what position you're in, you will always need someone's help. I helped out alot when it came to my team."
good,"I would run the register, talk to the customers, and fill the prescriptions."
good,"I enjoy making conversations with the patients, I feel it makes them feel important and that their time is valuable."
good,"the working environment wasnt my type, so many rude people, work not being done on time,  patient transferring out. new mannager very two weeks"
good,The best part about working at Rite Aid is all the people I work with. They are simply amazing. I do love my job but I want to advance and I'm thinking the only way for that to happen is to work somewhere else.
good,"When I worked here, it was interesting meeting new people and to provide them with good customer service. I worked up front at the cash register and greeted people as they came through the door. The manager was really nice and always busy. My co-workers were also nice and worked together. The hardest part of my job was the odd hours that I had to work. I enjoyed meeting new people and to be able to help them find what they needed."
good,Good company for first job. company willing to teach new thing.
good,we are usually pretty busy so we dont get to talk much to each other but when we have a little time i have some fun loving people to work with. we are concerned about each other and close knit. we all work really well together and keep a good work flow going.
good,"A typical day for me was to fill the store orders, clean my box, stock my box when needed, help other co-workers when needed, and keep record of everything I did."
good,"A typical work day at Rite Aid would consist of running the register,stocking,running photo lab. I learned how to multi task working there. It was a very fast paced job. When i started working there i loved the managers they were very serious about there job. i worked for the same manager for a little over 4 years before he retired. The new manager that took his place was very different. He didnt care very much about anything that went on there. I loved my co-workers they were awesome. The hardest part of my job was having to pick up the slack of the manager. I loved working there i enjoyed my customers the most. Making them happy made me happy."
good,"Typical day of work day always something to do .Starting with Morning business reports ,to freshness program."
good,As I clock in I'm greeted by my regular customer who comes in to pick up her prescriptions and some grocery for the house. One of the biggest lessons I have learned from working here is you have to be positive no matter what the circumstances. My coworkers and managers are very helpful and supportive. One of the most enjoyable part of my job is meeting all types of people from different parts of world.
good,"A typical day at work starts with daily opening operations, check in vendors, cash handling, interaction with customers and executing the activities for that day. It was a challenging job, yet I enjoyed it. I love the daily challenges of it. The co-workers were excellent to deal with. The hardest part of the job would be trying to get everything done within allotted time with less payroll hours.The most enjoyable part for me is when I get to set the planograms and resets."
good,"I loved my customers and I loved my co workers, my issue was with the management or lack there of, my reason for leaving was because of the lack of care and concern not only as a Rite Aid associate but as a human being period. I had a emergency with my home and my manager was only concerned with when I would be back to work, and what I could do to save him a headache. I understand the situation was a inconvenience yet it was a accident that was out of my control so I felt disrespected and decided to resign and look for better opportunities. Overall, besides the poor managing the organization as a whole was a good one."
good,Hours are minimum. 12 hour minimum and 40 hour max. Been there 8 years and have only went from 7 to $11. That is with being a manager for 3 years. The pay is awful for what they expect.
good,It was a fairly good place to work at.  If I hadn't become homeless I may still be working there. My co workers were very nice. It would've been nice if the company went above and beyond and had some kind of extra help with financial aid or housing or Christmas gifts just something a little more to the employees.
good,"I had a great 10+ years at Rite Aid and should've stayed. The grass isn't always greener on the other side regardless of what is promised. People are great, Management makes poor decisions which add to the workload each and every day."
good,"The postions at Rite Aid are not sit down positions. You are on your feet from the start of your day to the end of your day, many times your day can be very hectic and challenging."
good,I was the Wellness Ambassador. I promotied the wellness 65 program for seniors. I set up flu shots and the clinic for vaccines for pneumonia and shingles vaccines. I helped with the pharmacy counter also put away the Monday loads which mostly consisted of vitamins for the GNC area for our pharmacy area
good,"Corporate, like all other businesses, would hesitate for raises, advancements and many other things what would very much so help the company keep its best employees. The reason I left is because I was, more or less, their head technician. However they would not give me the promotion (mind you I didn't even want a pay increase, I solely wanted the title). I loved all our customers and the job that I did there. But with being told that I could not have the title, I left. And they hired 2 people to replace me, because of all the work that I did for them."
good,This was my first job straight out of high school. It Is a great way to start off and get the fundamentals of being employed and understand the responsibility that comes with it.
good,Provided me with the knowledge to advance my career.  I worked on several different categories and learned various businesses.  We had a very analytical focus on decisions we made to drive the business
good,Rite Aid was a  good workplace. I did not have too many issues with my coworkers or with the business practices of Rite Aid. I sometimes clashed with the head manager. This was usually because he had problems dealing with his stress on the job.
good,"Rite Aid was a great starter company for me, beside the management issues and lack of trust with corporate I really loved the job. It taught me great leadership skills that i still use today"
good,The company is run well but growth opportunities are scarce.Some methods of performing tasks could be updated for more time and cos efficiency. It is a good job to start and learn the basics
good,"The lack of organization is the only con. Besides that, the job is not hard and there are good people that work there. In the department I work, a lot of heavy lifting is done, and the expectations are high, but the pay does not match the effort expected."
good,Management was always late and made up excuses. Inventory was always all over the floor still in totes to be put onto the shelves. Started out of high school so pay was fine at $13/hour.
good,"My job responsibilities included cashier, keeping aisles stock, cleaning up after work and customer service.  I was awarded for not selling cigarettes to a minor who ended up being a secret shopper."
good,"Unless you are management, your shift was night hours."
good,"Rite Aid was my introduction to Pharmacy work and it wasn't a bad job. The problem was the pay and that was my only problem. Although, I am glad I was able to learn pharmacy, I wish it paid better and I would have stayed with the company."
good,Fast paced atmosphere. Always something to do. The first manager i had was awesome she left her replacement wasn't as easy to deal with. The customer service is great.
good,Rite Aid was a great place to work they had  great management along with great benefits and a good hourly salary. I would highly recommend Rite Aid to my friends and family.
good,"The one I worked at wasn’t the best, I guess because of the management I was under. But the customers were very kind and the winter period was always a blast because we had people from all over visiting the area"
good,They don’t pay any attention to your availability when you are hired. They have favorites and we are constantly reminded by our boss that we are failures.
good,"All jobs got done, the management did not have a schedule set up for us si it almost always in the wind. We all worked together well, and for the most I enjoyed working there, I learned a lot about medications and drug interaction, as well as insurance issues. Rite Ad had been going down the drain though and I needed something that was more fast-paced"
good,"Hours are at least 2 nights a week and every other weekend. No overtime, limited vacation time, one week after your first year. No additional time until after 5 years. No sick time."
good,"It has been a lot of years since I worked for Rite Aid, all that I remember is that I left because I suddenly felt that it was a dead end job. After being promoted to a supervisor I still only made $8.50 an hour and had all the same responsibility as the store manager."
good,"I patricia ostine enjoyed working at rite aid as you can see from my resume provided. I learned something new everyday either from a team player or a customer. The management team was nice and understanding. Rite aid culture was diversed. The hardest part of my job was having to do my job and another co-worker, we they called out. My most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my customer smile."
good,"13 an hour for unarmed security in NY is kinda rare, but I definitely earn my keep. It's a dangerous job, when you make a stop you never know if the suspect is going to do something crazy, or just cooperate. Another big unknown is whether your boss (the area's Asset Protection District Manager) is going to have your back if SHTF. "
good,"Rite aid is not a terrible place to work. It's a good job if you're just getting outta school, but I wouldn't suggest it being your career if you're trying to have a family."
good,As a Customer Service Rep i felt undervalued.  But once I moved to a Purchasing Coordinator my skills were better suited and appreciated. But then again it was a call center atmopshere so that was expected.
good,"Always something to do whether it be stock shelves, inventory, updating locations and plan-o-grams. It was interesting and fun and nude to be in control."
good,Fast paced job which requires a person who can multi-task.  You meet so many types of people and also the different people that you work with is also enjoyable.
good,"This job is very demanding, as any retail position. Requires long hours and very few if any breaks. Have to have business knowledge to successfully run as store"
good,"With limited Tech to pharmacist ratio and more to be done, it's been getting stressful to meet the requirements and daily activities as a pharmacist. As an example,the set number of vaccinations by management to be given at each pharmacy and to be evaluated as performance of a pharmacist's success or weakness has been subjective and irrational because non of it is in the pharmacist's control."
good,"Some places have a feeling too it. Like a home away from home, or a prison you want to get away from. Sometimes you get this feeling but fro me working h=in this company has a on and off feeling. It just felt like a job after a while."
good,"I love my job, only because I am able to interact with people and help them with their needs. The hours are not what I want and also the pay of rate is not that great."
good,"this was my first technician job, I stayed for 2 years. I learned a lot. people were great but pay not so much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,pretty relaxed,,,,,,good luck"
good,I have worked here for over 7 years. Overall it is a very enjoyable place to work. Somedays the pay is not worth the work. You have to enjoy working with the public. I settle a lot of issues during the day as well as manual labor. Their is a lot of running around and is not for someone who doesn't want to be on their feet the majority of the day. The Corporate over the years has been very nice yet recently I have been having issues with my benefits and that is the reason I am leaving.
good,"The part I found most enjoyable was being able to move up in the company. Within a year I went from a cashier to a pharmacy technician in training until the Pharmacy Manager left. However, due to the store going through four different managers in 4 years I had to restart my position each time to move up."
good,"Great experience to work with Rite Aid.I like that store  for working as well as shopping.Nice & Friendly Associates.I learn alott of things in rite aid like customer service,cash handling,cash register.I am very happy to be a part or team member of that company."
good,When you get the layout of a store it becomes easier to find things for customers. I wish we could wear shorts it would be much nicer even if there tan shorts and navy polo
good,I learned just about everything I know from Rite Aid. It was my first job. It was a good job. I loved working in the photo lab. Not a whole lot of encouragement or rewards for doing a great job. Planograms I enjoyed doing because it made time go by and I love seeing the finished work that I done.
good,"Rite Aid Pharmacy is a good place to start in the field.  It gives an opportunity to learn all aspects of retail pharmacy.  The only problem is the computer system and also the quality of how the upper management care about their employees could be better, though better then some of the other places that you could go to.  Still would recommend as a good place to get your hand into a variety of good experiences."
good,There's not much to say beyond the title. Upper management has one thing on their minds -- money. What should be a company focused on the well-being and health of their customers focuses now on figures and profit.
good,I was able to gain this employment through a recruitment agency. I was able to learn a lot in a short period of time. This was a job I really enjoyed doing and was a great learning opportunity.
good,i love working there. i love costumer service. i do feel that there could have been better marketing decisions. but all in all was a great experience.
good,"The job keeps you busy which makes the day go by fast. The pay is quite low even if you are a supervisor, which is technically a manager when there is no other managers working. Also since its a pharmacy many customers can be difficult."
good,well i got there and had to just jump into the job. i was mostly on the register but some days i was out on the floor taking care of putting about the merch such as the make up department.
good,"Rite Aid has taught me alot customer service wise, I love my work team and the goals we work together to meet. We deal with alot in customer service and the pay isn't the best."
good,"At the time working at Rite Aid I had small children so scheduling became an issue, Over all liked working there as was able to cross train in other areas."
good,a day at rite aid was always fun. There were just times when upper management didnt really appreciate anything you did for the job. They always complained about any little thing
good,"In the pharmacy, it is such a great place to learn so much from the customers, pharmacists, and medications. The hardest part of the job is time management. Being able to get everyone's medication to them in 15 minutes is tough. However, to work with the pharmacists and providers is so educational and fun."
good,"flexible with my school schedule, earned vacation time, great customers, good coworkers. Decent manager. Horrible pay for the work they expect out of an employee."
good,"Fast pace environment. Payroll is very tight, and must be able to multi task in order to be profitable. Company P&L is different them most companies. Rite Aid adds in district cost to stores P&L. This then will show as a negative on your stores bottom line when you can not be prepared for all financial situations,"
good,I enjoyed working here as an intern and as a pharmacist it was good. I got along with my team and made sure I made my patients were happy with my service. Rite aid tries to help every individual to make sure satisfaction is achieved.
good,"I found it difficult to work with the low staffing, though I know that other pharmacies staff even worse. "
good,"I overall liked working at Rite Aid, it was a hard working, kind, friendly environment where there is always something that kept you busy throughout your shift."
good,"Working for Rite Aid has been one of the most pleasant coworker experiences I've had. The work itself is not my favorite, and the pay is minimum wage, but a great learning experience."
good,"good start in pharmacy. not real good pay, but was a good experience. staff worked well together and customers were very enjoyable. learned a lot while I was there."
good,wasnt full time so no benefits. other than that good work place with great co-workers and managers. great place to work while still trying to find your way after high school
good,If you like setting your own schedule and full time hours then this is a decent job. Dont expect much advancement. Pay is dependent on what district you work for.
good,I loved the people I worked with. The wage is low for the amount of work you do. Very stressful during Peak hours and the store is under staffed for sure.
good,working with rite-aid was wonderful i enjoyed every second i would still be there today if i did not have to relocate the people are great my boss was to die for she made a better person.
good,"A typical day at Rite-Aid is ringing customers out, unloading the trucks and putting items on the shelves, and responding to back-up calls from co-workers if the store was busy. I learned how to make the store a joyful and friendly work enviromment by interacting woth customers. The management employees were helpful aswell. I became good friends with the other co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the pressure of not messing anything up when the store got busy but I got through it successfully. The most enjoyable thing about the job is interacting with different people and customers."
good,"While working at Rite Aid in 2007, we had a decent team working together. We always had the support necessary by our manager and learned one anothers strengths and weaknesses and utilized those as well as learned to help one another grow where necessary. It was a wonderful environment at the time."
good,"on a typical day, I would work with customers and stock shelves. I was the head cashier. I learned how to work a cash register and how to handle customers who can act irrational. The management was very friendly. They have worked their for a while so they made the work place a home. I had few co-workers. Some of them were difficult to work with because they simply did not care about the job. The hardest part of any job is finding someone who shares your work ethic. The hardest part of this job was trying to close on time. Everyone would take their time. The most enjoyable part was being able to participate in fundraisers that support health."
good,I was a pharmacy technician for the company and became friends and family with my coworkers. I remember every customer by name in the pharmacy and their needs
good,This is a fast paced business where you need to get things right or you could seriously harm someone.  I enjoyed that challenge.  It's rewarding to see your patients happy that you are able to get their prescriptions filled and get them home as soon as possible because they don't feel good.
good,"I was an excellent pharmacist so I moved up to being a pharmacist manager very quickly. I learned how to manage a retail pharmacy and hire and manage coworkers. Set budgets and adhere to them."
good,Company recognizes hard work which is evident in my several promotions throughout my career. Planning and prioritizing is extremely important in this fast-paced environment.
good,"A typical day at Rite Aid would go something like this, First when i come in to open the store,I have to disarm the alarm,then clock in, Open the office safe and get the register drawers ready for the day and put them in the registers.Then i would open the big safe and do the deposit ,record the deposit in the computer,and print off the BDR for the day before,I'm normally their for a few hours by myself running the store till the cashier comes in.Once they are here i start doing the daily activities , greeting customers and making sure they find everything they want,and making sure the cashiers are doing their daily duties that need to be done on  their shifts, and assisting customers when needed."
good,"I learned how to run a cash register, take calls, stock and many others things. My co workers and I have never had any problems and my manager is awesome. The hardest part of my job would have to be inventory and the most enjoyable is helping our customers out as efficiently and quickly as possible."
good,"It was a good job, but they were not flexible with my school schedule. The hardest part of the job was scooping the ice cream. I enjoyed being up front at the cash register. My co-workers were really friendly."
good,This is a company that will afford you growth as long as you have the drive. One has to be self-motivated in order to advance.
good,"I come in to work, make area is clean, and examine what needs my attention first. Management was ok for the most part. The hardest part of my job was sometimes dealing with rude customers, the part I enjoyed most was the appreciative customers that said ""thank you"" and meant it."
good,"not a bad company, but can not keep up with the competition... do not want to pay employees. old equipment and needs security."
good,"Sales- cash drawer, answering phones, helping customers locate merchandise, putting up stock, settng displays, placing sale prices on items,greeting customers, helping out where needed."
good,I started out in retail pharmacy and it was hard at first but it became much easier thanks to the pharmacists I was lucky to work with.
good,"I was supposed to be a full time employee, when I first began working for Rite Aid. They started cutting back hours, and my checks were too small. I can't take a part time if it's too far from home. I don't have a set Schedule and I would like that to be able to have a balanced life with my family as well. A tipical day at work would be getting yelled at almost every day all day, because technicians and pharmacist can't get the prescriptions on time. Customers don't understand the fact of the insurance process and their Prior Authorisation and Having to hear back from the doctor for refill requests when needed. They are very impatient. I am always nervous when I try finding a prescription, I am literally praying to find them so that I won't get yelled at. "
good,"friend staff, taught me a lot of stuff when i was externing here, sure miss the staff a lot. it is a busy pharmacy will costumers that i was scared of"
good,This was at times a difficult job because dealing with customers can sometimes be a pain. I am grateful that this position allowed me the training in order to advance and become a technician from a sales clerk position.
good,A typical day at work i mainly stood behind the register checking out customers and helping them find what they needed. As it would slow down i would follow out my daily duties such as dusting and re-filling product. It was usually just one cashier and one manager which worked the front end. The managers had a lot to do so we did not have to interact often. The hardest part of the job was when we would get our truck in. Putting away stock on the other side of the store as well as still having to be a cashier can be difficult at times. the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to interact with all the customers and put a smile on their face for the day.
good,"Generates orders for supplies, equipment, books and other general"
good,this company has a good work atmosphere would have like to see how it feels to work for the company it self
good,"friendly atmosphere, learned a lot from this job, great coworkers"
good,A typical day as a cashier goes as any other store. I never really had any hardships and enjoy most of the time spent at Rite Aid. Management was dysfunctional and constantly changing.
good,"Part-timed, provided insurance, friendly co-workers, and neat store environment."
good,rite aid was an okay place to work people are some what ok and the customers were very rude but overall it was a alright place to work
good,The company gave you opportunity to develop. The benefit is so-so but this is a employee-friendly company. He knows employee is the core of success.
good,Working at Rite Aid provides steady income. I worked part-time while attending college and management was great to work around my school schedule and give me the hours I needed during the week.
good,The most joyable part of my job is working with te customers.
good,"This was a very stressful job, Retail is such a high pressure and high turnover culture."
good,Was a good career but company needs to learn type show more appreciation for the employees that work hard to run  there stores.
good,Good work place. Provided good on the job training. Great co worker. taught me a lot about the pharmacy business.
good,"Typical working day we had to clean inventory, take away old (expired) goods, and put new ones on the shelves."
good,I worked at a pharmacy technician while in school and they were very flexible with my hours allowing me to take off during exam times and pick up shifts during the summer. Great co-workers and patients/customers!
good,"Working at Rite Aid got me started after a period of time with no employment.  It taught me skills, such as customer service that would advance me in becoming who I am today.  My co-workers were fun and taught me so much.  The hardest part of the job was learning all the different medications.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working daily with the customers and employees."
good,I liked working for Rite-Aid because its one of the smaller pharmacy chains and that gives you time to learn the fundamentals of providing great customer service. The extra time you'll have can be used improving accuracy and efficiency. Ideas on how to make the company better were always welcome at the store I worked at.
good,"Gave me lots of hands on experience with working along side my co workers and managers Learned to handle myself in many situations. Taught me how to deal with different types of people with different backgrounds, different situations, and different needs and desires. Atypical day at work consists of me cashing customers out , providing customer service, making sure the shelves were clean and priced, making the work always neat and presentable, making sure every customer had their needs met in a polite and timely manner, and working promptly. The hardest part of the job was know there were many things that needed to be finished but customers waiting in line at the same time. I learned to cope with this by managing my time and calming my mind. I was careful not to get overwhelmed. I learned quickly that, that made the situation even worse."
good,As a pharmacy technician my main job was to fill the perscriptions and help customers. the hardest part of my job was sometimes the customers and the insurance companys. dealing with the public everyday was the best part of my job i met alot of interesting people.
good,"Great company, active and fast-paced environment. Team-work and leadership skills were a huge part of the learning proccess during the time in which I worked for Rite Aid. Members of management were devoted to the company, strong bonds were formed among co-workers.  "
good,Its a good company to work for . But I think they need better employees.
good,Good job over all in your first pharmacy experience. Willing to work with you. Customers are not the nicest... remember this is retail pharmacy so you have your good days and your bad days. Pay is awful though so dont expect much.. pharmacists want more money for themselves so... you will start at MINIMUM wage.
good,"A typical day was doing the store orders, cleaning my box, stocking my box, and helping other co-workers with their stores."
good,"Went to work after school ran the registers, stocked shelves, did inventory, helped in the pharmacy, worked in photo, involved in opening and closing procedures."
good,"50+ hour weeks are expected if you are salary. Advancement is possible but you might have to change departments. Not a bad place to work, good pay and benefits."
good,"Have a great time with my employees and customers, I typically love my job other than some problems with management and finances."
good,"I worked in the pharmacy, cashier, stocked, night mgr. I managed about 6 people in the evenings, balanced cash registers and closed the store in the evenings. I also ordered stock and help unload trucks and mopped floors."
good,it was a pleasure place to work i was there for 8 years amd like any other work place it has pros and cons but overall was a very good place of work.
good,For the most part this was a pretty decent job. The work was consistent
good,"Typical day of work was managing 6 or more employees, paperwork, vendors, cash handling, customer service. The co workers were very good people to work with, the most enjoyable part of job was helping customers"
good,"A typical day at work is coming in make sure all is right when it come t o paper work, making sure that all the customers are being greeted at the door by the cashiers. I learned alot with dealing with all types of people. As a part of management every thing is put on our shoulder to take care of with the store or stores. I love working with my co-workers because we got along with respect we me as a person and the job. Hardest part of the job is dealing with people the want to hurt or do bad by me cause you catch them stilling. The most enjoyble part of my job is helping the poeple that come in and need help with the things they need to find and me making there time here enjoyable as well."
good,"loved interacting with customers and helping people, getting along with co-workers, supervising problems or taking them to management, i most enjoyed the customers helping them get their medicine and dealing with insurance"
good,"I go to work, fill prescriptions, answer the phone, count medications, mix suspensions, do customer service. It is a job where you have to be able to multitask at. Be in a good mood all the time, always be running around, and be good at remembering things and be good with dealing with people."
good,"Had a great time working a couple different stores, met wonderful people, the staff was awesome. I did learned so much as a Pharmacist Technician and as a person."
good,"I loved working for Rite Aid. My manager and employees were great to me. Felt like more of a family than coworkers. Unfortunately, our location closed before converting to Walgreens or else I would still be there!"
good,I was hired as a part time sales associate but was typically working 40 hours a week. So it was a full time job with part time perks. Felt very unappreciated but coworkers was what kept me around.
good,Good place to work management works with you to meet your goals most people are friendly and willing to help you. Many opportunities for advancement good working atmosphere
good,I come in at 11 clock in and log on to my cash register I'm on the register majority of the night but when it reaches around 3 I go to stock shelves .
good,"Productive but laid back type of work environment with little emphasis on the individual and more emphasis on wage saving. The company is dependent on the worker and their customer service skills but do not relate directly to the individual associate. They eliminated my position in the Plymouth store due to a decrease in shrink over the seven years I was employed. Offered me position at all three stores in Concord NH with no increase in salary for travel or time in-route to job site. Could have remained employed but would have taken a large loss in pay due to travel and time in route at my expense. Total loss of revenue was approx $100.00 per week. Basically the company doesn't care about the individual, only the bottom line."
good,Working for this company can be very challenging considering your facing the public daily and you never know how people are feeling. It is a great way to help people and get to know people
good,"I always entered my places of work with a great attitude. There was a language barrier between management and customer, but i managed the difference with diligence. I learned to take every day as a challenge and overcome."
good,Great working environment if your a self motivated head hunter. Tons of floor observation. Mostly watching electronics and your beer cooler. Easy bodies to apprehend.
good,"Learned Great stock experience , customer service, and merchandising. Learned how to be a team player and how to time myself in a timely fashion. Now obtaining multiple licenses."
good,"I loved my customers & my co-workers. "
good,Most of the people I worked with made me feel important on a daily basis. They always encouraged me and were very helpful. I enjoyed receiving freight and breaking it down into the departments they went to for restocking. It was hard work but made me feel accomplished each time.
good,"Friendly environment to work. Just like any other job, if you have a reliable team your daily duties will run smoothly. Consistent customers you start friendly relationships."
good,Very good environment to work in. Family feel.  Customers were the best part.  Management was a little lacking and needed to step up and help instead of taking credit for jobs done by others and not herself.
good,"It’s a good company to learn at and then move on, the pay raises are .20 a year and they start out at 8.50 an hour. You can learn a lot in the pharmacy and they require you to do a rite aid certification program which includes a test at the end."
good,"A typical day at work consists of many emails, phone calls and building relationships.  Despite the stress that comes with this job, it is rewarding at the end of the day."
good,Filling out the application was a quick and easy process. I was able to fill out the application in a short period of time. The only improvement I would suggest is to make the application more mobile friendly.
good,"Good company to work for to gain experience. For the amount of work, just wish the pay-rate per hour was better; pay increase every year did not satisfy my needs."
good,"The hours are typically flexible.  There is always something to do. Must complete monthly trainings. Must be able to stand, bend and lift. Must be prepared to deal with irrate customers due to alcohol and tobacco sales"
good,"learned to stock products in their sections, cashier much more efficient, unload trucks on delivery day, learned how to become a better customer server employee"
good,Not a bad job. Made a lot of friends here and you get to know the regulars as well. The pay wasn’t great but I had a good time working here for the most part.
good,"processing prescriptions, vaccinations, mtm therapy, excellent management, 12 hour shift, hardest part is having a designated lunch break, closed holidays, short weekend hours, prescription output is based on a timing/point system"
good,"I enjoyed my employment with Rite Aid. Duties for my position included merchandising during store resets. Shifts were usually 12 hours overnight. The job was fast paced, but staying busy made the time go by faster. This particular position had a team of about 12 employees and supervisors splitting into teams of 3-4, working at different stores weekly. There was drama amongst team members frequently, sometimes this made things fun and other times I couldn't wait to find another job. Our manager was fair, approachable, and an all around cool guy. Overtime pay made the job lucrative and benefits were good. If I had the chance to work at Rite Aid in the same position again, I'd do it."
good,I started as a cashier. Then went to pharmacy and help with input of prescriptions and pharmacy cashier. Then key manager and helped front and when needed in pharmacy.
good,Working at rite aid was really rewarding. Helping people and being there for people was really great. The hours were good. They worked around my other job hours which I loved.
good,The bad thing about rite aid is if your working over night which is 10-6 or 11-7 you get paid $10.75 from 12-5am . So if you start at 10pm your getting $10 per hour until mindnight hits which is 12am then from 12-5am you will get $10.75 . But once 6am comes your back to getting $10 and hour . I wish they told me that before I started working . Other than that it’s an easy place to work for .
good,While it was a generally easy job the pay rate was less than acceptable. The responsibilities weren't exhaustive but being apart of non-competitive wage business made the days very long.
good,This is retail.  We are all expendable.  It's all about who you know and you better know your audience.   Your reputation can be destroyed in a flash if you don't smile nicely even when you are on the chopping block because a new manager don't like you.
good,The location I worked at was fairly slow. Management was willing to work with you and show you a lot of new things cashiers didn't normally do. Management was very supportive and always there to help with work or personal things. The customers were horrible but the staff made working there fun. I still talk to my former managers and look at them as friends now.
good,I enjoyed working with all the other employees and the environment was nice. The customers were majority of the time easy to work with. They had good benefits as well.
good,"I've observed the onsite training for both associates and managers to be severely lacking. Rite Aid has a wealth of tools, policies, procedures, etc that should create capable, successful employees but fail because they're largely unshared. Managers should focus more on building up their teams  if they want more successful stores."
good,"Started as a cashier for a month then asked to be switched to overnight stock clerk. Where I would restock all of the stores products, including the ice cream. I would also clean up the backroom, restrooms and all of the store overnight."
good,Rite aid pharmacy is a lovely organization that provides job to The entire nation and help student plan their schedule between school and work with the flexible hours. Reliable management and supervision at any point in time
good,Typical day at work would be answering phones. Data entry for prescription written by providers for patient's. The pharmacist was nice to work with and i learned a lot while employed there.
good,The Rite Aid I worked for has been taken over by Walgreen's and I have not worked there since the transition............................................................
good,Decent starting pay but not very large bonuses. Job duties are simple and easy to learn and a friendly working environment. There are also opportunities for advancement.
good,It was nice working with rite aid. I loved and enjoyed working there. I learned a lot. People were good and friendly. I learned New things I gained so much confidence working there.
good,"As with any retail pharmacy the duties of the store leader are all encompassing.  The store leader is ultimately responsible for all aspects within the store.  It is a position that requires long hours, but can be highly rewarding."
good,Rite Aid is a good company to work for. They really care about their employees. They push for your betterment and really work with you so you can climb the ladder.
good,"Rite aid is a store with friendly faces, caring employees that not only know most of the costumers names but the costumers know our names without looking at our name tags. It gives the best service possible."
good,"Loyal employee for 20 years.  Time to make a change.  Served Company well and successfully as Store Manager for many years, Regional and Corporate Trainer.  I assisted in opening many new stores as well as one I operated.  Travel extensively for company: manyTraining Initiatives: Oregon, Washington, California, Utah, Colorado Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, etc."
good,Good first job. Understanding. Quick paced . Be able to understand sales. No benefits for part time individuals. Dull time workers get benefits after 90 days
good,"I truly like working here. The only thing is that the pay for picker/stocker is only 11.50. It would be great if they paid us more for this role. They ask if you like to cross train and when shift is over and under 8hrs, you can possibly work up  until the 8hrs for that day."
good,"Rite-Aid is a very fun place to work, you meet all kind of people and become almost like family, there are always opportunities for advancement if your looking to advance your career in the retail customer service area.  They provide constant training and workshops that keep there employees updated on trends."
good,"Customer service and highly making the customer satisfied."
good,"Must be ready to work "
good,"Worked as a cashier at Rite Aid before I graduated college, as well as full time after. The work enviorment was professional. Helping customers in store."
good,Never was there a slow day in the way of filling prescriptions and attending to customers on a daily basis. The pharmacist had tasks needing attention to keep you busy and the hours seem like minutes.
good,Rite Aid was awesome place to work! Management was awesome employees were great. The only thing was working nights when the homeless came in intoxicated their was no security for protection.
good,The pharmacy is flexible if you have a working partner willing to trade shifts.  The benefits were straight forward as far as picking insurance plans.  401k match was pay 5% get 4%.  Pay is very competitive with other companies with opportunities to work extra shifts.
good,"- Rotation on morning and evening shift."
good,"Your experience depends on which store you are assigned to. I worked in a very fast paced pharmacy with little to no room for mistakes. As a Wellness Ambassador you gain much experience in customer service, assisting in a pharmacy, and promoting the Rite Aid brand to the community."
good,Great place to work. Team oriented. Always challenging and changing. Forward thinking and innovative environment. Learn new things everyday. Tools available for self development.
good,"The company is now owned by Walgreens. Walgreens purchased some of the Rite Aid stores and remodel them, They also closed some of the stores because it would have been a monopoly in some locations."
good,At Rite Aid it was always a fun day. We had our daily objectives to achieve but we always had fun. We had a diverse group of consumers that were willing to make the employees a better person and customer representative. Some spoke Italian while other spoke French and willing to teach the employee the new language. Many were couponers and teach us how to save money while working at the work place.
good,I learned how a retail store works and what kind of work it takes to keep a retail store running. I enjoyed learning how the store runs and learning how to approach a consumers.
good,Rite Aid has a great staff. I love the managers I have at the store. It can get nerve wracking but I get through it. Associates are very friendly also
good,"Overall was a nice place to work. Everyone worked as a team for the most part, but when it came to advancing my teacher wouldn't advance me but advanced even the person that started the same day as me all because of her unproved suspicions about me."
good,"interacting with customers .. addressing their needs and helping them with medications .. updating their immunizations and doing medication review "
good,"It really depends on the store you work at on whether or not your associates actually care about the job they are doing, same with the management. They have okay benefits for a retail place."
good,"12 hour days during week and less on weekends"
good,I personally think working at rite aid has improved my service skills and my patience. Ive had a lot of fun working here i just think its time to move to bigger and better things.
good,I did enjoy working with my close staff. I still go back and use them as my pharmacy because I trust! I did get to travel to different locations and would often fill in as need by my district manager.
good,"Retail Drug store that takes pride in customer service and offers many services for the customer including vaccinations, money orders photo finishing and GNC products"
good,Working at Rite Aid was a great experience. I enjoyed talking to a lot of different types of people. I learned how to speak to rude people and how to deal with people with mental illness and sicknesses.
good,Rite Aid is a good place to start a career but there is not much room for advancement. Peoples egos will get in the way at times and a title means everything.
good,"Recover assets and make safe apprehensions within company policy and guidelines"
good,Was very happy to get up everyday and go to work great culture I loved rite aid.only thing was the commute ended up being to far plus I got sick right at the best time in my career
good,My store is a pretty busy store keeps you moving always something to do. Can be tough but you won’t be bored.  Looking for a job that will keep you on the go this is for you.
good,Right aid was a good working environment. Very quick paced and easy to perform task. This is a excellent job for a younger person just trying to make some extra cash. Great job besides the pay. ($10.40)
good,I love working with most of the people at our store and our patients are wonderful!!!! The flexibility of our schedules is awesome and being able to switch with coworkers is a great thing too.
good,"From the moment I arrived at work it was constantly busy. Always on the floor either helping customers, and all the duties I had with my floor work. Also helping new employees."
good,"I love working here only because of the willingness to adjust to my schedule due to being a single mom and my co workers, & management are amazing, just the pay is horrific. Minimum wage hardly leaves room to survive on your own in New Jersey. I would recommend that they move up to an appropriate pay other wise they will continue to  lose quality employees. and the rotation is horrible nobody wants to work in a place where the pay so obviously devalues its employees."
good,"Good company to work for until this last year. The transition of the store being sold to Walgreens has been very trying. It is sad to see "
good,"Hours are flexable if part time, easy work, good if you're a student.  Old people are annoying but also easy at the same time. Candy for cheap. A.C during summer."
good,"Cashiers at Rite Aid spend a lot of time at the register, during slow times of the shift you would face shelves and change tags for the holiday season or sale items."
good,"Nothing much to say.  Typical retail job including cashier, stocking, and janitorial duties. Also filed Western Union orders and answered the telephone."
good,"Satisfactory company  to work for; no part-time shifts, which is why I was eventually laid off.  I enjoyed the flexibility in day shifts.  The store was well-run; management supported the pharmacy staff.  We could have used more technicians to enhance the smooth flow of prescription dispensing."
good,I loved working for Rite Aid until my store closed down. We had a good team there. We knew our customers by name and knew their families as well. I feel like the promotions and deals were great. They never set goals that seemed impossible to reach.
good,"Great place to work if you can handle dealing with the occasional rude customer. Pay is below what other pharmacies in the area pay, but most of the clients are really nice and easy to work with. Pharmacy crew works really well together."
good,A typical day was pretty good until we found out that the company was being bought out and the store was closing five or six months down the road. So working and looking for a job is a hassle.
good,"The work for the most part is easy, it can be fun to interact with the customers. The management could do a lot more for the employee's who put a lot of effort."
good,"I hired in at Rite Aid as a shift manager and have been promoted to Assistant Store Manager.  I have yet to be assigned a permanent store.  This company has been purchased by Walgreen's and my future status with this company is unknown at this time.  I deal with the public regularly, as well as managing employees."
good,Rite aid was a fairly fast paced environment. People were often friendly and explained things well. They appear to want you to succeed. The pay was not the best and I found it difficult to live on the money.
good,"A typical work day includes a lot of customers and many hours standing. Store manager and the assistant store manager work really well with each other and with the cashiers/associates. The supervisors below them need some work, but they all try hard to keep the flow seamless. The hardest part is the consistent standing with small breaks."
good,Over all good place to work but they just switched shipping and receiving managers. This has made it a little stressful in the two departments. Will take time to smooth out.
good,i work overnight. Two hard night is doing the truck. Working place is good but management is really bad and so does benefits and salary. always short on employee.
good,"employees do not work well with each other when there are new hires. a lot of them like to intentionally tease them. after a while, everyone ends up getting used to each other.. tough to get hired unless you know a current employee or have a lot of experience in that field of work."
good,As a union store the employees should have been treated better. Hours should be set instead  of inconsistent where a employee would close and turn around and open early the next day.
good,"I loved working with public who came into our store and I was able to help them locate the item(s) they were looking for."
good,"I worked at Rite Aid over 13 years ago, so I don't know how much I have to say is relatable to the working situations at this given moment. "
good,I have worked at Rite Aid for over 3 years. I have worked in the pharmacy and in the front end as a cashier. They don't overly train for different jobs you kind of learn on your own.  It would be alot better if the training was there.
good,my first job ever while i was still in high school it was a very fun and up beat company to work for they trained you just about every week the pay was nice the customer was amazing
good,"Rite Aid is a good company to work for, you can start out at entry level and with hard work and determination there is always an opportunity for advancement."
good,I was a supervisor at rite Aid I actually did enjoy working there. Unfortunately other supervisors got to work all the good shifts and I closed every day. They offered great benefits but never enough pay raises for all the things they required. Also when I took my concerns to store manager it fell on false ears no change. I honestly would probably still be would be working there if they listened to my concerns
good,"Provided opportunities for growth, sponsored provider training, provided scheduled break time for pharmacist.  Provided flexible hours and competitive pay,"
good,I am currently on a long term medical leave of absence.  My experiences during this time have been mixed.  I will have been there 24 years this coming August.
good,"Love working with the public. Management was very professional. Was close to home and worked around my schedule when my mom was in the hospitals, nursing home and hospice. They were very sincere and caring during that difficult time in my life. And gave me a couple days extra to deal and grieve after my moms passing."
good,When I first started with the company it was a great company to work for then policy change and not to benefit the people on the lower level but for upper management..
good,"rite made many errors to drive itself to sell the company to Walgreen."
good,"Good for a Younger manager. Lots of physical work. You do everything as a manager. Schedules, P & L, Stock store, set planograms. You get left alone for the most part."
good,"I think being a technician is a very stressful job and Rite Aid doesn't help with that at all. It is very goal oriented, as in you must meet these goals and do these things which only adds to the stress level."
good,I got to meet new people. I also got to travel out of town for a week that was paid by the company. That was my first time doing that. I know more now about retail than I did before
good,job entailed lots of team work and organization skills. There were no hard tasks on the job. Management was also excellent.............................................................................
good,Very low pay for your responsibility requirements.  Benefits are great!  Have a nice employee discount for purchasing your dad to day things you need for your household.  Perscription price is great!! $5
good,"fun and easy at the time really didn't do much when i was i working."
good,This place was nice to work. I had a very understanding manager. I had a good schedule. I got along with pretty much everyone there. I stayed at this job for over 8 years.
good,The overall work environment is very professional. The technicians are hard working and look after the patients in a very caring manner. It is a privilege to work with such dedicated employees.
good,You must always be doing something. There is no time to slack around or be doing nothing. They always expect you to be facing products and stocking shelves.
good,"I worked for a drugstore before, and I would just say this one is really different. A company that was wasnt put together well with people who truly don't care about there employees."
good,"it was great place to work at the headquarters in Camp Hill, PA, Colleagues were helpful and understanding across the board. and benefits were also great"
good,i worked as a very fast stalker and supplies their were times were i was too fast and the manager would sent me to do it again i just play around i would fix the store way too fast
good,"I was a cashier at Rite Aid. I did not enjoy the job very much. It was kind of slow. Not a very busy store, old checkout terminals with too  many steps for approval of any special transactions and waiting on management."
good,"there you learned that you are there for a reason , to work, so we cant waste time."
good,"Great starter job, I learned a lot working for Rite Aid.  I learned how to deal with difficult customers, I have excelled in multitasking. I also learned great Manager skills, the company did provide Management classes."
good,Good friendly people oriented company that somewhat preferred  city location versus suburban and the people culture is reflective of a tilt to folks and employee attitude was relaxed towards all.
good,Rite aid is a good place to work at while going to school or if youre a Pharmacy student then getting your foot in the door in Pharmacy is a great route to take.
good,Rite Aid is a good entry-level company that teaches you the basics of retail and management. The main issues to Rite Aid is their pay is not competitive and there is high turnover.
good,Very good place to work scan tote place orders send on line take orders from stores make sure everything is in the tote prepare zones for next days for the night shift and do it over the next day
good,this job is a very good opportunity. the pay may not be so great but the real value of this job is the experience. if you are looking to move up there's no better place. when you begin here you are completely in charge of the entire department at your store and you single-handedly run the program. this is an outstanding experience that can help you start at a management position elsewhere. overall this job is loss prevention so it can be very fun at times.
good,"Usually never a dull moment there. Manager knows her stuff, coworkers friendly and environment generally upbeat. There's been a lot of shifting in the upper management areas as Rite Aid attempts to come back after the merger with Walgreens fell through. All in all, a decent place to work."
good,It was a nice place to work for  the most part. Had its bumps. mostly lack of employees. I feel with proper staffing the job would have been better . There were a lot of wonderful employees there when I was working at Rite Aid
good,Its a drug store in W.V. you can sell locker there that means you'll be dealing with a lot of people trying to get you to sell it to them or steel it. Just the usual stuff.
good,Good for a first job out of high school or college. There was a lot of repetitive jobs everyday and did not have an opportunity for growth from my position.
good,The pay was low but they flew some very nice aircraft.  The upper management were a pleasure to fly. Harrisburg and the area are very nice and raising a family there would be great.
good,"A typical day at work is that we stay busy, but it's a challenge when you are trying to get the hang of things and take care of your patients, but i did it. I learned how to use their software by entering the patients information and distribute them their medicines. I also cashiered in the pharmacy, counting out prescribed medications, put medicines in the proper bottles, labeled  the bottles. I also learned how to find the different types of medicines on the shelves, stocking. the management team was good and the environment was relaxing to me. I felt right at home. Everyone was so nice. Protecting a patient's privacy is the key to respecting your patients"
good,"Fairly stessful, fast paced job, but management genuinely cares for the most part. Poor compensation though, and will work you into the ground if you let them. Little to not time between shifts."
good,"an okay place to work, good learning environment, poor management can create problems for the day-to-day workers. Overall a good company that provides a good service"
good,"work was scheduled 12 hr shifts, 7 out of 14 days."
good,"Trained in duties of a technician and using the prescription computer program. Received prescriptions, typed prescriptions, filled prescriptions. Helping customers, keeping records, filing prescriptions, vaccinations."
good,"At Rite-aid, you learn to do a job and do it right. Learning all about retail is a pleasure working there. Managers are very friendly and informative. The only thing is that it is only a part time job and most Americans like myself are looking for full time to support their families."
good,"was a sales associate in a busy location in queens would unload trucks on delivery days and do inventory, restocking. not a bad job managers were fair and hours were flexible just stuck on minimum wage"
good,good company to work for even though there was no room for advancement. benefits were average. wages were average. although the people i worked with were friendly there was no room for me to grow in the company
good,"Calming environment, very nice managers, get to mostly pick your hours and they work around you if needed. Not much start pay, but very relaxed. Non stressful"
good,It was a good place to work. The people was nice and very helpful. Management was very helpful. I didn't get enough hours and thats why i had to leave.
good,What I liked best is that there was always something to do. I was kept very busy and I liked that.  I was able to do a lot of plan-o-grams and sets. Everyday very busy. I gave the management only a 3 because I had some of the worst managers in my career while I worked there. They both ended up getting fired. I also had the best manager ever while I was there. Loved him. He was a great manager and created a great work environment. I also learned a lot from him.  He ended up getting a great promotion which he deserved. A good manager can make all the  difference in the world. I really liked my job there.
good,It isnt too much work. It would be good for a first job because it could teach you how to multitask and customer service. Management was always super helpful no matter what.
good,"Rite aid is the place where anyone can learn about products.This place will make you faster. You can take lots of product knowledge, expert on customer service."
good,Assist customers in the store and on the phone. Store operations. I learned how to do deposits. Management was a little sketchy. The most enjoyable was the people.
good,The workplace was good and humble. A lot of gossip and didn't feel comfortable. Otherwise my manger was awesome with shifts and lunch breaks. Would do a lot from putting away/together newspapers and items also the mangers are really pleasant to work for.
good,"very nice staff and very helpful when needed. "
good,"This job position is stressful, because we needed to deal with emergency situations all the time, from customers to patient's insurance issues. But I liked the working environment, and let me fully understand the healthcare system."
good,"Customer Service was my priority: I honed many skills including: Management, Inventory, Product Inspection, Oversaw Loading/Unloading merchandise, Cash Handling, Customer Service/Relations, Stocking."
good,Very friendly work environment. Co workers were easy to get along with. Pay was decent for the position and was allowed to make my own schedule working in loss prevention.
good,"pretty standard, lots of products to process and stock."
good,"It was a fast paced work environment.  Techs always calling off and the pharmacist has to pick up the slack. Besides tech, pharmacist were also short staffed, the company made pharmacist work easily 50+ hours."
good,As a pharmacy tech there is never any down time which makes the day go by much quicker.  There is always something to do and usually many customers to serve at any given time.
good,Working with the public and interactions.  Co-workers were very helpful with training and everyday work. learning new things. Interact with customers.
good,"loved working here, was a challenging job at times but was always fun and exciting to come to work daily.. had to deal with and work with customers daily that were not always in the happiest of moods so a calm and often gentle tone was needed alot."
good,Turnover is high therefore stressful when there isn't enough staff to fill the hours. When there is sufficient staff then there is a great work flow making it less stressful.
good,nice place to work for part time money. I like the people the culture of the work place was very good. Management was very nasty the the the works and customers
good,Got my start here as a technician. Learned all my base skills for being a tech and well as dealing with all sorts of different people in person and on the phone.
good,"I would definitely work with Rite Aid again. However, the pharmacist on Stone Avenue was real jerk. He was borderline narcissistic, because he thought he was God. It was really sickening. The sad thing is that he really thought everyone loved him."
good,It's nice and a great place to work as a first job and a good place to learn discipline and maintain a great attitude in the work place. Time schedule is great for most
good,"Good place to work, love the enviroment. Everyone is friendly. Would recommend working here to anyone. Great learning experience. .learned something new always"
good,Business is in transition of merging.My position will no longer be active.Flexible hours and benefits are very good. Corporation is outstanding. I am one of the top performers in my district
good,"It was good working there. Good starter job , if yur fresh out of high school. I enjoyed working there for the most part. Just lookibg for something different."
good,"This place is a great place to work if you're looking for a job with a flexible schedule while going through college or some other schooling. They are very competitive, therefore their wages are also competitive."
good,"After working at Rite Aid for so many years, I was able to make many personal connections, that I still keep to this day. I even met my wife there, and we are happily married for 17 years with two beautiful children."
good,"If you are looking for a place to move up in the company fast, then Rite Aid is where to go. Does involve a lot of moving around, and helping the customer gain the best experience possible.  For the most part and to much of their ability, they try to accommodate one's lifestyle, whether it be school,childs, etc. If doing the right thing when working, and showing eagerness and potential, one can move up and run the stores or company one day."
good,"Typical day at work: Filling prescriptions, helping customers, providing medical and prescription information."
good,I worked there in the late 1970s.  The company was expanding rapidly and there was not enough management or management trainees to fill all the positions.  Long hours were common as the company tried to hire more people.
good,"Ok place to work, but I did not care for the quotas that were required. Every quarter or more frequent someone was harping on me about how many prescriptions to do or the look of my tie. Annoying."
good,Clocked in by 730am. Then started pulling tickets from the cue that I could work on until the pharmacy opened. I dealt primarily with script tickets and script machines. If they broke down I would log in remotely and fix the bug in the software.
good,"Always something to do; inventory, cashiering, organizing. Very fast paced environment. Always new stuff to learn. Enjoyed getting to connect with regular customers."
good,I cannot give an honest review of this company since it has been over 15 years since I have been employed by their company.  It would not be right to do so.
good,The people are great and the managers really work with my school schedule to make sure I am still able to work. It's a very easy going atmosphere and quick to learn. The hardest part is not getting paid enough for the work that I do. I am the lead technician and get paid just as much as a cashier up front even though I have almost 3 years of experience.
good,"Rite aid is an easy place to work at as a sales associate. You stay up front most of the time and you do returns, damages, cleaning and facing the store every night. It's a good place and the associates are all super nice people."
good,The majority of the management i have dealt with have been decent besides a few bad apples. The pay is absolutely pitiful for the amount of work they expect from you. The benefits aren't that great at all either.
good,"My normal day is I clock in & take over cashiering. Then later stock shelves, price idems, & take inventory. I also would scoop Thrifty Ice cream, take inventory, & stock the ice cream."
good,good place lots of overtime sometimes stressful. as long as you do your work and come in you should have no problems. good money and the managers are ok.
good,great working team from pharmacist and every store clerk.  Everyone is friendly.  Everyone works well in keeping store clean and shelves stocked.  great employee discounts on purchaes
good,"I have worked at rite aid for many years , I love the customers but the job itself is very stressful , the upper management does nothing about any employee complaints. The  benefits are great but the pay sucks !!"
good,Rite Aid is a typical chain place to work. Management can be a bit stickly sometimes and things often don't make sense but you do it the way they want because that's the way they want it done. The people I worked with were good people and most of the customers were grateful to be helped.
good,Fast paced environment. Great people to work with. Possibility of working weekends. Stays pretty busy. I learned a lot about this profession while working here.
good,"-I go in, take over the front end "
good,"Good place to work. Very busy at times, always something to do. Constant customer contact. Management is very helpful and patient. Friendly, helpful co-workers. Need to be a multi-tasker. Many training assessments."
good,"Great place to work. Management needs to be better. You can't keep good people without better management. But yet the company can't understand why they are losing good, hard working employees because they cater to long term managers and not good employees."
good,Rite aid is a place that is fun loving to work with good working environments and good working people. The hardest part of my job is there working hours and low pay but with flexible working schedule
good,"The day-to-day workload was fast paced. I was able to use my attention to detail and organizational skills to make the workload easier and more efficient. "
good,Rite aid is a very productive and educational enviroment with outgoing and friendly co workers. I am constantly improving on my social skills and the management there has made it very easy to balance my work and personal life.
good,Management is terrible and we are understaffed. I have worked here for 1.5 years and we have gone through 11 other associates due to management. The company doesn't worry about their employees at all.
good,"The managers were kind and helpful.  The crew is like family. Very fast paced environment in the pharmacy.  Good benefits, low pay for the work required."
good,"the job begins by getting trucks at your doors, it is now your job to sort the product of the truck with your partner until it is time to punch out.  most enjoyable part of the job is getting a partner that enjoys using teamwork to accomplish the tasks at hand.  hardest part is having a partner who wants to stick to themselves making the job twice as hard."
good,There job advancement was a joke and i have received a settlement from them about 4 years ago that acknowledge we did not recieve payed breaks and was under payed i was a shift leader(key holder) which meant i can open and close the store and a cashier which i supervised made a 1.50 more than me then they put a store manager who had no experience at all over me i had to show him everything they do not promote from within and the money that was taking out of my check and was suppose to be in 401 plan was stolen by there ceo
good,"I had a great experience working for Rite Aid. The people we're amazing and loving.  It wasn't that good morning boss, let's get to work, no it was hello everyone, How are we doing this morning? We worked as a team and supported each other in everything. If anyone had an issue or couldn't figure something out the Manager was available anytime of the day whether he was present or not."
good,"My job title. I was a picker and when I got hired on I started out working in the 3rd building and I work my way up to the Pharmacy base on my job performance and production. We had invoices that we went by and my job was to pick the merchandise according to the invoice without any mistakes in a tote and put them on the belt for shipping and we had to make production everyday and the quality checkers would come behind and check some of your totes because we had to have so many lines per say and if any mistakes made you would get wrote up and after so many write ups there were displinary action taken. Over all I enjoyed my job, my co workers and my supervisors."
good,"the interaction with the customers "
good,This job taught me what I needed to know to advance to a different place of employment. It was disorganized. The drive through portion of the pharmacy was a source of a large amount of stress.
good,Would have Been better with proper training.. Manager training me had quit during  the training.. Store basically had to be run so I had poor training so it didn't last .
good,I enjoyed working there a lot. I recently left the job to seek enployment at another place of business. I did the training for about a month and i wasnt happy.
good,I enjoyed working there receiving more hands on training in the career that I chose. It was interesting to be able to work fulfilling prescriptions as well as learning how to put away stock properly. Learning how to interact with customers and employees from all walks of life was fun. The different personalities helped me to maintain an unbiased mindset in order to do the different jobs assigned to me. Management was professional and courteous towards the employees and customers. The hardest part of the job was trying to assist customers who were unpleasant refusing to understand the protocols to filling prescriptions that were outdated. Overall it was an enjoyable experience that taught me how to work under pressure.
good,"They treat you with no respect , no consideration when it comes to work requirements , they don't rotate departments like they are supposed to , they are not fair with all employees , they show favoritism."
good,"I love what I do, I can be a manager, team player at many companies.  I like to work with companies that offer unlimited opportunities for advancement that I am actually interested in. I found that the company didn't pay well  enough  for most applicants so it was difficult to keep staff."
good,"Could use more business minded managers , better security and a higher rate of pay.  Has a fair set of rules and guidelines for employees. Overall I enjoyed working there ."
good,"Day started 7am, daily activities included upgrade planning and installs. Monitor PLC operation. Learned a lot on PLC's and capital projects daily. Management is OK, just needed to improve their communication. Organizing needs was a bit difficult due to the size of the building and scope of work. Enjoyed working with the PLC's and on capital projects. They have pooltables, air hockey and a full service cafeteria."
good,"Great Customer service experience, excellent management and employees. Rite Aid was a pretty fair work place. I enjoyed the experience there and learning how to read prescriptions and the different medications."
good,"i learned to work with others, do store resets, learnt how to work in the pharmacy and do perscriptions, the hardest part about this job was having to change management when you use to working with one already that was good. i think the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with the pharmacy and others"
good,A great job to practice your multitasking skills due to the fast pace of required performances. One task in the pharmacy required me to remember where I left off from the amount of pills I counted as I went to take care a customer transaction
good,"Training was never delivered for my position. I had to learn many thing on my own, even after asking for help. Delivered great results in my store and made sure to run a clean and precise store."
good,The work atmosphere was great and the managers were very outgoing and approachable.  My customer service skills have improved.
good,"From the start of my day to finish I am dealing with cashiers calling out,customers having problems,cashiers needing voids trying to unload truck all in a very low budget payroll but what can I say I thrive under pressure and it made me strong."
good,it was personal with us. We took care of our customers like they were our patients. between our cashiers and pharmacist customers were always satisfied
good,Most of the time our customers where like our patients. With us it was personal. We where always there with an answer between our cashiers and our pharmacist.
good,"I already gave a review for this job. This is a great company to work for and everyone is friendly. The company is nice and friendly and is just a great place to work for, very nice, clean, and friendly."
good,Working for Rite Aid was a good experience.  I learned how to manage and engage effectively with customers.  Management worked hard and worked well with customers and employees.
good,"Very routine, great customer service is a must have skill set, and its mostly a fast-paced work environment. Only advancement is in corporate level positions."
good,Reporting to the store owner if anything out of the ordinary was happening. Store had to be kept organized and I made sure every worker was in proper uniform.
good,"It is good to build customer-associate relationships, it is a part of networking that can be used in the long run. I enjoyed my months working here, but the feeling of not belonging, was quite overwhelming."
good,"It's only 1 of 2 retail pharmacies in my work history but it is definitely my favorite. Everyone I've ever dealt with, even up to corporate levels, have been amazing people to work with!"
good,i really enjoyed my coworkers and customers at the time just sorry that my time there was so short. not a bad work environment.
good,"Typical day as manager includes going over financial information, managing staff, ensuring completion of tasks, ensuring customer service and planning"
good,Rite Aid was a great company to work for. Everyone was very friendly and cared about the customers and their experience with rite aid.
good,"Not all employees are nice but you can get along to get things done. "
good,I thoroughly enjoy the Asset Protection Division. The job itself is wasn't as challenging as I would have liked but the coworkers and other associates were good people.
good,Rite Aid is a wonderful place to meet new people and create lasting friendships. The hours are flexible and store managers are willing to work your schedule around your day to day life.
good,"Great people to work with, always super kind, but customers can get agitated relatively quickly and can be impatient and rude."
good,"Working at Rite Aid Pharmacy, I've learned patience and being able to multi-task without getting distracted. The co-workers there are very helpful and respectful to those who they work with. As well as with the customers. Interacting, liftingtotes/boxes, packing or unpacking, working at the register, filling paperwork and doing inventory every day has been very rewarding."
good,Working in Rite Aid was a very good experience.  It was a job that gave me the experience that I needed to be a good customer service person. If given the chance I would go work for them again.
good,"Rite Aid is a customer oriented company, with their emphasis on Wellness. I enjoyed my time there.  I learned how to train the staff while working with their strengths and weaknesses.  I grew as a leader because of all the training I was given."
good,"Fun enjoyed my day to day interaction with customers, not to take things personal dealing with the public. My manager was cool as long as everyone pulled their weight, my co-workers were very pleasant to work with."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of organizing prescriptions, selling prescriptions, and calling to inform patients their prescriptions were ready."
good,"Everyone at Rite Aid was awesome I loved the family atmosphere we all worked great together, they have a great support system."
good,The company is not a bad place to work for the management has changed a couple of times since I have started. There is not enough structure and dependability from management.
good,This particular location was in an elderly community and it was easy to make friends with all of the customers who were all regulars. Coworkers are all great and getting tasks completed was easy because the customer flow is usually slow placed.
good,"Working at the Rite Aid Pharmacy has allowed me to grow as an individual. It has allowed me to present my soft side towards the customers. I am able to show my emotions with the patients who come to pick up their medication, build a relationship/friendship with the patients. Relate to their situations, share similar experience in order to provide comfort for the patient. Rite Aid is a never ending learning process as the hours go by on every shift something new is learned."
good,"I have had the best coworkers anyone can ask for, however it is stressful at times because I feel underpaid for the amount of work and responsibilities I have. On a daily basis I answer phone calls, bill medical insurances, fill prescriptions, count and prepare medications, ensure accuracy of all information, provide customer service and answer any questions I can within the rules and regulations of the pharmacy and pharmacist. I come across many different walks of life and sometimes thats the most exciting part of my job, but that can also be the most stressful part."
good,Working in the pharmacy was fun but lunch needs to be longer.I learned a lot. The store and pharmacy managers were awesome
good,I think it is hard to balance your personal and work life. They do offer internal promotions and was able to advance quickly and learn Multiple departments.
good,"if your a cashier you can easily see up too 400 people a day, with that being said its a good way to pass he time. I've learned at a business like that any frankly any business, you are just a number to them, so being that it is 24hr for example if you say you are fully available they are going to take advantage of that and put you where ever they want and change the schedule around as they please. The management is very hard working and i do commend them for that but they try and work all their workers as if we are going to devote our life to them. The most enjoyable thing would have to be the flow, especially on 10th and 5th, there is so many great friendly customers and the neighborhood is lovely; that would have to be the best part about working there."
good,"A typical work day is busy because its very important to not keep the customers waiting, especially when there sick. Working with a great staff is extremely improtant, the flow of the work place is so much better. I enjoy seeing customers happy when getting the medications needed."
good,Gave someone that had no IT experience a chance to learn and gain knowledge and grow in the IT field.  Overall good place to work for and good managers that want you to exceed.
good,"everyone is very nice but management needs improvement and they should hire more people because they are always under staff, the days ae usually easy but sometimes hard because you have to do more things at once because again the problem of not many employees at one shift."
good,Rite Aid gave me several learning opportunities to advance. I had the opportunity to learn all about the company and different positions available in the company. Their mission is to improve the health and wellness of thier communities.
good,Loved working there but the money wasn't great. would still work there if they payed more. The  pharmacy manager at the time was the best manager ever.
good,"This company allows for the opportunity to advance and to transfer to other departments quite easily. I started as a part-time Front-End Cashier and worked my way up to Store Manager. Working with the public in a retail setting can be challenging, but it was made easier by the fact that upper management could always be depended on."
good,"I was only at Rite Aid for a couple of months do to complications with the Store Manager. When you are sitting there waiting to clock in because you are 15+ minutes early, and the Store Manager is calling you unreliable and tardy, there's an issue. She also told me my newborn son was of no importance and that I needed my full attention to her store.. Well no, that's not fair and it's pretty easy to do both so no. Don't get me wrong, the company is great. I'd work at another location no problem at all. Management I gave a 1 to because I couldn't give it a 0. It would be at least a 4 if it wasn't for the store manager I had. That's not how you treat employees of yours. Its disgusting. When I contacted HR for this the first girl I talked to seemed confused and told me not to go into work until we got ahold of upper management since my district manager was on a LOA. After the next person talked to me, she said that it was being handed over to a HR person who I talked to several time. I told him what I wrote here and then some about whats going on in the store. HE came to the conclusion that, ""I don't believe what she is telling me, there's no way I can believe here."" Well luckily for him when it was close to being done a different HR team that knew my Manager took over and said, no blemishes on her record and seniority so she's fine and you're done. And they used me not coming in, when I was told not to, as a way of saying I missed to days. Such a shame it went down that way but we all move on from things."
good,"Clean around the strore "
good,"A typical day for a selector consisted of light to pick, packaging producs to send out for different rite aid locations."
good,"productive place to work but the pay is very poor. The people are nice, very good environment to work in, but I do believe if they hire someone it needs to be a decent pay salary."
good,"From the beginning to the end of one's shift, there is no downtime. Resets and inventory or some sort dominates the day. Worst part about the job is having to clean restrooms when needed."
good,In the pharmacy there are great people to work with. The pharmacist I worked with was awesome. It is currently under new management but I enjoyed working there.
good,"A nice place where you can learn some what quickly depending on who is set to train you. Sadly there is almost no time to eat or use the restroom the majority of days, which is fine but just adds to the stress levels. Computer training is very helpful and somewhat easy to learn. One of those jobs you jump into and its so busy that you have to learn as you go."
good,"Go in there ready to work on stock! Get the stock out fast, neat, and make sure its not out of date! If its out of date, then send it back!"
good,"I enjoyed being the wellness ambassador because you had a lot of freedom to bring whomever you felt would be great for the customers into the store.  I organized a lot of health fairs and I also went to other health fairs.  It was fun, but the pay wasn't great and I was asked to do a lot."
good,"I would've liked to have advanced like it was stated to me when I was hired but overall, I enjoyed my employment, my co-workers and what the company stood for."
good,Greeting customers and assisting them with questions. Developed one hour photos. Put up and took down weekly sale signs. Explained the benefits of the store's rewards program. Stocked shelves. Management was supportive and always challenged me to do more in order to develop customer service skills as well as merchandising skills. Coworkers and managers were always willing to support one another.
good,"Is a place where I go to miss too many people who was nice with me and they teach me too many things I never seen before."
good,A typical day at work is busy yet fun & interesting. Very helpful coworkers. I learned a lot about retail pharmacy settings and excellent costumer service.
good,The company is a great place to work for. Each day is something new and exciting. The people here are very friendly and they help when their assistance is needed in helping others.
good,RA provides an opportunity for development in areas of retail operations and retail management.  An opportunity to advance exists if you are willing to work hard and apply yourself.
good,"For the most part, the only issue is when a customer is upset and I can't help them further at that time. I love being able to really create a personal relationship with some of the regulars. I have seen people overcome cancer, I've helped a little girl with a scraped knee. I've dealt with the rich, snobby, poor, old, young; and each of them have a story. I really love working with people."
good,"No room for moving up, Most of the higher positions are given to former colleagues. Looking for a change of environment and a company I can grow long term."
good,I had to open the doors for the customers. I was the cashier so I had to deal with all of the money. I also cleaned at the store when there were no customers.
good,"using a computer to fill prescriptions,I had nice co-workers,the hardest part of the job was learning all the different names of medicines and what they are used for."
good,"I determined eligibility for Medicaid and Medicare Savings programs at social services; here I learned how to bill that same insurance. My coworkers were great, my boss was wonderful and I liked the customers a lot. It was a fun place to work."
good,"Rite Aid is a fine pharmaceutical/ convenience store company.  The location that I worked at though, the Ocean Beach San Diego branch, had a well deserved reputation for being a difficult place to work because of the environment and customer base.  The staff that I worked with and lead was excellent and I never had a qualm working with any of them, similarly, management was very open to staff frustrations and concerns.  "
good,Good work habits. Learned a lot on how important and hard it is to run such a big corporation. Working at Rite Aid helped learn good customer service Skills.
good,Working at Ride Aid was a good experience. The atmosphere was great. Always looked forward to going to work. Couldn't complain about the pay.
good,"My job included opening and/or closing the store and preparing the store for the days customers. Making sure displays were filled and neatly displayed and priced accordingly.  The management was helpful in training and assisting co-workers with carrying out their duties each day.  The hardest part of the job for me was truck day, in which all associates unloaded the truck of merchandise, and distributed it throughout the store in it's proper location.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers and helping customers with their questions and their needs."
good,I loved working here. If it wasn't for a raise with a better job opportunity I would still be there. The staff is wonderful and the pharmacy is great with their customers as well!
good,"Stock medication and greet people that were picking up and dropping off prescriptions.  Answer phones, filing and data entry."
good,오래된 동네라 나이드신 분들이 믾은 아주 바쁜 약국중의 하나로 학교를 졸업하고 제일 바쁜 연말에 일을 시작해 많은 것들을 배울 수 있는 기회였습니다.
good,"Good learning experience, managed many different people. The only bad thing was incompetent managers who fail to see talented associates."
good,This was a great job and payed decent. But even with that it was very boring. You tend to have to travel and work yourself into different stores once you get comfortable. No real growing opportunities.
good,"Fast paced retail community pharmacy.  A lot of demands, must multi-task and prioritize.  Often the technician budget is tight, so experience and well-trained technicians are a big plus."
good,"Rite Aid provides easy access to food, household products, gifts and provides a safe, fast and trusted pharmacy for the residents who shop there. Sales are frequent, however, stock of sale items wasn't always adequate, and rain checks had to be issued when stock ran out. Prices are usually reasonable when items are not on sale."
good,A day working at rite aid is a good day. Most employees will take the time out of their day to help another employees. We all provide great customer service. We have all learned that our customers are the main focus of our day.
good,"typically a day is spent doing designated tasks in an effort to make the store clean, and enjoyable for the customer in numerous aspects. I learned patience, and a number of retail oriented skills as well as some healthcare knowledge that would be valuable to anyone. My direct manager is a good hard-working person but other than that the management for this district is all new and still learning which makes it difficult to be a lower-end associate. Most of the co-workers are good-natured people disregarding one. The hardest part of the job is very wasil havng to deal with so many diverse personalities and even moods that your customers and fellow co-workers have and balancing that in a productive way with your own. The most enjoyable part f the job for me was the bonds I made with some of the customers and getting to know them on a personal and friendly level."
good,"fun productive place to work, good management team, good co-workers, fast paced, must be flexible to work here. i've learned alot about the inventory side of warehousing."
good,"Work load was great. Always busy. Co-workers were excellent to work with. Management wasn't always on the ball, but they worked with you."
good,"Very Demanding job with limited amount of tech hours, long hours with no breaks whatsoever.Helping patients with their medications was very rewarding."
good,Some management is great and are on your side to help you work as a team and others act as glorified babysitters.  The job itself is pretty easy show up do your job and go home.
good,Long days and nights and weekends must love customers and be willing to travel need experience in receiving truck open 7 days a week all holidays
good,"Part time job working in the pharmacy.  Filled prescriptions, removed expired medications from shelf and provided customer service."
good,"I worked there a while ago, so maybe things have changed, the manager that is there now had to learn to get along with us and cope with us, but she talked down to us as if we were under her in a since of making us feel small. Overall I hope that things have changed since then."
good,The Healthcare industry is the most depressing industry to work in. Insurance Companies hurt more people than they help and you have to jump through so many hoops just to help a person with their medication.
good,"I was a shift supervisor and i loved the people i worked with the most. The customers were ok too but i worked in a high class area, and they wanted everything done a certain way."
good,Good work enviroment. Room to advance within a very supportive culture. Cross-training opportunities available. Company is heading in a very positive direction.
good,"The staff is always looking for new ways to help the customers. We want them to have the best experience they can when they visit our store. The store is always kept clean, organized and well stocked."
good,Outgoing workers with a quick and steady work pace. Coworkers work together to strive to get the job done and make Rite Aid the place to shop for all it's neighborhood customers.
good,"working at rite aid helped me to develop my customer service skills and my people skills. working with a high end clientele  i have learned to listen, patience and service, treat people the way you would want to be treated. i enjoyed each of my customers each one had a special personality."
good,"I enjoyed working for Rite Aid. My first job out of highschool, I was treated by this company very well. Although I had to move on to better myself financially I think Rite Aid is a great company to work for."
good,"I love what I do in Pharmacy. I was always dependable, and a very hard efficient worker. If given the opportunity in the right setting; I know I can be an asset to the com[any, again."
good,"In my position, I learned a lot about motivating and managing my fellow workers. I also learned how to delight customers with outstanding customer service. A person working for Rite Aid will never be bored as they demand a lot out of you, and there is always something to work on. There is upward mobility for workers who desire it."
good,"Liked my Managers both front and back, Supervisors were very helpful.Pharmacy gets really busy especially with drive thru, not enough help because of cutting hours."
good,I love working for the company because it's challenging and rewarding.as long as you come to work on time and do what you have to do you can get far in this job.
good,"putting up sale signs, doing totes, helping customers on the floor and/or working on cash register. Overall a great place"
good,"A typical day at work varies depending on which shift I am working, but it's always about customer service. If I am running the opening shift then I count in all the registers in the morning, and do the deposit. If I am working the night shift, I have to count down all the registers at night including the ones in the pharmacy. Customer service could including running the cash register or helping customers on the floor. At Rite Aid we all work as a team, and mostly everyone is a team player. The hardest part of the job is when there are customer disputes, usually easy to resolve were everyone comes out happy, but sometimes we can't make that happen, which in turn because hard. We never want to make a customer angry and them not want to come back and shop in our store, so we try our best to make every customer happy. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you have made that customer happy, and they show you how overjoyed they are. Or when you have shown a customer excellent service and then you are recognized for it. Management shows what is need to be done and what is expected to be done during each shift. That can include doing planograms, setting seasonal, price changes, and making sure the store is fronted and faced every night. Also one a week help putting away our order, and getting it done in a timely fashion."
good,Great place to work. Managers are friendly and helps to solve any problem. Co-workers were also friendly and laid back. I felt as if Rite Aid was my 2nd home.

good,"Imputing prescriptions into the computer database. I learned medical terminology, different types of medications for the same medical diagnosis, different side effects for the medications."
good,"A typical day at this job requires me to greet costumers assist in ringing at point of sale, in addition stock shelves. I have learned how to engage myself,provide personal costumer service and be more proficient in my work ability. I love my coworkers they have made me feel so comfortable and welcomed they are almost like a little family its very close knit. I cant complain about the hardest part of the job title."
good,Rite aid offered me an opportunity to advance from front end cashier to Pharmacy Technician. The change was great and the pay worked for me.
good,"Hard work, at times. Some heavy lifting. Sometimes long hours, sometimes short days, depending on the amount of pieces to pick that day or number of trucks coming in that day. Worked in heat, since it was a warehouse."
good,"Rite aid has been a great opportunity for me for the past 22 years, I am just ready for a change from the busy retail life, trying to gain some new knowledge in different areas."
good,"I learned how to fill prescriptions, i printed labels, and learned the computer system. I very much enjoyed meeting new people."
good,"a typical day would be the same each day according to volume just find a open zone to pick and log on and go for it "
good,"Your day usually starts early. You check the registers. I would make sure the employees are present. The rest of the day you would usually be spent being a cashier and making sure the store was straight. I learned a lot about teamwork, patience, and customer service. There wasn't a specific part of the job that was hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers."
good,Busy work envivronment. Great people to work with. High employee turnover. Expected to do more work with less help. Great health benefits.
good,"The work flow was at times erratic and some unorganized. Over all the work itself was great, but the customers where rude and not at all understanding."
good,"A typical day at Rite Aid would be making sure every customer that enters our store walk out satisfied not only with our hospitality and great customer services but with our sale prices and deals we have on merchandise located in the store. Working at Rite Aid I have learned how to deal with people ,meaning their moods and personality.  I learned that a customer is always right ,so therefore you must humble yourself and handle nay situation in a professional manner.  By, working at Rite for so long my employees became family we learned to help each other out in any way that we can."
good,"Complete your daily task list. Freshness, inventory, restocking, and whatever displays needed to be put up. Keep the store clean and help out the cashier. Open/Close the store depending on shift. Take charge in absence of store manager."
good,"Rite-aid was a good place to work at. It help me learn lots of new things. My typical day there would be checking  customers out, greeting people, scanning out damages and overstock items, hanging tags  for the new weekly sales, stocking, and straightening. "
good,a typical day at work is very stressful. I learned to not volunteer for certain things because they take advantage of you. Most of management is very rude.
good,I received great experience in customer service. Rite Aid was a great job to help with leadership skills.
good,"management were very helpful, a place where talent is recognized."
good,"The hardest part of the job is working in the center of a high crime low employment city.  A lot of the customers don't have enough money to live (especially through the holidays) so they rub their financial stress off on you.  If you are not a strong willed person, a lot of the customers can beat you down with their words and make you feel pitiful.  Working at Rite Aid has taught me how to help people remain calm when everything around them is falling apart.  It also taught me how to stand up for myself and not let people walk all over me.  If you let the customers see that how they are talking to you makes you feel less about yourself they will continue to talk like that to make themselves feel better.  I learned how to smile through everything and not let other people's moods ruin my whole day.  The management staff is great and my coworkers are wonderful.  They are the absolute best part about this job."
good,I enjoyed working at rite aid and the employee's became my family. However the company seemed to undervalue its employee's and with the constant change in management made it hard to keep up.
good,stock replenishment in warehouse. I was trained to operate a forklift.
good,"-filling prescriptions for controlled substances"
good,"A typical day of work consisted of maintaining a cash register, customer needs, processing new materials, and keeping a tidy work space and safe sales floor. I learned a lot about time management, reassembling planograms, taking in inventory, and interpersonal skills. Management was helpful and always there with a plan in times of crisis. My coworkers varied, but all very much in cooperation in fulfilling the store tasks daily. The hardest part of the job was being able to help all the customers during days with short staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was making connections with the team and regular customers."
good,"Cashier- is just that at Rite aid, you ring at the register and maybe vacuum and stock shelves when asked. Minimum wage and very few hours. No advancement available. Rite aid had weekly MVP contests for associates rewarded with a gift card as well as tests you could take to enter into a raffle. Alright work place."
good,"Meeting new people, and enjoying the mix of people and personalities that my city had to offer!"
good,"The first thing I do when I come into to work is check the store for any hazardous situations; trash on the floor, a tote blocking the aisles etc. then I check the business emails to see if there where any alerts of theft in my area or an event that the company may be having for the day, my co-workers are good in being an extra set of eyes and ears on the sales floor for me if its anything I need to know about they report it to the store manager or myself, I would have to think the hardest part of the job would have to be when I have to apprehend someone and have them arrested only because you try to give people the benefit of the doubt, and the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with all the different and regular customers that come into the store."
good,There was a lot of mandatory over time made it hard to be able to take care of things when I got out. Made a few friends and my bosses where good people
good,Most enjoyable part of my job was serving and delivering the Hispanic community with top commitment.
good,"work was usually a steady pace sometimes increasing in needs a bit"
good,I liked working for Rite Aid. My favorite part of the job is talking with the customers and getting to know them as individuals. There is a lot of CBTs and various things you have to learn to be able to work at full capacity as a pharmacy technician but once you get the hang of it it's a good job.
good,"A typical cashier in the pharmacy opens a new doorway to help customer/patients get their medication with a friendly service and empathy.  Everyday I learn more about the functions of a pharmacy, and I enjoy learning more everyday.  The pharmacist and co-workers are very helpful and efficient at their jobs.  It isn't easy having to stand around when the pharmacy is slow with not much to do, I like to keep busy."
good,same as previous rite aid review all info was given previously   I worked for rite aid 1980 thru 1986 and it was a wonderful experience the 2nd time from 2004 thru 2014 was different.  I enjoyed the experience until the last two years when everything was in turmoil
good,"Rite Aid was an enjoyable place to be, I liked to work in the pharmacy where it was fast paced and people friendly. A typical day at work was aiding to the pharmasist to make sure that the customers were able to pick up their prescriptions in a timely manner."
good,Good company. Employee discount was amazing.  Learned a lot of information that I have used in my career.
good,"This job taught me that you have to show older people more patients and attention, but they are very loyal customers. also how to be very flexible with my time."
good,"I had an overall great time with Rite Aid. I worked at two different stores. The first was much better than the second. There were two totally different managers. But, the customers were always great! A typical day can include anything from cleaning the store, stocking shelves, and of course, satisfying the customers every need."
good,"Rite Aid is a very business work place your always on your feet and helping customers,and answering questions. you will learn how important your job is working at rite aid.

good,I got to know my customers and make them feel comfortable i helped out whenever someone needed help.
good,It was a very fun and eventful experience for me. Everyone was welcoming and nice. There was a lot to learn and always something to do to keep you busy.
good,"My manger was good organized, my co-worker worked hard and as a team. loved my customers."
good,"One thing I like about working at Rite Aid is how employees can connect with each other and the customers. I learned the importance of organization and proper records. I have learned one of the best ways to increase sales is to make customers aware of what is available to them, saving opportunities and showing them how these thing can benefit them. I have had several different managers so I am easily adaptable to different styles of business operations.A typical day at work includes counting office safes, if task are not assigned I have to determine what needs to be done, assigning task to cashiers, making sure the store and outside property is presentable and compliant with all laws, rules and regulations, checking in vendors, audits, daily sales paper work, compliance checklist, inventory ordering and management, making sure we have everything we need to operate efficiently, problem solving, and most importantly customer service. The hardest part of my job is getting everything you feel needs to be done as well as what the district manager needs done when you have unexpected events that need immediate attention."

good,"Providing product knowledge, Photo assistance, and customer service"

Overall a very neat, fun, challenging environment to work in!"
good,Being a shift supervisor was an excellent experience. It opened me to new things. I got a chance to take on a higher role at a young age and I enjoyed every minute of it. It opened my eyes to the retail experience and now I been in retail 3 years.
good,This is a very multi tasking job that requires excellent customer service. I have learned that some days are a little more difficult to get through but you manage to along side your co-workers to have a successful day at work. The hardest part of the day would be trying to communicate with customers on a level that that both the employee and customer will understand and comprehend.
good,It wasn't very busy but the staff was great and it made it easy to come to work and be happy with where i was working.
good,"I enjoyed working with the public, the impact you make with personality on a customer/patients day"
good,"Stocking, Cleaning, Picking and packing items off shelves into totes"
good,"My job involves filling prescriptions, patient consultation, medication transfers, and paperwork. The pharmacist manager is super awesome. She is smart, helpful, and very efficient. The staffs are well-trained and cooperative. The pharmacy is a busy one, but it runs well."
good,A typical day would be fast pace with little room for error. I learned a lot about prescription drugs and even over the counter medications. The management and my co-workers at Rite Aid were enjoyable to work with and cared about the well being of our customers as well as the people they work with. I enjoy talking to customers and interacting with others.
good,Cashiering was nice because I was able to interact with the customers. Was boring at times.

good,"Rite Aid treats it's employees well, and it's a nice place to work."
good,Its a fun place to work just the Clyde office needs an improvement with management in the Pharmacy. No pay raise but other then that a very fun place to work.
good,"Rite Aid was a temporary full time position and would end after Labor day. I enjoyed the environment, the work, and many fellow employees. I was offered a full time career position and felt I had a responsibility to accepted it. This was a third shift position"
good,"staffs are great !"
good,making sure money was correct in cash register. learn how to restock register with receipt paper.
good,I love the people I worked with and how the did daily duties. the area was poor and crime ridden so the clientele wasn't exactly top notch. maybe more flexibility within the corporate standards for raises and vacations/days off.
good,Fill prescriptions and give face to face customer service. Cashier and inventory duties as well.
good,"I really enjoy my job. I enjoy interacting with customers and making their experiences as pleasant as possible. I am currently for new employment because at this time I really feel there is no room for me to advance within my company and utilize my skills. In a normal work day I may work with vendors, do financial transactions, create schedules, and assist with customers as well as supervise 2-6 people on a shift. The hardest part of the job is knowing there is no real room to advance. The most enjoyable is building relationships with customers, vendors, and fellow coworkers."
good,There's always work to do at Rite Aid. Whether it's ringing up customers to completing assignments out on the sale floor. I have a great management team and we all work very hard together. My other co-workers are great to work with and we love coming up with new ways to increase sales and customer experience. The hardest part of the job is not having enough hours or staff coverage to complete every project by their deadlines. I enjoy merchandising and making our customers happy. I love our customers!
good,"Cash management customer service, training new employees, merchandising, taking vendor deliveries."
good,"My day would start by opening the store daily with other co-workers, i would set assignments for all front end employees with tasks that needed to be completed. I would also get all cash registers ready and counted for the day as well as balancing the volt. My day would consist facing the store followed by maintaining the stockroom,stocking,resets.POGS,merchandising,shipping and receiving,pharmacy procedures,photo lab and great customer service. I had a great team to work with so it made it easier to make sure things got done for the day. I love the kind of work that i do in retail just for the simple fact that i like working on the sales floor and being able to interact with what the customers needs are. The best part of being a shift supervisor for me was by the end of the day i was able to accomplish my duties and to help and answer questions and concerns with my co-workers as well as my customers."
good,"I love my job at Rite Aid and I enjoy going to work each day.  Through great leadership I have learned many jobs including the Card Department, Cosmetics, Inventory control and cashier.  My present Manager, is a fair but friendly Store Manager who I enjoy working with.  My co workers are also friendly and eager to help me with anything that I need assistance with.  There isn't any one most enjoyable part of my day.  I truly enjoy my work experience with Rite Aid.  The only reason I am looking for a new position is because I recently moved and Rite Aid doesn't have a transfer available."
good,"Working at Rite Aide Pharmacy on a typical day I would be greeting customers, cash handling ,receiving prescriptions and doing some slight housekeeping duties. I learned paying attention to detail is extremely important. The hardest part at my previous job was not having much to do, I enjoyed almost everything about my job but interacting with the customers and being able to help someone was the best."
good,"Filled prescriptions, left for new job at Home Care. Good starting place to start my career."
good,"Rite Aid divides its store into Front End and Pharmacy. Both departments are completely independent of one another for the most part. As a cashier, days were repetitious and union dues killed my part-time paycheck. In fact, I found the presence of a union to protect my minimum wage work absolutely ludicrous."
good,worked here for 3+ years basically did everything from warehouse to floor duties
good,"worked at Rite Aid as a technician, while I was preparing for my equivalency Exams"
good,it was a very nice and useful experience. a nice and fun workplace.
good,"Good environment to grow in ones field , especially in relation to pharmacy."

good,"Even under the stress of long lines at my register, my experience was rewarding and calm. I enjoyed working with Rite Aid very much."
good,Great customers and co-workers. Face paced and fun job. Good field to be in.
good,Would go in and sign in count my money in register to see that it was correct. Put up any products left at the register that people had decided they did not want.  It was a great place to be.
good,"Every day is very fast pace, which I enjoy.  I am constantly learning new aspects of management, from Kronos payroll,  advertising, ordering and marketing all merchandise, to supervising all employee's to work together to meet the days goals.  Hardest part of the job is keeping focous of where you are at on completion of each task, while preforming all other aspects at the same time.  I enjoy helping the customers achieve a great experience while in our store."
good,I love everything about the job that I done there. the only bad part about the job was being alone in the wee hours of the morning unloading the truck by yourself.
good,"It was a good place to work, management was flexible and co-workers were nice, it was fun to set up store plans"

good,it was a good place to work at and i had good co workers love to have fun and scoops big ice creams for people
good,"I think Rite Aid was one of the best jobs I have ever had. Rite Aid taught me a lot. I learned how to do markdowns, merchandising  through visual placement, as well as, planograms. I loved all of my co-workers and really enjoyed the regular customers. The part of the job was leaving. The most enjoyable part was truck day when all of us was brought together to get the job done."

good,The hardest part of any job is getting your co-workers on board with new initiatives and keeping them motivated. I accomplish this by example and touching base everyday with each shift and management staff. I believe if you develop those around you every thing will result in happy customers and increased sales.
good,"This job gave me the opporutinity to expand my interest in the medical field. Working in the pharmacy was the best decision I had ever made. I  learned how to communicate with customers who were happy, angry, sick or sad. I learned a great amount of medication names between brand and generic names that  have helped me a great deal in the nursing field today.  I also learned how to communicate with insurance companies and I learned how to read and understand prescription/physician language.  The hardest part of the job was prioritizing my actions between the phone ringing, the drive thru, the drop off section, the pick up section, the data entering and the medicaton counting when just the pharmacist and I were working, but eventually it did come natural.  The most enjoyable part of the day was knowing you were doing a job that not many people know how to do and you felt like you were making a difference."

good,"Fun place to work. My co-workers made it a pleasant experience. I learned a lot because this was my first long-term job. Got my first experience as a lead/supervisor here, and being in charge of my own department was a great experience. Management wasn't the best, but still a good place to work, with room for growth; slowly, but it could happen. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the production quotas. Some of them were almost unrealistic and extreme hard to meet. The most enjoyable part were my co-workers. We made sure that even on our toughest days we made each other laugh. The pay was pretty good as well."

good,It is a pharmacy based retail corporation that requires long hours and commitment from each associate
good,"Entered new and refill prescriptions daily, rang up customers after their medications were ready, got to know a lot of people at doctors offices as I spoke with them on a daily basis. I trained new employees on company policies and computer occassionally. This company offered me the chance of school to become a Pharmacy Technician, which was one of the best choices I could have made. the hardest part of the job is not being able to give all customers what they need, whether it be due to cost or lack of availability. I love this job because you get to meet new people all the time and it's always fun to get to know new people"
good,"I have learned a lot from my pharmacists such as how to counsel a patient, drug inventory, transfer prescriptions, insurance handling."
good,"Working at Rite Aid was very entertaining. Rite Aid was my very first job so I was excited to be working. Almost everyday when I was working there the day consisted of the same routines. We would straighten up the store, do cycle counts, and pull out of dates. While working at Rite Aid I learned how to deal with customers and how to handle certain situations. Half of the time while I was employeed with Rite Aid we did not have a manager. My co-workers were the best. I made a very close bond with my co-workers. There weren't any hard parts of the job, but the most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with the customers to help fit there needs. Being the people person I am I loved to talk with the customers."

good,"I was satisfied with my overall experience at Rite Aid. They are a good company to work for. However, I worked there for 7 years and moved up in management and I feel that I was underpaid for all the duties I was responsible for."
good,"As a cashier, i spent most of my day assisting customers with individual needs. My managers and other staff were very respectful and easy to get along with. My co-workers worked hard, and made it a point to work together. I really didn't have a hard part in my job, everything was pretty much easy to do. The most enjoyable part of the job would definitely be interacting with the customers. They made my job worth while."
good,"loved my time with RiteAid. learned alot , loved the customers, worked ALOT of hours. health benefits are good. This job is very demanding of your time, leaves very little for home life. worked for company for many years but realized i had missed out on so much with my kids because of all the hours i had put in with this company and the demands it puts on you so i needed to find a job that allowed me to spend time with my family as well as work and provide for them."
good,"right now i am working with specialtyrx a long turm pharmcay as a pharmacy technican Responsibilities: File documentation as required by pharmacy regulations ,Locate medication from pharmacy supply area, count out, and package in correct system,"

good,"Good company to work for. Though they have been struggling financially due to bad management in the past, they still value a good associate and are working hard to raise the company to level with their competition. I think they are finally on the right track."
good,"I learner how to developed film and how to run register. The manager was nice. Some Co works were okay to work with. Hardest part of the job was drama, and some customers were alittle difficult. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and making new friends."
good,typical day a work would be tiring. all day back in forth to and from register to in and out the pharmacy to help customers. putting up stock on truck days and keeping pharmacy clean and in order on a daily basis
good,"Working at Rite Aid was fun and a enjoyable experience. I was a cashier I also did truck shipment once a week. I cleaned around the store, greeted customers and I just made working there enjoyable with my co-workers and manager."
good,"energetic place, great people, and customers, clean and neat, organized pharmacy, insurance available with number of hours, discounts on merchandise in store"
good,As an Intern I was required to greet customers and locate their prescriptions and ring them up. I occasionally filled prescriptions.
good,A typical day at work consists of me supervising a group of eight people. I delegate tasks for them to do while also completing my tasks. I also handle large amounts of cash sales and provide customers with great service.
good,Working in the pharmacy expanded my knowledge in regards to pharmaceuticals. Besides that was typical retail job.
good,"Offers schedules ranging from day shift to night shift, as well as a rotating shift with 5 days off in a row. Allows plenty of time for vacations and family. This company also offers you the opportunity to advance to a management position."
good,"For a corporate chain, its about as good as you can hope for. Stores are hit and miss, district management is generally fair. Oftentimes Store managers interfere way too much with pharmacy."
good,Enjoyed working for this company where I got the chance to excel in my position.
good,"I honestly love working there. I have the best co-workers in the business. The only issue that I have is, I have been there for 6 years, and I have been told that I'm the best worker there. Unfortunately, I have not been promoted or even heard the word promotion. Management says they want younger people to run the stores, and I'm turning 24 in May, but they apparently think I'm only good at being a cashier. I have been employee of the quarter 4 times in almost 6 years."
good,I was affored the opportunity to learn the many asspects of the retail industry. It gave me the chance to help alot of customers.
good,"Rite Aid has been a good company to work for. My bosses and co-workers are friendly and helpful. The pharmacy employees work together as a team well, although sometimes it is hard to keep up with the workload due to increased tasks from corporate as the company grows mixed with budget cuts causing our hours to decrease."
good,"Typical task overview is working at the register, stocking, facing the store, putting go-backs away, and engaging customers. Its pretty straightforward."
good,"Rite Aid was a fun and busy place to work in, everyday is different and there is always something to do. It varies from customer service, cashiering, stocking, building planograms and displays."
good,I have nothing important to say as my opinions could influence others and they may not have the same experience as I did. Best of luck to anyone applying.
good,"Between my teammates I worked with and the customers I tended to, working felt more like being a part of a family. The work was simplistic and easy to grasp. The day to day activities made the time seem to fly by."
good,I enjoyed my job here. Actually liked the overtime.  I had planned on staying here. Sadly they are closing both distribution center down in December. Over the years if you wanted overtime this was the place to work.
good,Rite Aid serves a large community in a very efficient fast paced environment. Customer convenience is a top priority. The pharmacy staff works VERY hard.
good,Rtie Aid is a very busy environment. Customer service is very intense. You have to know what the customer wants before they ask. Be very observant. Multitasking is a must. Hard labor most of the time. Lifting heavy things and stocking. Keeping the area as clean as possible. Ensuring the customer has everything they are looking for and if not ensure you will get it for them the next time they return when product is in the store.
good,I love my customers. I enjoy working with people. The hardest part of my job is finding people who want to work. I Have learned to be a better person. I work 45 hours a week
good,"A typical day at Rite Aid starts with logging into the portal and punching in on the company laptop to start the day and punching out at the end of the day."
good,"Good place to learn to work as a team player, and many chances to move Up. Benefits are pretty fair to what others companies offer, and the Salary is pretty decent."
good,Not a bad place to startoff in the warehouse and production seen . Although their pocking allocations are exaggerated and unrealistic with the way they have you doing piece picking. Really hard and almost impossible to meet standard minimums.
good,"Take care of customers, check in vendors, stock shelves, check for outdates, clean up, etc."
good,This position was different from previous position held as medical professional..still allowed me to teach customers about their medications & to discuss health condition concerns.Internal & External Flu Clinics were interesting.Assisting Pharmacist with completion of prescriptions was like solving a puzzle.
good,"I was trained at rite aid for my forklift certificate, I had a good time, met a lot of good people. I just never got a chance to move up so it was time for me to move on ,get more money to take care of my family."
good,Overall a great learning experience and loved the customers. Got to learn alot of new things. Didn't care for the management experience. I didn't also care for a new school I had to do for their company without explaining it was what was needed.
good,I wasn't properly trained. I did overnight whenthe delivery truck had came in so I guesshey didn't have time to properly train me. I feel that I should have been through training during the day for a few days before I started working overnight.
good,"it was my first job, i learned a lot about customer service and the skills i learned here helped me further along in my career. it was a fast paced environment butboverall good place"
good,Management was understanding in work hours due to me attending school. Communication was very strong among staff and management. Shift coverage was good whenever you needed them; even in the event of an unlikely emergency.
good,"productive workplace, fast paced and friendly environment, the most challenging work day is truck day. The customers are very pleasant and there are a lot of regulars."
good,"Working at Rite-Aid in the Pharmacy was very challenging at first since it was a very new environment as opposed to the cashier job that most would think. After continuously asking Questions and being exposed to the job, it got easier to learn through application. The very best thing about the job is that it is real world and the knowledge gained from the job is valuable as it is a new entrance to a new field of business."
good,Face paced daily duties. Customer experience is always top priority. hardiest part of the job is dealing with shoplifters who ave no regard to authority.
good,Nice getting to know the customers. Employees are very friendly and helpful. Co workers are fun to work with. Management is great with scheduling around any appointments.
good,"Very fast paced work, can be stressful due to your weekly pro-rate, very good exercise. and very early morning hours and very short day seems to be due to the early morning hours."
good,"As Field Tech Supervisor, good and controllable mix of home and travel, administrative and field work, etc.   Typical day included monitoring and checking on fleet vehicles, Call handling/reporting, HiPAA handling, Project status, PM work status, Remodel schedule with Project tech, asset tracking/inventory control, Conf calls with manager/techs at least 2-3 per week.  Additionally, travel throughout territory to check up on quality of work, scope of work compliance,  equipment cleanliness/organization, check satisfaction of internal customers (store managers and District management personnel)."
good,Management day to day workflow which include typing prescription and solve third party issue and customer service. The most hard part of the job is when the customer have no patience and most enjoyable part of job is the team work.
good,"I actually really enjoyed working at Rite-Aid.  I was only there for school, so I did not receive a salary.  But, they were very educational and were fully capable of educating me about different jobs.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I enjoyed the learning experience.  When I graduated, they didn't need any new hires, so I wasn't offered a job."
good,A great place to work at with flexible hours. Employees/managers are very easy to work with. Definitely a good part time job. Company is very good as well.
good,Depending on locations some good some bad. I enjoyed my time there but there were a few discrepancies with the higher up people of the company. I dont see myself going back there for employment.
good,It was 7 sections in one row. I had to pick  items from one section and put in a tote. Then move to the next section and keep going down the row until I was done
good,"Days/Nights were always busy, we had a consistent flow of work and opportunities to switch to other departments to make more money. We also had optional overtime to pick-up some extra hours."
good,Overall its a great place to work.  Converting to a Walgreens.  As part of the management team we are considered working managers.  That's not bad except it leaves little time for management duties.
good,"My immediate manager was very good, the district manager was horrible. I would do anything to help my manager. The other employees were good but there was a high turnover."
good,Helping others find the products they need while maintaining a clean and organized store.  Supervision of multiple employees simultaneously accomplishing different projects.
good,"This was one of my first jobs, and I learned a lot from it like being diligent and efficient. I learned to be responsible in handling large amounts of money and great customer service skills."
good,Good work environment. Directives from field managers are clear. Allowed flexibility in order to drive sales. Not too much involvement with day to day operations of pharmacy.
good,"My management and other employees are  awesome , Work is easy especially if you have done sales before.Typical day is ringing out customers , front facing shelves sometimes putting away truck , sometimes helping reset areas of the store , stocking items that need restocked etc.  Every one is so polite and great to work with, atmosphere is steady work and nice all around , Pay could be better for what we  actually do , I have been paid more when i worked at DG doing the same i do here  but its a job and i like the atmosphere . So pay and hours are not the greatest but i love everyone i work with and our customers are actually nice we dont get much of the rif raf , like most places in town ....... all in all its not a bad place to work for except for the pay and hours are not guaranteed , but it is a great place if you arent worried about that stuff plus i am one who i like to work from the bottom and go up aka prove my worth which here you do have the opportunity"
good,"Back when I worked for Rite Aid, everyone loved their job and no one was worried about their job being lost. With stock prices dropping, there is not a lot of job security which is a bummer since the company is so good to its' employees."
good,"This was a great retail job for me the pay just wasnt the best. We did have good insurance so that helped.The enviroment  was great because it was quiet and made it easier to get work done,"
good,"Rite Aid Pharmacies are not a terrible place to work. That being said, they are not great either. They do not pay well, and there are no part time benefits. The pharmacy team do strive to provide excellent customer care, and the front end team and management strive to help in any way they can."
good,While I was there I did a very good job when giving a job function. The only reason I resigned is because I had to leave the state of new york to go to new jersey to take care of my elderly mother.
good,"The people are freindly, but the location that I was at we watched out for eachother at that time I learned just do your hours and go home."
good,THEY DO NOT PAY THEIR TECHNICIANS FAIRLY! i love the pharmacist and staff  i work with. However i have to begin to search for another full time job because i cannot afford to live on 9.85 an hour . im not trying to live with my parents for the rest of my life. its a shame that they dont pay their techs good or for the great work that they put in. i work extremely hard and i am under paid. ive been working for 2.5 years. great experience but time to move on
good,Love the company there is space to move up in the company always busy.Training is simple if you love working with people this is the place to be.good company
good,part time job that accommodates the hours I can work.  seems to benefit and work around schedules to make sure that we are staffed to get the job done.
good,working at rite aid was very fun I met a lot of cool people there. We all worked together as a team and got things done. Rite Aid benefits were also very good then what most people would expect but I just wish the vacation time and sick days were handled much differently. seems like the length of time you worked for the company dictated everything.
good,"Loved it but manager was useless."
good,Rite Aid offers fantastic benefits and a very flexible working schedule for it is union employees. Managers however are severely underpaid and seemingly unappreciated.
good,"It could be a fun, stressful, fast pace environment. The job was self-explanatory and nothing really confusing. The only stressful parts would be customers."
good,"Rite Aid is a great place to work with hard-working employees, great managers who create an unbelievable environment, and fast service to appreciable customers."
good,It was a great summer starter job for me. I learned quite a lot about customer service and customer relations. I want to find a job that will suit me more in the electrical field and advance my career now that I have graduated.
good,Main manager and assistant manager are fantastic! Supervisors are good and the choice of workers make the job worth it. Stressful environment during busy hours.
good,"The company is good but hired people from India u other countries for managament position and theu are try to use the system from the country that they are coming from and has been the problems from years, they could do better business if they apply american system and avoid conflict with the personal doing the right thing"
good,It gave me a opportunity to learn a lot about running a place.  A since of pride in my work. And learned about maintaining fast paced inventory stock.
good,"Working for Rite Aid was awesome. Being able to have first hand with patients by getting to know them and filling there prescriptions. I really enjoyed being able to assist the patients and having them leave the pharmacy with a smile because of being satisfied with there service, The hardest part of the job is dealing the emotions of the patients ,when they would find out the results that they received from the doctor."
good,"Work days are great. It does depends on who you work with, but the work flow generally moves smoothly. Most customers are very pleasant, but like any retail job there are some customers that are difficult."
good,great company to work for would recommend to anyone attempting to start a career rite aid taught me several things about retail that i did not know before
good,Very calming atmosphere to work at Rite Aid. I learned more hands on objectives than at tech school. Management was always helpful. The most enjoyable part of being a pharmacy technician was interacting with the customers.
good,"Working in Rite Aid  was a completely change of career but, an excellent experience. "
good,"For the most part I was really happy there. My managers were team players who were willing to roll their sleeves up and get dirty with us, as opposed to sitting in the office or micro managing."
good,I loved it. Helps reach your goals . The company has work life balance and career advancement. I worked with company for years and grew . Friendly environment and customer driven.
good,"Working at Rite Aid in Wayne was nice for the most part, but they little pay with the amount of physical work was not worth it. The Manager at the time Deneen was not professional and whenever she made a mistake, she wanted her employees to fix it."
good,"As my first job, I picked up on things pretty easily.  The managers were attentive if you had a problem and they gave you any information or training you needed to preform the best to your ability. Even on quiet days there was always something to do."
good,Working at Rite Aid provided me an opportunity to expand upon my history of management skills. The best part of my job was helping my customers. The company is not always good at understanding the needs of it's workers but generally provides a good working environment.
good,"A strong culture, in which members agree upon and care intensely about organizational values, can improve business performance by motivating employees and coordinating their behavior towards a vision and specific performance goals that benefit the company."
good,"I will be able to better answer this question after movement is witnessed. There exists empathetic, compassionate executives that are sometimes contradicted by others in administration. One has to work to get work."
good,"A typical work environment with day to day challenges,dealing with new /old customers,counselling, immunization,applying professional knowledge skills"
good,I'll always have a soft spot for this job because it was the first opportunity to make enough money to make moves that benefit my future. I made great friends and professional contacts.
good,"The company is ok, they need more direction with associates but overall its a job to do and you will like it overall with the customers, some stores have a great front and pharmacy, they cut hours and expect workers to do more work with less help ."
good,"Rite Aid was my first job, it was a great first experience. They valued good work ethic, and hard-workers. They taught me valuable lessons in being in the workforce. They helped me get used to the everyday work style. I would refer someone to rite aid as a first job."
good,"Help with finding things throughout store, western union, Cashier, money orders, clean maintenance, stock shelves, pharmacy, great manager, great shift supervisor,"
good,A typical day at Rite Aid is generally quiet.  There are daily tasks that help enable the store to run smoothly day to day.  The clientele are generally pleasant and personable.
good,"During my time there, I found it to be a decent job, with decent pay. There are issues in the pharmacy that needs to be worked out, otherwise it's a great store to be in. The sales associates and general manager seem to be great at what they do."
good,The job required a flexible person who doesn't anger easily. Night cashiers should be able to defend themselves because the store closes at 10 pm every night. I learned a lot about how to balance working the register and getting other things done behind that counter at the same time. The management is working very hard to keep up with the minimal cashiers available but it is causing issues because of the high turn over rate. The coworkers do joke around and talk while working which can be a little unprofessional. The customers and short staffing are the hardest part of the job. The customers have no problem screaming and bad mouthing cashiers when they want to about everything. The short staffing means that the cashier working won't be getting a break. The conversations and jokes between the coworkers is the most enjoyable part of the work experience. They make the rest of the job easy to handle.
good,I started out my job with Rite Aid in 1983 and have come back to it doing a different job last was Shift Supervisor. I was a manager at one time. Loved working for them. Took a job closer to family
good,Good management communication. You know what is expected from you. Lots of tings to keep you very busy. I enjoy my time when I work. Nice location. Friendly staff.
good,"Fast-paced, multitasking,and working and helping others in providing assistance and better health for them. It has allowed me to grow in providing great customer service."
good,Getting prescriptions out of the Que and filling patients new prescriptions. Learned Medical Terms and generics of medications along with uses. Management was fair. Enjoyed people I worked with. The hardest part of the job would be getting important prescriptions out in a timely manner due to low staffing.
good,Time goes fast and it's fun. Steady full time hours and over time is available frequently . Early and late hours available. Bonus available if recommend new employees.
good,"Making sure everyone does their job was is disorganized."
good,working for this company was ok just a lot on the store manager have to do extra work for the same pay get paid for 50 hours work like 60 or more get the same pay
good,Very fun people to work with.  Learned alot about retail pharmacy and human nature.  A young staff.  I did a lot of training of them as well as them of me.  Now Im well seasoned of 33 years
good,work to satisfy customers with better services and supervisors. Perform daily routine relative job to keep up for continuing current job. To serve customers with excellent customers services. with warm welcome to the store
good,"Great experience. Typical day is 12 hour shifts. Able to make an impact on patients health care. Most enjoyable is to get to know your patients. Worst part, having to deal with insurance companies."
good,Our new store manager has all the best of intentions but she over works people by working them 7-8 days in a row and then justifies it by saying she gave us a 3-4 weekend. She also is not much of a team player when it comes to unloading the truck. She puts most of the work on the Shift leads while she barely does any of the work and then complains that it takes too long to get things finished. She complains a lot and makes working with her unbearable most days. Sometimes I would rather work alone than with her.
good,"A typical day at Rite Aid was fun and for the most part relaxed. The management was good and respectful, the work place was very cultured. the hardest part about the job was unloading the totes. The most enjoyable part about the job was getting to help and learn the customers."
good,"The pharmacy cashier is a customer service position.  Demanding but fulfilling.  lots of customer interaction.  requires patience and ability to work with all types of people.  I enjoyed the work, but had not enough time to sit."
good,"Job requirements were: stocking newspapers daily/magazines weekly/books monthly,walking,standing,kneeling,stocking shelves,run cashier for both store customers and pharmacy customers,sweeping of floors, garbage detail, other tasks as needed."
good,I felt like I wasn't really needed and knee the job would end soon.temporay job so only lasted a short period of time I enjoyed myself though and I wish it was a permanent job
good,"Being able to manage all the stress from the job itself customers, and coworkers. If you can not handle a fast paced environment and a heavy load of stress, this isnt the job for you."
good,"It's a healthy environment and friendly environment but the paid is not good enough for all the responsibilities and expectations. The company right now was sold to Walgreens Corporations, so we are on a ""limbo"" regarding job stability. The workplace culture is safety and convenience for associate and customers in general, plus the top management programs are accessible to the associate in general."
good,"Good employees worked for me. All the customer were very nice. The work hours are long but rewarding, Working on all the holidays was not always an ideal situation."
good,"At Rite Aid, my typical day consist of greeting customers, ringing customers for their prescriptions, data entry, ready to fill medications, making sure that the medications are in stock, making sure the medications are not expired when being dispense and answering the phone."
good,I stocked floors and fixed aisles for easy customer access to products. Deal with customer complaints and made purchases and returns. Depending on days it was either super busy or pretty dead. It was however a great first job.
good,The job as Pharmacy Technician is a very fast paced and time consuming position.  Typically the customers can be very difficult.  I am sure to be pleasant to each and every one regardless of their attitude.  Customers like to be reassured they are receiving the correct medication in the appropriate quantities.  Putting their mind at ease is my goal.  In most cases being pleasant and informative with someone will turn their attitude right around from upset to pleasant.  Customer Service has always been my pleasure.  From years ago when I was a flight attendant to working at Walt Disney World and now at Rite Aid.
good,"The enjoyable part of the job is the lunch and breaks when you get to enjoy the company of others. "
good,"Rite Aid was an experience that I will always remember.  The company was not the best to work for, but the employees made the best of it.  I would recommend this place for anyone looking for an entry level job."
good,"It's a good place to work temporarily, Solid environment. It can be pretty stressful but it's usually not that bad. Although some of the customers certainly make it difficult to keep a smile on."
good,"Was employed there for 4 months, worked hard for low pay opening a brand new store so hard work was a given but hours were spotty at times. Too much politics from management down."
good,"Constant customer service, whether it was answering phones to take refill orders; inputting new prescriptions; placing orders; replenishing stock, etc."
good,"The pharmacy manager is very reliable, friendly and leads by example. The pharmacists are overall patient and the training provided is thorough. Fair hours."
good,I was young and in high school. Good place to work when you want some experience and need some money in your pocket. I wouldn't recommend long term due to low pay.
good,"I had a good time working there. The only reason I left, was because it didn't pay as well as I needed. I actually enjoyed the fact that they were structured."
good,"Easy job but very boring. Customers make the job difficult, sometimes there are too many tasks for a single person to do. Hours are flexible and the job is simple"
good,its a steady pace type of job that needs full attention. it also has a pool table and foos ball table that you may play before work and during breaks as well as after work.
good,Really busy pharmacy. Always long lines but understandable its one of the most busy pharmacy in the neighborhood. Pharmacy staff is good. Great wellness ambassador.
good,"Well when I was working here the manager didn't like her staff. She was kind of jealous that 2 of the assistants was cool with all the associates and she didn't like that. She didalot of spiteful things, and the everyday customers didn't even like her."
good,"A typical work day would consist in stocking products, and tending to customers to their day to day need. By providing exceptional customer service, we were able to leave customers satisfied with their needs in their reasoning for their visit."
good,"Working here can be a fun experience for interacting with your co-workers and customer if you are willing to put in a significant amount of energy and effort into the immense amount of work to be done. Though working in this company teaches you many skills regarding the different types of tasks a person must do, the work itself can feel repetitive once you become used to the daily procedures. The management is competent and the workplace culture seems interesting enough that a person will look forward to working in their next shift."
good,"When I started in 2013 I really liked my job. I was there for 4 months and was offered a supervisor position. The SM at the time was great to work with. Different stores have different work environments, some are fast paced while others are slow. They are apart of the UCSFW union so there are union dues unless you become a SM. Great opportunities to move up in the company. Benefits though aren't that great."
good,The job isn't bad. My direct manager/supervisor is great to work with. Can't say the same about corporate. Pay is low considering daily expectations. Always opportunities to climb up the ladder if you work for it.
good,"A typical day at work would include me running register and greeting customers as they enter the facility.  Doing the necessary paperwork, like freshness report, price changes, logging in out of dates, checking in product with a hand held scanner, helping the pharmacy out, counting down drawers when closing the store.  Making sure store is clean and shelves are fronted."
good,"Learned a lot from here. Restocking, pharmacy work, customer service and assistance work, back room inventory, and stockroom ordering. Definitely a strong first job."
good,"scheduling of pharmicists"
good,I got out of school and straight into the pharmacy. My first time being in a pharmacy and I loved all 3 years. Loved the customers and loved my job just thought the pay and raises sucked.
good,"The main focus at this company was to make sure the customer was satisfied and that they got the products that were needed. You have to greet the customers to make them feel welcomed and assist them with locating goods. At this job I also had to process transactions using cash, debit/credit, and checks.Anther task was to return unwanted goods at the end of your shift."
good,A typical day of work is a challenge that helps you learn customer service. The hardest part of the job is customer service because sometimes they customers are right and sometimes they are wrong but you have to be pleasant about it. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping someone find what they needed.
good,"it was an overall a pretty good job. there were obviously some cons to the job: such as short breaks, some times there would be drama. but there were a lot of Pros to it too. I just got tired of cashiering and want to change it up."
good,I think the job is nice to have and easy to do but the pay will not confer my expenses and I don't mind working and get good hours but it isn't enough.
good,"worked at the findlay ohio location loved it, worked at the shawnee ohio location hated it went from a great manager to one that talked about everyone behind their back"
good,This company does not have enough employees and the job is over worked and under paid. Employees are stressed and this makes the job hard to keep up with.
good,"the work is difficult but rewarding.  You verify the prescription and then bill, fill and distribute the prescriptions it is difficult at first but there is much you can learn."
good,"Fun fast pace work environment makes day go quickly."
good,"Rite Aid is a decent company to work for, with many great employees and coworkers. The unfortunate difficulties lie in an old infrastructure that does not allow for rapid resolutions or any kind of item location."
good,"I sold my drug stores to Rite Aid and went to work for them.  It helped me make my transition out of independent ownership.  the hours were good and the schedule was great,"
good,It was ok. I didn't enjoy the job as much as I wanted to. The company was disorganized and the customers were very rude to people trying to help them.
good,"I am pleased to say that I get along with all of the other employees/staff. They are a friendly group of people, and if you need any help with finding things or even if you need directions to another place the employees are always polite and eager to help; if they dont know they'll find someone who does know."
good,The company is great to for and if you think you get rich not in lower management  and has a union so the yrly raise are very small.
good,I love helping people who do not understand their benefits and I go out of my way to help. My company allows me to go out my way to have return people. A little kindness goes a long way.
good,"Rite Aid provides a safe work environment, with good and hard workers. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the customers and trying to give them the best customer service we possibly can"
good,Fun place to work very fast place very rewarding. You get paid every Friday which is a plus. Everyone is friendly and that's what make customers want to come to our gas station.
good,Work was simple and structure was clear. Helped customers by checking out items and new what was expected of me with other tasks.
good,I like to be around people and actually make a difference so that was a huge plus. Also being a supervisor is challenging but definitely fun.
good,"Wonderful people for co-workers and pharmacy software is amazing."
good,I have worked for Rite Aid a little over 2 years. I like working there but do not enough hours anymore so I am seeking other employment. The staff is friendly and I enjoy my customers.
good,"Well run chain pharmacy. No lunch and supper breaks were not given. I usually worked alone . In a rural setting, people seemed to ask you a lot more health questions"
good,"During my career at this company I have worked my way through college. The have made long lasting relationships with managers and other co-workers. This job was very flexible with any of my other duties that needed more of my attention. The downside was when it came to pay raises in relation to hard work. Also the fact that this job is retail and you have to deal with complaints and needs of the public on a daily basis, but like i said, it's retail. I enjoyed the healthcare aspect of making people feel better and healthier, but no matter how hard you work you do not receive a pay raise based on how hard you work or how efficient you are on a daily basis. You can only receive a yearly review which can lead to, at the max, a 5% overall raise. This is the only the only way to get compensation for the hard work you put in."
good,"good local neighbor hood location. Could have shorter holiday hours. management was good, pretty good discount on products. Friendly staff and customers always makes a good work environment."
good,"I enjoyed the company very much, it was fast paced, and i personally enjoy helping customers out. I have a lot of customer service comments, that can be viewed"
good,Most of my co workers were very friendly.  i made some close friends. I got know customers by face and first name which made their experience much more pleasant and personable.
good,Theres a lot of changes happening..they dont pay well with your experiences. Lack of leadership makes it hard working day to day. With the Walgreens buy out you dont know what and where you'll end up.
good,Its a ok place to work at. I'm jus looking to expand my range of interest and knowledge. I'm interested in making more than what I make at Rite Aid to support my family.
good,If you have the ambition its a great stable job with plenty of advancement opportunity within store level. Must be willing to work EXTREMELY hard.
good,All in all not really a bad place to work. Over the years retail pharmacy has changed so much. Sometimes it feels like more profit based then customer experience based. There's too much asked of too little staff and asked to do it with a smile. You must be patient and well equipped to multi task. I started with this company when it was a Thrift Drug. I've gone through 3 possibly 4 buy outs and learned no one company is better than any other. The hardest part of a work day can vary from day to day. For me it's the standing on a concrete floor all day and having to deal with difficult customers and co-workers. You'll have that any where.
good,"They were great about scheduling around my school schedule, and the customers were usually great, but thats about all there is to say about it unfortunately. not much room to advance and a lot of empty promises that dont get followed up."
good,"An overall good work environment with friendly workers, also learned how to properly communicate with managers given I also worked a second job. Managers were very understanding and did whatever was in their power to ensure that employees were never at an inconvenience."
good,"A typical day at work is to greet customers and to make sure that they find everything they need. Customers are our number one priority. The management is just fine and they will work with you when you have any questions or concerns. The most enjoyable part of the job is that your hours are flexible and you can talk to someone that is working with you. The hardest part would be truck day, because i would have to run back and forth to make sure that no customers are needing help while i put my stock up."
good,"A typical day at work for me was getting seasonal isle looking really nice, Ringing up customers, helping people find things, checking in orders. Honestly there was nothing actually hard about the job, Management and handling all of the money is stressful at times but that is why we have other people there to help you if you need it. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was meeting new people and making new friends."
good,"Giving great customer service , doing freshness making sure there is no outdated foods or other products. Restocking the shelves and making sure they look neat and clean."
good,I was a shift supervisor for rite aid. I like being able to advance into a manager but you have to handle everything pretty much by yourself.
good,"Hard work loading and unloading merchandise was the hardest part of the job. Heavy lifting never ends every week same story, truck comes take it all down. You are sore for a week.."
good,"Getting store ready for cashiers and customers , end of the day , making sure store shelves stocked and neat, floors and overall  cleanliness . Best part of my job was relation with customers. The hardest part of my job the very long hours ! Co workers, pleasure to work with ! Manager was the best."
good,"There isn't a day that goes by where my co-workers and my customers don't make me laugh. Since I've been with Rite Aid, I've learned how to maneuver the pharmacy system. It's much different than what I'm used to but I caught on quickly. Management is great with communication and offering opportunities. There is no ""hardest part of the job""..."
good,The most enjoying part of this job was that you get are empower to be creative and make good independent business decision that will help grow sales in your store.
good,"A typical day at work at Rite Aids for me would be stand at register, greet customers, help customers with any problems they may need help with and also ring them up for the items that they purchase. I learned how to work the register and also how to deal with different types of customers personalities. The hardest part about the job for me is not having the inventory customers may need right then and there. The most enjoyable part is satisfying the customers."
good,"clean workplace with good friendly environment."
good,"Working close with the pharmacists learning about processing prescriptions.  Giving the best customer service to the customers.  Helping them find what they need.  Boonville, NY is a great place to work.  Very small town and many people I do know."
good,I was lucky enough to do my internship here. In one days mail of receiving my resume I went from Pharmacy Intern to Pharmacy Manager in a day. In my pharmacist career I have never been the staff pharmacist but always the Pharmacy Manager PIC. I am the youngest Pharmacy manager Rite Aid every had at 23 years old.
good,"I seem to have fit in with co-workers very well.  I was asked by a manager to take the promotion into my current job.  He thought I would be a great fit for the job, because I enjoy helping the customers.  The worst part of my job is before & during flu season I must ask everyone if they would like a flu shot.  I upset some people that do not want a flu shot because they get asked so often."
good,"Working at Rite Aid Pharmacy is a challenging job. You must keep your head, ears, and eyes on a swivel. Every day is a learning experience, learning computer skills, and customer skills. The management is superb, the management is flexible with hours and work schedule. The hardest part of the day is being short handed with the work schedule and the business cutting hours to have it current employees working 8 hours+ during the working week. Also, looking past the hard work, knowing each of the customers that come into the pharmacy is well worth it. I really like knowing and remembering multiple customers by names, birthdays, phone numbers, and also some of the customer's relatives is a good challenging part of my job."
good,work days varied some busy others quiet all the same it was honor to serve the patient despite the challenges of working short handed because of the cut tech  hours
good,"At Rite Aid I work in the pharmacy as a pharmacy technician. As a technician I am responsible for various tasks. One of the main tasks is to ring up customers in the store or in the drive through for picking up their prescriptions and making sure that proper identification is collected at drop off or check out if needed. I am also trained in entering/filling prescriptions for customers and knowing what forms of identification are required for controlled substances. I have also been trained to follow all state and federal laws in accordance to HIPAA in the protection of patient information. I have also been trained to answer phone calls from patients as well as doctors in regards to patient prescriptions (whether or not they are ready for pick up or if there is an issue with the prescription itself. I have become well trained in calling various insurance agencies in regards to insurance rejections, prescription rejections, or  vacation supplies. I have also been trained to check in the pharmacy McKesson inventory system to see if certain supplies are available for refills or new prescriptions or how to check online if a nearby Rite Aid pharmacy has the needed supply. I am also able to order more inventory when needed through the online portal and via the McKesson phone system. I am also well educated in billing different insurance companies. This job has also helped in expanding my medical knowledge in learning the uses of different medications."
good,learn a lot working a Pharmacy. rite Aid decent company to work for. Had great co-workers very friendly staff.Great learning experience love the customers.
good,this job was fun and alot of experience for me and I really enjoyed the customers.  The job however did not want to work around my school schedule and I had to leave.
good,"A good place for first timers looking for a job. The place is union so the job has good job security and benefits. The pay is not great but not low. You do get a good jump in raise, if you stay there over 6 years. The down side when you hit your 6 years, you don't really get a raise unless you get promoted."
good,"A constantly improving company that never settles for just"
good,It was a great job to start off my career to working full time and learning new areas of the store. I not only worked in the pharmacy but got to meet new people in the different areas of the store.
good,The biggest wear house I've ever seen with three huge buildings and hundreds and hundreds of workers that seemed to get along great.  It was a quick pace environment and the days flew by.
good,"A typical day at work consists of providing satisfactory customer service, re-stocking products, and assisting in opening and closing the store."
good,Rite aid was a interesting place to work. Payroll was so tight that as a manager you only worked with 1 associate. I enjoyed working with   my co-workers.
good,Changed managers often. not paid enough but otherwise good people and a good place to work. the most enjoyable part of my job was the customers.
good,"I would watch the sales floor for shoplifters. After the elements were met, I would apprehend the shoplifter and have them criminally charged."
good,"Preserved integrity of data by processing prescriptions with knowledge of the SIG codes used within the database.	Verified accuracy of patient’s history on labels, and on prescribed medicine, in compliance to the federal law.	Served as a liaison between pharmacists and customers to successfully address all customer inquiries."
good,"there are plenty of customers come in per day when I process money orders, lottery sales and sales for regular merchandise. I clean store in the front and inside and restock shelves when needed. "
good,"Rite Aid is changing their overall corporate culture for the better. They have a 2 week rotating schedule, and are usually are very good about letting you have off when you need to be, ex. vacation requests. They are usually full sy=taffed, and are very professional in their approach to pharmacy, and highly value their customers."
good,My responsibilities were to ring up customers and provide excellent customer service. I learned how to multi-task and prioritize my tasks that need to done starting with the most important to the least. The management there was really friendly and easy to work with along with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was having to be able to tend to the floor duties and manage the cashier. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the variety of customers and starting up a new conversation each time.
good,"Shifts range from 8 -12 hours at a time, while only allowing a 30 minute lunch break in between. Learned a lot of technical skills and to apply the knowledge I obtained from college."
good,The typical day is is thankfully somewhat predictable as far as knowing when you are going to work and what daily duties need to be completed.  The unknown circumstances is what makes the job challenging and interesting.  Each patient has different needs and expectations so the experience is never boring.  There is always something new to learn everyday which is both exciting and frustrating.
good,it a nice place to work because you meet new people the people are very friend and fun
good,"made sure things were clean, "
good,"I worked with a great team of individuals, but management promised a lot opportunities and advancements that never came to fruition. They worked very well with my school schedule and were fairly sympathetic to family responsibilities. I felt like my particular position was a lot of work and not the right amount of compensation."
good,"I enjoyed my cashier position at Rite Aid for five and a half years. I enjoyed having that customer interaction. But with that said, some customers were unbearable. I could not handle anymore rudeness."
good,"Troubleshoot hardware and software issues for Rite Aid retail stores. Including, registers,  servers, photo Equipment, and Scriptpro machine."
good,"Lot of room for advancement. if one is willing to put in work and time they would be able to advance farily fast, but anything past store manager position one would not be able to have any family life."
good,"When I was hired on at Rite Aid in December 2013, another pharmacy in the area was closing down and my company bought out their pharmacy patients. The work load almost tripled, but there was still the same amount of employees. I was hired during a very hectic time, so I had to learn fast. At times it was stressful, but I am grateful for the extra work because it taught me to be a better, more efficient technician. I was given more personal responsibilities such as coordinating our unit dose patients, and controlling inventory. These responsibilities gave me a great sense of pride knowing that I personally saw a patients’ needs through from beginning to end."
good,Check out customers as a cashier  and put away inventory throughout the day
good,"We average about 300 scripts a day, we are very busy, work flow is good. I am constantly learning new things. I have the two best pharmacist, they make the day better telling jokes and singing to us to make us laugh!"
good,it wasnt a bad job just the commute was a big long going to work and just as long going home
good,"A typical day at Sitel consist of answering phones. Learning people skills. the management is ok. Co-workers are usually ok not hard to deal with. The hardest part of the job is not that the job itself is hard ,but dealing with the customers. the most enjoyable part of the job is when I am not working on the phones but answering other representatives questions."
good,A good place to start and get a field of what management is truly like.
good,"Learned alot about customer service "
good,"A typical day at work for me would be coming in and first thing i do is pull up a list of patients who need to pick up medication. We do not want to have to put medication back (delete it) so we make house calls to patients informing them that their medication is ready for pickup and to offer the service that very few patients know of which is, our delivery service! The elderly patients love the idea of having rite aid fill their script and deliver it to their homes! In the time that i have worked for Rite Aid i have learned how to work very closely with other team members because i never really had to work that close with my co-workers. I have also learned the importance of work ethic, having a very tough manager helped me develop a work ethic that employers love! I have had a very tough manager in the past but i appreciate him for the employee he molded me to be. "
good,This was a great job as a high school student trying to earn a bit of an income and begin saving for college.  Overall it was an enjoyable work environment; co-workers and managers were great and easy to get along with!
good,"Good place to work got along with all managers and coworkers. Tasks are giving to you at beginning of the day which is nice. You will get pulled from task to task in different departments to be prepared to learn a lot in a short amount of time. Hardest part of this job is learning all the different departments, the most enjoyable part of this job is working with good people and having good managers."
good,Rite Aid has come a long way and is definitely a good company to work for.  I definitely suggest this company to first time managers looking to gain experience.
good,"Pulling medications, filling prescriptions, interacting with patients"
good,i have worked here for 14 years and in that time. I enjoyed my job and had the experience of working in many different environments i worked from a cashier to a store manager.
good,"A typical day for me involved team work, scheduling and organizing layouts and store changes. Through out my three years of experience through Rite Aid, I was constantly taking courses to improve my skills and help my employees also strive for better learning and processes. My co-workers always knew they could depend on me day or night, if I was not at work they knew I was always available to answer any questions. I made sure the people that worked around me were comfortable and could feel free to express their opinions without possible retaliations. I never felt there was a ""hard part"", in essence it was the challenges that helped me learn the most and what I appreciated in the end."
good,Sometimes very stressful but with a good team you're days will be enjoyable
good,"Rite Aid tends to see employees as bodies to fill a time-slot, instead of unique individuals who can really drive the company."
good,"I really like that they focus greatly on the safety of the Associates."
good,liquor order cashier unload truck put it away markdowns sale item
good,They worked very well around my full time job and my family life.
good,"Enjoy working and assisting customers."
good,"My typical day work was always challenging because I had to handle several jobs at once but did very well. I have learned management duties and how to run a store on my own. I was part of management and a lot of times was the only supervision there so I had to learn very quickly. My co-workers were team players and believed in getting the job done like I did. The hardest part of this job was learning management priorities but what I enjoyed the most was succeeding, getting it done, and doing a very good job."
good,"Would consider working their again.  It is a learning experience.  You need the right supervisor willing to train you.  I had one supervisor/manager that was great, he showed me how things were done and was preparing me for my certification.  I also had one that didn't want to take the time to teach you.  This kind of work environment is fast paced.  You have to have patients when dealing with clients."
good,Great store in my home community. Great co-workers and manager. Maintain basic store upkeep and provide customers with excellent service.
good,Managerial challenges include non trust worthy employees. Your team of associates may not always be willing to work per your business plan which is drawn out per your discretion as a store manager hence it becomes harder to enforce your business plan and ideas
good,"Busy and fun "
good,"A typical day at popeyes was busy, being that it was a new store that never had this type of product in the area. I learned time management and how to deal with difficult co workers in a stressful situations. Many of the employees we hired were young and didn't have any clue how stressful this job was going to be. The co workers that stuck in were trained correctly and became asst. managers when I left. It was just a fun place to work even though it was challenging sometimes."
good,"work meant more and more metric work less  and less time to filll prescriptions and patient interaction, co-workers  ok"
good,"Shifts vary from 9 to 12 hours . Very busy pharmacy , 3000+ rx's per week . Staffing difficult because fairly remote so candidate pool limited . "
good,This was a good place to work. The people were friendly. I enjoyed getting to know my customers personally.
good,This company is a very good company to work for however there are a few set backs that I encountered one was that I is very hard to advance within the company..........
good,"On a typical work day it is key that I team up with management and discuss any growing concerns involving asset protection which includes external loss as well as internal loss. If a problem does arise, a plan of action is generated, and executed. Working for this company I've learned to trust my decisions in high stress situations, as well as holding others around me in the work place accountable for their actions. Management at Rite Aid are extremely fair, and easy to access. The hardest part of my job is to remain safe at all times when apprehending a subject. The most enjoyable part of my job is doing everything within my power to create a safe, and honest work place."
good,"A typical day at work is stocking shelves coolers answerings phones riging up customers and some minor maintenance."
good,"Difficult time dealing with the air conditioner fan above which would blow heat during the hot summer.  On cold days it would blow cold air.  Dressing in layers was not fun and then stripping was not always possible when you wanted to get a layer off.  "
good,Great working environment. The owner really cares about his employees!
good,Employees were friendly and helpful.It is a very big building with a lot of activitivy going on.
good,Company in which you can grow with a team that you can call your family.
good,I enjoyed working with the people I worked with. We had a good flow and were in tune with each other.
good,"Gave me lots of hands on experience with working along side a pharmacist. Learned to handle myself in many situations. Taught me how to deal with different types of people with different backgrounds, different situations, and different needs and desires. Atypical day at work consists of me preparing medication to be picked up by the customer, filling prescriptions in their respective vials, making the work area was always neat a presentable, making sure every customer had their needs met in a polite and timely manner, and working promptly. The hardest part of the job was know there were many things that needed to be finished but customers waiting in line at the same time. I learned to cope with this by managing my time and calming my mind. I was careful not to get overwhelmed. I learned quickly that, that made the situation even worse."
good,"coworkers great to work with, easy job, learened alot working in different department"
good,"Everyday the goal is great housekeeping.  Organized salesfloor, office, and stockroom.  So the day begins with walking the store and fixing any issues.  After the doors open the focus is customer service.  The usual retail projects of restocking the salesfloor, checking for outdated merchandise, and planograms are daily task.  The highest priorty is customer service.  Management establishes leadership. Co-workers are encouraged teamwork.  The hardest part of the job is exceeding the goals with the amount of workload. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and seeing familiar faces everyday."
good,was a great company to drive for until they sold out the transportation dept to ryder.
good,"Retail work. Cleaned the store, as well as working the cash register and handling customer concerns."
good,Great place to work!!! Great flexible hours. Really enjoyed working for this company/
good,Rite Aid is an Ok place to work. I feel it is a company that is losing ground in this area with CVS and Walgreens. I applied for a completely different job than I was hired for. I applied for a position as a Wellness Ambassador and was told I would be working in Pharmacy. I did not want to work in the Pharmacy again. I was told I had to wait for the district manager to give me an interview. After a couple weeks I was told that the manager that hired me had no authorization to hire me for that position. Then I was shipped off to an other store because they didn't have any hours for me and after a couple weeks at the other store I was told the same thing.
good,"Work was incredibly busy. I was required to accept incoming prescriptions, be friendly to customers who were not feeling well, prepare prescriptions, work with insurance companies, answer phone calls, manage inventory, be organized, and handle an accurate till. The hardest part of the job was the long hours; sometimes 12 hours if management had asked me to stay. The most enjoyable was my management team."
good,It was very fun and interesting working with the customers at the pharmacy. The days were very long and I was part-time working full-time hours only making minimum wage.
good,Easy and busy job. There was always something to do so the time passed by quickly.
good,Handeled transactions behind the register.
good,"Working in a Pharmacy, dealing with insurance, customer service and other things all at once takes a special person to multi task many tasks. Typically going in daily, it seems like deja vu every day because your doing the same thing over and over again, but running into different issues, when it comes to insurance, medication, or health problems for the customers, and i have to work diligently to get it right before my day is over. Daily i am learning 1 how a pharmacy is actually run, and 2 that every need a person has is very important big or small. The people that i work with are amazing. I couldn't ask for any better co workers. The hardest part of my job, is actually being patient in the times that the customers are yelling in your face (knowing there wrong). Keeping my cool, is something i have worked on ALOT when it comes to customer service. Helping the customer quickly and accurately is the #1 thing for me that i focus on daily. Helping them from where a certain item is in the store , to calling the insurance company myself and dealing with that issue so the customer can get what they need without them calling themselves. My favorite part of this job is actually helping the customers, and making friends. Having them walk in and already having the script in my hand (because of knowing there name) means a lot to them. Being a personable person is what people are looking for when it comes to customer service, and i believe that working with Rite Aid this has made me accomplish this daily."
good,Worked part time while in college. Overall good experience. Hard physical work at a fast pace.
good,It was a great job experience for me. I enjoyed helping people and making sure that I accommodate them. My co-workers were great. They were very friendly and helped in many ways.
good,"A typical day at rite aid was reviewing and verifying prescription, supervising pharmacy tecnicians , counseling pation on the appropraite use of medication and various side effects. Performing MTM services when needed, The management was good and fair . the job was not hard and i enjoyed counseling my patients on thier medication"
good,I helped the pharmacist fill prescription and address customers concerns.
good,fast pace and busy.
good,Helping others at a women's shelter means the world knowing I'm part of the team.
good,"Rite Aid Corporation is one of the nation's leading drugstore chains, operating approximately 4,700 stores in 31 states and the District of Columbia."
good,Working as a team is very important to me. The turnover was very high ~ as a Manager I would build a team then would be moved to another store and start over again.
good,"A typical day at work, handling the fast paste of the environment. It's a very busy work place but good for the right people. The management within the walls of the business are very strict. I always learn something new wether its with the customer's, or my co workers, even the products we sell, its always something exciting for you to learn there. I would say the hardest part of the job are keeping up with the fast paste and helping customers as they approach you. I find it enjoyable because the day's, week's, and month's go back quickly. I love doing multiple things at one time. I love having the feeling of appreciation when I'm able to satisfy a customers need. I enjoy my job and helping others."
good,"customer service , learning labeling and plan o grams . learning stocking and phasing . the management was very nice and understanding my co workers were once again a big family ."
good,This was my first job and they gave me a chance. i got to meet some great people.
good,fillind prescripyions helping patients with questions and problems
good,Normal work setting with normal duties and hours. A great job to get used to being in a working environment. Not really anything that really can be learned from working here other than to be dependable and do your duties. Great place to learn to work with the General Public.
good,"Ensured daily reports were sent to management by specfic deadlines. Ordered supplies for distribution ctr via purchase order, or COUPA. Ensured Temps payroll information was correct  and sent to proper agency."
good,"From a loss prevention agent aspect, now renamed Asset Protection agent, The Rite Aid  APA program will give you a full span and understanding of loss prevention in its entirety,  and give you the skills you need and can take anywhere.  The fundamentals of loss prevention doesn't change, the 5 steps to making an apprehension.  But what does change is companies policies, rules and regulations. I recommend Rite Aid, weather you are starting you Loss Prevention career or continuing your career."
good,"Great opportunity for growing in retail pharmacy field. "
good,"Rite aid is a great company with great potential. At times the leaders treat each pharmacy like they’re all the same and won’t hear the staff out on ways to improve productivity. It’s a decent workplace but can be understaffed and overwhelming at times. There’s a union and medical benefits are good and affordable. You accumulate personal days off, vacation and sick paid time iff"
good,All depends on the quality of the manager. Raises are once a year and set with the union in Philadelphia. I'm a student to the ability to have a flexible schedule is ideal for me.
good,"Multiple attempted mergers/buyouts resulted in layoffs. People are great, but the culture/mood has been negatively impacted. (Understandably) It is a large company with Corporate offices and retail stores, distribution centers -- each area represents a different type of work environment. Overall the company has invested a lot to improve the experience of the associates at work.  However, as mentioned, the recent merger troubles really put a dent into the improvements they were making."
good,"The pharmacy is a very busy, fast-paced job.  The people who work there are great and any time I needed time off for a special occasion it has been honored."
good,3.5 day work weeks 12 hour shifts 30 min lunch and work every other weekend. off during the week and  have to do in house marketing for company  work in HEB location only 4 in San Antonio
good,"Busy just like every other retail chain, but with more of a welcoming environment and kinder corporate team. The medical record system, NexGen, is user friendly and allows you to easily multi task."
good,its a decent place to work. don't have very many complaints and management can be understanding of issues that come up and work with you on them sometimes.
good,"i didnt really enjoy my job to much immaturity, no body liked to do their section of work , someone was always talking about somebody, and being sick was a problem"
good,Staff there was amazing. Everyone worked as a team and were able to finish daily duties. Store manager and assistant manager were very professional and followed company standards and procedures. Weekly computer training was mandatory for everyone. 100% of proceeds went directly to childrens hosp.
good,"Team members and the shift supervisor will typically work together to face aisles and replace merchandise taken off of shelves. Managers are usually organizing stock that is almost ready to hit the shelves and making sure prices match, etc. Managers will handle any and all customer complaints, refunds, and approving overrides. The most fun part of this job was being able to organize and set up holiday/clearance aisles. Another fun aspect of this job was being able to help people find what they are looking for and helping them feel satisfied with their visit."
good,Is a great company to work for. Never really know what is going to happen on a day to day basis. And non two days are really the same. The hardest part is balancing work and life. Being in management you are sort of on call 24/7. If something happens you are ultimately responsible to fix it. Other than that it is a great position.
good,Great staff with a relaxed worked setting. Fast-paced as you would expect with any pharmacy but very effective at goal/task completions. All around great experience.
good,"I have been with this company over 7 years, I wish we had more staff so that when an employee calls in sick we have back up. When we are working well together it is a great place to work."
good,The management team I worked with was amazing. Jobs were divided up equally among all employees and the management team. Everyone was treated equally and fairly.
good,"Coming in as a Tier I, I had about a month of training. This was also my first IT-related job. I quickly made some friendships with my coworkers since we all had similar mindsets. Work environment among peers is great, however, results are inconsistent when it comes to management, especially with the relatively recent merger with WBA, releasing about 40% of the store count and forcing layoffs at all corporate levels. Things have stabilized since then somewhat, however, morale is still somewhat low due to a much smaller roster of technicians."
good,"My experience working with the company was good they treated me equal, same went towards to the other employees that worked there, and the managers also help me become more of a team leader when helping new employees starting and also show that I'm can be reliable when it comes to tasks and helping the company image."
good,I like working there the hours are good it be better if we started at 8am. We get off in time to get stuff done before 5. Its a fast passing job. Most of the pepole are understandable when it comes to needing time off.
good,I had 3 roles at Rite Aid Distribution Center. The first was picking products in detail for orders and filling up Totes/Crates. The 2nd role was stocking the other shelves for the pickers with the right product. 3rd was building skids with the totes and boxes. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with a productivity level making almost zero errors for orders for each days quota. I stayed because it was good benefits and good pay. I left to go to GA. If not for that I would of stayed there for more work.
good,I really enjoyed working for Rite Aid I really wish they would not have gave up and sold the company I think they just had the wrong people in some positions they shouldn’t have been in
good,"In the years I worked for Rite Aid, I was able to learn many aspects of the business from the time product was initially reviewed, to the moment it was placed on the shelves at store level. I enjoyed my employment with Rite Aid and would recommend them to anyone seeking opportunities.  The most enjoyable part of my positions were the teams that I worked with and the teams I was responsible for.  Every position has its challenges, however, you learn from these challenges and develop a great team to work through them."
good,"Rite Aid is a good employer. They provide monthly online training to all employees which I believe is good as a refresher. They try to have a manager, supervisor and cashier every shift which is good."
good,Loved partnering with my field teams.  Loved the cafeteria - great opportunity.  Loved the challenge of always something new every day.  I like making a difference.
good,"If you can't sympathize with patients, this job is not for you. On an average day, we would get patients, scrips, and phone calls all as soon as we opened. Technician hours are being reduced, so my home pharmacy is down to one technician per weekend. When I work weekends, one pharmacist and I fill around 200 scripts per day. If you can't handle time management and customer service, this job is not for you. You're the middle man between patients and their insurance companies, and patients will get mad at you, even when it isn't your fault. Patience is vital, and empathy is recommended."
good,great and relaxing and dealt with customers but definetely not into the pharmaceutical field it worked great with my hours as a student in highschool.
good,It was a great place to work. I got along with all of my coworkers. But the pay isn't very good and I recieved no healthcare benefits. My hours worked around my significant others. He worked during the day and I worked evening/night time.
good,Rite aid was a challenging but fair environment that paid pharmacists very well. Unfortunately they have sold most stores to Walgreens. Rite aid had state of the art software programs and a good corporate structure with pharmacists answering to pharmacists. You only know what you had once its gone.
good,I loved the challenge. Everyday was a new project. Merchandising was my biggest asset. I always had an excellent working relationship with my superiors
good,"Can be a fun place to work and can be fast paced, dependent on location. Very flexible with schedules and other work or school related commitments as well paid time off."
good,"The position and department I was in was not the right fit for me. I am usually a detail-oriented person, but when they throw too many details at you, it can be hard to keep up. for the size of the department, we had to wrangle too many responsibilities. It was stressful, and I wasn't happy there."
good,"Wonderful management team and great coworkers. "
good,The workplace environment at our location was enjoyable because of the co-workers but the pay is a make-or-break for people. The customers are off-and-on and some can be extremely rude but there are also really nice regulars.
good,"I really enjoyed the customers that came in and received their medication. The majority of the patients were very polite and patient.My boss was very professional and very kind, but most importantly very understanding. Loved working with my customers and more so with my fellow employees."
good,"At Rite Aid I learned all the ins and outs of a daily structured schedule in retail. The real behind the scenes of ordering process, expiration's and theft."
good,"The workplace was busy, but I prefer it that way, less opportunities to watch time go by. I learned about the types of drugs, and how controlled substances have different ""schedules"" based on levels of addictive and dependency tendencies."
good,"Was a good temporary job while in college, minimum wage pay, mornings and nights, friendly coworkers, but poor management at the time. Didn't enjoy working at night leaving really late after my scheduled cut time passed."
good,"working for rite aid was a good experience because they have a different way of dealing with customer, different culture. I still can recommend a friend to work for rite aid."
good,"Great customer interaction. By working here I have learned how to care for customers. From working here I could see what all the pharmacist does, which is good because I am going to school to become one."
good,"I must say that I really did enjoy meeting and servicing the people in the community where Rite Aid was located. The workplace can be stressful due to the lack of payroll from corporate.However, its so much to learn and their is room for advancement within the company.."
good,"Good communication"
good,Rite-Aid was a good place to work. Nice and friendly place to work co-workers were willing to help out to get the job done in a timely manor. There was room for advancement. The pay and benefits were great
good,"My experience at rite aid was not bad at all, i just thought management was a bit too laid back and just let the workers do all the work, i feel like it wasnt enough pay but then again the work was nto really hard"
good,"The work place is always open to different situations and personalities which allowed everyone to be themselves. "
good,"I have learned a lot during this job and had the pleasure of working under a manager and the pharmacist who was not only amazing and very knowledgeable, but also very helpful and approachable."
good,"I wake up every morning pumped to walk into work... sounds cliché, but so true! The culture is unlike any company I've come to work for or interviewed for. Everyone in the Glassdoor community is truly genuine and extremely helpful in all aspects. Upper management will help you focus on your next career steps, in setting up mentorships and having one-on-ones to meet your goals."
good,There’s really not much to say about this but I was the customer service when people called and most of the time it was answering people’s questions about the website and people who wanted to apply for rite aid. Honestly the only part of my job that was hard was the people who had given me attitude but I was always friendly with them regardless and tried my best.
good,I think this is a great job to have especially for college students. Hours are flexible and there is room to grow for those seeking any opportunity to grow.
good,"One thing I liked about my position was the variety."
good,"I worked at 5 different stores as a loss prevention specialist. I did cycle counts if products seemed off and work with police for my apprehensions."
good,"Great company to work for as a starter job. Very friendly people and awesome customers to work with.  Has taught me a lot of new skills, especially people skills."
good,I started as a cashier and ended up being a supervisor. was a great college job and chance to learn business. The manager at the store was great and very accommodating with my schedule for classes.
good,"Good part time job for students, hours are generally flexible. Management can get a bit overwhelming but that's due to the high work load. For CA youre required to be part of the union if you are an employee, if hired seasonally you are not but if you become a permanent hire, the union will make you back pay from your original start date. watch out for that."
good,Rite aid is a fairly good place to work. You can learn a lot and advance up the latter real quick. I enjoyed getting to meet all the different people. No day was ever the same. I learned a lot there when I became a shift supervisor. Management is pretty good to work for. I had a good manager.
good,"Rite aid is a good place to work to improve customer service skills, money handling, and management skills. The company has currently been sold to walgreens."
good,"It's a typical retail environment. Corporate will always have their expectations as far as metrics go, but I like the environment that always puts the customer first."
good,"Work is ok, I took this job to help pay for college, opportunities for advancement are slim, no one really moves around or is promoted in the building.  All the people I've directly reported to are still in their same roles 6 and a half years after I started with the company."
good,"Working for Rite Aid Pharmacy has been a great experience. I have met wonderful people while working here, customers and co-workers. A typical day at work is having to multitask, assist customers, and be prepared to be busy everyday. I have gained tons of experience while working at Rite Aid."
good,"I liked working here, but only because I got along with the other employees. Some of the customers that came in, though, were quite awful. So rude and demanding, and sometimes belligerent. But, it was an ok place to work."
good,Local employees were always fun to work with.  Enjoyed talking to the customers and being able to help them in regards to their prescriptions and other pharmacy needs.
good,"A typical day is assist the Store Manager with the operation of the retail store including lead associates "
good,Me working at Rite Aid was really cool. I was able to work once or twice a week and at least 2 day on the weekend all while being a full time student.
good,"Rite Aid was a good company to work for. Everyday was different, but I enjoyed working with the customers, and making sure they were taken care of.The hardest part of the job was not having enough hours to staff the store.."
good,A typical Rite Aid can be found in both suburban and urban locations within many cities and successfully meets the pharmaceutical needs of the local community.  The corporate culture is comfortable and comparable to other retailers and competitors.  I would recommend the front end associates position to a dedicated motivated person that considers themselves to work well with and for people.
good,"It is a productive, fast-paced environment. You must be able to multi-task, have high energy and excellent customer service skills to thrive in this environment."
good,"the customers were great and i really enjoyed helping them.  it was very very fast paced, and you had to multitask all the time ex phone, drive thru and counter, as well as fill prescriptions.  they did not pay the techs well at all."
good,"7.76 is not enought to live on. I loved the job, and the people I worked with. I especially loved my manager, but I couldn't survive on the pay. That's why I left."
good,"My typical day at Food-Rite was customer service, food preparation, cake decorating, keeping the work area clean, rotating stock, etc."
good,I honestly don't have a problem working at where I use to work. The job was simple easy and not all that hard though I did wish the pay was a bit more.
good,I have worked for rite for almost 6 years its not a bad job i just hate area i work lots of tweakers ... its frustrating a lot but of nice people too.. I enjoy most of my co workers and pharmacists but many do not want to stay in this area because its too small and new pharmacists are from bigger cities
good,"Like all retail pharmacies, Rite Aid is fast-paced and stressful at times. Hours are pretty decent no late hours. Weekends are alternating so I only have to work about 1 weekend per month. We are union and the pay is really good! About $4-5 over CA minimum wage when hired as pharmacy tech with experience. The only negative part of the job is that corporate doesn’t allow as many hours as we need and so we are understaffed for the day & that is what makes it stressful and busy."
good,It was a nice place to work and I had great co-workers. Unfortunately the pay is not great at all. pay raises did not come often. I worked there due to necessities.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the many people I met, especially the customers, who became known on a first name basis."
good,"Was a great place to work, got to talk with a lot of interesting people, work in a fast pace environment and got to work with some really great people."
good,"Rite Aid is big on customer service, which is not a bad thing, it makes for better customer relationship and a better work environment. Dealing with insurance can be the most difficult part of the job."
good,The management really didn't care who you were or about your home life. They made you work when they wanted even if you said you could only do mornings. They would schedule you for nights.
good,Typical retail job. Good focus on Customer Satisfaction. Always plenty to too much work to be done. Not always enough people to get it all done. Good understanding of work life balance.
good,"the daily routine of my experience are the following"
good,"Working at rite aid I learned a lot about medications, how to work with patients and their everyday needs. this job was one of the best jobs I had. learning to fill prescriptions , ordering medicine, checking expires, and working at the register sometimes helped me learn a lot."
good,"I wouldn't recommend this to college graduates, but good for students looking to make some extra cash.  Alright, but I left because I was not getting enough hours.  Competitive workplace."
good,It was a pretty decent job. I only left because i had to move to another state. Union was ridiculous though! Just BS. I only got paid $7.80/hour AND they took $20 out per month for union dues!! But great co-workers!
good,Customers are normally friendly. Management team and employees work together as a team. Team is well coached for the daily duties ahead. Everyone knows what is expected of them as a Rite Aid team member. Many of the customers are regulars and come often.
good,"As soon as you arrive you have to be ready to count the safe/balance safe if necessary, organize the manager office space, read daily emails and get tills ready for the shift you're managing for the day."
good,"Working for Rite Aid was a very great experience for me. I loved all my co-workers and management staff. If it wasn't for working at Rite Aid, i wouldn't have went back to school. I sometime miss working for the organization."
good,Fast Pace Good Company Stable Job Supervisor are very nice and cooperative and they are open to any suggestion that may help the Company better and they care about the safety of they're worker and they give incentives like discount on all Ride Aid Store and gift card and well compensated good health benefits.
good,"I would clock in, settle my things and start doing the tasks that were left written for me in the office. I'll walk around the store and sort things out when I finished my tasks, and helped customers with their needs as I did so."
good,The job gets boring t times. Not very much business. Its easy and relaxing. There weren't many people on my shifts. Most people were nice and the co workers were awesome.
good,I have enjoyed working with Rite Aid. This company pushes me every day to be a better pharmacist. I have worked with multiple pharmacies and the associates at this company seem to all be chosen for their caring personalities. They care for each other and the multitude of customers and patients they serve.
good,A typical workday included checking product for out of dates. Setting up new planograms throughout the store. Setting up sales in the store. Making sure customers were happy.
good,"While working in the pharmacy as a technician, I gained unparalleled knowledge and experience that I wouldn't have gotten by working a normal retail job. I also gained knowledge of the inner workings of the pharmacy, such as how health insurance companies are billed and how doctor's offices communicate with the pharmacy both directly and indirectly. While working as a sales associate, I gained a great deal of customer service experience and learned how to deal with difficult customers. This helped me in my future management roles as well."
good,"I loved working for Rite Aid, however the pay was not acclimated to your experience. Started out at minimum wage and was given 2% each year. Fulltime 40 hours not the required 35 makes it hard to live on the income."
good,"My typical work day was helping the front end with customers, stocking the shelves, taking care of out of date products, counting down drawers, opening and closing the store, reconciliation of the store, and help the associates and customers. My next typical work day would be helping the pharmacy being a cashier and pharmacy technician. I would open and close the pharmacy when needed before I became full time. Once I became full time I would help re stock the medication shelves, record doctor prescriptions, fill the medication and place prescriptions in review for the pharmacist. I would also help with taking care of the customers checking out their prescription's."
good,"I enjoyed working in Rite aid as a Pharmacist. From the start to the end of each day, providing patient care is a very fascinating experience. A management which fully supports customer care gives us peace of mind that each customer will appreciate a job well done."
good,While I worked at Rite Aid I noticed that the employees that I worked with were not the nicest people to the customers and have no knowledge of our products we sold or where they were located within the store.
good,rite aid its a good place for those who are try to get the their feet wet as a pharmacy technician. its a fast paced environment. the job of consist of many things customer calling. filling and data entry.
good,"its a fun place to work at, also challenging. everyday i come into work I am prepare to learn new things from my coworkers. They still have to work on management team."
good,"I loved working for Rite-Aid,  I just needed better hours and pay. But I truly believe they care for you as a person. I thought management was exceptional."
good,I enjoyed working there but did not like the hours and having to work holidays and weekends. My manager was great. I liked interacting with the customers and getting to know them.
good,"I've been working for rite aid for about 2 years or so and it's been pretty good to me, pretty decent company to work for but it's easy to get stuck doing the same thing over and over"
good,I liked working here. you just have to be willing to take on responsibilities and keep up with all the updating. Nice customers most of the time and never a over hectic environment.
good,long stressful day at first .but then got esier as time went on !! would still be there if i wasnt outsourced by another company!! ryder outsourced our delivery jobs!!
good,"We as a team receive prescriptions on a daily basis from 8am to 8pm and process about 350 per day. We take most insurances as well as immunize daily from flu shots to other disease state that our state allows. "
good,It was a good place to work. It was customer focused and customer oriented. Safety was important and a clean work place was important as well.  Team work was also important.
good,Fast pace place. You have to hit numbers that your area require. It is a great place to work at and i would recommend it to anyone looking. As long you get the job done then your job is secured.
good,"Managers need to be paid way more. They work hard and is not compensated enough. Other than that, my working experience here at Rite Aid has been pretty much enjoyable."
good,I have not worked at rote aid for 5+ years when I startted the pay and management was great but companies change change alll the time by the time I left most upper management wear quitting many had told me to leave for my best intrest and the only thing that did not change was there was always .more work then priorities always a change  in direction. Like I said that was a long time ago
good,"I've learned a lot at Rite Aid, most skills I had and improved by working there. Management was fair, you must keep up with the pace though, it's a fast pace job."
good,"Great Management. Employees work exceptionally as team. Job has great benefits. Also, paid time off. They also reward their employees. Ceo's communicate with not only high-ip management but also their regular employees. Its nice to know they they acknowledge their workers."
good,I loved working at Rite Aid and all the responsibility I was given as a pharmacy technician. The pharmacists and management were all great and and I loved working with the customers and the challenges the job provided daily.
good,"As an Assistant manager, I helped in all management duties of inventory, cash handling, staff training, customer service and satisfaction. I found the employee training easy to administer and easily understandable. The Rite Aid employees represented a very diversified mix of cultures and relogions.  I enjoyed working with my District Managers. The most rewarding part of my job was helping  employees grow in their skill sets, prepare for promotions or further their chosen career path. There were several students employed as cashiers."
good,The hardest part of my job Is ensuring that my staff is providing excellent customer service at all times. Customer service and presentation is important in any organization. I've learned that finding the strengths and weakness of your staff can have you organization or business become a success.
good,Had really good benefits with them and met some great people and had promotions from cashier to supervisor within three months of being there then six months later became the assistant manager
good,"I would work at several Rite Aids, I had a 'main store' but I didn't like how often I had to go all the way to another store. Usually they would tell me last minute which location to go to. Overall not bad"
good,Constantly on our feet and dealing with irate customers over insurance problems and medication prices were the only downsides. Being around other like-minded individuals and being able to talk and interact with each other over the course of our shifts was very enjoyable.
good,steady place to work. there are 3 shifts to choose from. Same thing everyday if you like that sort of thing. Not the best for me. A job that helps pay the bills is all it really is
good,"They try to make an impact in culture at Rite Aid, however it is hard to implement nation wide as I found out. Honestly, like most pharmacies, it depends on where you find a job."
good,"Rite-Aid has given me the opportunity to grow as an individual, to meet so many different people & to develop excellent relationships both with fellow management, employees and customer."
good,Enjoyed working with customers but not enough staff scheduled to make the pharmacy run efficiently. I felt like the pharmacist's license was put on the line more than what needed to be due to us having to perform multiple jobs outside of actually practicing pharmacy. We were so busy that we couldn't even sit down and have a 30 minute lunch.
good,"I worked 8 hrs a day, days and evenings. I would come in and someone else call in and I would leave and come back to cover for them. Management seemed to change alot which made it tough on all of us. It was a fun place to work and really get to know your customers. The hardest part was the flip flop schedule."
good,"The pay was lacking, but the management and people were awesome to work with. They would easily work with your schedule and arrange coverage whenever needed."
good,"It was like any other job. You get along with some people, others you don't. Managers will listen to any problems that you may be having, but that doesn't mean they will do anything."
good,I constantly had to work the floor and unload boxes while simultaneously working the cash register while my manager proceeded to watch me work tirelessly. I learned a lot about how to run a store from this job.
good,I see a lot of different people in everyday life. It has introduced me to talking to multiple people/insurances. The most I enjoy about the job is trying to find the best solution for the patients.  I like to problem solve in finding the best medicine to the best cost is. and trying to work with the dr offices while helping the patient.
good,"Shift supervisor is a great position to be in and able to do the most with your customer service experience. I really enjoyed being able to type & fill prescriptions, answer patient questions, and build one on one experiences with each customer. Very fast paced and enjoyable. Did everything from data entry, cash handling(store deposits and change), supervision and training of associates to stocking shelves. HIPPA training and DEA guidelines.  "
good,"when i work i have to greet all customers. I have to make sure the store looks presentable so i have to fix the shelves if they are messy, and have to vacuum the floors. I have had many good experiences especially with customer service."
good,The area that rite aid is located wasn't really safe. And I also was working crazy hours. The staff are awesome but everything else was kinda a disappointment.
good,"As a retail pharmacy technician there is no stereotypical day. Everyday is different from the next which makes it engaging and challenging, since no two day is alike. That is one of the aspects that makes the job enjoyable, you won't ever be bored. However, you'll also have to be on your toes a lot, ready to handle the next big rush of customers and due prescriptions. As a retail pharmacy, there are lots of customers dropping in and out for prescriptions, the phone is almost always ringing, and customers on the floor are asking questions. One of the hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who are impatient, rude, and who don't understand their insurance policies. Despite that, there are customers who appreciate all the effort put into the prescription refill process, such as prior authorizations, early fills, and lost prescription procedures."
good,"I learned how to quickly use the register and advance my skills in counting and dealing with money."
good,"Rite Aid was a great place to work while I went back to school. It is easy, fun and not too demanding. I really enjoyed the ice cream dept. It was nice to make people happy.  Giving them huge scoops of their favorite ice cream flavor. I highly recommend this company for students or semi retired people."
good,It was a great experience I learned a lot. The management team was great. I loved the job. wish they come back to the Philadelphia area...............
good,"Downtown Spokane is crazy busy and very high theft area. You have to watch people steal and not say anything ""accusatory"" or you get fired. It's very difficult. Any other store is decent to work for."
good,My experience working there was a good one. Pay was very low considering the job description. Management was wonderful in my one time of a personal emergency.
good,This a great job to have in college. They worked around my schedule and provide great customer service experience. I would recommend this job for a first or second job or a management position.
good,A typical work day would be very quite at times I would walk the store and watch the cameras making sure there was no one stealing. Management wasn't the best but it was still pretty good.
good,A lot of fun getting to know your daily customers. Always a busy place with room for advancement. Management is always there for you when you need their help with a customer.
good,"i work in the pharmacy, so we get all types of personalities. its hard to predict how your day will be due to that fact.  although this can be a huge struggle, I have a great boss and work with awesome team members which makes my day go by faster and makes things easier"
good,"fun place to work, co workers are helpful, just pay was too low, hours are flexible. 30 minute breaks for anyone working 6 plus hours. can get busy at times but manageable."
good,"For the most part, I enjoyed working here. I feel I work well with just  about anyone, so getting along with coworkers was not an issue for the most part."
good,"Work day at Rite Aid involves taking doctor calls, filling scripts, dispensing drugs, and patients' consultations. The environment at Rite Aid is healthcare oriented where we care about patients' health and safety"
good,"Staff was friendly, work was nothing too complicated. Their was opportunity to advance if wanted. Overall good environment to work, can be busy and need to be able to work in a fast paced setting."
good,This was a great job. I hate they closed it down. The job itself was very easy if you could read. Not too hard & not too easy. I loved it. Management was okay.
good,"What can I say about working in a Pharmacy, there is always something that needs to be done to make sure the store is maintained properly and that each customers needs are met."
good,"A typical day would be sorting mail, faxing , general office work, working on confidential projects with the companies general counsel, cataloging thousands of files for storage , and coping and handling confidential legal documents . I learned how to do all of the above. The management was very nice. Most of my co-workers were nice people. The hardest part lifting heavy boxes. The most enjoyable of my day was working with general counsel."
good,In all I had a very good experience at Rite Aid but I wanted to move on to Mail Order pharmacy but the opportunity did not exist! I worked for Rite Aid for 36 years and made many friends and advocates of my strong work ethic! I was an asset to the company! The last years RX GROWTH  was over 11% being the highest in the district! I will bring this strong work ethic and productivity to my next position in a mail order pharmacy!
good,similar management practices all they care is numbers just like typical corporate company worked there 10 years back so lot of changes might have happened
good,typical day is stressful but can be manageable but hardest part is being a floater. you dont know what to expect each day. being a staff rph is better.
good,"Frequent turnover at top management level."
good,The Wellness Ambassador position is a fairly new role to Rite Aid. You are to report to the pharmacists. Its not necessarily a hard job. Your main job is to promote seasonal immunizations and increase overall script count. You interact with the customers a lot. There's a lot of community outreach and a lot of overall freedom. There is a lot of pressure at times but can be a very rewarding job.
good,Rite aid is a good company for beginning your retail career. Learning to work and help customers from so many different backgrounds helps build salesmanship
good,"Very busy in most stores, while certain stores have very light foot traffic."
good,"Everyday was very productive. since I like always being busy i and constantly busy which I enjoy.The hardest part of this job is that we are constantly understaffed, we have multiple employees doing multiple jobs"
good,"Awesome for college student, and I love the diversity. However I feel that once you excelled over a year you should be able to reap benefits like a raise or a paid week vacation!"
good,"During my time at Rite Aid, I gained a lot of knowledge, the ability to observe and decide if or not I would apprehend a suspect, I also learned the ins and outs of camera installation."
good,"I enjoy working at the Rite Aid Distribution Center, However I'm looking to expand my career and looking for better opportunities."
good,"After working for Rite Aid for six months at the present time, I can say that I did enjoy most of my time there but some days were better than others. A normal day as a cashier would be handling customer transactions, keeping the store front in order, and doing general chores and tasks asked of me by management or shift supervisors. While I did enjoy my co-workers and have shared many a fond night shifts with most of them, my manager and I had a tendency to butt heads too often and I cannot see myself working under her for much longer. The hardest part of the job for me was trying to occupy myself during slow nights. Once all the typical chores were done and I walked around the front to straighten things three or four times in a row, it got hard to keep myself focused on the job. I prefer to stay active and moving with different tasks, not running in circles like a dog chasing her tail. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers. I met so many people from different backgrounds and can hold conversations with some of them as well. Some of our regular customers I have come to adore and I would hate to leave them behind after I leave Rite Aid but I know some part of me will be left with them like some of them have left a part with me as well."
good,Load shipment orders into totes on a conveyor belt. Provide order accuracy by accounting for every item on the list. Label every item with the sticker on the count sheet
good,"RiteAid allowed me flexible job hours, thereby providing me with the opportunity to engage other responsibilities that I had. I learned that it can be hard to work by yourself since at times I was the only one in the store in charge of the cashier and other daily chores mandated by the company. Nonetheless, the experience, although challenging at times, allowed me to develop skills that were dormant up to that time. Working with customers can also be challenging but I found it very rewarding to engage different cultures and ideas; I made a lot of friends through the customer service experience. My overall experience at RiteAid was positive and it was a place where personal as well as professional growth was inevitable."
good,"Rite Aid was my first job that I ever had when I was 18. I have had over the course of two to three years four managers and three associate managers. The store was at a beautiful location in Hackensack but at the time during 2012-2013 this one of Rite Aid's worst Stores in its community. The Stealing was at a high risk, and Management was being fired back to back because of the lack of productivity within the store. It was such a struggle to advance and seek higher positions while working there at that time because of the lack of professional management."
good,"Great customers who appreciated what was done for them."
good,"Rite Aid has been going through some big changes in the past year which can be difficult to adapt to. As with any customer service job, there can be some difficult customers to deal with. However, the job for the most part was relatively enjoyable, with extremely pleasant regular customers. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to work on plan-o-grams and receive truck shipments. The hardest part of the job is the ever changing work environment and policies. My manager herself is understanding and works with her staff and our ever changing schedules, and my coworkers are diverse and friendly."
good,"although the people i worked with were gems, i had a live event occur 2 weeks post-hire. my father had died and i had to immediately get back to work and dive in on a new job. "
good,My co-workers were great and the regular customers were always friendly. I think Rite aid would still be a cool place to work.
good,"As a pharmachy Tech I dealt with customer questions and concerns. I tended to their needs if they were elderly, I would enter in prescriptions, almost always over 400 in the store per day. Needless to say it was very fast paced and busy. When I was shift supervisor I would oversee when the stocking truck came, help stock shelves, help customers, deal with unruly customers, and customer service was always part of the job. I as a supervisor was always either opening or closing."
good,"Not much room for advancement, and when given a higher position the raise was not much. Learned great Customer experience while working here."
good,"a typical work day would including inputting/counting etc.. 200+ RXs dealing with Dr offices and insurance companies, as well as working with patients"
good,put away driver/ i learned how to drive a standup forklift/ boss was great/ co-workers was a big help to make my job easier/ N/A/ coming to work
good,My experience at Rite Aid was very enjoyable. I loved working there because I learned very quickly and nobody had an issue with helping me. My manager was always looking out for my well being. The pay wasn't much but its definitely a learning experience.
good,"Enjoyable place to work"
good,"Very busy place to work at. I like a fast pace work environment makes your day go by fast. Customer are great, always looking to say hi. And they are caring which is quite a rewarding experience."
good,"Busy"
good,"A typical day involves working the cash register for most of the shift.  Other tasks expected of cashiers include nightly facing of the store, and unloading shipments on truck day. Management is helpful, and the scheduling is flexible."
good,"Great work environment with strong management and great employees."
good,"I love working for rite aid, however I feel there is little chance of advancement. The payray that they offer is also not up to par, you are working day in and day out and only getting paid what a person in victoria secret would get. There is hardly time to break because you are always busy. You never get complimented for what a great job you are doing. You are always on your feet and some of the customers are so rude and could careless that you are doing the very best you can."
good,"Overall, I love my job, coworkers, and customers. Sometimes the manager treats us unfairly if we do something that doesn't exactly meet her expectations. I was told if I went back to college my hours would get cut down when I barely get 30 a week. Most days are great. Our district and regional teams are great, I look forward to seeing them when it is time for them to visit. Company as a whole is great."
good,Management was good. The people that worked there care about each other and looked out for each other. The time would fly by and the work load was not bad.
good,Rite Aid is a great company and is expanding with it's Wellness Program. I enjoy engaging with patient's and helping assist with the managing of patient's medication and immunization history.
good,"they will push you with numbers."
good,I learned merchandising skills. Management and co workers are down to earth and comfortable to work around. Hardest part of the job is the constant traveling out of NY.
good,"I would prepare reports daily to assist my District Managers monitoring of the stores. In addition to my various administrative duties, I had the opportunity to oversee Pharmacist staffing for 45 stores in Northern California. I would routinely be required to problem solve to insure the stores were staffed with the best associates for the workload of each stores. Problem solving for sick calls and hard to staff pharmacies. "
good,"I feel overworked and under paid!!!!!"
good,I train Wellness Ambassadors on Clinical. Help meet metrics for my district by traveling and Outreaching to businesses and communities to set up clinics. I oversee 11 Stores . I schedule myself for presentations as well as working in the Pharmacy as needed to keep out customers happy. My main job is to meet metrics when I speak of this I mean Selling products weather in store or outreach on Vaccines. I hold one of the top  spots in the Region
good,"has good co workers and is a good company to work for cares about there employees, the pay rate could be better though. its located in a good area"
good,Loved working this job. I learned a lot about ordering and managing a store. Best part of my job was my manager. We made the best of our work day.
good,"When I got hired at Rite Aid I was initially very excited. The store that I supervised at was the busiest in the district. Every week we did very well in regards to sales, budget, etc. "
good,the first few years was really great and then the company started to hire these Target rejects to help change everything. no a good move at all. Then they started to hire Longs Drugs/CVS Rejects. turn into a big mess.
good,I enjoyed this position but felt that there was no room for advancement unless I would relocate. my manager instilled an amazing work ethic in me that I have not seen in other locations.
good,"Easy going management, loyal co-workers, rewarding at times, developed a lot of customer service skills, became more approachable"
good,just a busy place with very little pay have to deal with alot of rude customers but beside from that it was a gret job they give you alot of hours
good,"I like this job. I have learned so much. The Pharmacists are very flexible and works with you not against you. Everyone works as  a team. Being short staffed is hard sometimes, but I really enjoy helping customers."
good,"Delegating tasks among fellow associates, time management, and finishing the tasks at hand to close the store each night. I learned in management that it is important to not only keep the costumers happy but the associates as well. I learned that time management is very important and that teamwork is always important. My co workers are wonderful people always willing to lend a helping hand and to make sure that expectations are met or exceeded. The hardest part of the job is the time management. The most enjoyable part of this job is providing excellent costumer service and making sure all of my costumers have a wonderful experience."
good,"I would recommend employment at Rite Aid to anyone who is in school. They have great management, and flexible scheduling. Compensation is on the lower end, however so college graduates may need to seek employment elsewhere after completing school."
good,"It's a good working environment, co-workers are very nice and there's always something to do. A typical day would be handling customers who need assistance and being on the register. The hardest part is standing all day."
good,Rite aid is a great place to gain work experience for those who are still in high school or college. I have advanced three times in the organization in the two years that I have been employed there.
good,Experienced different work environments depending which branch I worked at.  My home store had up and down management issues.
good,"Externship for school. Worked under different pharmacists, with different pharmacy technicians. Overall, was an enjoyable experience meeting with different people"
good,"•	Organize and fill prescriptions in a short amount of time."
good,"Typical day at work is a combination of working at the cashier, and stocking the store. Ideal job for college students or anyone needing any part time work."
good,A typical day started with a meeting and the goals of the shift. It was an independent position that was spent physically moving and organizing inventory in tractor trailers to be shipped out to stores.
good,"I have learned very much from all the wonderful pharmacists at this company, however, the pay is very low for technicians. I enjoy working and taking care of my patients."
good,"I enjoyed working at Rite Aid, it's a multiple position meaning you're doing more than just cashiering. i started with a great manger and transitioned with a different manager, than management with south, so with communication at work it really depends on you rmanager"
good,"Typical work day involved checking customers out restocking shelves, taking care of damages. The hardest part of my job was being on my feet all day. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the same people all the time."
good,"enjoyed working there,it was union at the time so takes awhile to move up and pay raises, but if you stick it out it will be worth it in the end."
good,"You get from your job what you bring.  The environment is all about the customer.  If you enjoy people and want to make a difference the opportunities are there for you to enjoy your job.  Must be flexible with your time for working retail you don't have an opportunity to dictate your schedule.  Need to remember that every moment you are at work you are being watched and your actions reflect very loudly.  Success is based on a team environment.  If you work as a team from top of the store to the ""bottom"" and from the front to the RX then you will be a part of a very successful store."
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job was the customers.  A typical day was a lot of cashiering, customer questions,maintain store and answer phones.  there was a lot of multi tasking.  Always got along with my co-workers you have to be a good team player. The hardest part of my had to be trying to maintain late hours I'am a early riser and like to get to work."
good,"Clock in at 1900HRS, report to your manager or shift lead for your assignment for the night and gather all necessary materials (including forklift operator's licenses). You have 2 paid 15min breaks and one unpaid 30min break. For me, i'd eat on my first 15min break, workout on my lunch break & again on my final 15min break at 0330HRS. I learned how to operate MHE (material handling equipment) and how to fill store orders. We had a pretty good management team. My coworkers are from different cultures & ethnic backgrounds but that's what makes the place great, because you can learn from others. Hardest part of the job is probably staying back an hour due to department needs.The most enjoyable part of the job is the fitness center. The job is very physically demanding so they provide a fitness center to help associates to get into shape to be able to perform well on the job."
good,"A typical workday involves filling prescriptions, conversing with physicians about patient medication therapy, dealing with third party insurance companies, utilizing prospective drug review for each patient, counseling patients on OTC and rx meds, and ensuring smooth workflow among pharmacy staff."
good,"Working at Rite Aid was fun and stressful at times. Working there I had great co workers but the manager was bipolar. The job itself was great until inventory or a company visit. OMG, everyone in the store runs around like chickens. I think the management could have been better but overall Rite Aid was my favorite job."
good,"Loss Prevention for Rite Aid was a very eventful position. A normal work day consisted of checking for over night theft, protecting new items in PPD (Product Protection Device), checking counts of supervised items and actively pursuing shoplifters. The job taught me a lot about people. I observed a lot of different people, from totally different backgrounds shoplifting. This showed me that every and anybody has the potential to make blatant mistakes. My co-workers and manager were very easy to work with. I was able to work independently, and make my own decisions pertaining to keeping the stores losses down. The most difficult part of the job was apprehending violent shoplifters. I am trained to protect myself and others, so i was able to keep altercations down to a minimum. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around the many different people. I enjoyed talking and being a small part of my customers lives. I believe that with the constant help from my co-workers, that I made their trip to Rite Aid like no other.."
good,"As a shift supervisor at Rite Aid, the work staff and management are friendly and kind. Everyone does their share of work. The only downfall is pay. Shifts and Assistant managers do exactly the same amount of work but you'd probably make more flipping burgers. The amount of work and your title do not add up to the pay their offering."
good,it a good job but new manger  no good . i like to do retail and would like to work back there if the old manger was there
good,Loved This Place ..Still love all employees that I worked with
good,"enjoyed the work, fast paced and fun things to put out each week."
good,Constant management of cashiers and customer service.  Variable work schedules.
good,"From the day I started working at Rite Aid, I loved the people I worked with and the customers. I was amazed at how friendly everyone was. I have never worked in such a comfortable working environment. A typical day at work consists of honestly, not really doing much, and that is my biggest problem with working there. It is hard to do anything when your are not allowed to leave the front of the store. So when there are no customers, I wipe down counters, sweep the floors, put merchandise back where it belongs and greet the incoming customers. However, there are fast pace times during the days where it is one customer after another and those are the times I enjoy the most. Although, during the down time, I love taking the time to talk to customers, I have made a lot of friends just from saying, ""how is your day going?""."
good,Managing the store on a daily basis. Making sure that duties are complete according to company satisfaction.
good,Days were ok most of the time. came in did my job and left. The job wasn't hard at all. The most enjoyable was we usually made our own schedule.
good,The district manager is a pharmacist and does not know anything about the front end.  She can not help you if you have a problem and may become emotional and less professional given the situation.  You must rely on fellow managers to resolve issues.
good,"I would run the registers, help customers find things easier and faster. Also unload and load truck and restock shelves. At my store I really only had one good manager but he no longer works there. I loved some of my co-workers and got along with some others. There were a few customers who were so nice and wonderful. I was nice to every customer though because that was my job."
good,"While working for this company, I was still in high school and therefore only worked from five to nine at night. A normal day for me consisted of data entry, the filling of prescriptions, and the handling of various drugs at the register. This was my first experience in the medical field and this is where I developed my love for it, which is why I wish to attain a career in the medical profession. Although I loved working for this company, I was working part-time and therefore had no benefits. Also there was little to no opportunity for me to advance into a full-time position or obtain more hours during the week resulting in my search for another job. The best part of this job, in my opinion, had to be knowing the regular patients by name and carrying a conversation with them about their day."
good,"This was my first job way back when. Management and coworkers were really nice and caring. Wasn't too much hard work only on delivery days. A really laid back place to work as long as you are punctual, don't call out, and make sure your cash drawer balances. Only thing I did not like was the fact that the stores don't have any type of security personnel. Some aren't in the best of areas so security would deter a lot of thieving and make employees (like myself) feel safer."
good,"Checked out customers at the register."
good,The business would get busy very quickly. There were often not many cash registers. Management were often disorganized but very respectful. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers.
good,"A typical day at Rite Aid was focused mainly on keeping the customers happy. My organizational skills came in handy keeping the store neat and clean, looking presentable and organized for everyone. I learned how to control myself a lot more working with difficult customers. My coworkers were amazing. Always a great atmosphere going into work, I always felt welcome there. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to chat with the people that came through the doors, getting to know people that I would normally have no contact with. The hardest part of the job was definitely dealing with some of the more difficult, rude, or outright obnoxious people. But everyone needs a smile sometimes."
good,"I loved working at Rite Aid. It was a good job, people were really nice to work with and the customers were great! "
good,"I am a Certified Pharmacy Technician currently working at Rite Aid Pharmacy. A typical day on the job consists of constant processing of prescriptions. Whether they are new or refills. I really enjoy the job. There are some moments that are difficult, but I do my very best to maintain composure and keep going. I really enjoy helping people when processing new prescriptions. I am looking for a position where I can utilize my skills and knowledge to its full potential."
good,Everyone worked together to improve productivity and reduce costs.
good,"Don't really know what to say about Rite-Aid. Loved my co-workers there wasn't anything hard about the job, the most enjoyable part was seeing different people everyday."
good,Working at Rite Aid has taught me a lot. The things i do is be a cashier or be in the backroom pulling items that need to go to the floor. On fridays thats when the delivery truck comes and have to unload the truck. Ive learned how to manage my time. Be able to work under pressure and to learn about different types of items that the store sells. THe hardest part of my job is the delivery truck day. Its overnight so I go in at 8pm and dont get off until the morning.
good,Learning of new medications to come onto the market was enjoyable. Communicating with physicians and their staff was informative.
good,"The type of typical day of work I have goes something like this.  I get to work and start ringing people out at the register.  When I am not busy doing that, I organize around the registers, clean the counters, and sweep the floors.  I take a walk around the store and straighten shelves and make sure all the products are organized and pushed to the front.  Towards the end of the evening I will collect all of the newspapers and dispose of the Chronicle and record how many Plain Dealers are left.  At 8:30 PM I close the gates half way down and shut down the photo machine.  Then at 9:00 PM we close and lock the doors.  Usually throughout the day a manager will need to be located for assistance.  The register needs their approval for things such as price modifying or manually typing in a coupon.  The management is good but I was promised a minimal of 20 hours per week and my promise has been broken.  The hardest part of the job is remembering every single thing.  I enjoy talking and helping customers.  I like the interaction and being able to feel like I am pleasing the customer."
good,I enjoyed working at Rite aid pharmacy as pharmacy technician position. Most enjoyable work is working on RX.
good,Management at my location is very understanding about requested days off. I have learned about different medications and interactions.
good,loved helping customers find different things and everyone was always friendly towards me and vise/versa always got my job done and got along with all employees
good,Great place to work awesome employees and great benifits ans there's room for advancement
good,"I out grew my job as a ""pharmacy cashier"". Just wanted something that I could show my skills in and be a better tech."
good,I supervised the front store and a small staff. I worked in the pharmacy doing tech work. Did not work many hours so certification was not done. Audited narcotics weekly and was a key holder to the store.
good,"Days at Rite Aid vary depending on two things: load and holidays. Hectic days are assured and time for relaxation is small, but time flies by when customers are overflowing."
good,"At Rite Aid I learned great team work skills. I also learned how to develop pictures, which is something I absolutely loved about this job."
good,"On a typical shift, worker counts drawer to ensure appropriate amount of funds for change, checks out and greets all customers with a warm welcome along with providing friendly customer service to everyone. Maintains clean, stocked, and organized environment; answers multi- line phone systems; money orders, receives film order, sends off for development, and promptly notifies customer upon arrival of developed film order."
good,"it was very good working there , the only reason im upset is because they gave my job away when i went on maternity leave"
good,"enjoyed working with the public, co workers were great to work with"
good,You would meet multiple customers some become regulars and build a relationship with. Co-workers are always helpful as well as the managers.
good,This Job has worked with my schedule due to school and my willingness to move forward in the medical field. Although this job is not terrible i dont see myself advancing career wise here
good,"•	Assist customers using the GREET customer service standard"
good,"A typical day would begin with counting down my till, then catching up on what's going on in the store, followed by a quick scan of the store to see what needed to be stocked on the shelves.Throughout the day I would see the daily customers and update them on the new items in the store that I thought would interest them. I really loved to relationships and bond with the different customers. My supervisors were great and they were willing to teach me whatever I was interested in knowing."
good,"Cashing customers out when they were ready, making sure all front end product were filled, made sure that all front end product was fresh.  Removing almost outdated ( 1 month prior to expiration date) candy and other front end product were removed from shelf 1 month prior to expiration date.  Keeping front end clean, making sure all baskets were returned so that no one would fall or trip.  The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my customers,most on a daily basis, helping them and other customers whom I did not know."
good,"I enjoyed working there, I loved seeing all the new people every day and talking with my regular customers. I enjoy working on the computer and building relationships with my coworkers. "
good,"I loved working in the pharmacy helping fill prescriptions, while learning so much about medicine and the company."
good,"5* Company workers, when co was owned by Eckerd ity waass a good co, when bought out by Rite Aid it closed from poor corporate management"
good,"For the most part working with customers helping them to find the right product, stocking shelves, and lots of cashiering."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers and serving them in a timely manner.
good,It was a great experience and I was glad to have worked there.
good,i was the main cashier. Being a cashier was a very easy job. I had good co workers. We were all a team at rite aid.
good,"I have currently been at Rite Aid for almost 5 years. Though I have gotten raises, which helps with the economy these days, I haven't been asked to move up in the company. I do have amazing customer service skills and am always smiling. "
good,I would be over evening cashiers until the midnight Assistant Managers would come in. The day time manager and Assistant managers left when I came in. The cashiers I worked with were good people. Management and other key holders were good coworkers. The hardest part was when I was left by myself to run register and photo shop and cashiers called off and Assistant manager wouldn't stay so I had a line and was backed up on everything until evening Assistant manager came in an helped me. 
good,"i loved working in the retail industry, it was my first job and it was a wonderful time working with celebritys and all people from all walks of life, it gave me the confidence to work in retail anywhere."
good,"At this job I was able to effect business on a daily basis.  I worked constantly, however, I had little time for my personal life."
good,"Inventory/stock"
good,"I enjoy working at Rite Aid,it is  very bussy from start to finish.You learn how to listen and try to fill the needs of the patients, how to communicate with them, how to be efficient and fill their prescriptions in a timely manner.Management is excellent.My co-workers and i get along very well we talk laught and make jokes, we share ideas and vewis we  communicate with each other we also work as a team to make the work easier. The hardest part for the job is when you have a very difficult patient,I try my very best to take care of them in a very pleasant manner.The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting, communicate and helping the patients,"
good,The up side of my job was the great customers I knew by name who always came in with a smile and when the computers were working correctly and the were no miss haps. The down side to myjob is when you would get the mean customers would come in and nothing you did would make them smile or when the computers were down or the insurance companies were down.
good,"Exposure to pharmacy management, mtm implementation and one of the best retail pharmacy systems "
good,"working for rite aid was fun.  it was fast pace, the managment was fun but stern, and overall a great place to work."
good,"i learn alot, i learned how to use a cash register and also how to fill the pills and organized the place too"
good,The location I work at is very busy. I have learned how to work with all types of people from customers and co-workers to management personnel. I have also learned how to deal with many situations such as delegating job tasks to other employees. The hardest part of the job is not being able to use all of my skills in the wokplace. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with the plesant customers that come in the store.
good,"I worked with customers in helping them make their choices when it came to product. I ran the front counter answered phone calls, helped with the photo lab and Pharmacy. I learned that I can do more than one thing at a time, with the fast pace inviroment in a pharmacy. My management was awesome, and I was offered a postion for night time ket holder. Everyone I worked with was always willing help me if I needed it. The hardest part of this job was seeing the bad enviorment from where it was located. I just enjoyed coming to work everyday because the people their made my job a enjoyable one."
good,"Everyday was a different experience. On a typical day I would walk the store to find any recovery issues and look for any out of stock items that needed to be replenished and notate it on my daily planner. then i would pull up the daily schedule and delegate the tasks to the associates that were found on my morning walk. Then i would pull the previous days sales and also the current days sales and notate it on the daily planner. After my office work was completed ( check time and attendance ,check western union transactions,deposit money, check e-mails from DM and corporate,etc.). I would also validate all previous days notes from the previous days walks were completed. Then i would partner up with the Pharmacy Manager to talk about how many scripts were filled and any issues that occured on the previous day. I would also check out of stocks with vendors and made the necessary arrangements to fill the out of stocks. I had a great working relationship with all my vendors and my co-workers. This job was a great learning experience that opened my eyes to a bigger brighter future in management."
good,"I'm the type of person that loves to get things done, every day at work its a different challenge and I get right to it. Its always important to me to do the best I can at anything I do."
good,Had fun working the detail-oriented warehouse until a medical condition prevented me from performing my regular job duties.
good,This job gave me an opportunity to serve the elderly community directly which gave me a great sense of pride in the job i was doing.
good,"Ran the register, helped customers, worked the photo lab. Learned how to print pictures, management and co workers were okay. Hardest part of the job was working until 10. Most enjoyable part was I had a job."
good,"Arrive early, do deposits, ordering, prepare for opening, Receive orders, take care of venders, payroll hours ect.."
good,I got all my hands on experience at this job. I started as an intern and was hired before my internship was over. My fellow employees provided a fun learning atmosphere.
good,Rite Aid required continued checking and follow-up to customer needs. Maintain inventory system. Hold a wide range of skills to adequately perform necssary work funtctions on a daily day.
good,At rite aid i got to learn alot about diffrent aspects of retail as well as learning to use time efficiantly and to be productive with any time we have.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Rite Aid is all the great customers and coworkers I get to see on a regular basis. Everyone gets along very well and we get things done while keeping the mood light and fun. A typical day consists of ringing up customers purchases,answering the phone,helping customers find product and with any questions they may have of us,resetting the shelves,stocking the shelves,putting away returns/shotbacks,etc. Everyday there is always something that needs to be done no matter if it is the same things or new things that haven't been done before."
good,"I started at Rite Aid as a cashier and was certified to become a Pharmacy Technician. I filled prescriptions, answered phones, did inventory, and cashiered. My co-workers were all very courteous and cooperative. My manager was very courteous and respectful."
good,My day at work was working with great co-workers and nice customers. i learned about different people and the different types of cash registers.
good,"Anything from checking at the front counters, serving up yummy ice cream, to stocking all the merchandise. I have learned how to be patient, and enjoy the little things in life. My co workers were a great group of people that worked hard. The hardest part of my job was getting robbed daily and not being able to do anything about it. It was located in an un-favorable area."
good,"Working at Rite Aid had its ups and downs; I worked with a variety of people. A typical day at Rite Aid was usually slow, and quite. I did a lot of work such as changing prices, stocking shelves, photo lab, and waiting on and greeting customers. The management at Rite Aid was okay; they tried their best to do right. The hardest task at Rite Aid was running the Photo Shop and the Register alone. The most enjoyable task was waiting on the customers; I met some really great people working as a cashier at Rite Aid."
good,I was a Sales Associate so basically I worked as a cashier or stocked the floor.
good,It was a good Company to work for. I learned quite a bit about working in a big chain Drug Store the operation of running a store to reacting with the different customers it was a big challange. I started out as a Ice Cream Clerk and working my way up to Store Manager.
good,Good company to work for. in the two years i worked there i was promoted. but the management has no respect for there employees. which was why i left.
good,"I enjoyed working at Rite Aid (which was formerly Eckerd Pharmacy when I was employed). I got along with the majority of the staff and management. The only reason I left was because I felt it was time to move on. No hard feelings involved, I was just ready to explore different ventures."
good,"Process prescriptions from patients. Enter information into system, create labels, count and fill pharmaceuticals, use of cash register."
good,"I very much enjoyed being a pharmacy tech, along with my co-workers and patients. Responsibilites certainly did not shadow the pay."
good,"Nothing too hard, just scanning, restocking and keeping track of inventory. Working fast and efficiently is definitely a plus and there is union which is great."
good,It is a good work environment but unfortunately when you're a technician you have to go where there is room for growth. I enjoyed my co workers and my customers tremendously.
good,Work was challenging and  management was encouraging and supportive.  I enjoy the challenge of filling customers orders properly putting materials away in the air properly and safely. I enjoy helping others when I had the time to do so And was proud to keep my work area clean and safe
good,Learned a lot working in the pharmacy. I was given the opportunity to complete the job duties of a pharmacy technician as well as ringing up the Rx purchases.
good,It was a good company to work for . I feel that management could have been better they seemed a bit unorganized. And at times they would show favortism.
good,"I love this job, I just need something that I can go further with in my future."
good,Just when it come to the number just need to help working get them that a down about it but over all co worker and bosses cool just need to update forklift and other truck to have them run right
good,Super slow. The pharmacy was pretty much the only part of the store getting business so it made for super slow days. I was always bored besides the days where we got our delievery truck.
good,"I enjoy coming to work everyday giving instruction, and directions to the associates who I'm responsible for. we built a good and respectful relationship."
good,I learned a lot there and had a great time being with my coworkers. Tasks there are simple but do take time to get done properly. Management was always respectful and understanding of peoples situations.
good,Rite Aid is a good place to work but if you don’t work full time the pay is low and you don’t get benefits. Rite Aid always gives 20% discounts to employees on store products.
good,"At Rite Aid, a typical day involved back stocking, working on the truck,  planograms, outdates and damages, counting the safe as well as the registers, and overall solving customer problems. I loved doing all of the work, as I did my job well. However, management made it really hard to like the job at times because not all of them were hands-on. So we ended up doing most of the work while they delegated it to us.  It's a very independent job, and what I liked most was not feeling overwhelmed in the environment. I always felt like I could run the store."
good,"All the usual challenges of retail. Great team members, great place to as long as you are willing to work. Lots of opportunity for growth if you are headed somewhere."
good,"Rite aid is a good company to work for. If your a supervisor you are expected to know how to use a register, know how to scan in vendors, receive truck, help customers in need, work the back room, count the money at the end of the day, create bank deposits and much more. It’s a good work environment."
good,I love the people that I work with and enjoy most days however I can not live on the amount of money that I am paid. I do not want to leave my position but I may have to in order to survive.
good,"I had some of the best years working for my bosses at Rite Aid. Unfortunately, it was time to leave after some time because my life was moving on but the pay wasn't following."
good,It's a good company to work for but they will give you many things to do at once. You could be assigned to do a plan-o-gram but also are running the register at the same time because there aren't enough hours for a cashier to come in early and open with you. Also on top of that there is still shipment to be put out. You have to know how to handle a lot. Now since Wal-greens has taken over things have probably change.
good,"Field Systems Support will no longer be an entity as of November 22nd, 2019. The experience has been positive for me personally and professionally. I was the supervisor over a team of 10-15 people. I love my job and hope to continue in this role elsewhere. My passion for the associates was my calling card and recognizing them for their successes."
good,"The job asked a lot from me physically and mentally and considering how many hours I worked it eventually took a toll.  However, this job might be just right for others."
good,"As Wellness Ambassador at Rite Aid Pharmacy, my job was to create relationships with all our customers but especially our seniors.  My responsibilities included time at senior centers in the West Ashley and downtown Charleston senior living facilities. At these facilities we talked about what Rite Aid had to offer them.  Immunizations, medications and everyday items along with planned talks about health concerns were among the topics discussed.  After these discussions we would have an activity geared towards seniors."
good,I just started at Rite Aid. So far so good. Hope it stays that way!  The pay could be higher but overall its a nice job. I hope to be here for a long time
good,I quite enjoyed my time at Rite Aid. I thought the corporate level of management was a bit out of touch with people working in the stores. I really liked working with customers and helping them.
good,"My manager wasn't a boss, she was a leader. She would care for how her workers were treated and would help then in any way possible. Yeah, customer service can be stressful, but I had co workers that would help me put when I'm overwhelmed."
good,"It was good working at Rite Aid, my coworkers were nice and easy to get along with and most of the managers. Most of the days are relatively slow paced except for load day when we need to stock the shelves. Depending on the location and what kind of person your manager is it's a pretty good working environment. Also, once you work there for about a year you receive dental and health benefits. I liked working Rite Aid."
good,Working was fun. Coming in to work my managers and co-workers always had a fun attitude. Helping the customers was great since we had many regulars that came into the store. The toughest part was having to deal with the people that liked to come in to the store and steal.
good,"Stayed employed .worked hard with good people."
good,It wasnt a hard job to do. It did get stressful at times but nothing you couldnt handle. Best part of the job was seeing repeat customers come in with a smile really makes the day go by better.
good,The team I had the chance to work with was great especially my supervisor who trained me. I Learned a lot of things there and met with so many nice people around.
good,As a clerk you handled all front end responsibilities and helped any customers. You will sometimes stock products and always maintain a clean work space.
good,"Enjoyed working at Rite Aid and learning a lot about displays and prices, and repricing of product, and marking sales.   Signing and Displays of product."
good,"I had a good crew in my store...but, upper management were cutthroats, always out to get someone for something stupid. Good running stores were usually left alone."
good,Offered a good amount of opportunity for career advancement. Culture is good and employees are friendly and easy to work with. Management is willing to work with you to obtain desired outcomes.
good,"The management style was relaxed, compared to other retail positions. They worked around my second job very well, and were always willing to teach me how to do something new so that I could make myself more valuable to them. They weren't afraid of scheduling over the ""part time"" requirements and gave me as many hours as I wanted, as long as I didn't make myself sick in the meantime. They did have a rule that you have to call out if you're feeling flu like symptoms, but since they're a pharmacy, it's understandable, and welcome."
good,"It's a good job to have if you are in school. It's a rejected environment, but it also has its hectic days. You can learn a lot by working there. They also train you in the pharmacy just in case the pharmacist gets slammed packed with filling medicine."
good,"If you can learn relatively fast and can handle busy working conditions this is somewhere you may consider working. Anyone could probably learn how to perform well here, the hard part is keeping your cool when you get the regular who gives you grief, you get at least one no matter what retail chain you work for, I promise."
good,"(1) Your daily hours you don't know until after 2 hours of working. If your were a picker.You pretty much pick items off the shelf's as fast as you can with trying to making a quota of 95%."
good,The people are great their. The management and supervisors are very helpful. It’s a nice place to work and get experience In warehousing. They care for their employees and they show gratitude.
good,it is an active and constantly changing workplace with a lot to offer. The workday often goes quickly and there is definitely a constant flow of work to be done
good,"I was afforded, and took advantage of, several opportunities for growth and professional development.  I have enjoyed my time with the company and would recommend it as a good place to work."
good,"A typically day at Rite Aid was usually simple. I ran register and helped customers with any questions they had. During slower times of my shift I would stock shelves, set up displayed and clean my work area. The management were all very understand and respectful to any question that arose. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the smiles on the customers faces as they left the store with satisfaction."
good,"Productive and very fun workplace.  All the associates from the front end to pharmacy were so nice, respectful and helpful.  Management was awesome.  If I didn't move to Texas I would still be working there."
good,"I think the atmosphere of the work place was rather pleasant and most of my workmates were kind and caring, and got the job done well. But there were a few people who were grumpy and negative. All of the managers were very kind and not bossy or mean."
good,This company has an onsite jam and cafeteria service and security services for when you enter and exit the building and plenty of parking spaces to park your car
good,I still work here and cannot say anything for my employer uses this site. our team colors are navy and tan and the pharmacy is open 9-9 at most locations.
good,"I loved my job being a cashier/pharmacy tech but my manager wasn’t the greatest. Almost two years ago, I found out my grandpa has passed and my manager wouldn’t let me go to the funeral because I didn’t ask for it off.... sooo I left shortly"
good,"The pharmacy is always busy and unless your co workers are friendly and helpful you get overwhelmed very easily. The customers in Pharmacy are the rudest I've ever encountered. I learned that I have more patience than I thought. I learned that being in contact with so many rude people each day really wears you out, so the job was very draining for me."
good,It is a good job other people should apply for. It keeps you busy and management is fair. On holidays you get paid time and a half. Everyone is friendly and helping.
good,It was a joy working here I was able to work in my community as well as with my friends. It was a relaxing place to work and we had a motto if you have time to lean you have time to clean I always liked that motto.
good,rite aid was a good place to work. i learned a lot of things in this company. the workers in my department encouraged me to work more and know more and not be afraid. the management team were great. they were flexible about work schedules and meeting each employees needs.
good,A typical day at work consists of selling merchandise and helping customers with money transfers. The management is wonderful and the work environment is great
good,"Good place to work. Fast paced , so be ready to work."
good,"I would still be there if management had change. My manager was lazy and lacked knowledge of current and new policies. Plus, she did not follow policy. Besides that Rite Aid is a great company to work for."
good,I was given a chance to work as a clerk and gain education on the job for developing camera film on older machines and everything the photo center had to offer their customers. I enjoyed my time and learned alot of my customer service skills and retail skills.
good,"Rite Aid has been a good company to work for. They offer flexible hours, good pay and benefits. You can move up in the company if you would like to. They offer employee assistance programs."
good,"The personal touch is evident in this great company culture."
good,Good job lots of people come in the stride and steal  the security system wasnt the best.  Managers were nice . The people were half on half  some were cranky and some were polite.
good,Loved my co-workers. Customers are always hard to deal with. Great part-time job for a full-time college student while playing a sport. Very flexible schedule. Provided on the job training through Pharmacy Technician University.
good,"Start morning looking at ServiceNow call and task que to get an idea of what day looks like for team and if anything needs adustments or special arrangements made.  Make sure payroll is approved and Overtime report submitted.  Check personnel working or adjustments in schedule/coverage has to be made.  Prepare for store evaluation visits, inventory audits and other travel as necessary.  "
good,"The pharmacists role at Rite Aid is quite busy. Most days you are expected to work non-stop. I don't even get a break during my 12 hour shifts. You are always on your feet multi tasking throughout the day. On a typical work day you have to verify prescriptions, talk to doctors and insurance companies on the phone, manage technicians and counsel patients."
good,"A typical day at work includes ringing people out at the cash register, helping customers find inventory, and restocking or placing sale signs. The management is low-key and the culture is relaxed."
good,"The customers are nice most of the time but they get annoyed with long lines. The budget is low and we are always working short handed and you are expected to produce top quality performance whether there is 2, 3 or 4 workers on a shift"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with. Its more busy there at nights.  I learned how to deal with difficult situations and different types of customers.
good,Please note the word job. For me as a pharmacy technician as well as Wellness Embassador I spent a lot of my time at the store. At the time I did not have a family to consider and was still living at home. It's a fast paced job in which you get to learn a lot about disease management through medication. You learn a lot about the medications themselves if you are interested. Not a bad job for someone out of high school/through college though!
good,just go in and do your job and show up everyday and they left you alone. had a nice gym and lunch room and smoke room.leave everyone alone and they will leave you alone
good,"Iit was a challenge to get work started, and customers attended to. Be able to organize the daily duties to have all necessary items available for customers when store opened."
good,I enjoyed working for Rite Aid it's a great company and room for advancement when available. It's very hard to get full time schedule which makes it difficult to live but I enjoyed working there.
good,Rite Aid was a good overall work environment. I loved the atmosphere of Rite Aid. Most of their policies were geared for the protection and safety of their customers and employees.
good,"Days primarily consisted of stocking and facing shelves. Occasionally someone was called up to the ice cream counter to serve customers."
good,Rite was a great company to work I was able to advance in more than one area. The company provided more than one opportunity for advancement. Recession resulted in  my departure.
good,"I don’t work at rite aid I work for food town company doing reset merchandise for 7!years aim interesting in reset merchandise. Like Coca Cola, acosta sale and marketing, everything about produce"
good,follow policies and procedures and your job is safe. Sometimes to the detriment of the company they don't make changes when they should. Transfering is difficult at times especially for excelling store managers. They take advantage of you and don't let you get closer to home and give excuses why.
good,"Relaxed but sometimes busy location, more family oriented patient clientele. The company sold to Walgreens after years of financial struggles. This store was closed after Walgreens acquired it."
good,"I was a part-time associate with full-time responsibilities.  I worked out of two store locations with two sets of store keys and two sets of associates that I had to oversee to make sure that the day's business was done properly.  I came on duty in the evening for our merchandise days and instructed employees what and where the merchandise had to go.  Going through that process twice in one week is a lot.  Fortunately, my coworkers made it a lot easier to deal with.  There were times, however, that the friend's hat came off and the supervisor's hat was put on.  The hardest part about this position is explaining to the associates that policies and procedures are put in place for everyone's protection.  Once those rules aren't followed, the work becomes harder to do.  And, unfortunately, disciplinary actions are called upon.  The managers from both locations were very good and knowledgeable about the daily operations in their store.  I was one of the lucky ones who was able to move on to bigger and better things with what I learned from Rite-Aid."
good,"Like any retailer, work goes well depending on the area you work in and the boss you have. Working in Lake Oswego was great because it's a nice area and I had excellent bosses."
good,"For the most part, the job is very easy there is just a lot of busy work like restocking, putting up and taking down sale tags, organizing and many other things."
good,"Full time is considered 35 hours per week. Most assistant managers don't receive more than that. Health insurance is very expensive, more than half of each paycheck."
good,Started as a cashier and within a year I was in charge of the load and within 2 years I was promoted to Key Associate. If it was not for moving I might still be there.
good,"More suitable for a first job as a teenager not a good fit as an adult, real slow days that has its peak in business sometimes during the day. Something to look into."
good,handling of customers orders -handled customer returns/complaints -inventory control and price changes -worked returns for company back to main office -bank deposits processed and delivered
good,I like working at rite aid I just needed a better job for my son growing and living exspenses. otherwise I would have made a career out of that job I thought it was awesome
good,I absolutey loved working at this store.  I find that this was due only  because of our particular store manager.  I briefly filled in at 2 other locations only to find that our work culture was not what other associates were experiencing in their particular stores
good,"The pharmacy was a fast pace environment and challenging. Patient care and customer service are a priority. I was the lead technician, scheduler, trainer and inventory manager. I really learned a lot and was appreciated for the contribution that I made."
good,Rite Aid was my first job. Managers were always really nice and helpful. It was a good place to work at for the first job. The most enjoyable first was scooping the ice cream.
good,"Working at multiple Rite Aid stores around the area, the success of the store seems to rely on how much the manager of the store cares to lead the team and store into success. I have been to stores where everyone is on task and making sure everything is kept up to date as well as stores that are struggling with months behind on plano-grams, freshness and tasks that also have a high turnover rate."
good,"Busy as the day progressed. Regular duties: patient counseling, drug utilization reviews, data entry, inventory management, quality control, immunizations, insurance issues, phone calls, medical therapeutic management, register work, and general retail pharmacist duties. Most pharmacy district managers were very fair."
good,Very busy pharmacy department but we all got along well and both the Pharmacy Manager and Store Manager were supportive. Customers were friendly and usually patient when the pharmacy was busy.
good,"A review for Rite Aid will differ upon which store you go to. The one i worked at, wasn't that friendly towards customers. But that's my own opinion. Prices are too high for me to shop there."
good,Rite Aid was a good company to work for. The upside was that upper management communication and support was good. The downside was that the company kept increasing your tasks while decreasing the hours available for technician help.
good,I need to have more hands-on training-instead of learning myself from computer courses.I have liked all the management people I have met. Some are better trainers than others.
good,I loved the small town community where u get to know your customers by name. The management team was always good to me. You have to have open availability to get decent hours
good,"Fulfilling Customer Satisfaction with a lean staff"
good,There was a friendly atmosphere with coworkers and managers. Flexible with scheduling if given appropriate notice. Not very many advancement opportunities.
good,This job was great for me in terms of hours and flexibility. Pay wasn't great but it was enough to scrape by. Advancement oppurtunities camy by every so often but not abundant.
good,"Good place to start. A lot of employees were in and out, not many stay long because of the pay. The benefits are good though, medical, dental, vision etc."
good,"rite aid lacked the resources to upgrade store, needed a remodel or relocation, no major work done on location in 18 years. staffing was not enough for volume"
good,Hours are usually cut short so never expect too much if you work part-time. Will always have to deal with a wide variety of people so it is always an experience.
good,"I was made to resign there because I was pregnant and couldn't work the photo machine anymore. Instead of having me do another position that I was more then capable of doing, they forced me to resign."
good,making sure all shelves were properly stocked registers have enough money (start upnmoney) making sure fountain drinks and replenishing condiments and utensils
good,"Managed the cash registers and helped customers with their needs. I learned a lot about customer service and become very people friendly. The manager was great to work for, she was very upbeat person. The workplace over all was enjoyable. The job itself was not hard, sometimes had to deal with unsatisfied customers. Most enjoyable part was helping the customers and I became to know the regulars quite well."
good,"Everyone helped everyone, We did ALL and enjoyed working together. Was a GREAT place to work at. Loved having regular customers coming in and making our day also."
good,Recent corporate changes drastically affected job experience. Work hours were reduced while responsibilities stayed constant.  Overall a good place to work before sale of company.
good,"The store manager is a great person to work for, He is also very approachable. There a large amount of lifting that is required. I was not paid well for the amount of responsibilities that I had."
good,"very productive workplace with good pay and benefits-,but the benefits and pay could be better but overall you really had room for advancement. the training and communication between the production and management coul have been a little better, I think that having an education reimbersment program of some type would give you a reason to consider long term employment with the company."
good,A typical fast paced employer whereas customer service is key. The management is strict on attendance and appearance. Every store is differenent and I never had difficulty in working with the crew.
good,"There is no license or certification you need before getting this job, you only need a high school diploma. I learned a lot about medicine and side effects at this job. It is a very organized, fast paced and high demand job."
good,"My manager and assistant manager were awesome. The hardest part of my job was not being able to please everyone, no matter how hard you tried. The best part of my job was knowing my customers by name and knowing their routines and needs. Being able to help them before even being asked."
good,A nice store to work in with advancement opportunity. Lots of stocking is involved though so you dont always just stand at the register. Pay is pretty good.
good,"I loved working at Rite Aid. My co-workers were great and we were busy with plenty of things to do. Loved helping others and working hard to grow in the company. I am still trying to get hired back on in Florence because I had to leave suddenly with only a days notice because my infant son was at MUSC and was being transferred back to Florence the next day. Come to find out instead of saying I had to leave unfortunately, they said that the new transferred manager put down that i was terminated."
good,Rite Aid is a good place to work. The pay is not the best in the world but it will do. The employees are all  friendly and all have a positive attitude.
good,I enjoyed my job over all.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers.  Not much opportunity for moving up in the company.  Not fair with all workers in the company.
good,I loved my job my Manger didn't like me so there was prombles. But I would lover to come back with different manger.. it was a great job I didn't work to hard it was easy n I really liked my pay ..hours .. and job
good,It was a job that fit at the time. I was young and needed a job. There is lots of work to do in mininal time so time management is a must...............
good,"always busy working, setting planograms, etc. interacting with customers and when you can do something really nice for them and they leave your store feeling like they just won the lottery, or when you can put a smile on their face, just makes the day."
good,My co-workers and team make it a great place to work.  With enough enthusiasm and work effort you can make it very far in the company.  Hard work is paid off.
good,Rite aid always provided me with challenging work and encouragement.  They tend to eliminate positions and shove that job onto someone who is already doing the job of 2 or even more people.
good,"A typical work day as a supervisor would be rather slow, mostly consisting of being on the register just the same as a cashier. At Rite Aid there is only ever about 4 to 5 employees working at one time meaning that the job duties are spread out between those few people. I have no complaints about the management there. There isn't very much work culture to speak with this company. You spend most of your time working on a task alone."
good,"The department I worked for was a solid 10, but the company eliminating our jobs, and not offering job placement elsewhere within the company was detrimental, especially when most people had 10+ years invested in the company."
good,The company as whole is great..theres always a few bad apples in the bunch..it was more of the surround area..that made this location.unbearable to work...should invest in becoming an green light locAtion..store#4694
good,"Rite Aid was a good place to work based on pay and benefits.  The management was above average and there was collaboration between various teams and departments.  Unfortunately, they went through several restructures and it caused the need to layoff employees to stay afloat.  Upper management did a good job in spite of the retail environment."
good,"The company is fair. However, they need to train management more carefully. The workplace culture is good as well. The associates does try to please the customers as much as possible."
good,"working there in the pharmacy was a uncomfortable environment for me. mostly because of i did not feel like that was my place, over all if you want to be a pharmacist it is a good place to start your career."
good,It was a good job to start out at and when you are in school they do work with your schedule. But it wasn't a place you could really grow at unless you have been there for a long time.
good,had fun and learned quite a bit from my pharmicist. working at the only pharmacy in a small town allows you to get to know the patients/customers and allow you to better help them
good,"This was a good place to work being in my early 20's. It is possible to make a career out of it but i had other interests, otherwise i would have. Management is good and the coworkers were friendly. The customers were a little overbearing at times but thats retail."
good,"Rite Aid is a wonderful place to work for a first job, If you are hired directly into management I know the rate of pay is not bad. For me the people I worked with became like family even long after I left. The pay and raises were just to low for the position I was working I left after finding a better suited position for myself and my family to make a better living."
good,"Mgt is good to work with you when needing off. Work place is steady. Typical day is filling and taking in new and refilling rx's. answering phones, faxing and running a cash register."
good,I enjoyed working but the hours was not consistent n I was working evenings n werkends.And especially the holidays and I had my kids at home.It was a good company but it's not for someone who had a family
good,Typical work day was everybody knew what work area they was going to. I learned to catch on quick so the work load won't affect other employees what they have to do. The work place culture is adapting to the enviroment. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with my lanes I was working on. The most enjoyable part of the job was overtime. More money..........
good,"I enjoyed it my  job"
good,"I enjoyed working at Rite Aid quite a bit. My particular store had some communication issues, but it is one store out of many that didn't have this problem. For working anywhere in Rite Aid, you have to know what you are doing and pay attention. You can't slack off and look lazy when our main priority is customer engagements and satisfaction. This is an easy environment to work in, but you can't be lazy. I enjoyed working here because of all the people I got to meet and speak to. I also got to promote a lot of the great benefits of being with Rite Aid. If you like meeting people on a daily basis and being that person that makes the customer want to come back, then yes do this work. The hardest part was when the store was busy and understaffed. I worked as a Wellness Ambassador, which meant I was in the pharmacy and the front. So, imagine it being busy and understaffed and both sides of the store need you. It was hard to balance both sides and make both managers happy. The balancing act I don't think applies for cashiers or managers as much, but as an ambassador, my job was to make them want Rite Aid and use the pharmacy and the savings. I was the advertisement. My example was crucial to a successful store. I couldn't be lazy or be sad. You have to be happy when you walk on the floor to work. Doesn't matter what happened 5 minutes ago. Doesn't matter if your coffee spilled on you before you came or how angry you are about something at home. You have to come to work."
good,Rite Aid was made of up really good people.  Majority of the areas of the business was led by subject matter experts in their areas of responsibility.  The upper executive management could have been more closely connected to those in middle management but it is what it is.
good,"My store was pretty good, the Manager at the time was nice. easy to work for so long as you did you're job and did not make his life hard. I was in high school at the time and they were fine to work around that. I had plenty of time off to go out and do teen boy things."
good,Pretty fun place to work at. The customers were friendly and so was the co-workers that worked there before me but there were some customers who would make your day very stressful.
good,A typical work day would include working the registers and taking care of customers. There was also a lot of stocking but the not so great part is the delivery stocking. It consisted of men and women doing a lot of heavy lifting.
good,"I have no complaints about the job, my coworkers are all great people and are fun to be around, the only down side is pay rate is $8.10/ hour and there is no room for raises or advancement."
good,"Typical day at any pharmacy includes opening and having people with controlled substance prescriptions waiting before you open the doors. You proceed to take phone calls from doctors, patients and insurance companies. Customer service is essential."
good,"The Pharmacy was a very fast paced environment. The Pharmacy management was knowledgeable and helpful. My co-workers were very friendly. I enjoyed this job so much because it was very team oriented. The most difficult part of this job was the busy Monday's and the elderly patients passing away,"
good,"Developed pictures throughout my shift, burned photos onto disc's. On my morning shifts, I had to open the photo lab and make sure there were enough chemicals and photo paper. My shifts ran smoothly and efficient."
good,"Its a learning experience for anyone interested in the pharmacy career. The support system from corporate down to the store manager is extremely useful and helpful, and human resources is readily available for any employee issues and concerns. Everything is well detailed and explained during the training process."
good,I really enjoyed working at Rite Aid. Management was awesome. I enjoyed working with my colleagues. I enjoyed the customers that always shopped their.
good,es bueno por que le dan oportunidad de uno subir de posición el salario es más omenos no excelente es lo único malo en Rite Aid  el salario
good,"Typical pharmacy environment is fast-paced & a lot of multitasking. I was lead technician at my store so I assisted my manager on duty with paperwork, clinics, tech schedules, etc."
good,"There is a healthy balance between busy and slow work days, you have downtime when it's slow. Managers stay in their offices all day and only come out when called for."
good,Rite aid likes to keep their best employees at the same position. They do not like to advance them in within the company they rather hire somebody off the street.
good,"Working for Rite Aid was a great experience.  My only set back is working Holidays.  Christmas and Easter, Thanksgiving to me, is an essential family day and it is a very important priority in my life.  Working for Rite Aid does not allow the choice."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of, but not limited to answering the phone and helping the customer or transferring to the appropriate person, greeting customers by receiving prescriptions orders, filling out paperwork vaccines and updating insurance information, filling prescriptions and cashing out the order and stocking medicines."
good,A typical day at work we come in prepare for the day put up trash bags to keep a clean and safe environment. Picking products and packing them in blue totes to be shipped out to the stores. We work alone or sometimes together to get the job done in a timely manner.
good,"If customer service and focus on community is important to you, this is the place to be. The company's commitment to helping its customers, and giving back to the community they are in, goes above and beyond expectations. While the everyday prices are not spectacular, their weekly specials and Rewards program makes up for that. It is a fast-paced job. A self-motivator with an eye for detail would be a good fit."
good,"First job I had where the managers were nurturing and would teach you how to do things that would help you not only in the workplace now but at future workplaces, customer service skills, how to go the extra mile with a customer to buy their loyalty and of course how to weed out bad applicants and only hire the best for the job."
good,the hardest part of the job is handling money and making sure you take and give back the correct amount of change back to the customer. it was a very easy job especially while in school.
good,"Enjoy working for rite aid ,  we typically average 200 prescriptions daily, have a good computer system that is constantly being updated , you can apply your clinical skills through medication therapy management    and consultations with your customers  they have been great working with me as a floater in that they are flexible wi th the days I can work "
good,"Rite aid is an interesting place, you can't go in there expecting to work just for the money, you have to have a good mindset to understand that you will meet all kinds of people and you have to accept change."
good,"Rite Aid is a great first job out of college. You can learn valuble skills such as customer service, business, inventory, stocking shelves but this wouldnt be a good long term job. You can move in management if you work hard and are trust worthy."
good,"A productive day in the workplace is when you have many patients come in needing their prescriptions filled and you are able to get them all done in a timely matter."
good,"Everyone there was very respectful and fun to work with. Rite aid was very good with working with my hours and good with giving the hours desired. Also at rite aid there was a weekly truck we'd have to unload, and there's always something to do such as stock shelfs make sure product is facing out and straight."
good,It all depends which location you are in your experience could be good or bad. At the the end of the day you have a lot of responsibilities and make sure everyone is happy.
good,Usually the hours are very flexible and you work with a diverse group of patrons on a daily basis. Laid back environment and easygoing atmosphere for the majority of the year.
good,I worked here for years with a nice team and good benefits. A typical day starts at 9am and ends at 5pm with a number of my regular customers coming in to fill their prescriptions and chat.
good,"I enjoyed the work day,Because working in the Pharmacy was very busy,especially during cold and flu season.I learned that working in the pharmacy I learned to handle different types of circumstances,while listening to customers with different medical diseases."
good,"Typical day stocking and interacting with customers and vendors.  Learned a lot about how stores operate.  Management all depends on who you work for.  Workplace culture again, depends on where you are and who you work for.  Hardest part of the job was having to constantly change schedules to cover shifts.  I met and worked with a lot of great people.  Company has high expectations of what they want done but don't have the best payroll resources.  Very difficult to execute on some great programs.  There's only enough to get the basics done.  Overall, it was a good place.  I would consider returning."
good,"Busy all the time, added work loads with delivery, Learned delivery operating system. Had to multi-task answering phones, working on the deliveries and cashiering. Some fellow workers were unpleasant to work with.   Many of my fellow workers are still great friends."
good,It is a diverse company to work for as it gives a fair experience to everyone. The management can be helpful at times but lacks showing appreciation at times when it is needed. It is a relaxing atmosphere though and pretty easy for the most part.
good,Store was a very steady work with a good manager.  The money was not great and there was no chance of advancement but I enjoyed the work and loved the customers.
good,The constant contact with customers is so fun.  Hoping they receive all their medicinal needs & home comforts.  Very good benefits for all involved.  Learn all aspects of retail.
good,a fast pace work environment. a lot of room for advancement if they like you. have to fit in or you will not last. getting numbers is the most important thing.
good,"I like the experience to work over there, a lot of patience from my supervisor. I like the team work and everyone over there feels he is a part of this big corporation."
good,Just like any other chain pharmacy. Little appreciation from management for all the work staff did to keep customers happy. In the end they wanted to cut staff and increase RPh duties with no compensation.
good,"My experience while working at Rite Aid was overall not too bad. In my opinion, it it a great job for those starting out on their career path. I was able to communicate with customers, provide them the service they needed, organize shelves, and work at the cashier. May not be outstanding, but it is worth something."
good,"This is a great company to work for, however, advancement opportunities are highly unlikely.  They have competitve pay &, therefore, not all employees make the same amount for the same position. If u r in a position that allows for annual reviews, this increase rate is between $0.20-0.40 typically (I've seen this w the APA position employees). I've been fortunate enough to get more than that.  A raise outside the annual appraisal is possible but only if u r fortunate enough to get a superior to assist u in achieving it.  Favoritism is the most obvious form for advancement. Benefits r great for nonunion employees. Since I wasn't union, I'm not sure how the benefits r if u r union. Each store has a dif atmosphere &, therefore, each team is dif: u may deal w high school drama employees in 1 store (even tho everyone is well out of HS), but have others who buy each other birthday cakes for every birthday in another store. Parking expenses reimbursed, along w mileage if going to a store that is not ur home store (only for APAs not associates). I've worked in every RA for 2 dif districts, so approximately 30 dif stores. I hope this helped!"
good,"At Rite Aid, there are several pros and several cons, sometimes determined simply by the coworkers."
good,Good benifits nice people to work with challenging work and schedule good 401 k with vacation time need to be a multitask in different area's with great persription plan coverage
good,Rite aid has blessed me to have the ability to manage myself and a whole crew. It also showed me how to manage the company and how to handle situations when the store manger was not present.
good,Manager was really understanind and flexible with requests. Co-Workers were all same age group and got a long very well. Pay was low. Hours were plentiful though.
good,"Very friendly employees, the manager is very understanding and helpful.  Very flexible to students, willing to teach you new skills.  10-minute break for every hour, very diligent as to what duties the students or underage employee are allowed to perform."
good,Typical day: Is the same as Kroger. All pharmacies are pretty much the same when it comes to a typical day. You just make sure that the customer is always satisfied with there service.
good,"Great coworkers, busy store. My pharmacy manager was amazing and was extremely accommodating with school schedules. The hardest part was trying to talk to customers and explain certain things about their medications."
good,"Depending on the store, location and people you work with, the daily activities can be anywhere from enjoyable to gruesome and tiring. Retail will mold your people skills and teach you a better way of interacting with customers."
good,"The drug store business is something completely different. The work day is typical retail, but it seems there was always an adventure. Lots of hard work, but we always seemed to have a bit of fun."
good,Rite Aid was an overall great opportunity for me! I began my pharmacy career there and fell in love with one of my strongest passions. A typical day of work was very chaotic but I always tried to make the best of it. I learned a lot starting out in retail pharmacy and gained much knowledge while working there! Management had its pro's and con's but that's every job out there! The workplace culture varied by each location or store due to the atmosphere the employees provided. The hardest part of the job was knowing the person on the opposite side of the counter was terminally ill and medication and smile is all I had to help them somewhat feel better. The most enjoyable part of the job was most definitely the people I came in contact with and was able to share a friendship with them and formed a bond with most customers and they were like my second family! I miss my customers the most!
good,"Its full of positive associates, and always a pleasure to work with. Great Environment and atmosphere to work. During the holidays gets even better with customers and working together to better fulfilled their needs."
good,Rite Aid is an environment with much room to grow in the management aspect. Most managers are very helpful and willing to teach new employees. This is a good starting out job as a cashier with further room to expand if the job fits the right person
good,"I have learned a great deal and have strengthened my customer service and entry level skills while working at Rite Aid. "
good,"The work environment is very satisfying because it's a very calm setting, with friendly co-workers and typically friendly people.  There are always things to do around the store, and always something else to learn.  Management is all super friendly and with this job I learned how to handle money and store opening and closing procedures properly along with a ton of other things.  Hardest part of the job is that some of the stores don't have enough hours to offer everyone, so you might have to jump around from store to store to get 40.  Making this environment perfect for if you're looking for part time. "
good,"I loved working for Rite Aid Pharmacy. Good environment. No work over load. You can gain a lot of hand-on customer service experience as an employee. There are many opportunities for advancement and hard work does not go un-noticed. I think it would be agreeable amongst other shift supervisors that we are underpaid by maybe two to three dollars. Overall, the experience that Rite Aid has given me so far will help me in my advancement within the company itself or outside the company as well."
good,Managers were really nice people and you make friends with the customers causing you to have a great client to customer relationship. They were flexible with hours and there was always room to grow in the company.
good,"It's a great flexible company to work for, a lot of great hands on experience and friendly environment. Job is somewhat hard on the body, standing for long periods of time."
good,"I learned about cash register procedures, anti theft devices and policies, stocking, and rotating merchandise. I worked with many different people on a daily basis, it was a good learning opportunity."
good,"the environment is very friendly, and helps develops great team work skills. management can be confusing at times, but overall cooperative."
good,"Overall, a good place to work but has been through too many reorganizations over the past ten years. Pay and benefits were good"
good,"It was a great environment it taught me alot about different products. "
good,"If your a good multitasker you will do well. Managers all bicker and dont communicate, and the pay is terrible.   I would only recommend this as a tempory job, you won't be happy here"
good,"my day could consist of ordering the product for the store, to helping the customer find the unfindable product that we have. Then going and working in the pharmacy and talking and helping the customer out. than finishing the day by counting the register drawers and making the daily deposit."
good,I remember on a truck night me and another co worker had to bring in totes in the rain. Nobody came in because of the rain so we was short staff but we got the job done
good,"Most of the job is sales and once you sign a business for a clinic, it is worth the stress. Have to be able to multitask and use time appropriately. Learned to meet new people and not be stuck at a desk all day."
good,what i enjoyed the most were my team and my customers. A typical day is pretty hectic. The long hours with little staff was a downside.
good,"Enjoy working there and I learned a lot about medication, what is used for. I learned how to call insurances to request eligibility for the patient and calling doctor's offices for prior authorizations and refills."
good,"Typical day included data entry, quality assurance, Q&A inspection, verify presciptions, communicating with prescribers, insurance companies, and giving patient care in a variety of ways. Most enjoyable part of day was giving compassionate patient care. Hardest part of day, not many but getting thru busiest part of day."
good,"Learned how to manage inventory to maintain minimum inventory cost."
good,"Management & co-workers were pleasant, and helped to maintain a clean work environment and store area. Good company benefits and many job advancements."
good,"I was hired at Rite Aid as cashier, I learned so many things while working at Rite aid. I learned how to work as a team and how to take care of our customers. After a few years I became a shift supervisor with more responsibilities and then a few years later I became an Asst Manager."
good,"I enjoyed my co workers and customers, but my customers made my day go faster , I would get along with most of them. My coworkers also were very kind id always joke around with them it felt like my second family."
good,"Great co-workers that make the work place more enjoyable."
good,Working in rite aid is stress-free. It is family-like environment. Each associate opinion and input is highly valuable and appreciated.
good,"The typical work day was hectic, but rewarding. I learned how to deal with insurances and how to help people to the best of my ability. I personally had great managers and mentors. My co-workers and my managers became my family away from home. The hardest part of the job was trying to accept that even if you give it your all there will be days when that's not enough, you can't control when or how many people are in need of medication. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the community."
good,"My experience working at Rite Aid was good. I learned a lot about working with the public and learning new skills in retail. I worked well with my co-workers and never had any altercations. The hardest part of the job was being left alone a lot of times when I needed assistance, however it taught me how to work well under pressure. The most enjoyable part of the job was stocking shelves and cleaning."
good,"Nice place to work (i work in the pharmacy). The pay sucks, Rite Aid is way below the national avg for Pharmacy tech positions. its really sad that my best friend is a cashier at McDonalds and makes 2.50 more per hr than i do. I am also a C.P.H.T. which means i hold a national certification and license to be a pharmacy tech (which is not required by law in most states) and is not required by law in new york."
good,"It's a nice place to work, management is nice and flexible. Everyone is really nice and we always get along, in my store at least."
good,I enjoyed helping customer solve problems with picking up their prescription. One of the hardest situation I had was when I started my immediate supervisor was used to micro manage his employees alot and he lost 3 admins in 1 year. When the position was offered to me I sat down with him to explain that micro managing a person sometimes does not work well and he accepted my recommendation and gave me the opportunity to work without that pressure.
good,"A typical day at work means dealing with registers that don't work properly, mostly when there's bad weather. "
good,Great benefits. Not a very good job for wanting to excel and move up. Fun co-workers. Fun management except for the store manager.
good,"It work as it for some private people is fixing and installing programs on their pc,desktops and some times also set ups of their whole new electronic equipment's"
good,"For the time I have been working there, I have enjoyed it thus far. Management could use a little fixing but there is always room for improvement."
good,"I sarted before they were rite aid and there was quite a change in the phylosophy of corporate. Not all bad, you learn to adapt but not a real family oriented organization I don't feel. Alot expected (of course), but reasonable pay and benefits. ALOT of hours for upper management but needed to maintain acceptable results."
good,I started here to in the retail world. It was a tough work environment but it made me a better pharmacist in the end as I can handle more stressful situations with ease in my current role. It is too bad that this company may get bought out
good,"Exellent management in the store Im located in. "
good,Flexible job for college students. Great company and good way to build experience. Learned how to handle cash and complete tasks.
good,"This is a great job, started out as a part time cashier, and made my way up to a full time technician. I start my day off with typing out prescriptions in the Que, counting out tablets, labeling them and passing them on to the pharmacist for approval. Once the que is cleaned up I start processing orders from our wholesalers, while keeping the Que clean. The best part about this job is the work atmosphere. When there is work to be done, everyone knows what they have to do. When the work load is light, there is a good joking environment between the cashier, technicians and the pharmacist."
good,"A typical day at work in a Rite Aid pharmacy consisted of helping every customer that walked in, called or came in our drive-thru. Whether it be ringing up prescriptions and asking pharmacists to review them with patients, typing up new prescriptions for new and returning patients, or helping wandering customers find just the product they're looking for. I learned a lot about customer service in terms of the best way to talk to upset patients or quick problem solving when it came to insurance issues. The management that I worked closely with included my immediate boss, who was always an impartial judge of character and quickly and effectively solved any problem that came to surface. Most of my coworkers were veterans to the company and had much experience in our everyday tasks. They were always willing to lend a helping hand to anyone that had a question. The hardest part of the job is always giving a customer bad news. Sometimes they don't know that they do not have prescription coverage, or that their insurance doesn't cover their medication, which without coverage costs hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars. The best part about the job is helping customers, seeing the smiles on their faces and often times the gratitude they express for just a little bit of your time a day."
good,Did a lot of travel and learned how to multi-task to cover the 27 stores. Was the manager of 60+ pharmacist and had a good repoire with co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the travel and not enough time in the day to get everything done. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the pharmacist that worked for me succeed in the job to make Northern Michigan profitable and the innovative ideas that Rite Aid was developing to help the customers in their health and well being.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to fill prescriptions through the electronic database, receive phone calls for refills or any other concerns along the way, take care of customers in drive thru and registers, call patients to remind them to pick up their medications, order medication so that they can be in stock for the next day, go through invoices from the delivery, and balance out any negative inventory. I learned how to truly multi task at this job. I have to pay attention to close detail. My management team has been good so far since I have step foot at Rite Aid. My co-workers are amazing to work with. I haven't found anything difficult in my job experience at Rite Aid. I do find taking care of patients and customers and satisfying their needs enjoyable."
good,"Enjoyed working for them, but we moved to North Carolina.  I was only there for a very short time, but really loved the job."
good,"Everyday me and my staff had to clean, ring up customers, and break down trucks. I learned how to manage a crew, unload trucks properly, manage the safe, and how to face aisles. The management staff was very friendly and they always are exceptional at their job. My co-workers believed in me and they always came to me whenever they needed a favor. The hardest part of the job was getting everything done on time when half of the staff would call out. My favorite part of the job was knowing that my co-workers believed in me."
good,"Nice place to work at for high school or college students, not necessarily cut out for the working adult looking to provide for themselves and pay bills. I generally loved helping customers, unloading shipments, and stocking the shelves. I do think that management could've been less favorable towards others and given somebody more deserving an opportunity"
good,"Atmosphere was easy to work in, overall assessment of co-workers and management is fair, the job was easy and required little to no type of mental stress, good place to work over summer break."
good,"yes there is slow times like most jobs. but the most part you must be able to do multiple things at once.   must be able to answer phone, help customers and cashier at once while keep a smile on your face."
good,"Fun work place with a good management team. Coming to work everyday was enjoyable , some days were very busy and others not so busy. Working with a good team was key, we all were a family and that is how we achieved success. It was stressful trying to make sure scripts were filled on time some days but having good customer service is number one. Overall Rite Aid is a good company to work for."
good,"Rite Aid provides a fast-paced work environment as well as a strong focus for both customer and employee satisfaction. For those willing to put forth extra effort, there is great opportunity for advancement within the company."
good,"Rite Aid is a great company if you're new to the job market. You will gain great skills needed to advance in your working life. There is not much room to grow as far as positions go, unless you're willing to become a shift manager. There are few opportunities to grow within the company, so don't expect to get far unless you plane on trying for the office positions in the main district areas."
good,Enjoyed learning and the interaction with customers.  Didn't realize how many people took certain meds.  Management and co-workers were great.
good,"My days at work consisted of maintaining the sales floor. Taking care of all customers complaints and compliments. I would supervise and overlook the sales associates to make sure that they gave our customers the best customer service and went above and beyond. I worked at Rite Aid for 9 years, so I learned a lot. I learned how to become more patient, responsible, and punctual. I had good mentors who taught me and helped me improve my attitude on life in general. I worked with the same co-workers for 7 years, and we became a family. We worked well with one another and appreciated what each person brought to the company. The hardest part of my job would be to train a new team of management; consequently, in an upper level position than myself. The most enjoyable part of my job was making customers happy and trying to make sure that they leave the store happier than when they walked in."
good,"It was fine, It gave its members of management freedom to make store level decisions that will benefit that particular location. AD ordering was fun."
good,"I felt as though I was home once I got use to the setting in Canton,NY and working in Rite Aid. A typical day at work for me was to restock shelves, answer customer questions, take calls about the pharmacy and input information into the computer. I was the main cashier for all customer purchases. I always ensured a clean environment especially working in the pharmacy it should always be maintained."
good,Rite aid was the perfect high school job. They worked around my school schedule and it helped me gain customer service as well as cashier skills.
good,Assisting customers with their purchases.  Great management team.  Excellent Management training.  Good benefits.  Opportunity for advancement.
good,My co-workers were by far the best part of the job.  They really made you feel like family and were always there to support you.
good,I worked at various stores & helped to keep shop lifting at a minimum. I was to stop people from leavings stores & to contact law enforcement people.
good,"I loved working here. The staff was very friendly and was willing to help any new comer with ease. Customers and regular Rite-Aid shoppers would come down to pharmacy to ask various questions and we were always willing to give a helping hand. It was a place where most people not only came to pick up their necessary medications, but felt comfortable enough to share their experiences with us as well. It was a very homely experience."
good,"Rite Aide is similar to Nestle in that the work force is made up of people from around the world and has similar requirements.  I was on a 10 hour a day shift that rotated days on and off throughout the week.  Each work day started out with the entire shift doing stretching exercises to limber up for the day's picking orders, packaging orders and shipping.  My job title was Lead Receiver and I was assigned to the Prescription Drug Department which ironically was the only area of the warehouse that was air conditioned."
good,"Working in the IT services at Rite Aid is a pleasant experience in comparison to the store services side. I learned just how much technology you don't ever see in retail stores that are behind the scenes. I can configure a server in one stop and the next stop work on a robotics machine used in the pharmacy. Never short on things to work on, with, and learn."
good,"I worked long hours, some times overnight shifts. Very fast paced, but enough help to carry work load. I was promoted to Pharmacy Manager's position and incentives good. When the union was introduced technicians stopped caring for clients. Handled three different software as business was changing hands."
good,Working in a pharmacy people will tell you their secrets even without you asking. Stress will become a factor at some point since you deal with people daily.
good,"Working for Rite Aid has greatly improved in the last several years I have been with the company. A typical day involves working with a team to improve patient care by dispensing medications accurately and efficiently, providing medication therapy management and immunizing the community against vaccine preventable diseases. I have learned that the role of a pharmacist has changed dramatically and continues to change from a ""behind the counter"" job to a patient-centered career. The hardest part about the job is being able to communicate insurance rejections to sick patients while the most enjoyable part of the job is creating personal relationships with patients and being able to help improve their life by counseling and teaching. My favorite part about my job is teaching my patients about the dangers of non-compliance, drug interactions, side effects etc."
good,"your day is always busy lots to do every day from plan o grams, data entry,  inventory control, customer service, however working together as a team everything goes by so quickly. Hardest part is getting everything that needs to be done all in one day. Loved working with all of my team and peers we were all like family."
good,"I enjoyed going to work everyday, worked in a small town and knew most people by first name. Always like to help customers in any way I could. We had great co-workers and everyone worked as a team.One thing I will not miss was having to wake up at 1:00 am to unload truck especially in the snow!"
good,"Was moved to a number of stores, so I was able to see different management styles. Was able to get along well with co-workers, and tried to support where I was needed. The hardest part was the constant movement in staff. The most enjoyable was having a job."
good,"Typical day was running and maintaining photo lab equipment, register, and calling customers to let them know services were completed. Hours stripped to bare minimum - typically one person running cash register, photolab, stocking, and ordering a large section of the store. I learned how to multitask and juggle tasks to finish each one before shifts ended. Management was very understanding and easy to work with. Co-workers were friendly, and job was usually in high spirits even on tough work days. Hardest part was being alone nearly every shift, but had great co-workers in other department(s) and a fantastic management."
good,"make sure the right amount of cash is in the drawers. Store is very clean, promotions are displayed. Excellent customer service/professionalism at all time"
good,Rite Aid is a good place to work for if you are in the market for part time work.  If you have a flexible schedule this is a great place to work.
good,I left Rite Aid to find a job that would allow me to see my friends and family more (a Monday thru Friday job).  Since leaving the company fully back in December I miss working with the people not only in my store but in the stores within the same  district.  I have made life long friends working here and wouldn't change anything.
good,"Always busy yet fun, good management and wonderful co workers that make the time go by and fun to work there as well. I enjoy being able to work with those I am around, getting to meet new people, and  always learning something new."
good,From working at Rite Aid I have learned more about medications and what they do. I have learned how medications should be taken and what to look out for. The management at Rite Aid is great. Everyone works together and they are very flexible with my school schedule. The hardest part of the job is seeing people who cannot afford their medication. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the public. I am a people person and love meeting and talking with all of my customers and making sure they have a great experience in Rite Aid.
good,"A typical day for me at RiteAid is working at the front of the store as a cashier then being a customer service rep. for the phone system. Later on i am also the maintenance worker for the store, as well as the heavy lifter for any products."
good,nice flexible hours. can move up fairly easy and raises every year. if you get in a good store you are bound to make friends.
good,"Store's Front End: Cashier for customers, developing photography (with the older style cartridges, not digital development), Unloading weekly truck orders to restock shelves/needed inventory while facing or neatly organizing products to appear more attractable and easy to locate. Posted weekly sale tags around the store to promote weekly sale items. Worked Front End from 04/2003-05/2005."
good,I enjoyed working as a team member at rite aid. The only reason I had for leaving was financially it was a strain on my commute to work.
good,"A typical day at work has many different tasks and assignments scheduled, which generally change depending on the season and time of year. Assignments usually entail; restocking, cleaning, organizing and satisfying customer requests. My Co-Workers and I have learned how to work efficiently in a fast-paced environment while ensuring superior customer service by working hand in hand with our Management team. Changes in policies and rules are also easier to adjust to, when most of the Management and Co-Workers have been at the job for many years. Sometimes engaging with customers from different walks of life can be challenging as well as rewarding."
good,I learned how to handle money and communicate with others. Work days would be standing by the register answering the phone or checking people out. The co-workers were very nice and I liked seeing people smile when they saved money. the hardest part of my job is when it would get really busy and someone would need help looking for something but I would have to stay at the register to help check people out. I had four managers and all were four of the nicest ladies in the world.
good,"A typical day at work would be to greet customers as they enter and leave the store, help ring up purchases or complete exchanges or returns. Help customers locate items within the store, complete planograms if they were needed, put away returned items or go backs. I had not worked in a retail store before so I learned a lot about presentation of the store, the right and wrong way to present customer service, your attitude is a large part in how well you present yourself to the customers and how well you execute your customer service skills. Management was well taken care of. The store manager is a respectful man that takes pride in his employees and his store. My co-workers were a huge part in my success at Rite Aid because if I had a question about anything, there was always someone who had an answer which improved my knowledge about the products and their uses and what we carry and what we do not. I would say the hardest part about my job is the difficult customers that occur in a row certain days-regardless of their attitudes, I have learned that I still need to be respectful and kind no matter how they treat me. Customer service is a large part of working in retail and if you cannot handle some difficult customers every once in a while, retail is not for you. I have been there for almost two years. I enjoy being around my co-workers and learning new things. I really do learn at least one thing new every shift and the regular customers that come in enjoy a friendly face and kind smile that greets them when they enter and leave."
good,After working at another place that had more drama and lack of training I look back at my time here as not nearly as bad. There will always be a few problems.
good,A typical day at work included opening the store between 6 am and 8 am. Getting the money ready for front end as well as pharmacy. Setting up Photo lab to be ready. Put in invoices and credits and check all other paperwork. The management was great. We were taught how to handle all management material for advancement purposes. I would say the hardest part of the job would be at times I would be the only one on the front end for several hours at a time. My most enjoyable part of the job was reacting with customers and being able to assist them positively.
good,"My job can be very difficult sometimes but what makes it better and more fun are my co-workers. We all get along great. When you like the people you work with, it makes your job easier."
good,Working in the night shift at right aid i was more self reliant to get things done as it would come down to just me and my supervisor at the end of every night. Answering phone calls and engaging with customers was an everyday thing building relationships with returning customers and handling the cash flow during transactions. i was often times short handed which lead to long lines. i also would have to leave the store to pick up carts at the end of the night making sure all the cars were accounted for and making sure the security of the store was up at the end of every shift.
good,working as a cashier/ customer service employee was great. My manager always said i was a great team player. I used my communication and interpersonal skills daily.
good,"Depending on the store you worked at, it was either great or terrible. but overall i loved the experience."
good,"Fast paced work environment with daily challenges, nice co-workers, & room for advancement"
good,"they work with your scheudule while going to school,. offer benefits and opportunity to move up/"
good,Like any retail environment it's fast pace.  The customers in most stores are great to deal with.  Do not want to put any negative feedback at this moment.
good,good place to work. friendly staff. very good with helping out with your schedule.
good,Rite Aid is a wonderful place to work for.  It is family oriented.  The only thing is that they do not pay you enough money and there is no room for advancement.
good,Very busy filling rxs and immunizations.Learned to balance what management wanted and what patients deserved.My coworkers were dilligent hard working underpaid employees.Surviving management was the hardest part of the job and helping people the best part
good,I enjoy this job as far as the interaction with customers. We are always busy with the many duties that need to be completed in a day but also have the leniency to be able to speak to and better learn about the customers we see everyday. I have learned how to be a better supervisor and balance being friendly but also make sure I'm keeping the associates on task. The hardest part of this job would be the fact that there is not enough recognition for a job well done as there should be. The most enjoyable thing to me besides the customers is that we as employees have become like a family which makes life easier in all ways. It allows us to work with each other when it comes to scheduling and supporting one another with our responsibilities quicker and more efficiently.
good,Rite Aid is always evolving to the benefit of it's customers and employees.
good,"Open the store, count deposits and balance the cash registers in the morning upon opening the store. Did bank runs where i took in deposits, train new employees on register and over see the store along with employees. Handle customers and their needs. The hardest part of this job was unloading the truck when the shipments came in, most enjoyable part is i love working with the people"
good,"I normally arrive at the store 30 minutes before opening. Count safe, put out tills, check bathrooms, make deposit. Open the store at 8 am  prepared to welcome all customers. I continue to mutli task my daily assignments while helping customers find products. I complete all invoices, approve time, put up stock, answer calls, and answer emails, complete any plan-o- grams. I usually have 1 cashier to complete transactions. I am available for any and all questions both by staff or customers. The hardest part of my job is balancing tasks while giving excellent customer service. The most enjoyable part of my job is greeting my customers! I love to welcome each one. I am often complemented on my smile and greeting. I have learned so many things! How to give greet customer service, how to prioritize assignments, how to delegate tasks."
good,"great environment love the people and staff."
good,good place to work clear duties and great customers. I enjoyed training new hires and helping the store run smoothly.
good,"Rite Aid was actually a decent store to work for. You always could approach management; as were they always quick to introduce you to higher ups and visiting management. I did work in a union store, so the raises came as they were supposed to, you have the union to back you if needed....plus I had some great co workers and an awesome store manager! "
good,Creating a good enviroment for my team  to ensure good teamwork which is necessary for providing. Good customer service as this is one of our priorities. I enjoy my job but it is stressful when you much to do with little help
good,"Maintain physical security of assigned store while conducting a visual audit of all alarms, Closed Circuit Television, and locks are functioning properly, Conduct routing bag checks on associates at the beginning and end of shifts when circumstances warrant, Aid the store management, associates, & overall company internal, as well as external theft apprehension and/or prevention."
good,"I managed the business in all aspects, from cx service to dealing with vendors, training and ordering merchandise, etc. I managed the business according to companies policies and guidelines. I enjoyed working with my team, and working with customers."
good,Challenging but rewarding at the same time. I enjoy seeing the end results of my work .
good,"You have daily thing to do like clean the front of the store, restock the candy if needed. Co-workers are will to help you and explain everything that is not understood. The hard part is restock in the aisles on truck day because its a bunch of items."
good,"The job was basically stand at the register for hours, and occasionally set up displays, stock shelves, and clean the store. While the job seemed unimportant, I learn how to deal with customers needs and time management with the various projects that I put together. My bosses were all good bosses, just not very good people, but I understood they need to act like superiors before people sometimes to get the work done. There were not difficulties with this job, and the most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers, they were all fantastic and fun to work with."
good,"Its a great place to work if you enjoy dealing with the public,management depends on the store Manager that is assigned to the store you're in.Overall a great start for working experience, great challenges given."
good,"Typical Day is providing Customer Service. Filing processed prescriptions by numberic order. Processing Prescriptions, verifying prescripitons & insurance, calling doctors and problem solving. ordering merchandise, putting up orders when merchandise comes in. Looking for outdated product. Filing orders by  alphabetical order. Answering multi-line phones. Calling customers and veryifying orders. The most enjoyable part of the job  is working with a wide variety of people from all walks of life. The hardest part of the job is rush hour the pharmacy gets enondated with people wanting their orders ASAP and it is difficult when problems arise."
good,"expected to constantly multi-task"
good,"Busy Store."
good,"Everyday I learn something new whether its about our prescription processing system, medication, or patients there are new challenges each day."
good,I was hired as a cashier but i also helped in the pharmacy and in the back with inventory. i enjoyed giving out ice cream to kids and seeing everyone happy. The hardest part of the job for me was to drive there when gas prices were high even though that isn't the stores fault i had to commute. I really didn't have any bad things to say about the store great staff and management.
good,"It was a fun place to work, with coworkers that can be called family. The only real issue was that it was a dead-end job, there was very little room for improvement in the company."
good,"flexible hours as manager, get to create own schedule"
good,"i learned how to use a register deal with all different kinds of customers, stock shelves and work the photo center. my coworkers became really close friends and management helped with every need i had. there were some hard parts of the job such as processing checks and dealing with disappointed customers but the staff was always there to lend a helping hand."
good,open up at 8am run register if no one else was there. Made deposit  balanced cash that was in store. checked vinder in unloaded truck and put out stock had other people to help on truck day. I did the same thing for each company. So every day was the same unless we had resets.
good,"The store payrolls are such that you can't afford to have an off day...not enough time/help to catch up if you fall behind, especially considering they add more to your typical day all the time.  I am fortunate to have a spectacular crew."
good,"Everyday was always something new to learn or do. I learned alot of helpful tips by working with them. The management was great. I loved all my co-workers, we got along great together. The hardest part about the job was dealing with rude customers but you learn to bite the bullet because ""customers are always right."" The most enjoyable part was working with a great staff and regular customers."
good,"This was my first job ever out of high school. "
good,"Cashier, make customers smile, Sell item of the week, Just work do what I have to, to make the day productive and successful"
good,Advanced well within 10 years. Worried about job security due to company financial struggles.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the patient whom we help each day. Patients have great expectation of the pharmacy team to deliver their precription fast, provide a friendly enviroment, to educate patients about their medication or any other health concerns, and great all around services. My coworker are very important part for a team to meet our goals in the pharmacy. The staff have to be educated to a level where they understand what is expected of them. A typical day at work is having a staff thats working together well."
good,Lots of opportunity to interact with customers. Management was great! Co-workers were nice to work with.
good,"Schedule employs, check inventory, set shelves with merchandise, and help customers with all their needs."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Rite Aid very much. My typical day would start at 6 AM and run until about 4-5 pm. There was soo much I learned during my tenure, one of the greatest being superb customer service, proper staffing and excellent people skills will make you successful, how far is up to you. I had the greatest team of managers assembled in the Southeast, not because we were the highest volume, but because I placed a premium on creating a work environment were people wanted to come work. Always eager for the next challenge. The hardest part of the job was seeing thru all you and your staffs efforts, some employees could not attain the level of professionalism I demanded and as such had to be let go."
good,"Provide excellent customer service, maintain cleanliness of registers and counters, operate cash register and handle monetary transactions, assist in stocking of items, promote sales, and other duties as needed. "
good,"Working for Rite Aid as a Customer Service Associate, the days were rather easy. Helping customers find products, working the register, unloading deliveries, stocking shelves, and maintaining the store's appearance were all daily and easy tasks. Management in the store was fair. Upper management did seem rather aggressive about certain ways the store should look, which had a trickle affect of pressure on the store manager to the employees. Hardest part about the job was working while noticing other employees were not. It happens everywhere, not a big deal but can lower you motivation to work while they are relaxing in aisles or the stockroom. The most enjoyable part was probably some of the customers. Other than helping them, some of them had some interesting stories to tell. "
good,"The company does not offer much in terms of pay or benefits, but the stores are usually well run and functional to work within."
good,I enjoy working interacting with the customers at Rite Aid. I assist them as much as possible and provide them with excellant customer service. The employees here work together as a team.
good,"Work starts early in the morning processing the paperwork and collating them with their matching labels into packets. Use those packets to pick, pack, seal and ship the products."
good,"friendly atmosphere, hard with family and small children. Not easy to get time off."
good,conducting daily audits to reduce the store shrink and to watch the activity of shoplifting of internal and external.
good,"The procedures, pharmacists, management, values, and RX operating systems are way better than their reputations. Unfortunately, the pay for a cpht here is much less than the competitors are paying. Lots of loyal, talented workers are lost as a result."
good,Regular customers were great. Co-workers are friendly and a pleasure to work with. Management tends to take out stresses on employees. Fast pace at times.
good,"Nice customers, family atmosphere. Left Managers to work alone at night. You were expected to be the cashier, stock person and manger. Dangerous."
good,"stock the whole store and cashier,good neiborhood nice work area just no hours"
good,"Most days were spent answering the phone, compiling reports, creating spreadsheets and tracking various information. I also learned the basics of hiring practices, talent information, looking at budgets, booking travel and how to plan, organize and schedule off site meetings. The people that I reported to where very helpful and knowledgeable in their respective fields. They trusted me with a lot of confidential information and allowed me to be mostly independent in my daily activities. The most enjoyable part of my job is just getting to work with a lot of different departments and learn some of the aspects of their job. The hardest part of my job would be balancing the multiple people that I reported to and ensure that all of their information was accurate and submitted on time. Time management was very important in the success of my job and others."
good,It was a good experience for me.The location gave me an opportunity to deal with customers from different cultures
good,"A closing shift; stocking shelves, cleaning, floor management. Usually balancing the change and deposit safes, setting up bank deposits and change orders. I'll handle approvals over price mods and returns and other such register changes and problems. Assign jobs to cashiers, and review the completed work. Watch the floor for suspicious characters and possible thefts, and if such does occur notify the authorities and upper management. Handle parking lot problems, such as vagrants and panhandlers."
good,"A typical day at work starts off with clocking in and getting right to work. I am either on the register helping customers or on the floor helping more customers, or if short staffed I will be in the Pharmacy. I have learned a lot at this job, different types of medication, handling pretty upset customers, and learning the right way to shelf items. (""Take time out for saftey."") The management there is alright, they could sure use a strict individual once in a while. My co-workers are the best, they are always having fun with themselves and the customers: to the point where all the customers know who is new and who is not. The hardest part of my job is not being able to please a customer, they leave the store upset or frustrated because they could not find a certain item, or someone did not help them a certain way. I try my best to have them leave with a smile on their face or leave a good impression on them. Also another hard part of my job is trying to get things done and having customers ask me questions (very distracting) but I am there to please, so I shall do what my job description says. My most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I did all the work I needed to get done and going home knowing I will not get a manager on my case the next day :)"
good,"A typical day at work is assisting our customers with their needs, whether it's helping with the photo equipment,locating something in the store, or just general questions. Once a week I also unload the truck, we usually get about 12 feet of totes and boxes, it can sometimes be very challenging. After 3 years of working at Rite Aid I have learned a lot, one of the main things I have learned that the needs of the customer is always my top priority. It makes me feel good to know that the customer leaves our store happy. I have great co-workers they have helped me grow into the woman I am today."
good,Working at Rite Aid was somewhat interesting especially when customers get upset about there medicines. Management was sometimes discouraging but tolerable. Co-workers were fun and energetic.
good,"I enjoy the flexibility of creating my own schedule, ability to work independent and with others, supervisor does not micro-manage and frequent contact with employees in multiple stores. Job is self paced but expectations are clear and performance monitored. Many challenges in a day with different equipment but keeps the job interesting."
good,"A typical day of work starts off with doing the ""pull sheet,"" which is Rite Aid's inventory management system. It tells the person doing it what to bring out from the back and to put on the shelf, so the shelves stay stocked. The second thing you would do is the freshness sheet. This helps make sure the store is not selling outdated product. The third thing that would need to be done is ""Zero's"" they help the warehouse order what the store needs by saying something is out of stock. However, from here on it is very hard to describe my day from there because it is never the same, from helping run register, doing returns, filling shelves, building ends, and resetting isle it is always new and exciting."
good,"I learned a lot in Rite aid, and had amazing colleagues."
good,I enjoyed working for Rite Aid pharmacy. It was busy at times but my co-workers made it worth it. I learned how to fill prescription quickly and accurately and how to deal with customer complaints in a polite and friendly way. The hardest part of the job was some of the insurance billing issues that took some time to resolve on coverage of medications. The best part would had to have been the co-workers and getting to know the customers.
good,"Helped customers daily , I've learned how to manage and use a cash register. management was very understanding and attended to my needs. The hardest part of the job was on delivery days when employees had to load and unload the truck with merchandise. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the shift is about to be over and everyone is on a time schedule to clean up and pack up the store!"
good,"It has been a learning experience, I've grown within the company, learnt and applied the skills that I acquired over the years."
good,"I would open the store and set up the registers. I made sure I tried to complete the task for the day like putting up any new displays,putting away inventory, checking out recalls and so on. Management was very friendly and understanding. Most of the co-workers did what they were suppose to be doing. Some of the young ones could be a little lazy. I didn't enjoy putting away all the new product that would come in every Thursday. I did enjoy putting up displays and dealing with the customers."
good,Typical days at this job was i was the main cashier most of the day then when other emloyees came in i was switch to stocking duties in the back. Didnt really learn anything honestly. Manager was never there like once a week just to check up. The hardest part of the job was when the power went out nd we had a bunch of customers that was being checked out. The most enjoyable part was pretty much everything else job wasnt really too hard.
good,"Opening and Closing Photo-lab,Scheduling,Balancing Cash/Drawers,Full Customer service for printing and sending out orders."
good,"Directed and coordinated operational, management. Planned and implemented facility programs in accordance with regional and national policy and to meet established objectives for providing efficient, effective customer service, trained and managed employees and achieved significant improvements in their productivity, successfully handled start and end of day process."
good,"Waiting on people, cashiering,stocking selves opening or closing store for that day,banking"
good,"I come to work a few minutes early before punching to start work. I learned a lot since I've been working at Rite Aid. When I get to the sales floor or at the register I found myself reacting instantly to customer concerns and problems that they may have. And answering any and all questions they they may ask. I've also learned that a lot of the merchandise on the sales floor might not have the right pricing or in the wrong spot and the customers always having problems with getting the right prices for their merchandise. I get this a lot when I'm up at the cash register. The response from the management team here when being called or paged over the intercom is unsatisfactory. I try to make sure that when this happens, I talk to the customer and try to help them as much as possible with what they need while they wait for management show assist them. My co-workers do the best that they can when working under store rules. During truck days, in which we restocking our store shelves. Most of the time they put the merchandise in the wrong place because they can't find where it really goes or don't want to find out where it goes. The hardest part of my job is restocking the merchandise. I work so hard to make sure that all the items on the sales floor is in the right places under the right price tag and it feels like no one else is doing the something. It's like I'm working alone to maintaing the order of the store. The most enjoyable thing about my job is getting to interact with new people everyday. I like being able to help out people when they are in need of help or just a simple"
good,"Typical day at work is once you punch in ask the manager for the day what he or she would like you to do.its either stay on register or face(fix) the store.Do back up if they call you.go one a 30mins break come back then continue your work.i have learn customer service,working well with other,team player,being organized.To me now the management is not that well because the lack of communication to the associates.my coworker are very helpful and caring.respect one another.The hardest part of the job is when they cut your hours from work because of payroll.And the most important part of working are the customers,just seeing the joy and smile on their face"
good,"Great experience working at Rite Aid, it was a very educational experience that help me to understand what it was like to work with many co-workers, to manage them and to work as a team. The Managers, Supervisors and fellow employees were very friendly and trully helpfull, they taught me many things that help me to value and increase my productivity. I was incharge of receiving freight and responsible to keep acurate count on the merchendise. The hardest part of the job was knowing when to terminate a certain employee. Being a Stockroom Manager i feel was a priviledge, it thought me to see whats it like to be a manager but also to have patience with are regular employees. A good manager makes great employees..team work is vital to a successful bussiness."
good,Rite Aid is a good company to work for. It is very challenging but I enjoy a challenge
good,"I loved working at Rite Aid because a typical day was fast paced, so it went by fast. In the amount of time I've worked there, I learned a lot in a little amount of time. The managers there were very nice but also very direct. I liked my fellow co-workers because we always got the job done. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the really tough customers but the most enjoyable part for me was knowing that I was responsible for them walking out extremely satisfied."
good,"Very busy, sometimes I had to multitask when I was the only manager in the store, made sure the store was clean at the end of my shift"
good,at this job i unloaded the truck every wensday am and stocked the store. I also helped customer with overal problems and was a cashier.
good,Rite Aid was a great place to work. Everyone was helpful and worked as a team.
good,It was a good job just couldn’t deal with all the drama. I don’t get it why they are open until midnight and you just stand there doing nothing. Hours were ok
good,"For the last couple of years I worked mainly remotely. My day consisted of "
good,The pay was not so great for the amount of work that was required of me but the energy me as well as my coworkers have made for a very happy environment
good,Enjoyed working with this team. They allowed me to grow and i learned a lot while being in the pharmacy. I wish my time there wasn’t so short but i appreciate the moments i had.
good,"Rite Aid was a great job. Light work, fun people and tons of customer diversity. You cash people out, organize shelves, management was fantastic. The hardest part was handling asset protection. Overall, enjoyable."
good,"I have enjoyed my time and co workers during my tenure at Rite Aid. I have enjoyed the culture and many fun times over the years at Rite Aid. I believe that I have grown as a person in many different ways, through my on the job experiences."
good,"Typical clerk job, pay was barely above minimum wage. Recommend for High School students to apply at CVS, where you can earn $5 more an hour. Fellow employees and management was extremely friendly and great to work with!"
good,when coworkers tend to show up to work in horrible/annoyed moods it messes with your positive work environment. i dealt with that for a year from a manager. other than that rite aid is a great first job and great in general!
good,This job is good for entry level . Management is very supportive. I have learnt a lot related to retailing.  Always busy and lack of staff. You will have little advancement in career at the beginning.
good,"Great team mate, very well structure of assistant if need. You work very independent, company car, tools, and company credit card. "
good,"This was a fun place to work! Staff was great and enjoyed the work. The pay was not great for the work that is being done, but they do have good training."
good,Rite Aid is a good place to work.  It does tend to be better for people who don't have a family as that they dont have set schedules and sometimes make the schedules last minute.  Most of the managers are helpful and friendly and do try to accommodate everyone's needs and concerns but also meet the needs of the business.
good,"Fun place to work . I made new friends.. only the scheduling wasn't good ... the pay was good also . The job as a cashier was doing different things such as stocking , phone, cleaning , . Overall a great place to work"
good,I had a good time working in Rite Aid. Constant changes in the market place adds stress and restructuring occurs every few years. Benefit package is among the best in retail.
good,"Rite Aid is a nice place to work. Most of the employees are friendly and are always willing to help each other, but very limited associate hours does present a challenge to most stores."
good,"When working ,making sure that you and the pharmacist had filled all prescriptions and cleaned up pharmacy before closing and have a positive experience each day even with difficult customers"
good,My experience working at rite aid was pretty good. My co workers were nice and didn’t mind helping me learn the ropes. Staff was friendly as well and very helpful
good,"It was an amazing experience , and I was able to expand my customer service skills. Working for this company you will need to work as a team to accomplish goals."
good,"I loved being Pharmacy Manager at this location. Community members were like family and when the location shut down in the first national closure Walgreens buy-out 75% of the community followed me because of the culture, trust, and patient-pharmacist relationship  my partner and I fostered. Upper management was difficult- not enough hours to staff as business demanded, also hard to hire and retain good employees at the pay rate allotted. I am sure this is case at most big business drug stores."
good,I reported narcotics missing to loss prevention.  Never did anything about it .Had back surgery and when i came back thay terminated me for procedure.  Have all proof to my claim
good,"Rite aid was my first job and it was actually great , the lessons I learn , my communication skills was more proactive. Being my first job I had ups and downs but I overall every cons I had and made it as a lesson on a day to day."
good,"delivered excellent customer service while promoting immunizations, smoking cessation, allergy wellness, flu clinics, phone calls to patients including follow up,scheduling appointments for meetings between pharmacist and patient, helping with insurance and billing and paperwork."
good,"I worked there for 10 years as a cashier, went through a lot of employees,  I loved all my managers the biggest problem was the shift managers didn't do what they were told and the managers get fired or tranfered leaving the same problem for the next manager. I turned down the position every year because a quarter wasn't worth it."
good,"Great company to work for, I worked in pharmacy.  Front end I'm not sure how they enjoy their jobs or pay."
good,"All about the numbers.  Not a hard job but a lot of moving parts to remember. Doing Plan-o-grams, Checking sections for out-dates.  Enjoy interacting with customers."
good,The pace at rite aid is very fast and abundant . Also very competitive although no room for growth. All in all it’s not a bad place to start out if your trying to build your resume and get costumer service experience.
good,"I enjoyed working there. At the time, they were very family oriented. The benefits under Rite Aid were very good and made having to work weekends a little more acceptable."
good,Working for rite aid has been a pleasure. The people and culture of the company made for a welcoming and encouraging atmosphere. Personal and professional goal and development are paramount to corp. leaders
good,"From my experience, the competency of managers varies widely from store to store; however, it is expected of the employees at every Rite Aid to adhere to a daily task list as well as weekly and monthly lists. Everything is very straight-forward, and you know basically what to expect depending on which day of the week it is. Rite Aid is very charitable too. Beginning every March, we start a fundraiser for Children's Miracle Network, and encourage every associate to ask customers if they would like to donate. There is a ton of communication between districts, District Managers, etc that is really essential to keep us all focused on the core values."
good,Retail pharmacy has always been my favorite field to work in.  I worked for this company for several years and traveled as a trainer when the company bought Eckerd's. The supervisors and district managers were very cooperative.  I worked as a pharmacy manager for several years and learned a lot about managing.
good,"I was lucky enough to have extraordinary co-workers and managers. My store was great, but not suprisingly, some stores are a dread to work at if there is poor management."
good,it was relaxed and fun with great management It's fast paced. Had to do so many things in a typical 9 hour shift. You have to receive product. Put the product away. Help both customers and patients.
good,I started this job back in 2007.  Eleven years later and I'm still here with the same people doing what we do best.  The culture at Rite Aid is great but its the people that make this place a great place to work.
good,While working for Rite Aid I learned a lot about customer service and the day to day managerial duties. The most enjoyable part of job was helping customers find everything they wanted.
good,"Typical day at work is just fixing up all the aisles, cashing out people's shopping at the cashier, and most importantly customer service; helping out customers and being friendly."
good,If you show initiative and drive and prove that you want to be there the better off your hours are going to be and the more likely you are to advance.
good,"A very busy fast paced place to work and always helping our customers.  Also the people I worked with were very nice and friendly"
good,"It was fun working with this company for time that I did , I can remember waking up in the morning just to get my day started at rite aid the people who worked there where great iv learned a lot even became a part of the team as managment from a stock associated all was good ...."
good,I wish they had locations here in San Antonio so I could have just transferred with a job when I moved here. Great company and friendly staff. Awesome benefits and great managers in some stores
good,Overall my experience was fantastic at Rite Aid. Customers were the only real downside but I loved putting away freight. the hardest thing about it other than rude customers which you get everywhere are the part of freight you have to do as a cashier that requires leaving your mandatory workspace but also not allowing members to wait for you when you are away.
good,good place to work at. theres always customers that have a question. staying busy makes the time go by fast cuz being in a store all day  drag. Ice cream was always a good sales pitch.
good,"It's retail pharmacy, but I had freedom to take care of my customers. Always pushing for numbers but for me it did not interfere with my doing my job the best that I can. Caring for customers the way I do keeps my service scores high."
good,"none great place flexible with schedule "
good,I really like this job I enjoy working for rite aid and the people I worked with was very nice to me and I know that I was laid off but I know there will be more jobs out there for me thank you so much
good,I enjoyed working at Rite Aid.  The Pharmacy Manager was a wonderful teacher and mentor.  The only reason I left was because I knew that I would be relocating out-of-state.  I would have given 5 stars if they had paid me what I am worth.
good,I really liked the management team at my store. I learned a lot about sales and keeping customers satisfied while reaching daily goals. The workplace culture was relaxed but challenging and our boss always pushed us to do better. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers find the items they needed.
good,The coworker are great to work with but the area isn't the best. There are a lot of shoplifters that come to the store. It also gets very busy during the afternoon till evening. The store is sometimes under staff.
good,I enjoyed my time working there I really learned a lot from Rite Aid. I appreciate them for giving me a chance to show my skills and treating me as part of there family.
good,Rite aid is a great place to start in your career. It can by just a job or turn it into a career. But there is a threshold how much you can advance and of course not many people reach that but when you do there is no advancement opportunities.
good,The compensation is great the only downside is that you are to tired to enjoy it. I didn't so i loved the job. Because I had no life. But if you love staying busy like I did it is great for time occupation. Because its always something to do.
good,Rite Aid management has always treated me well. The long hours without any breaks is taxing. I would like to see the company succeed however I feel respect for pharmacists is on the decline.
good,I enjoyed working for rite aid. It seems like it will take awhile for raises as it's only once a year. I worked with a great staff and management. I would recommend to someone just starting off.
good,"Working at Rite Aid was a pleasure. Nice Managers and Supervisors and great security workers. I absolutely LOVED the cafeteria, GOOD breakfast and Lunch to start and get you through your day."
good,"The Rite Aid experience is a great one for most people that want to take their careers seriously and can be ""lead"" or ""molded"" into what the company requires. I have just personally reached an impasse in my life to where I need to make a change and Rite Aid may not fit that change, so I'm forced to look elsewhere."
good,Was a demanding job but everyone worked together to accomplish a common goal alongside the supervising physician. Every one had a job and in order for things to flow smoothly everyone had to effectively do that job and lean on others if help is needed. Communication is important. I enjoyed working with the pharmacists and other technicians. The pay was okay for the job being done although at times the job can get hectic when understaffed.
good,Rite aid is my first job and it was really a fun experience working there I was able to learn things I didn’t expect to be taught. Was a cashier for a year and half before becoming a shift supervisor
good,everyone that I worked with at all 2 of my locations were easy to get along with. there was always room for promotion if you worked hard enough for it.
good,Working for Rite Aid was not a bad job it was actually well relaxed very well maintained steady work had a lot of organization to it and was smoothly run with good fellow employees with good attitudes..
good,"Rite Aid promotes a successful work environment by demonstrating the company's care for their employees and customers alike. One can expect a calm and easy environment where the team works together to demonstrate care for the customer and their wellness. A typical sales associate is expected to work the registers, straighten stock on the floor shelves, sweep and clean when necessary. The most important component of a sales associate's work is their value of customer service, exampled through communication with everyone they interact with. "
good,Very fast-past and hard working productive but fun job. Great place to work as a employee and manager. Good location for a free standing store with a pharmacy.
good,"Rite Aid can be a great and rewarding place to work for, however, it all depends on your manager. There are many benefits and scheduling can be easy and flexible. There is a 401k offered, dental ,health, insurance, a union, and online perks. There is room for advancement depending on the individuals skill and performance. The dark side of this company is that new managers may not receive the help they need, and upper management can be quite questionable at times."
good,I did photo tech support while I was here . I enjoyed being a cashier . I would of stayed longer instead of the issue with management . Overall nice place
good,"The job is always different and changing. New products to be put up, mark down the old. Inventory, Stocking shelves,  helping customers. Running of register."
good,"They had awesome managers. They kept store clean and neat and stocked. Everyone was really nice. And they understood if you needed to be off for kids, school or doctor appointments."
good,good benefits - fun place to work. its a union workplace so you get good benefits. hours are not steady. They have a pension plan for employees. Good excersise because your always on your feet or waking.
good,My overall experience at Rite Aid has been a positive one.  Rite Aid is a great place to work and you can learn a lot from management because they are very engaging and involved in their employees success.
good,"For a full-time worker you get 30 min. lunch "
good,A productive and good place to work. Fast paced atmosphere. Have to stand on your feet for the most part of the day. Should have strong multi-tasking skills. Great co-workers.
good,"Was dealing with and trying to calm down irritated customers due to rejected insurance claims. I would always try everything I could do get the claim to be accepted, from asking the pharmacist to call the doctor to get the med changed to something that was covered or suggesting a cheaper option if insurance rejected."
good,"typical day at work was making calls early in the morning to the customers who had medicine being put back and then helping on the floor with all other customers or on the registers."
good,Friendly staff can be stressful at times customer friendly the ability to advance stressful at times but still a great company to work for you will love it
good,"Worked independantly often ,Manager planned wedding. Learned quickly how to spot shoplifters and money laundring.Staff worked very well together. All in all agood place to work."
good,Some days I go in to work its fast pase and competitive and sometimes relaxed its only relaxed when it's not to crowded or not to busy I always liked working there
good,"Typical day at work was general office duties, mail distribution, emails, spreadsheet updates, filing, answering phones."
good,"As an Asset Protection Agent, I was kept busy at this location.  I made hundreds of apprehensions and recovered thousands in merchandise.  I was able to get the other associates involved by training them in observation and recovery statements.  The only downside was not enough in the budget for adequate product protection devices.  The most enjoyable parts of this job were getting to know the good regular customers and the other associates.  We always celebrated events like promotions, awards and holidays with a small pot luck party."
good,I was packing out aisles and organizing the shelfs. I also did truck night where I had to move the tilts from outside into the store in a organize manner. The hardest thing about the job is lifting back and forth and organizing the shelfs because it was label wrong.
good,Okay Place To Work Management Sucks And Timing IS Very Stickt Lunches Are Not Paid For Breaks Are Only 15 minutes and by time you get out to break room break is almost over
good,It was a lot of fin to work at Rite Aid because of the team work that made everything flow effortlessly even with many issues that would arise with our customers. Rite Aid cares about customer service and its employees. Employees could solve problems that would benefit the customer with out computers making all the rules and having to call on everything to get somebody else to fix what you could have done in 10 seconds. I loved working there.
good,"I was compleatly new to the whole ""facing"" thing and I kept geting scolded for not knowing how to do it. Besides that it was a fun job and if it wasnt for school id still work there"
good,Every day I clock in and go straight to work. I have learned so much about different medications and prescriptions along with insurance billing. Our manager at our store is amazing. They are very considerate of our outside lives and is very accommodating with scheduling. Not really any hard parts other than all the learning aspects of the drugs and technician training. Love my customers and my coworkers.
good,I enjoyed working at Rite Aid it brought me a sense of responsibility with working in retail and pharmacy. I have work in several location that gave me a teaching moment in learning different cultural.
good,This job gave me many skills i need in future jobs. This job showed my how to manage my time as well as to counsel other on better ways to manage theirs based off of my experience.
good,"Days are very productive, demanding, yet it is a fun workplace. "
good,"shift supervisors are glorified cashiers, no real authority. Only cashiers with keys. Managers are nice but they work in store as much as associates are not allowed to manage because of work loade"
good,This was my first pharmacy job and I learned a lot coming in knowing nothing about the field of pharmacy prior. I had a great team of people to guide me in learning the various tasks and roles that comes with being a pharmacy technician.
good,They should consider bringing back thrid party transportation to and from the job location. Overall my 16 years experience working for this company was a pleasure. The open door policy was a plus.
good,Very easy going place with very few issues. Managers were great and the job was fairly easy. I would recommend this job to friends and family. Nice environment.
good,Rite Aid is a very slow paced job that is great for those who have no job experience. It is great for people who just got out of high school or a private school. It is really easy job.
good,something different every day
good,"It was overall a great place to work. But they really loved the drama and starting issues with other coworkers. I loved dealing with the patients, doctors, nurses, and insurance companies."
good,It was a great environment among most co-workers. One manager was very poor at working with people and would be nasty. But aside from her everyone was really great. Some customers are rude and difficult but that happens in all retail jobs.
good,"I have been with Rite Aid for the past 12 years and the best thing about the job is that it really goes fast because you are on your feet a bunch, There are alot of friendly people who come in the store and know you by name. I would recommend RIte Aid to anyone looking for an affordable pharmacy to refill your prescriptions."
good,Very fast work place. Company promote within. If the overtime was not mandatory the job would have a high turning over rate. The discounts is one of the high lights working for the company.
good,"I love working here this was my first job. I gain more family, i really learned a lot here but now I just have to move on to bigger and better thing for me and my family"
good,It is a great place to work get to meet different people and help Customer while they are there shopping. I also work close with the managers to help with shrink and train new associates.
good,"Long hours, but can be fun to select and drop items for cutters, and as well as filling orders for loading and delivering of individualized goods. Overall, it's a good place to work"
good,Very nice people to work with job always keeps you busy and friendly customers. Everything is always nice and neat at the company and sometimes they will throw you a curve ball or two to make sure your on your toes.
good,"You had certain things you had to do each day of the week, no deviation.  Took a lot of discretion from hands of store managers in last year or two I was with company."
good,"Not bad job, but it is just a job, not really a career. The only difficult part of the job is dealing with the customers. Great culture and a fun group of coworkers."
good,"Rite Aid was a very fun and laid back position, not too busy most of the time but when it was it was a quick paced atmosphere which at times can be quite stressful dealing with sick patients."
good,"keep computer based  training weekly and monthly. "
good,That company is a great place to work as since everything is well-managed and organized. The fellow employees are very friendly and the manager is also well-respected.
good,load on a daily basis. It is a good starter for someone out of high school or a retiree.  The discounts were a nice privilege to have in addition to the vacation time. It fair and reasonable
good,It was everything i expected and i had my bad moments but overall was good. Some co workers were hard to work with. Best part was helping the friendly regular customers. Worst part was dealing with people ho clearly had a problem with their prescription drugs and would be very irritable.
good,"It’s alright, could be better about the vacation days you have to wait a whole year before you even get to qualify for vacation and you have to work 35 or over to get it and have to work over 30 to get benefits. Also shift supervisors do not make more than they should they make maybe .70 cents more than the cashiers for way more responsibility the pay isn’t great."
good,"Loved working there ,little far from home but love the customers and associate . I enjoyed the day to day operations.  I had a good staff both in pharmacy and on sales floor"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to other associates and customers. I learned how to become more patient and how to build  management skills. The work culture is not very diverse, and the hardest part of the job is trying to feel like I am truly making a difference. A typical day would entail, completing the freshness report for the day, providing management approvals needed at the register for cashiers, as well as pick-ups. I also check vendors in and out, log registers on and off, gather deposit cash to send to the bank, and do regular closing or opening duties."
good,"not a bad workplace, fun place to get to know different medications, using basic math, and develops good interpersonal skills. I recommend highly but currently looking for new employment"
good,"The job can be challenging because of the production rate but not hard to do. They often have food events to appreciate associates. Thanksgiving dinners, breakfast treats, ice cream socials and more. Nice to be appreciated. The management team seems to be the right ones for the job. ."
good,"Company went through restructuring, many people were not retained.The company is a nice company that treats you well. The company has had many financial  problems, and  recently sold half of the company to Walgreens there were many changes to the organization."
good,"This was my first loss prevention job ever, many people hate the place for their own personal reasons but this place never given me any reason not to like it. I do wish the pay was a little more i will not disagree on that but aside from that the job really doesn't stress you out there really isn't to much to the job just keep up with your regular duties and you'll have a smooth sailing."
good,I would love to work at rite aid. If I was given a chance to work there again I would take it in a heartbeat. Lots of great people to work with and lots of great customers.
good,I had a lot of fun working here because we all got along and worked well together- it was steady pace with some down time. We did everything there from cashier to stock .
good,"i had worked at rite aid for an externship i did with the santa rosa junior college. I was at the one on marlow, i liked it but it was really slow and they didn't have much for me to do."
good,A day at food rite for me was joyful it was an all around great experience and i liked it. I would highly recommend this job for anybody who is a teen and looking for a first job.
good,"Fun"
good,"I mainly floated between several local stores, so it would be unfair to provide the general daily work experience as it differed between each pharmacy. But overall I have a very pleasant experience at all locations I have worked."
good,"job was great, worked with some great team members but my school schedule did not work well with the hours. I learned how to lead a team and was able get the job done in the time frame it needed to be done"
good,"My typical day at work is busy and somewhat stressful. Even though I have learned a lot through this job, I unfortunately also learned that I do not want to stay in retail pharmacy. My management team is amazing, though I have heard plenty of stories of others not having that experience. The hardest part of the job is just keeping everything done. My store has a drive-thru and our phones never stop ringing, so it is hard to make sure every customer is dealt with promptly while also doing other things like putting away the order and cleaning. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is helping people with their medications. Whether it is answering their questions or helping find cheaper solutions, I wanted to be in healthcare to help people and that is my favorite part of the job. The main reason I dislike Rite Aid is the pay. When I was promised a raise, it took 3 months to get to me due to details that had been conveniently left out when I was told about it. Plus, staffing is an issue. We have lost several people at my store and they have not replaced anyone. We are down to 3 or 4 technicians without any new possibilities coming in. When I get overtime due to this situation, corporate gets angry, but they refuse to fix the problem. This situation also makes it hard to take breaks, as we are a very busy store."
good,"Maintains staff by recruiting, selecting, orienting, and training employees; developing personal growth opportunities. "
good,"Ran the cash register, loved working with customers. the hardest part of the job was working with the steady income of customers during the summer season."
good,This was my first retail job I started when I was 16. Other than the long hours and pay there is really nothing to complain about. The rest was mostly rude customers which you'll get everywhere. My coworkers and bosses were pleasant.
good,It's a cool place for starter jobs.You gain a lot of experience while working there. There are times during the day where the store gets congested but you are trained to be able to handle everything.
good,Pretty decent pay with average hours. management was kind but upper management was a pain in the neck expecting too much from everybody in low amount of time. decent benefits and diverse environment and low learning curve. Decent place to start in retail
good,"I loved working there. The hours were kind of shaky and pay, but as a first job, it was wonderful. Great environment to be around and a great place to gain better social skills"
good,"Job is fairly easy, just several routines that you do over and over everyday.  The only changes is when one of the delivery dates changes then it pushes that task to a different day"
good,"Always something to do, great people life balance This is a great job to start out with and grow with. Lots of potential. Not always the greatest pay."
good,"Quick Pace, Always have something to do. Being short staffed is normal but the managers are always there to help. Customers are nice and easy to deal with. The most enjoyable part is the people we work with, everyone is helpful and kind."
good,I loved working for rite aid. I was the for over 2.5 years.I loved all but one of my managers (who was fired after a month). Nice customers. Little stress. Great coworkers.
good,"My typical day at a Rite Aid usually very productive as a cashier as there is constant flow of customers, when there is no customers to handle we usually are doing a variety of other things such as cleaning and organizing the merchandise."
good,"I love my job.  Love the people I work with and interact with.  Hours are great, you just get odd days off.  Maybe two consecutive or one at the beginning of the week and one at the end.  So not a whole lot of room to do things.  For the position, the pay is ok.  You can't expect $13+.  It's a great place for some supervisory experience.  Not a really good place to grow and move up.  You have to be there for several years or really dedicate yourself to the job.  Just a stepping stone for most people.  Great job for those in school or for someone who really wants to work hard at growing with the company."
good,"I worked in busier store than most, we filled up to 3000 scripts a week with skeleton staffing. We had a high turn over rate because of the clientele. Since I worked in Ohio there was a large pharmaceutical drug epidemic paired with illegal drugs. I lived in a town with intersecting high ways for the flow of traffic was hard to stop and catch anyone doing illegal activity. My co-workers were amazing and so was management but I do feel pharmacy workers should be paid more. Especially for having to do continuing education and the high stress of the job."
good,"This company has a local niche, as a health product provider with a fifty year history of service to neighborhoods across the U.S., with capable staff, good training, and room for advancement. I recommend this company for those seeking work in this field."
good,Wonderful manager and staff to work with.  The manager is very flexible with the scheduling and is will to work around your life schedule. i.e. appointments and meeting.
good,"My day started with opening the store getting the deposit ready and all the drawers out,Running the front and the pharmacy when needed,I learned to do a lot of these at one time,the hardest part was trying people away who had no insurance,The most enjoyed part was meeting people and helping them."
good,Long time since ive worked there but it had poor management.  They needed certain process in place to ensure a routine.  They had great people that worked for the company but lacked leadership skills.
good,"It is a great place to work, flexible hours and a great team to work with. Its a little fast-paced but its all work it. The management is  little questionable."
good,"Job structure is ok. Depends on who they place you with for training in the beginning. District office will work out ANY problem for you that you may incounter. Workplace culture was beginning to change around the time I was getting ready to depart. I do believe the way that they were handling the transition onto the new direction, with helps from the good people of the Disney Institue, was the right one and perfect timing. However, I can only say that their plan for that type of enviroment must be watched over and revisisted atleast twice a year for best practice to become the NEW normal."
good,"I worked for Rite Aid for a few years, and I was treated well.  I received a promotion from Cashier to Assistant Manager in 3 months.   I learned how to do new things like inventory and managing employees."
good,"It is a good company, but it has some problems when it comes to keep the team members. not enough staff and payroll is not according to the sales so it sometimes affect the number of team members working at the store."
good,"The many strategies i learned to do the work made everything almost effortless,after learning what to do n what not to do. I learned how to handle customers,fellow employees and management District managers n above are easily contacted. everyone works together nice teamwork. That management politics can be bad sometimes: if you aren't careful you will be used as a pawn in a battle between managers. otherwise its wonderful few bad customers here n there , few bold thieves to look out for. Keep sharp!! Be polite, don't be shy."
good,"Rite Aid is a great place to work. The people that I worked with in the Fields System Support department as well as those I worked with in the Training and Development department were very good co-workers.  My job was down-sized in November 2010. Throughout my Rite Aid career, I had a great relationship with management."
good,great learning good people hard work long hours lots of over time on your feet for long hours fast paced routine in everything you do turn over is really high for the company
good,10 to 11 hours on your feet is hard. But other associates and management make it a fun place to work. MOST associates are willing to lend a hand whenever possible.
good,The job was rewarding. I was able to help people and made sure they left with the help they were looking for. Every day was a different day and I loved the people that came in.
good,Job requirements and work load does not reflect pay rate very well. Minimum wage should start atleast $8.50 and hr. It's many hours of work for low pay. Also serious security should be mandatory for 3rd shift since that shift is most riskful. Other then that the work is good if you enjoy a fast paced enviroment and positive customer service relationship.
good,Working at rite aid was one of the best jobs until i got a new manager who for what ever reason didn't like me which i didn't understand i did my job.
good,Rite aid is a great place to work rite aid give u proper training and give u the opportunity to grow with the company rite provides great customer service
good,"I was always kept busy doing our daily work depending on what day it was. I was hired as an Assistant Manager but was quickly promoted to Store Manager before I got done my training. When I became pregnant with my twins, I demoted myself. One of the most enjoyable part of my job was working with the public."
good,The room for to advance within the company was unfortunately small and the position higher than my own wouldn't be available for another 5+years and I wasn't willing to put 5+ years into a position that I wan't even guaranteed to advance into as there were other employees in my same position that had stayed there for almost 20 years and had no hope to advance. Some of the management hires were also not thought out well and would often result in a termination with around a one year time frame. But the people I worked often were very helpful and good to work with. The people were the reason I stayed so long with them. They had great medical and retirement benefits options as well.
good,this job is always busy never a dull moment. I enjoyed working on the dock. But they seem to realize is  that you have a life out side of work. Mandatory 16 hr shifts was hard.
good,"Stores run on skeleton crews.  There are not enough hours given for the tasks assigned, but we are provided with the tools necessary to make us way more efficient than our competitors.  Upper management is great and most of the time, listens to what you have to say.  They will give you what you need, as long as it's reasonable."
good,"I had this job right out of high school. I made great money, moved around in different positions, worked with some amazing people. I honestly don't really have any complaints."
good,"All work places vary with the area you live in and in this kind of work, it requires one to be a strong individual. Some patients may like you more than others, some may be difficult, but that is the way most jobs go in the healthcare industry. Different places have a different system, so some days are busier than others and some parts of the day are busier than, let's say, the nights. Most management makes it easy for new workers to adjust."
good,"A good job to have, the management for the most part was pretty relaxed and good people to carry on conversations with. Alot of them will complement you when you do a good job."
good,"Very nice fun atmosphere, although that depends on store manager. Reasonable hours for retail. Great customers, very loyal to the brand. Team work makes the time go by quite smoothly."
good,"Rite aid offers an easy and rewarding work experience, They do not pay enough to attract the kind of talent you might like to see, but the work environment is not very stressful."
good,"It's a good company to work for regarding field work but somewhat stressful and difficult but depending on your stamina, it's all good. A lot of driving, 250 to 300 miles per week in a fleet vehicle."
good,I worked with an excellent store manager by the name of Mike Barber who showed me the ropes. He was a outstanding mentor and a great person to work for.
good,"It was a great company. I loved the people I worked with, however working as a traveling technician just took too much out of my family. If I could have stayed at my Roseburg Pharmacy full time I would still be working there."
good,"I enjoy being a manager at Rite Aid but with the pending Walgreens merger, moving into a Human Resource Manager position decreases my job stability within the company.  I would really like to utilize the skills and knowledge I've gained from getting my degree and believe there is something out there waiting for me to apply it to!"
good,The day go start off very fast and be under the pressure of the work load. Eventually it cools down giving the opportunity to catch up on unfinished work. Then start right back up. Always something to. I've learn how to handle each customer that walk throw the door in a professional manner. Each manager was different and had their own unique work style which sometimes counter other manager work style. Which was the hardest part of the job. Not many people was on the same page. Another factor would be the overwhelming amount of customer. Multi tasking was the key factor and hardest part. Over i enjoy the environment it keep me active.
good,Safety number 1 goal. Need to stay until the necessary work is completed. Sometimes the hours can be 11+ a day. Learned how to run a warehouse from operation manager to selector. Have had associates from all over the world working for me. Have met many people over the years I call friends.
good,"I ran cash register and order merchandise. I like the people I worked with, they made it enjoyable. The hardest part was trying to get work done after other employees left and you were there by yourself trying to get work done and run back and forth to register."
good,"Nice company to grow with. I enjoy working with this company. Many friendly employees, and customers. I also enjoy the working enviroment. It will always be a solid company to work for."
good,i love rite aid is a good place to start but i rather have something better.I don't really like the fact that it goes by seniority and I'm always put last since I am the last employee i get nothing I rarely get vacations i close 3pm to 11:30pm for the past 5 years and I never get holidays off so that's the reason I am moving on.
good,"Working at Rite Aid requires an individual to be a hard worker, that is capable of meeting the needs and demands of customers. The workplace environment is bus on a daily basis, with customers entering the store for materials they require for use. Working at Rite Aid provides and interactive experience with the customers, as employees make conversations when completing transactions and inquiries. Working at Rite Aid is a great opportunity for individuals who are looking to enter the workforce."
good,Manage a pharmacist and several techs in providing high standard care to patients. Communicating corporate values and expectations in order to improve profit margins and clinical care.
good,"I really enjoyed working here and really enjoyed management. My only problem was that the pay was very low but I was going to school full-time and did not get many hours as well. The hardest part of the job was getting certified, but I also enjoyed that because I was able to learn and still have knowledge about medication to this day."
good,"Overall this was a great experience for me! I had a unique opportunity to actually take a new program such as the Beauty Advisor initiative and make it my own, I traveled with the company and trained all the new Beauty Advisors. The hardest part of this job was trying to expand it beyond it's caged limits."
good,"The management was good.  When they came to visit, they were respectful and were there to help you do better.  There was never a feeling of a threat on your job if you don't get this number up, etc.  They usually gave you tips on what to do.  Management was understanding of you had personal issues and were there to help."
good,a typical day at rite aid is very stress full!  I learned a great deal by being thrown to the wolfs and basically never trained on anything just being told to make it work. Management is impersonal. Best part of this job by far was the relationship I built with the customers.
good,"A typical day for me at Rite Aid would be busy starting from opening to close. Having everything a customer needs makes it a busy day for us. I learned my customer service skills from here, especially with working with a diverse group of employees/managers and having a diverse group of customers/clients. "
good,"Dealing with customers was the highlight of the job.  With Rite-Aid in financial problems, we were expected to do more with less.  Then after the buy-out from Walgreen it became a cutthroat environment. Many great employees were forced out.  Overall, it was a great place to work."
good,with the proper management working here is fun. its like a second  family. its rewarding when customers come looking just for you. That's make you feel you are  doing an  amazing job with your customers
good,"Enjoyed meeting new people, the work environment was always a good environment. I learned a lot about team work and leadership."
good,"for a teenager starting out it was a good job, I didn't mind getting on my feet and taking responsibility. I used the money to put myself in cna school."
good,"A typical day of work would be traveling to store location, visiting with employees, walking the store to review security opportunities. Educating and training associates. I would typically review shrink reports as well as cash refunds, etc, pull paperwork while visiting the store and look for opportunities to train associates on areas needed for each specific person. Audit, conduct safety walks etc"
good,"Flexible work hours, attentive staff, and a warm environment all around for any worker, this is the place for you! You learn good cashier skills, stocking, attending pharmaceutical needs to the customers, and all around are very friendly people."
good,"Enjoy working for Rite Aid. With a pending merger with Walgreens, staff hours have been decreased.   "
good,"a typical work day starts off busy, but not to the point where its overwhelming. Around 4-6pm it gets busy because everyone is getting off of work. My co-workers are amazing. We all Get along and we actually like each other. Plus everyone helps and supports one another. I started as a cashier and now I'm a pharmacy technician, so I've learned a lot."
good,"This is a decent job for when you're in High school or college. They work with your hours, and the job itself isn't too demanding. It is a nice environment."
good,It is like a family. Staff works together.Manager position is hourly so you don't have to work more than 48 hours. a good position to help get healthy
good,"The boss was incredible. I have a college degree, so being a sales associated wasn't a great position once a graduated. For entry level it was great to be there."
good,"Growth opportunities for regular associates are great, benefits are great. However once in the assistant manager position it is hard to get out of."
good,"Rite Aid has been a great place to work for the last 10 years, but the long hours, weekends, and holidays have created a big road block in enjoying a personal life outside of work. the job expects too much of its management teams with little assistance."
good,"my first month at the Langhorne Rite Aid Warehouse was the best experience i have had for any job i have worked for. you start off the day at 11 pm and you meet with your co-workers, which were pretty much friends. then the huddle for a half hour, talk about the numbers we hit and the numbers we need to hit.  then its first break. have a snack and talk to co-workers. then back to work. i loved it so much"
good,It is very fast paced with plenty of opportunities of overtime. Their is a large variety of cultures that get along well. Management is quick to communicate and keep everyone informed and up to date as to the projected end time. They strive to keep a safe and healthy work environment for everyone and ensure everyone knows safety procedures.
good,"Excellent place to work with tremendous benefits not only financially but in regards to healthcare and retirement. Great working environment, although it is currently doing a lot of changing. Focused on providing a caring moment for the customer and people in the community."
good,"If you care about patients and genuinely like helping people this job will keep you busy. A majority of the work is all about being a team player, everyone on the team has a role to play. Weak links will make the job harder, communication is key."
good,Tipical day at work is just clocking in and helping the immediate customers with any questions they might have or helping to cashier. I enjoy working with people
good,"Good management.  Team environment. As a corporate building, there are opportunities for advancement, but it's difficult to advance outside of the department you begin in.  Ergo, there's a combination of personal skills and good fortune needed to actually be promoted."
good,"This job had a drive thru, pharmacy is very busy. Most enjoyable part is knowing the work queue is clear and you can then take it easy."
good,"Depending on what your job is it could be very easy or very hard. If you're the cashier then all you have to do is stay at the register and help customers. If you have stock duties then you have to serve, fill, and clean ice cream , sweep and mop the whole store, face the coolers and throw away trash all while helping the cashier with purchases. If you are the straightener you go around the store making sure all the display look nice and help with the register if it gets busy."
good,I didn't mind working there it was an easy job but was boring. The management that I've had through the year that I've worked so far was very well. I had a good time and liked the people I worked with but was planning to get a bigger and better job.
good,I left due to growth but I would go back if I had an opportunity. I left for more advancement but the grass isn't always green on the other side .This company is a great place to work.

good,"I love my job at rite-aid it is very fun and easy job. I have been working there for about a month and a half now and when I first started there they welcomed me right in and I have been working there ever since. My typical day at work is making customers as happy as possible. I have learned a lot working at this job, my alcohols, cigarettes because that's mostly all the customers come in for. The management is really good I love all my managers and they all treat me with so much respect. My co-workers are ok they all are older than me I am the youngest out of all of them, but I talk too them and they help me out when I need help. The hardest part of my job is selling people alcohol because I'm really not a drinker. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing all the happy and friendly customers that walk in and out of the store."
good,the co-workers are awesome to work with other than one. a typical day is busy but sometimes you don't get everything done due to customers coming in and needing to be rung up.
good,"I had a good experience working here for a good month, the starting pay was really low so i had to change work. but overall a good and nice environment to work at for startes."

good,"staff are very friend and also well organized."
good,"Rite aid  was a great place to start have if you don't have experience. The co-workers are nice, for example, if you are in need of someone to take your shift, someone would be more than happy to do it."
good,"The most caring team I've ever worked with. People here are great, but communication isn't always on point. Overall its a nice environment."
good,Day consists of a basic routine of maintaining cleanliness and order within the store. What I've learned while working here is better time management skills. Co-workers are easy to work with and easy to talk to. Management is adequate.
good,A typical day at work consisted of coming in to try and get my work done but never having an available workstation to use. What I learned from this job was how to fill prescriptions and understanding how to bill insurances. The most enjoyable part of the job was going out into the community and spending time at senior centers.
good,Rite Aid was a very stressful work environment but I taught me how to become a true manager and that you have to work and get along with all typed of people and employees if you want to become successful.
good,"I enjoyed my years working for Rite Aid Pharmacy.I loved goofing around while we got our work done,and we had fun with our jobs and our customers.The hardest part of the job was unloading our delivery truck and trying to get it all put out on the shelves in one day."
good,"I enjoy the Customers, my co-workers, my productive job, helping people, dispensing, inputting and completing the work task"
good,"I went to work and did what was expected of me. Overall anyone can do this, if you need a paycheck. The managers of the pharmacy where I worked were the best and treated everyone equally and that is rare."
good,Working part-time kept the days fairly short and my schedule very flexible.  A great way of learning how to speak to customers and overall a strong introduction to the workforce.
good,Upper management has been shuffled around quite a bit lately (partly because company was sold to Walgreens) making for an inconsistent message and focus
good,Fun and productive work place. the chances of advancing you to a higher position such as manager or shift manager are very high if you are a good worker.
good,"New hardware which keeps you up to date with technology. Fun Place to work.. good balanced life/work culture.."
good,"•	A typical day at work was learning new skills everyday"
good,I floated from store to store. Depending on the store it could make or break the work experience. As a whole the company is pretty good to work for. It has the same problems that any large chain pharmacy company has. It has the best computer system for filling prescriptions that I think i have ever worked with.
good,Fun place to work at with positive management. Willing to work with you on scheduling. Good variety of work. The most enjoyable part of the job is working along side employees and learning with them.
good,"Once again this is a job that was a favorite . As a Pharmacy Tech it was busy from the moment I walked into work, until the moment I clocked out. I only had  other co-workers which was an easy thing for me. This job was fairly easy. Another office setting type of environment where I get to use my knowledge of computers. Having a great attitude also helped at this job, for sometimes people that came in weren't feeling to well and a smile can help pick up someone elses."
good,"A very fast-paced work environment that requires you to be able to multi-task.  This company provides great Benefits (medical, dental, pharmacy, and life) to all full-time and salaried employees.  Working in retail has taught me to expect the unexpected and not assume anything."
good,If you enjoy having an impact on the store and how it runs then work for Rite Aid. Your typical day will consist of maintaining the store and customer service.
good,"Challenging work place with supportive management.Enjoyable work environment and most of all working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. I have learned to multi task in ways that I didn't think I could,multi tasking has became one of my top strengths.The hardest part about the job is not be able to see every patient be able to afford there medication(s). The pharmacy is one of the busy departments in the company.I truly love working as a Pharmacy Technician and look forward to furthering my career.I enjoy working in the pharmacy caring for people and brightening peoples day."
good,The job was demanding and there was always something to do to keep me busy. The customers were eclectic. Sometimes the manager who relieved me would not show up on overnights. It was 24 hours and I would have to stay for a 16 hour shift.
good,"I enjoyed working at Rite Aid. I enjoyed the flexibility of my hours with my schooling, and the team I worked with. I also enjoyed the responsibility I was given, and it made it seem like I was working toward something. I received all the training I needed for any task I was given, and everyone received credit where it was due."
good,I liked my roll in Rite Aid Pharmacy as a Pharmacy Technician. I felt very successful and useful in my job there. Always a good place to be.
good,"My typical day was running register, customer service, cleaning the front area, working the photo machine, and started training for management."
good,"Rite Aid is just like any other retail job; demanding with demanding customers."
good,"I loved working here and everyone I worked with.  Benefits are good, but pay isn't great.  I worked in pharmacies in several locations and nearly everyone was very friendly and skilled at their jobs."
good,"On a typical day at work it would mostly be the same duties, but have certain tasks added each day. I learned to work with speed and multi-task better now that I work in the field i want now. The Head manager could have her days working there, but all its supervisors are very friendly and helpful. The hardest part here would be able to focus on multi-tasking with different customers at a time. The most enjoyable part is getting to know new people and being familiar with your duties so its easier to work. This job was a part time job to pass through during college and it was a fun to do."

good,Good place to work to start out in health care. Can learn a lot and can get promoted rather quickly. I enjoy working here. Would recommend this company.
good,"Management is awesome, Co-workers are like friends instead of just simply work mates, and they all strive to help each other. Hardest part of the job was stocking items, which in relativity to other jobs was a walk in the park. Most enjoyable part of the job was pleasing the customer and genuinely caring for each and every person who walked through the door."
good,"Do whatever needs to be done. Stocking shelves, register, sweeping up, ensure freshness of food products, removing and putting up sale tags, assisting customers, etc. Learned important customer service techniques, merchandising strategies, and store etiquette. Management there has always been very good to me. Most co-workers were very relaxed and friendly but some were irresponsible and careless. Some of the customers were difficult to deal with. I enjoyed talking to and helping people there"
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working at Rite Aid.  My fellow managers were great people, as were my other co-workers.  We worked well together and successfully accomplished each day's tasks.  The most enjoyable part of the job, was being able to help customers and or find solutions to any problems they might have."
good,"Fun co-workers but minimal pay for work required. Constantly ""improving"" but improvements only target larger stores and leave smaller ones in a more difficult spot."
good,Great job for people just starting out in the workforce coming out of high school or in my case the military. Only bad thing is bad job security.
good,"Day was entirely planned out, never had to ask questions."
good,"•	Duties included scanning items, processing payments, applying coupons, providing change, and issuing receipts providing product knowledge, answering customer inquiries, and handling customer complaints. "
good,"Allways busy, learned a lot and had help if needed. enjoyed the work and the freedom to go into all the different work areas."
good,"I enjoy my time at Rite Aid. It has taught me a lot of customer service skills. My only problem is that there are very little full time jobs available within the company, and my hours are very infrequent, which can make paying bills at the end of the month stressful. My co workers and boss are fun to work with."
good,A typical day was running the regitster.  Stocking the asiles with product.  Cleaning.  I learned how not to take what people say to heart. Management was great.  Couldn't ask for better people.  The hardest part of the day would be truck day.  having to.  put up all the products. The most enjoyable part of the this job was the costumes. Just seeing them every day. You would start to feel like part of their family.  So sweet and nice. The best job ever.
good,"Good environment, pay is ok flexible, the atmosphere is great not a lot of opportunity for advancement and you have to set your guidelines as soon as you are hired."
good,"Was only there for the two major stock days. Stocked shelves and made sure all of the product on the floor was immaculate, I also helped customers find product they wanted. Management was friendly and nice and they resolved problems immediately. I loved my co-workers and that job because they were nice and it was easy."
good,"Districts were appx 25 stores and very active.  Had support team of Pharmacy DM, Asset Protection DM and HR DM for every 4 districts.  Also had an Admin."
good,It was a mix of blister packing for nursing home and regular retail pharmacy.  Of all my years in pharmacy this was my favorite store till they closed the location for lack of profit.  The front store and pharmacy operated like a huge family.  We all got along well together spent time together outside of work as friends and laughed and enjoyed working together.
good,"I would spend most days working the register and assisting customers. When the store was empty, I would restock some of the shelves around the main area. Other days, I would be required to help in the storage room and put away products to the right aisles, which I actually enjoyed. Management could be strict at times, but they were also nice and friendly at other times as well. My co-workers were nice and we got along well. The job was not hard, the only thing that may have been difficult was when the store was crowded and I was the only one present at the registers. My favorite part of the job was putting away the products and organizing the shelves."
good,"Rite aid can give you experience with working with people, learn lower management skills. Earn some money to help your family out."
good,"Working here is boring, but it is still a job. The location i worked at in Pittsfield had a wonderful manager that made the days go by faster. Overall it is a job, but opportunity for advancement is null and void. Unless you want to spend many many years ranking up."
good,"I cashier, do my daily audit, check emails, give change, problem solve any customer needs, price changes and create any signs for upcoming or current ad. I have learned how to make signs, labels, email correspondence, cash handling, superior customer service, manage employees and store, answer customers calls and questions in store. My manager is a great team leader with a great positive attitude. My co-workers are the best and I consider them all like family. The hardest part of my job is not enough coverage, making sure all my tasks are done and lending a hand to my workers that need to help finish. The enjoyable part of my job is the people. I love my community and love the challenge of all aspects of my job."
good,The manager of the North Main Street store is the nicest boss to work with because he treats people with respect.  He is an excellent manager and great person.

good,I worked for the company for three years and enjoyed it. I had trouble getting my raise but once I received it I had no additional complaints.
good,Make a daily tour sheet of what needs to be worked on each day. Assign tasks to each associate. Merchandise daily to make sure that we have no out of stock items. Fill coolers. Take out trash. Each day has assigned work so we follow plan by doing recalls in a timely ma nor and keep up to date with price changes and do planograms and revisions when they come in. Also set ad and end caps and wing racks per plan. Make sure that everyone completes the tasks assigned to them and help with proper trianing of all associates.
good,"I loved the wayne store where I was manager for 15 yrs.When brand new store was built ,closing mine,I was not giving a chance to manage .The dm bully I had let me go.I loved meeting people in my store ,watching kids of cx grow up.This truly was my dream job,until that fateful day.I guess when your dm`s hero is mike ditka,I did not have a chance of suceeding,for he was a bully also.In closing my time with r/a rewarding,but beware to r/a managers who are not part of the good side of this dm"
good,"What I've learned about working for Rite Aid was organizing large crowds, how to stay calm in all situations, and to always learn new challenges everyday."
good,durin of my 12 years experience i learned a lot from my co-workers and supervisor and i enjoyed working in a friendly condition and team working.
good,I loved working at Rite Aid. I worked in the pharmacy and met a lot of people. I did my best to make them happy with their experience at Rite Aid. I was just needing a full time job and they didn't offer it at the time.
good,"Nice place, sometimes got boring but it was a job, good benefits"
good,"A typical day at rite aid is clocking in and going straight to work. assisting customers with taking in their prescription and getting the prescription filled for the current patient correctly, Using complete teamwork to make the current patient experience run as smooth as possible, communicating with the management to keep the informed of  the products and medication that are needed for our area, asking questions about medication and patients that I may not completely comprehend. The hardest part about working at rite aid was when the team didnt work together. The most enjoyable part of my job was assisting our patients with any questions and products that they needed to understand."
good,"This employer has many good points including corporate culture and recognition of employees. The company is currently trying to be competitive with the top 2 companies in the field and is doing well at copying their goals and structure, this is not necessarily a good thing as it puts wage and work pressure directly on the employees and management."
good,"Rite aid is a good company to work for they work with your school schedule. management is great, the hardest part of working there is just when people call off. main duties is customer service and keeping merchandise is stock"
good,"Check people out, re-stock merchandise, help the customers were a daily part of your job. I loved working with my co-workers and managers. Very flexible and understanding."

good,"nice workplace, gained lots of experience and hands on training as a pharmacy technician"
good,management varies from store to store really simple can get boring at times but it is really easy work over all.
good,"As a sales associate I was trained to guide customers in helping them find what products would best meet their needs."
good,The same review  is also appropriate for this rite aid position. The only difference is this store becomes a very high volume store for 3 months a year which requires a lot of preplanning and hiring. I must also buy extra summer merchandise for this store to handle the needs of our customers
good,Working in a small store that has a little bit of everything you always find yourself busy with some sort of work. Days went very fast. customers seemed to be very friendly. The staff was really social and relaxed. Overall a great summer job.
good,"management asked to much for us to do, most of the time we were short handed, the hardest part of the job was dealing with management and being short handed, best part of the job was working with my coworkers."
good,It was a great first job where I cultivated excellent customer service.
good,"Customer service is of most importance to me, I treat every customer as if they were family.I go above and beyond and have been recognized by the company for it. I call insurances to get eligibility status on those who have insurance issues, call Physicians and other personnel that I may have to contact. I love my job as a pharmacy technician but I'm looking forward to growth and change in my life. When I applied to go to school at night, I was fortunate enough to have my employer accommodate the requirements and I was able to attend the Medical Assistant program at Lincoln Tech  . I'm now ready to embark on a new journey in life and hope to have the opportunity with a new employer."
good,"Long days, heard to balance home and work. Overall a good company to work for."
good,There are never enough employees working to get tasks done and provide customer service.
good,"Exciting  "
good,"While working at Rite Aid I was given many opportunities. I worked as a cashier, but was advanced to the Wellness Ambassador position due to excellent customer service skills. As a Wellness Ambassador I was transferred to the pharmacy where I could further expand my knowledge on health and wellness for our customers. I learned a lot about vitamins, over the counter medications, pharmacy operations, and organization while in the pharmacy. The pharmacists were always eager to teach me and the other technicians new things."
good,pretty busy now that we had a pharmacy close down the road from us. everyone i work with is nice and outgoing.
good,the most enjoyable part at my job is the customers and my coworkers it is very busy at times and i like the enviroment
good,My jobs allows me to interact with people daily. Even though i work as a Pharmacy Tech. I find myself on a one on one basis with multiple people. Talking about life and ideals on improvement. Including the fact im always helping people on the phone daily. Eventually people feel as if the Tech is common to them. Till eventually you grow a relationship with the customers. More like a personal Doctor type relationship slash friend. I enjoy this job.
good,"This is a great place to start a career in Costumer Service. You get to engage with costumers and it gives you the skills in costumer service value, relationship building, and communication. It was also a great environment to learn and have fun with co-workers. Every 3 months you get a employee appreciation day and this includes parties. It's a multitask job and can sometimes be fast pace, However, it's simple to learn and almost everything is hands on training. Rite Aid is about team work and team play, so keep that in mind. There is also times where you will be working individually. This is a great place to learn how to handle complaints and costumer needs. Remember, ""All Costumers Are Right"". Big saying here at Rite Aid, and we try to give every costumer the out most best costumer service experience possible. This is also a great place for those who have certain schedule limitations."
good,customer service was fun.  managers were fair and honest.  I run a cash register and was very good at it.  I enjoyed working there
good,"An average day started with writing my daily reports, answer phones and helping coworkers with any issues they may have. I always kept things filed, so that when coworkers asked for a phone number, copy of a policy, a license, personnel file, or anything else they would need assistance with, I could always find immediately. Coworkers were easy to get along with in what I would consider to be an ""average office environment"". The most difficult part of the job was filling pharmacy ""holes"". When we were short staffed, especially around the holidays, people would often request off and I would not only have to fill holes in my schedule, but I always helped other districts fill theirs as well. The most enjoyable part of my was helping my DM, PDM or Associates. It always felt great having people come to me for things because they knew it would be done right the fist time and in a timely fashion."
good,"I had an excellent ,understanding mgr,met alot of nice customers,the only drawback is that we were all women employees and haad to unload all of our own freight weekly and stock,which took away from the registers alot,and was physically a lil more demanding then the 25 weight limit when hired"
good,i loved the job and crew and management. it just could not benefit me in the way i needed it to. i learned inventory which is includes managing the whole store and keeping it professional. the hardest part of the job was keeping your business personal. The most enjoyable part was working with my co workers and having a uplifted spirit while working.
good,Days can be long if store volume is low. Depending on locations customers can be bad or good.
good,What I like the most about this job is that you learn something new everyday. You get to fill prescriptions and interact with customer.
good,"A typical work day starts at 7 am, and ends anywhere from 3:30 pm and 8 pm. The co-workers are helpful and nice. The hardest part of the job is the fluctuating hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to dress how I wan't, it makes for a more comfortable work environment.  "
good,was able to learn alot under a direct guidance of a licensed Pharmacist. 
good,Liked working for this company. Typical working day would be to stack cases on pallet in the shipping department. Wrap and tag pallets. Load onto trailers. Got to learn new areas of warehouse by transfering to shipping. Management was friendly and always helpful along with the co workers who helped out quite a bit. The hardest part of the job was staying caught up in your shipping lanes and when you were not busy you were helping other co workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was my work schedule.
good,It's a company that is great to start out as but I could never see it being a career choice.
good,"A typical day at work was filling prescriptions, calling patients, doctors, or insurance companies, cashier duties, and other responsibilities designated by the pharmacist on duty. This position is doesn't lead to advancement unless pharmacy school is an option. the hardest part of the job is working with angry customers in urban neighborhoods who curse and threaten employees, while the most enjoyable part of the job is saving the patients money, helping them to understand their condition and get better and being able to answer their questions over the phone and in person."
good,"staff are friendly, work days are enjoyable. customers are always happy with service received."
good,Also have worked for S.L.School Dist. for 12.5 Years as aide and will do so part time in fall.

good,"Not a bad place to work but the pay isnt great."
good,"The stores are great. The customers are fantastic. Everyone works well together as a team; however, upper-level management is atrocious. "
good,"A typical day at work is usual busy, especially during the night or in the summer when we would get out of towners, or a special event is in town. Over the past years I'v learned how to be better with customer assistance. The hardest part of the job is making sure we get everything on the sales floor on time when there's truck, but we get it done. The most enjoyable part of the job is some of the customers, and how they would make me laugh. My co-workers are pleasant and easy to get along with, they treat you like family."
good,Let me do what was necessay to increase Rx volume so the store could get to a positive EBITA

I would sign in and check the prescription section for the medication to be filled, start pulling those out from shelves, enter data, print the labels and extend the tray to pharmacist. I had to be fairly quick as the new prescriptions would keep coming. I also had to ring up the customers in the middle and take calls.

good,I loved working with the team we had everything wasn't perfect with the company but overall I was satisfied with my job it was almost like a death in your family when you lose your job
good,"As a shift supervisor I trained new employees and handled customer or employee mistakes if the assistant manager or store manager were not available. I counted the money in the safe at the end of the night and reconciled the register drawers to make note of any shortages or if any at all. I took deposits to the bank and to collect rolls of change that we would need for the cashiers and or to stock up the safe for extra on hand. I stocked product, ordered product, and worked overnights to help when the pallets of ordered product was delivered. the hardest part was trying to handle many things or issues all happening at once but I learned to do one thing at a time efficiently and tell the customer or employee I will be right with them. I enjoyed training the most about the job because I loved to watch people grow from being apprehensive and nervous and then being confident and able to focus more on their customer service by things becoming second nature to them."

The management in my department was great to work with.  Always willing to help.  Being an admin my days were not always structured with the same routine.

good,"Great place for any young adult looking for their first real job. Lovely, caring staff that understand the importance of a work/life balance. The hardest part about the job would just have to be working well under pressure, especially during rush-hour or the holiday season. Being able to handle multiple tasks at hand and knowing how to prioritize. It's a great place to build work etiquette and responsibilities as well as learn how to form real relationships with your customers."

good,"Rite Aid is a workplace filled with challenges that can be easily overcome with the right attitude and a basic knowledge of the ""Rite Aid Experience."" You get your regulars and if they aren't regulars, they are overall nice people that walk in and want their medication, grocery items, cigarettes, etc. You do get a few bad apples here and there, but as long as you have a manager on hand to help you along the way, everything will be alright."

good,Rite aid was a great job to have room for growth.i had many job promotion based on my productivity  .it also gives great health insurance. Dental vision & etc
good,I believe Rite Aid should shut down the stores for days like Thanksgiving and Christmas. The company should also give the stores more hours for employees.

I worked my way to a management position and learned how to manage. Always room for overtime, hardest part was sometimes having to do more than you want to or dealing with people."
good,"Always demanding more and more especially around flu season. Pay sucks at the beginning but max out pay isn't bad which right now is 5 years. Union job which means pension when you finally retire, 15 minute breaks and 1 hour lunches. 401k offered but no matching unless you are a pharmacist. Job is usually only part time. Minimum 24 hours given after 6 months. Love that you can float to other Rite Aids to pick up hours if needed."
good,"*Love to Work Full Day"
good,"A typical day at work involves engaging with customers, and driving sales. I learned so much about retail management, inventory, and budgeting. Management was very friendly we saw our regional heads often, they cared about the stores. Work place culture very laid back no hih stress levels except for around the holidays. The hardest part of the job was showing up at 4 am to unload new shipments, ans stock shelves before the start of the day which was 8 am.

good,"I worked with the same core group of people for 19 years.  We managed many problems together including inventory cuts, MTM and were able to get compliance with many patients that had problems.  Management was great because District Offices were located in the back of my store so if we had any problems we were able to get resolution on them.  We had a great district manager that was always helpful.  The hardest part of the job as far as I am concerned was seeing patient who really couldn't afford their medication and trying to help them get help wether is was a discount card or in some cases help from the drug manufactures themselves.  I learned compassion and teamwork over my many years with RiteAid."
good,It was a rotation so I was just there for a few weeks. It was a nice place to work and is what you usually get from a retail setting. Nice collaborative team.

good,"Rite Aid provided me the ability to have all on the job and classroom training I needed to learn how to process prescriptions, print labels, dispense medication, order supplies, and deal with insurance companies. A typical day for me is entering prescriptions,printing labels, ordering supplies, dispensing medication, but most of all providing excellent customer service to our patients. The pharmacy manager is the type of person who lets you do what ever you want as long as the job gets done. The best part of the job is knowing that I will have fun while doing my job. The people are the best that I've ever worked with. The hardest part of the job is working at the drive through."
good,"Good job, store close purchased by Walgreens. Rite Aid stores will remain open on the west coast. They try hard to help each associate whenever possible."
good,this was my first job i was in high school at the time so it was a great way to make money as a young teen just getting to jump start his retail career

good,The management and staff were and helpful. The work environment was fun. Everyone helped each other. I worked daily with the customers. The store manager always had something nice to say to every person on staff. I would say the hardest part of the job was trying to unload truck and stock the isles while also tending to the customers.

good,Managerial staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. Store was clean and employees took pride in their work. I enjoyed my time with this company and would recommend them to family and friends.

good,was a great place to work. would recommend to any one. they need to pay more foe the hours and everything you do. they need d=faster people the amount of script they do.
good,"Working as a Pharmacy Technician was tedious but fun. First, every Pharmacy is run differently. But in all pharmacies, you have to check the label, check the pills, and check the patient. along with having ALL information, name date of birth, doctor signature. then is it a narcotic? does it have NPI and DEA? is it spelled correctly? when was the last time they had a narcotic? Does any of the known medication they are currently taking conflict with this one. is the insurance verified? Don't forget ID and phone number. Has that doctor been flagged? all good now type it correctly, make sure the NDC matches. if not, change it so we can track it. count pills twice, count bottle pills. pass to the pharmacist and when its back makes sure to put it up and help the person at the register and or drive-thru. "

good,"Excellent pharmacists"
good,"Pharmacy during week days is very busy but during the weekends is fine but can also gets very busy towards the end of the day. We usually do a lot of prescriptions which is the hardest part of the day because it gets super busy. The best part of the day is talking with your patients, interacting with them, seeing how they're health is doing. Also my pharmacist make my day because they are very nice and I learn so much from them for instance how to fold a paper to be safe and not violate HIPPA rules. My pharmacists also make sure that they are treating every technician fairly. I am good at managing my time and really getting everything done in the pharmacy before leaving which is the most important thing for me."
good,rough hours but  you get to work uninterupted with very ittle interaction with management or customers. you have oppurtunity of growth within the company.

good,the rite Aid I worked in was a very busy and fast paced store. We had very good and well trained employees. everyone worked well together to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the amount of prescriptions to fill. You had to stay very focused.
good,great place to work and start out as a technician. Opportunities for advancement are slim but available. not the best pay but a good company to start out with
good,Would recommend. Good work environment and nice coworkers. Flexible hours with nice managers who are reasonable enough to schedule you accordingly if you need.
good,"Rite Aid is a great place to work if you're management. Great salary and benefits but not enough technician help so as a pharmacist, you spend a lot of your time doing the work that could be delegated to someone else."
good,"The Rite Aid I worked for had a feel of being a mom and pop pharmacy. The pharmacist knew a lot of the customers, and there were many returning customers. The team work was on point and the store manager made the environment very relaxing. "
good,"We all get along with each other we do what's told with No problem."
good,"going in to work and clocking in, then starting to work. I would go in clock in and then start my job as to customer service. I would use the cash register and scanning items."

I have learned a lot about running the store while my manager is on vacation or on other leave. I love working with the public and helping customers. Love it when they leave happy and come back on a regular basis."
good,I learned a great deal as an associate for Rite Aid.  The advancement opportunities were limited and I needed a change.  Our team was responsible for supporting store technical operations at many levels and that was a great learning opportunity.
good,great manager help me.learn what I need to move up in the company...I learn more each day to help me run my on store one day There is diffently room for move ment with in this company
good,"The building I worked in had a great management staff. Everyone was friendly, got along well and respected each other. Management held people accountable but was fair, morale seemed positive and the working environment was very neutral for the most part."
good,"Rite Aid gives you every chance to run your store on your own. As with any company , there are labor restrictions and in smaller volume stores, your role as manager has you wearing many more hats and that can take a toll. Compensation is on par with industry, but work/life balance is tough. I found that was the toughest part for me was feeling like I was in charge but had little to no time at home."
good,A typical day at work will be organizing the workload so that the work flow is in priority of importance for that  day.
good,"I learned quite a bit about medications.  There were classes offered to become a pharmacy tech.  Although, this was only good for working at Rite Aid."

good,"My job as a store manager was stressful at times, but overall it is a  good company to work for.  Upper management can be a pain at times, but they are just following orders.  I stepped down to Shift Supervisor to go back to college.  I would work as a Store Manger again if an opening came open."
good,"Working at rite aid was not bad, sometimes was very busy. However, it was a great place to work and a great environment. I would recommend to a friend to work for this company."
good,"great place to work"
good,Friendly environment with Friendier Customer at most time. Decent Benefits with ok pay with a somewhat flexible hour to work if you have school and another job.
good,"Nice to work for, always a clean place just not enough pay for the amount of work they want them to do. After a year of work you get paid time off and sick days ."
good,"Rite aid has a strong focus on customer service and Rx sales. If you would like a foot in the door for retail management and/ or Rx retail, I would strongly suggest Rite Aid. They have recently remodeled their stores and look great!"
good,I worked at Rite aid very early in my career and don't remember much about it. I know that I liked everyone that I worked with. I liked what I did and loved helping people.
good,I love working for Rite aid  because that was my first job after college. i got a lot of experince from rite aid because that was first job. I learn a lot from Rite Aid
good,"I moved up quickly. Met a lot of new and friendly people, other management was always willing to lend a helping hand. On hand training was usually available if you needed."
good,one of my first jobs.  loved the manager and co-workers as well as enjoyed the work.  learning experience and was well trained for future jobs I took later in life.
good,"The manage is really nice and overall good place to work for past time. However, the pay is not good at all. This is good for a student, but I do not believe it is enough to support a family."
good,"The technology was advanced.  The hours were great.  It was Union, when I worked there.  The staff had plenty of hours,  Management was supportive,  Life was good."
good,I enjoyed working at riteaid. i was there for about a year. had no issues. good work culture. everyone works as a team. i had to leave the company as I moved to a new state.
good,"I worked with this company about 7 years ago. It was a short employment because I had found something better however, the the working environment was pleasing and the staff was very collaborative."
good,I worked nights So I usually went to work around 9 or 10 and got off around 4 or 5 The pay was competitive.  We receive regular raises but topped out after 3 years
good,"Rite Aid is very well structured at the corporate level and places great managers in charge. Very fast-paced, can be stressful at times, but always stresses efficiency."
good,Rite aid was dun. Always something new to learn. The staff amd co workers were fun to work with. And as far has benefits and pay they were pretty fair
good,"My responsibilities included opening and closing the store, inventory management ,merchandising and promotional activities  I especially enjoyed the bookkeeping aspect of the business. I learned that good customer service is critical for a thriving business. The hardest part of the job was making the worst employee into the best. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the worst employee into the best. A successful workplace culture is one of caring and teamwork.  I learned to be patient and compassionate with the employees while setting and enforcing strict guidelines as well."
good,No two days were ever alike. If I was in the pharmacy it was fast paced most of the time. When working up front it was a little slower but there was always something to keep you busy. The other employees where easy to get along with and the manager was just a super nice man. The worst part about the job was that I had to move out of state and there was no Rite Aid close to where I was moving. The day we loaded the moving truck my manager brought over lunch for everyone that was helping. Such a nice jester.
good,It's a great job but sometimes the hours change but overall it's easy work but you do have multiple lines to pick your food from I love the breakfast.
good,IM A  peoples person so this job was a good experience for me. i delt with all types of people. i was always very patient and helped out alot in many situations. I will just say the customer always left the store in good spirits
good,"I liked working for Rite Aid.  I enjoyed the computer system and co-workers.  I liked the area my store was in and the trust my customers placed in me.  I was in a fairly busy store and was mostly supported well.  I  was able to organize my day and work with my team of technicians well.  Rite Aid encouraged us to match pricing , deliver and other practices to help with business."
good,a typical day at work is very fast paced and a lot of standing.Must be very knowledgeable in general about the basic material and what you are looking for when accessing the computer system. does come with training on the job but it does take awhile to get the hang of the position when you understand all the rules and regulations.
good,"Overall decent place to work. Good environment, making positive changes to reflect changing needs of business. High expectations, what you put in is what you get out of your experience."
good,"Managed cashiers/staff, did cycle counts, stocked shelves, reconciled cashier tills, worked on planograms.  Fast-paced environment.  Also, assisted District Manager at various store locations."
good,I enjoyed the work Environment and I worked at my own pace which I enjoyed but it helped the bigger production at night and I could see what my daily work was doing for the company.
good,"I have no opinion at this time,  However, If I wish to give my opinion I shall do so when I feel most comfortable in doing so.  Otherwise at this time I wish to remain silent."
good,I have not worked for this company for over 13 years. I do not know how things are run at this time. I did enjoy my work time there and the people I had the pleasure of working with.
good,"•	Ensure smooth work flow and customer satisfaction"
good,Overall great place to work. Everyday expectations are clearly defined. Good working environment with updated stores and pharmacies. Associates are treated fair and consistently an scheduling can be worked around an associates needs.
good,It’s not a bad place to work. The store I was at was sort of like a family. I got along with everyone. The assistant manager was pretty moody but other than her it was fine.
good,Rite aid is a good company. It presents no career advancement and the pay is not worth the job. Nothing is consistant and there is constant change. The senior staff is set in their ways and not open to new ideas.
good,"It was very fast paced, and we also had free delivery services. I really enjoyed my job and co-workers. My co-workers and I worked as a team which the customers enjoyed because they could get their prescriptions in a fast and timely manner."
good,Good place to work for your first job. Would like more of a pay. Hardest part is dealing with rude people. I liked my coworkers. The yearly raises were poor and not worth it getting only 15 cents a raise from 8 dollars.
good,It was a great experience working at Rite Aid. The other employees were very friendly and easy to work with. The manager was patient and helpful. I enjoyed working with the customers and helping people in the store.
good,"My coworkers and manager were amazing. all locations on bus lines good hours, good benefits, good team environment, lots of room for advancement, thumbs up"
good,I enjoyed assisting the customer with product making sure it was stock. Handling any customer complaint making sure all the issues were resolved in timely manner.
good,"I really liked working there and enjoyed a great employment opportunity. However, I moved to Baltimore and no longer worked for Rite Aid. I really liked working for the company and their hours were great."
good,"As a Cashier, attend to the customer, straightened the store, stock product,  scoop ice cream, cleaned ice cream every night, pull all go backs away and count the deposit."
good,always make sure to be ready because if not the manager will always pick on you and try to prepare you. make sure your always on time as well. good luck.
good,"Its a really fast paced job. There was only one cashier there when I worked, so I had to handle every customer on my own. It does make the time go by really fast."
good,This work load was a lot but not too much to handle. I enjoyed the work environment and the employees made all the hard work worth t. They made the time fly by.
good,"Before Rite aid I already have retail experience. I only learn how they operated and their system after a week training I was on my own every shift. it could be relaxed and stressful. overall its not bad place to work. Holiday season is very bad when you have workers or employees call out in the busiers time. if you work too hard you won't go higher position. In my opinion that's part of their culture, New CEO maybe good don't know. Customers are very close to management and employees they are supportive and extremely nice. That's what I enjoyed the most."
good,"Responsible every week for handling truck delivery of products, stocking and facing shelves. Manageable register responsibilities, some employee competitions for the sake of fundraising provided added interest to the day."
good,"It was very fast paced.. Worked in several departments learning how to pick stock and warehouseman.during my tenure as a warehouseman.I learned the in outs of hand loading trailers going out to stores, ran 3 out of 4 sortation platfloms also worked in receiving  driving fork lifts.. All in all it was a good and steady job"
good,"I was able to manage high volume, stressful environment due to my productivity and efficiency in managing work flow. I knew how to prioritize tasks and was able to manage staff efficiently."
good,"Work place generally calm but it does get busy at peak hours. Small and compact but building normally kept in a neat, clean and organized way. Good customer service and most willing to assist if needed."
good,"I've learned how to fill prescriptions,  asst customers with over the counter items,  the most enjoyable was dealing with customers, learning aha ever i could"
good,"The Transportation Department is like a family.  We all respect each other and work well together, despite our differences.  The job can be challenging at times and difficult to complete in the normal 40-hour work week.  A little overtime is required, but not so much that you are overworked or drained at the end of each week."
good,this was one of my first entry-level jobs. and it work while i was in hight school but i needed a new change of pace and better salary when i was accepted to the university of Delaware.
good,"During my time there (7.5 years) I went from a weekend cashier to a Shift Supervisor who was also a Pharmacy Clerk. The pay wasn't the best, but the Health Benefits made up for it."
good,"Rite Aid was solid place to work overall.  The biggest barrier I faced was investing in older / more rural stores to make the shopping experience better for the customer.  All retailers want more payroll for stores, and Rite Aid was no different.  They could have used a little more compensation for the front end part of the business."
good,I worked as a cashier for 6 years and then transferred to the pharmacy for 2 years. The first year was fine. The middle of the 2nd year after family health issues with a parent. I started having problems with the head pharmacist. I finally left Rite Aid. I would have stayed if I could have returned up front to all the ladies I had worked with and got to know for those 6 wonderful years.
good,"Constantly answering phones, working with patients and attending to their needs. Filling medications and processing them. Work with the pharmacist and pharmacy techs. Pharmacist and staff were a pleasure to work with; down to earth and willing to accommodate needs as a worker. Had difficulty learning new tasks; learning was done on the job, consistantly had to ask questions and relearn new information. Learned a lot of the job and well as took computer based training from learning about medications and those purposes to how a community pharmacy runs."
good,very good team management always willing to help when possible employees are well groomed and have excellent manors the hardest part of the job is the drive thru but with patients and perseverance it makes a long day short
good,"We had very busy work days, management was caring, the hardest part of the job was staffing; however, it was a joy working with the staff that was faithful on the daily."
good,"•	Assisted in filling prescriptions"
good,"was a benefits representative for all of US for Rite Aid Corp. very busy all day .. telephone calls , working with associates to complete there Benefits enrollments , HEalth Dental , Vision"
good,"hated to lose the job due to the many years invested with this company. benefits were excellent, pay was descent. it was a labor intensive job and physically demanding due to fingerprinting the freight at stores. Especially the water."
good,Good place to work. There are always room for advancement. You just have to be a little forceful. And make sure you have someone to mentor you so you can move up. It helps.
good,Retail pharmacy is very busy but environment is relaxed and very well organized. Management is great and store has a family feel. Pharmacists are great as well.
good,"I enjoyed the quick pace at Rite Aid after working in a long term care pharmacy environment.  At the time I felt the environment at Rite Aid was a bit competitive.  The focus was sometimes on how many flu shots you gave or how many prescriptions were processed, rather than focusing on patient care."
good,"some days are stressful, but overall it is an okay place to work. the management team is very friendly and customer are friendly as well if  you give good customer service."
good,"Patient based pharmacist, also involved in MTM reviews, daily Quality assurance checks, employee management. Observe and teach technicians and interns."
good,"Not really the best of jobs, the location was close to home but working there was highly repetitive. What usually got me through is the fact that it was close and some of the coworkers were nice."
good,"Very slow paced environment where I had time to constantly leave the register to restock shelves and ""face"" the items on those shelves. Dealing with a rude manager was difficult but the overall job experience was decent."
good,"Typically, when arribing to work we would check our daily stocking lists and inventory. Someone would work the check out in the front and others would stock and help customers around the store. Within my time at Rite Aid, I felt like I was unable to enhance my medical knowledge and use my certification with others. The most enjoyable part of working at Rite Aid was being able to interact with customers and realizing the impact I have made on them just by them coming into our store."
good,"A typical day at work is just that,WORK usually busiest on weekends and late night"
good,Fun and friendly team members. Always will to help. Easy to talk to management and learn new things everyday. Everyone knows and understands they daily roles which make getting things done on time.
good,"Work with good people, Good benefits, Company being bought uot so the future is in not as predictable in pharmacy as it usd to be.  Hopefully everything will stabolize."

good,Was a relax place to work. Management had good relationship with worker. Management worked with employees on scheduling. Home life was considered with scheduling. Pay was not very good at that time but not sure about present pay rate.
good,"every day a long store hours in pharmacy from 8 to 10 daily, learn form good customer reaction. but work environment is good but stress when high volume prescriptions."
good,Everyday is different very fast pace environment. Lots of information learned about retail and managing a store. The hardest part about the job is multi tasking and time management. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with people.

good,"When I worked here, it was super busy all the time but the senior  techs always made sure to help out. They never abandoned me in a situation where I didn't know anything about the status of a problem. Everyone in the whole store helped each other out. Front end rescued us in the pharmacy if we needed them. That's great team work !"
good,"Really relaxed. i would usually clock in and go to my register for the day, making sure aisles where clean. I would also make sure products were in the correct place."
good,"The Pharmacy is always busy, always fast pace, you have to deal with a lot of customer errors & solve them to keep the work pace fast and efficent. always a great time there when you work as a team"

good,"RITE aid is great place to work.Though at times, challenges May arouse, staff is willing to accommodate the best way possible to facilitate each other"
good,i started working here in high school. it was okay. i just restocked things because i was a student worker in the r.o.p program. but it was a good pay
good,You would do the daily assignments along with help on the register. You would help customers find items and answer questions they need answered. The job I feel was manageable and really did not have a hard part of it as long as you did what you needed. I found organizing my most enjoyable part of working there.
good,If you want a company that you can grow your career with this is the one. You can learn everything you want and work your way up into a management position.

good,"some days are long and busy"
good,Not such a bad place to work if you are in college or looking for a part time jobs. Some store managers are amazing to work with. On most days you will go home happy. Others in tiers.
good,"Using the experience I gained through previous employment, I was able to manage this store very successfully. The hardest part of the job was working nights and weekends."
good,Fast paced. It's my job to make it work. Hours can be long. Mostly we are left alone by management. I get to help people every day. Healthcare has changed a lot as have insurance companies.
good,"Rite aid has numerous opportunities to grow. Here you learn a lot about the pharmacy business . The company is innovative and the customers are great ,"
good,i enjoyed working for this company it was a great i have learned alot in being a cashier an supervisor an took that experince to get better postion jobs
good,"Working as a pharmacy technician was challenging yet rewarding. Initial and continued training is a character, skill set and resume builder. Synergy with staff pharmacists cultivates learning experience for most pharmacy staff."
good,"My typical day at work was enjoyable and stressless. I learned how to be more accountable when dealing with the public and handling business. Also i managed company documents and time sheets. In addition to, I supervise 7 employees and taught them how to be customer friendly and Goal Oriented. The hardest part on my job were to fix other people problems when i had major assignments to do. The most enjoyable part of my job were supervising employees and getting my work done at an more reasonable time."
good,"I have worked for Rite Aid for many years, and was very "
good,This was a partnership with Rite Aid and Drugstore.com. I was the Pharmacist in charge for rite aid and had to protects the rite aid license. Hardest part was breaking down the barrier of two different companies in one building.
good,"Management really appreciates diligence and supports a great working environment. A lot of opportunities to advance if an individual shoes determination, leadership, and eager to learn."
good,Steady work environment in this small community. Excellent manager and store manager who helped in overload times. I was frequently asked about OTC items in this location
good,this was the first employer I was ever able to negotiate my wage to match what I was worth. I was pleasantly surprised they gave me as much freedom to perform my job.
good,"worked scheduled was rough "
good,"Consistently help incoming clientele while multitasking other duties required. Learned information about prescription drugs as well as how a pharmacy is run and how close of attention one must pay to helping in this environment. Management is relatively easy to work with, and in this position I must work alongside them and interact with them very frequently. The hardest part is managing large volumes of customers while multitasking and remaining calm and organized with the most enjoyable being helping patients with there medicinal needs and questions."

good,there is a very good team relationship and there is a lot of time flexible and every one has chance to learning to improve your skills and advance more in your education
good,I enjoyed working for this company in the pharmacy. I learned a lot but it was a stressful job for me. I was on the cashier for the most part and dealt with customers pretty often. If you don't mind a cashier or talking with many customers and handling complaints then this job is for you.
good,"Servicing the customer and keeping a positive attitude were the main two things I learned from working for this company. Making sure the customer finds the items they are looking for and giving them a fast and friendly check out. My managers were always prompt when needed and knowledgeable of all policies when addressing any situation. Setting a goal and accomplishing the task, while assisting customers was the hardest part of the job for me. I strongly believe that accomplishing your work before the deadline is important. Being a reliable and productive associate helps companies in general and provides the opportunity to grow within the company. The staff made the experience of working for this company enjoyable. Being the best was important, but making sure the whole team finish was a priority."
good,"not really sure what to say since this is mandatory but great first job got it through school, so i was able to gain some work experience. really great customer service enjoyed scooping the ice cream."
good,"Enjoyed this position tremendously.  As a leader, it brought me great joy in training others.  This position tested my strength in dealing with different personalities"
good,"I usually Work from 2pm to 10pm, you're always moving, helping costumers with their insurances, costumers expect from you everything they want you to help them with everything possible they want you to be as fast as possible, the environment at the Pharmacy is always busy it could get very stressful, but you're always working on teams that's a very good workplace when you get coworkers to help you while you're busy helping another costumer. The manager helps us work harder always helping us learn everything, good with teaching us the correct way to do things. Helping costumers is very challenging which is very good for me and makes me focus better and learn faster."
good,very simple with no change at all. Very repetitive work for hours. They choose the best people to be a lead. The managers can be friendly but also direct with you.
good,"It is a place for hard working employees with the heavy load of prescriptions and customer service. It is good for training, communicating and being responsible."
good,"A typical day was ok. I learned that my co workers were fun to be around. Honestly, my job was quite mundane and difficult to concentrate on. I basically walked around and looked for suspicious behavior."
good,"Fast paced "
good,room to move up if you wanted to. Management was okay. Pay wasn't goof for all the work you had to do. Hours sucked. there for longer than you are scheduled.
good,As a Pharmacist I am compensated well but I feel the culture is changing for our Techs.  We do not pay them well and soon we are going to be a training facility where our best go elsewhere.
good,"Rite Aid is an excellent company for increasing skills, there is good communication between pharmacist and pharmacy tech. It is a great workplace to grow.."

good,"I learned how to deal with customers, give medications and answer phone calls accordingly to the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with a friendly staff and getting to learn new things about working in a pharmacy."
good,"Great place to work for, they promote fast until you get to an assistant manager, then you will have to wait your turn, great benefits and the union is very helpful as well"
good,It was a nice atmosphere the employees are nice.  You rarely see upper management.  Breaks are hard to come by and advancing can be tough.  But it wasn't all bad.

good,"Days are typically entertaining, and helping customers is the best part. They are what makes coming to work worth it. I've learned a lot about the retail world and am excited to see where this new knowledge takes me. Management is iffy. Some qualities of management are great, while other qualities are lacking. The workplace culture is general relaxed and positive, but drama can cause a lot of issues. That is the hardest part of the job. For me, I just love working with people on a daily basis."
good,It's fast-paced; always busy. You do CBT's on your first day. They will train you. The pharmacy techs and pharmacist at the store I work at are really good. They're not lazy. Always ask questions if you don't know something. They are always willing to help/train you.
good,"I enjoyed working here because the job security was excellent and the fact that it was close to home. However after working there for four years I could not afford to live on my own with the salary I was given, that is why I had to resign."
good,"New add break on Sunday. Monday recalls and returns, Tuesday or Wednesday is truck day. Thursday finish any let over truck. Friday is getting ready for busy weekend."

good,"Fast paced extremely easy job. Coworkers were friendly, loved getting the over time work, easy clock in clock out, love the gym, and has a cafeteria. Full time"
good,"My personal work experience was most enjoyable due to the people I worked with. Over the years, I've worked with several different people, and everyone always does an amazing job making each other feel welcome and accepted in the company. Management does a great job keeping everyone motivated and on task, while still enjoying what we do through seasonal pot lucks and occasional fundraisers."

good,its a good place to start working and as my first job it was a good experience for me. A regular day is just ringing people on the cashier and talking to my coworkers.
good,"I've been with this company for ten years, rising from a part time associate in high school to managing my own store. Throughout most of this time, Rite Aid has been fair and a company I truly loved working for. However, in the last year, things have been declining. Customer and Associate experience is being neglected in favoring of tightening belts as the purchase of Rite Aid by Walgreens draws near. The once-familial culture has devolved into one I can no longer say I enjoy. I only hope that after the deadline for this passes, whether the purchase occurs or not, that Rite Aid can once again be the company I loved."
good,"nice and friendly staff."
good,"While working at Rite-Aid, I had a good working environment and always felt safe. Our security was really good, especially since it was a bad neighborhood. I didn't always agree with my employees views but always stayed neutral. It's a good idea to keep friends separate from co-workers."
good,worked for this company for 16 years until they relocated. the company is family. we worked as a family and remained that way until they moved. they really showed that the appreciated us
good,"As Shift Supervisor I was responsible for the training of new employees in customer service, cashiering, inventory and merchandising operation. I supervised a team of 15 sales associates.

good,At Rite Aid I have learned quite a bit in the pharmacy.  They have sent me to different classes to receive my certificate to become a pharmacy tech.  I have also learned how important it is to be motivated and a self starter.  Working with my team has helped me to be a strong team builder.
good,A typical day at work was usually good. My co workers were great people and the management kept the store in a orderly fashion. Lots of rude customers came in at this location on the daily which made the job hard to deal with. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with good people.

good,"Working for Rite Aid has taught me how to hold on my own in a fast-paced retail environment but more importantly how to make the best of of everything the company and people had to offer me. It was the customers and obviously the money that kept me around for almost 3 years, every shift I had the pleasure of meeting new people all the time and i loved talking and chilling with my coworkers. The work was very easy for me after a lot of trial and error in the process so there was virtually no stress or imposition on my social life at all. The hardest part of the job was trying to kill the time especially during double-shifts. but despite the tedium with a love/hate work environment and uplifting customers to serve daily, I never really cared to be promoted to management thought in retrospect I should have been a little more concerned but you live and you learn."
good,"I have learned a lot at Rite Aid. I have gained many skills such as multi-tasking, how to work efficiently, and interpersonal skills. A typical night for me included picking and helping others. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is the people. The hardest part is standing on your feet all night and working an hour past your shift."

good,"Processed prescriptions daily, and interacted with customers from a diverse spectrum.  I enjoyed every aspect of my job, such as data entry, insurance billing, customer service."

good,"Rite Aid was a great place to work, you come in and do your day to day. You learn something new every day in the pharmacy. The Pharmacists are all eager to teach their techs and for the most part it is very team oriented. The hardest part would be frustrated customers, it isn't over groceries; it's their medications. You have to take customer service to a different level and sympathize but also do your job. I enjoyed helping my customers and making their stop to the pharmacy more enjoyable and less of an inconvenience."

good,"I worked for Eckerd/Rite Aid for 18 years.  9 of that was for Eckerd and 9 was for Rite Aid.  During the week, I typically worked 12 hour days and weekends were 9 and 7 hours respectfully.  We used to be very busy, but as the years have gone on, the Giant Eagle behind us started offering $4 generics and free antibiotics.  Also, over the last 2 years, we lost 3 major stores and several other minor ones in the mall and business has declined.  We weren't super busy with volume, but we were pretty busy on a daily basis with other jobs to take care of..  I was a Pharmacy manager for the time that we were Rite Aid.  I had never been a Pharmacy manager and a lot of it was learning on the fly, which made it a little more difficult, but, I muddled through it.  All of those years, I had pretty good coworkers who made the day that much easier.  The only part that was tough was having very little payroll on a weekly basis to work with and also, until recently, not having a competitive salary for technicians.I loved my customers and lot of them were loyal with me for 20 years or so."
good,"I open my store and begin to see what my sales from the following day was, I print all my reports, walk my store to see what my night shift had done, I read my emails, check job duties and make my list of things to do and then I start my day.."
good,I love working for rite aid. I haven't had any issues and reaching out to corporate is always helpful. You can never struggle without someone coming to help you or having the available resources around you
good,While I greatly enjoyed my time working with store level employees the corporate end of things were less than helpful. The higher the position the less they cared about the store level staff. They play the blame game more than try to find solutions to problems in the company.
good,"Stocking shelves, cashier, customer service.  "
good,"Working at Rite Aid, I was cross trained to also be able to work in the pharmacy as a cashier. I learned to work with a drive-thru pharmacy window and to get customers the correct prescriptions. "

I do the daily bank deposit, print out Business Daily Report from previous day and approve Time & Attendance.  I fill out Daily Employee Bag Check and assign duties for Cashier.  The hardest part of the job is ensuring the Cashier on duty stays focused on tasks assigned and completing them.  The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting customers in finding merchandise and helping the Pharmacy when it gets extremely busy."
good,"The job requires you to be quick witted and fast on your feet, but at the time of getting the job the pay was great and there are many opportunities for raises. Once you get a hang of the job it isn't particularly challenging, and you can constantly improve. There are many benefits to constantly improving, including pay raises."
good,Rite-Aid was a good company to work for. There pay scale was above most retail jobs in the area. I was allowed to do much of the training of the staff which was fun and educational.
good,"Was a great experience however need to remain in contact with hiring managers to make sure training on schedule, and that everyone is behaving as they should be. Managers have a tendency to try to get away with things when DM is away. "
good,A typical day at work will be helping customers which their purchases and ring them up. Have conversation in between each ring up with each customers.
good,"I enjoyed working at the store that I worked. The environment had its stressful times, however the management worked with me continuously."

good,The pharmacists are very approachable. They make sure I learn not only with regards to pharmacy work but also with pharmacy education since I was a student then when I worked for them. On free time they teach me. I said excellent because they can perform under pressure without making mistakes and still were able to do counselling.
good,Managers were always happy and willing to assist. Friendly and well-organized staff. Love to one day to go back one day and work with them again.
good,"Worked overnight at a 24 hour Rite Aid, some nights were slow .. i learned about more customer service i also learned about the position i was promoted to which was shift supervisor , my co workers were really great to work with , I wouldn't say the job was hard it was pretty easy ..

good,"Clock- in. Count the tills. Place Orders for Truck Delivery. Interact with Customers. "

good,"Went through many changes buy outs, mergers and acquisitions.  Retail pharmacy is an ever changing environment as well as the entire retail market."
good,"A typical day at work would be somewhat busy with one cashier up front, but if help was needed someone would help as soon as possible. I learned how to run a register faster and how to work better as a team. The management at Rite Aid was overall helpful. If I needed help with anything they made sure to help. My co-workers were helpful and friendly. They trained me well and helped with everything I needed. The hardest part of my job was working on load days when everyone was busy and I didn't get as much help as I needed. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers in any way I could help them."
good,"I enjoyed working in Rite Aid Pharmacy, it was a very fast paced environment, I learned how to deal with situations accordingly, I loved the fact that my boss was understanding on the fact that i had a child, and tried to work around my schedule for certain appointments i had, either for myself or my son."
good,"I enjoy my daily job.  I like taking good care of my employees under me, and providing excellant customer service daily.  I have met many different people, and have learned many new things in my years with the drugstore businss.  My co-workers are like family to me, and we make a great team.  The hardest p[art of my job is dealing with shoplifting.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the satisfaction of doing a job well.  I have learned how to manage my time well to acomplish what needs to be done"
good,"the shifts and the hours were awesome, it was an overall exciting and a fun work place and atmosphere to work in. The hardest part of the job was standing on your feet and took forever to get your breaks. the most enjoyable part of my job was working with the other employees and the management, and definitely learning the management way of doing things his way."
good,"A typical work day at Rite Aid is meeting new people and the joy of helping people who are in need of their medication. There is no hard part of the job. I enjoy what I do. I work alone because I have to travel by myself to transport clients medication to their homes. I really enjoy working at Rite aid. Although I am looking for another job it will be in addition to this job. I am a hard worker, fast learner and very driven. My goal in life is to one day own my own medication delivery business."
good,"I was always busy here made my day go by fast never a dull moment here i worked every deparment from photo to pharmacy, cashier stock and even serving ice cream."
good,"A typical day of work consists of ensuring the store is clean, organized, and fully stocked to satisfy the needs of our guests. It is also important to offer help to the customers if they seem to be lost or wandering. I learned many new things while working at rite aid such as the HIPPA guidelines and where and how to dispose of personal information. The hardest part of my job is remaining cool and collected when a customer becomes frustrated with store policies or lack of stock or a mistaken sale sign. It is difficult to continue smiling in front of the customer when they are frustrated. Some people just have bad days. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing customers leave with a smile of their face."
good,"a typical day at work goes by pretty fast. theres so  much to do, theres always something to do.the pharmacists and my coworkers are a joy to work with"
good,i had a very good boss and i cant complain about the company i would recommend it for any high school or college student i would have stayed there longer personally but i was planing on joining the marine corps.
good,My 9+ years at Rite Aid have been great mainly because of a great store manager and district manager. It's retail so it's not always flexible with hours and work life balance can be difficult around the holidays. Overall I've had a great experience and would recommend it to anyone looking for work.

good,"A typical day at work can be very stressful as it requires working very close with people in a confined area all day and trying to help lots of patients throughout the day. What I have learned through this job is how to manage my time and to be very patient at high stress moments. Being able to get along with all my co-workers as well as my superiors is the best part of my job. It is easier to wake up everyday knowing the kind of day I am going to have base on the people I work with. Working in a very confined area, it is highly important to be able to get along with all my co-workers and to be able to work as a team. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help patients and going the extra mile. It is important to me that I represent Rite Aid and to stand out and give them extra attention that patients might not get at another pharmacy."

good,"Busy stor,entering rx and dispensing,billing calling insurane for prior authorization,inventory,ordering,training other tech"
good,I loved working for rite aid up until they start cutting hours due to not making a certain amount of sells. Management favortises employees and only has something to say to others when they aren't doing something right. never a thank you.

good,"The Pharmacists were very knowledgeable and took time to educate our staff. I learned product knowledge, phone skills and customer service skills. Wonderful co-workers, they were team-players. The hardest part of the job was helping the customer in a timely manner with a limited amount of time in an extremely busy pharmacy.The most enjoyable part is that we became family. We enjoyed joking together and having meals and parties together."
good,"Rite Aid was my first job and it set the bar pretty high for what is to come. While I was in college, my work schedule accommodated my school schedule quite nicely. Also if I wanted a little more hours, I could just ask. All of my coworkers were very nice and treated me like family."

I also had to the office prep on daily basis and make sure monies are correct with also deposits cashier reconciliation."
good,The hours werent always the best. Customers could be difficult at times but the company was supportive. They pay was not the best for my growing needs with family but would have been if I continued up the ladder

I learned how to be a cashier, pharmacy technician, photo technician and a shift supervisor. My co-workers always worked as a team and showed awesome consideration for each other. The hardest part of the job was getting off due to someone being late or employees calling off. The most enjoyable part of the job was raising money for the Children's Miracle Network and helping the community by supplying school supplies."
good,"I overall enjoyed my work through the store, but it was regularly mixed signals as to where the priorities were.  Of course, the spoken word says that priority is the customer, and take all the time the customer wants and make them 100% happy.  Going above and beyond however, has its drawbacks - While customers love you and want you to help them or even stop to speak, other things will start to fall behind.  It takes more a careful balance of ""How friendly can I afford to be?"" which isn't the vibe that I like giving off.  With very limited staffing and hour cuts, often it would be just two associates in the store for hours at a time, so when one person's break came, that meant the register operator would have to solo things.  Not impossible, but if a customer needed help finding something, the other person had to get paged off of break to assist."
good,Was a chasier a stocker and clerk. Mainly stayed up front helping customers find what they needed and ringing them up. Co workers were professional and extremely helpful when it came to something i needed help with. Hardest part of the job was having to check the customer out in a fast and professional manner when the store got busy.
good,"my typical day i would great the cashiers and go into the rest rooms what were always clean theni would go in to the ice cream counter seeing that they were cleaned and filled, then i would greet the managers on my way to putting back products ,my co-workers were very nice and understanding ,there were never any hard parts to my day, and the most enjoyable part of my day was i got to make little kids smile when i handed them their ice cream"
good,Was a mostly easy job and got to understand what it was like working with customers and working with others also. Liked basically everyone there and did everything we were told to do at nights. Didnt have much room to move up though because of the fact that the hours werent very long because it is a small pharmacy and the full time people worked during the day and we worked at night and weekends.
good,Positive and Supportive helpful with any kind of question and employee has. Willing to help you grow and succeed in life.
good,Any day at work is a busy day. Prescriptions are filled for patients in a structured fashion with emphasis on safety and accuracy.
good,"Nice environment, competitive pay, benefits, great people. Considering you spend more time at work at times than you do with your own family, you learn to develop a work family with those whom you are around. The support is great including the paid time off, holiday pay and opportunities for shift bids."
good,Learn how to move in very fast pace the employee worked as team we will get our work done and make sure everything was in place....  have to patient with the customer help them find items... the only thing I will change will be the pay

good,A typical day at work was great because i got to interact with others and I have learned alot more about retail and I have also got to learn about being a Manager for a few weeks and i worked well with others because im a people person the hardest part about my job was nothing until recently relocating so the drive is the issue otherwise I was very happy with my job at Rite Aide
good,"Rite-Aid requires you to be a quick-thinker. I learned from my manager to consistently be concerned for the needs of the customer."
good,"On a typical day I come in and review the needs of the store. Write a task list and delegate tasks to the associates working that day. Then I set up all of the cash registers and equipment that we need for the day. I've learned to work with a sense of urgency, to lead by example and to strive for the best job possible each day. The management is clear in their expectations and the allotted time to get things done in. My co-workers are good at making the day enjoyable with humor and basic chit chat. The hardest part of the job is trying to get big projects done when faced with challenges such as busier than expected day or short staffed. The most enjoyable part is learning new things and being able to pass on my knowledge."
good,"What can I say, when I first started I was just a cashier. Stood on the register for eight hours.Now that I have more responsibilities my shifts fly by. I've been fortunate enough to have good general managers, who've taught me everything I know. There's days when I have to spend a few hours on the register and be the back up cashier. I'm responsible for merchandise displays, so ones a week I have to but up a new display. Damaged merchandise is one of the main duties I need to keep up on a daily basis."

good,Assisting customers day in and day out while providing excellent customer service. learned to be an active part of a succeeding team of associates all with a similar goal of keeping a well kept and fully stocked retail store. Management was incredible and always understanding of life outside of work. coworkers were always helpful and always promoting a healthy work environment. hardest part of the job was organizing the back stock area. but the most enjoyable part was talking with customers each and everyday and becoming the reason they chose to return to our retail store
good,Great place to work employees are more like family then co-workers. Customers are great and very friendly. You are always learning something new everyday you are never bored.
good,"I loved my first job. I enjoyed the experience as both an intern, pharmacist and pharmacy manager. My experience at Rite-Aid was quite enriching."

good,I worked there for 7 years and some of those years was the best years of my life. I worked with some of the greatest people I have ever had the pleasure to meet. Going to work and making displays and making sure my assiociates are happy in what they are doing. Making sure my customers leave there feeling happy and appreciated was a very big goal of mine. The hardest part of the time was trying to please everyone but that is also one of the greatest things about this job or any job because I love a challenge. When my customers used to walk up to me in the store or even on the street and give me a hug that was is the most enjoyable part of the job. Even though I no longer work there my customers still stop me on the street and hug me. That is the greatest thing. That I made people so happy they still remember me.
good,Working in the public can be challenging. You learn how to work around all different kinds of people. Working with co workers as a team makes it a better place to work for everyone. Working in retail doesn't seen to have much for advancements as I would like to have. I would like to find a career that has more advancement available.
good,Daily maintenance of stocking the shelves and checking for out of dates. Maintaining great customer service with all customers. Receiving stock from outside vendors.

good,a typical day was hectic. I learned a lot about how to fill peoples prescriptions and about he different types of medications and what they are for. My supervisor was really nice and worked with you to suit my needs and the companies needs. My co-workers were fun to work with and very caring towards our patients. i would say the hardest part of the job was the long hours and the most enjoyable part of the job was helping our patients.

good,"A great job with a lot responsibility and a challenge for everyday work. "
good,loved working for this company at times it could be a little bit hectic but still overall a great career.

Challenging job with no way to advance in the company, unless you go to school for a Pham. D. Great job for someone looking to get their feet wet in the pharmacy/health care field, but not so great as a career."
good,Good work place. Good company. Hardest part No hours. Learned People Skills.
good,Rite Aid was a company less popular compared to Walmart or target so we as a team always persevered to do our best for the customers. On a typical day we would always be busy with many customers to help serve and also push truck to the sales floor. I had several supervisors to learn from and was taught excellent customer service.

Customers can be difficult but I learned how to handle them and how to make them happy. This job can test your patients and limits at time but in the end overall I learned a lot and everyone from upper management was patient and willing to teach me as long as I wanted to learn. The hardest part were the hours and the stress of everyday tasks that have to get done and the deadlines but again having a team that was understanding and willing to work with me made my job more enjoyable.

It decided to terminate the assistant manager position in all of the stores but 2.  Most stores were capped on the hours scheduled each week.  Our store had a total of 205 hours a week for 8 employees.  I was a shift supervisor for 4 years of the 4 1/2 years I worked there.  When I started working there my dream was to be a store manager and work my self up the ladder. Everything was going well until the crash.  I was then stuck in my position of shift supervisor doing an assistant manager's work and no where to go.  That is one of the major reasons I decided to leave.  Just had two kids and I wanted raise them securely but since I was only working as a shift I couldn't do anything more there."

The environment was great and the service that the technicians, Pharmacists, and assistants provided was excellent.  There was always room to grow and as busy as the pharmacists were, they were very willing to teach their technicians and especially assistants who were pursuing pharmacy school.  Everyone behind the pharmacy counter was very empathetic of the patients and offered assistance to everyone.  I enjoyed every work day at Rite Aid because of my co-workers and because of the relationships that I had built with the patients."

good,Loved my staff.  Easy going and overall fun environments.  Management was awesome (to a degree).  Made quit a few friends.  Hate that they are now closed.
good,The hours are good. You don't necessarily learn something everyday but there are days when you do. Management gets along great with employees but also direct you In your job. The hardest part of the job is keeping an eye on the register when you are stocking. Customers do not like to be kept waiting so you have to check every 15 seconds or so.

good,A typical day could be fun if everyone did there own work in which the people that do there work end up doing the people who lolly gags around we end up doing there work
good,"The worst part about my experience here was simply the angry customers. The management team I worked under was extremely helpful and understanding, and job advancement is a very real possibility. I was promoted within a year of being hired because they seen my potential and recognized the benefits of promoting from within versus hiring from the outside. They accepted me back twice after my first term with the company, and I was always welcomed with open arms. This type of job will definitely help you develop personal and professional skills you may not realize you had before. This is great for a first time job, as it will teach you all the important skills you will need for better jobs in the future."
good,had a great working relationship with everyone at the 21 stores I supported. They all got along great and if you needed assistance they would be glad to help.
good,Thanks to great coworker and bosses I had a great opportunity to learn and grow here.  Starting as a photo technician and ended up an assistant manager before leaving the company.

good,"I've been with the company for a long time and have seen many changes. The company has had its struggles but the future outlook currently looks bright. I have always liked that Rite Aid takes an interest in your development (if you express interest in growing). The hardest part of my job is the varying hours (close one day, open the next, early truck days). The best part of my job is the regular customers and working with my team to help them grow and be accountable in their role."
good,"Work life balance is awesome! Pay is pretty low for the amount of work produced. Otherwise, great for a second job or a mom looking for income that allows time with children still."

good,It was fun and you able to build relationships with the customers. Great and hilarious boss you just got to get to know him. You had some slow days and you had some busy days it just depends.
good,There are not enough employees and hours to go around for help in these stores.  Employees are limited as are hours so getting tasks done can be pretty difficult at times.

good,"This was the first company I had ever worked for and during this time I learned a lot about stocking and cashiering. Really, just about working in the retail business in general. I had really supportive managers who put a lot of time and energy into making me a a self-sufficient worker."
good,"Rite Aid was a great place to work.I suppose there was never a typical day. My daily routine varied from day to day and kept me constantly on the go with little time to spare. It could be very stressful and demanding as well as physically demanding, but in the same breath it was rewarding and satisfying. The company as a whole was always striving to make improvements on all levels which didn't always work, but was usually a win. There were always opportunities  to become part of training for new programs and to become part of remodeling teams,merchandising projects,etc. I enjoyed the compatibility of my team members and the family feel we projected throughout our store and company as a whole."
good,It's a great atmosphere overall. I enjoy interacting with the customers. You learn new inforamtion about different medications and what they're used for everyday.The best part of my job is working with great pharmacist and pharmacy technicians. They're always so helpful and very appreciative of all that you do.
good,"I’ve worked for rite aid for about 2 years and I love it. I have great patients, great coworkers and a great boss. It’s very team oriented so you have to be a team player. My boss is by far the best boss I have, he really lets you know if you are doing a good job and if there is an area you need to improve on he’ll sit there with you and work on it. Everyone is always eager to teach you something when you want to learn too. The only downside is the area we are in, it’s not the greatest and sometimes we don’t feel 100% safe but we all love the job"
good,The most enjoyable part my intern was getting the chance to helping the customer with the medication making sure they understand the dosing if there prescription.

good,"I still work here as of the moment. The Rite Aid that I work at is a good place to work. The customers are regulars and they are very friendly. They know me by name. Workplace culture is very strict and professional. Our manager is a sweet lady with a caring heart. I would say the hardest part of my job are the hours that you are on your feet. There are some long days, but you get through them. I would say the most, enjoyable part of the job is the interaction between customers and employees. Overall, Rite Aid is a great company to work for and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a part-time position or full-time."
good,Working at Rite Aid was a great learning experience. I obtained skills that I can definitely use in future employment and the management staff was very understanding and caring.
good,"the job is very challenging, people are very good to work with maintenance crew always follow what you give them, only Human Resource is not fare they always listen to a false testimony but over all good to work"
good,I recommend Rite Aid if you're looking for a quick paced environment I do like working there and the pay is good but it is a bit understaffed which is why I think it can get stressful at times.
good,"I absolutely loved working at Rite Aid and if I did not have to relocate I believe I would have never left the location in Crofton. The store, the team members were lovely and a pleasure to work with."
good,Everybody that I worked with had a very good attitude and was very fun to be around. I enjoyed working with public. Some of them were very nice and other you didn't want to deal with.
good,"Advancement opportunities are great if you are willing to work for it. Schedules are crazy and never ""set"" so be willing to work any day, any time. The stores always seem short staffed and the workload is stressful for cashiers and management alike. But at least it's not boring!"
good,the environment was very fast paced but the managers of co workers made it fun.  the company is a bit of an unknown with the Walgreens buy out.  So the future to anyone applying is not set
good,"When you show you are work and detail oriented, there is always room to build yourself and your career. Rite aid likes to see their employees succeed and assist in every way they can to achieve that."
good,Fairly good place to work. I did not care for the overnight hours that were assigned to me. I would have preferred the swing shift or days. The benefits are excellent.
good,Salary is not the best. Team is great and I love the position. We do a lot as an administrative assistant and it's fun and busy but salary is low for the volume of work
good,"Although I enjoy working at Rite Aid Pharmacy and Store, I feel like there is no chance for advancement and no challenge. I perform the same duties everyday. Also, I don't really enjoy working the night shift 2:00-10:30 p.m. everyday. I also work week-ends. "
good,A typical day was very busy. I learned about medications and different health problems. The hardest part was not having enough workers and having to pick up others slack.
good,"Rite aid is very concerned with customer service."
good,"Typical day at work is pretty much the same at every pharmacy. I check rx, answer patients' question, give flu shots while also trying to fit in time to do MTMs and provide other clinical services. The techs I work with are very helpful and very friendly. Workload is usually manageable and we get a 30 minute lunch break. Hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with promoting all the clinical services we provide. Most enjoyable part of the job is talking to patients and counseling them if needed."
good,"At the store I work at it open at 7am and close at10pm."
good,"Just like any retail job, Rite Aid experiences some mean customers. Over all though, it is a welcoming environment with good employees. I would recommend this as a good first-job setting."
good,It is a lot less stressful than other chain pharmacies. They provide more tech hours and it is less busy than CVS or Walgreens as I worked for both companies
good,My day of work consists of helping others have an enjoyable visit at Food-Rite. I've learned that when working in retail the most important thing is to keep the customer happy. Without the customer our store and our jobs would no longer exist.
good,Rite Aide was a pleasant place to work.  The staff was friendly and we all got along.  I enjoyed working at the main register and interacting with customers.  I know a lot of people in the neighborhood so it was nice to see them come into the store.
good,"The only problem with the job is the amount of hours you get a week, I love the people I work with and my customers are great, and my job isn't stressful or hard, but I can't live on such a low income"
good,working at rite aid has been an exciting journey for me I enjoyed all 14yrs of my career there. I was able to make multiple friends and acquaints with great positive in and outputs I would really like to work there again
good,"Work place culture at Rite Aid is great and laid back. Customers that came in were regulars and was able to develop relationships with those customers. Typical day would be cleaning shelves, helping customers find items, cashing out, and setting up displays. Hardest part of the job is dealing with multiple customers at once and the most enjoyable would be helping a customer find what they needed or just simply making someone laugh and smile"
good,Making sure that all the ad in the paper was set on the floor and stocked in the back room and all vendors placed there products in the right area's easy for customer access.
good,"It truly is a pleasure to work at Rite Aid Corporation with its lively and diverse group of workers. All the employees here make it a safe and welcoming environment for any and everyone that enters the store. From greeting customers as they enter the store to helping them find their products--all in all, customer satisfaction is a top priority here. Customers often repeat their visits and become very familiar with the employees given how well the customer-employee interactions happen. With that being said, often times customers can be unpredictable and not all customers maintain a professional attitude when they are in the store, so it is up to the employees to make sure that every customer receives fair and equal treatment, no matter the situation. But such situations are efficiently handled by our team members as we all support one another and work towards making sure our store is presented well and all customers have a pleasant experience."
good,Depending on which location usually fun and fast paced environment. Hard to get a response from HR or people in the district but they get around to it in their own time.
good,The store level management were great at the location I was at. They tried their best to to teach you and would always coach you to be better and if you were struggling.  The hardest thing was the lack of hours that were available which made staying on top of everything difficult.
good,I enjoyed working there a lot. I recently left the job to seek employment at another place of business. I did the training for about a month and then started  working  here.
good,"As a cashier, it was a nice experience. Lots of customers come and go and it wasn't too packed that I wouldn't be able to handle. My team members are fun and friendly and I had a fun experience as a cashier."
good,Helping to assure that the job is accurately and productively accomplished while maintaining  the moral and self confidence of all associates. Building a strong management team.
good,"I worked with Rite Aid for almost 17 years as Manager. I loved working with Rite Aid, management was really nice and fair to work with. I got many progress opportunities with Rite Aid."
good,"Work environment was very nice, workout area, showers, lockers, pool tables, televisions, air hockey, vending machines, and a nice big open area to eat. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I met and the least was the hours and the physical labor which I knew before hand. I learned at that job how to work with people of all backgrounds as well as time management. Its one of the jobs I miss the most and if I was still able to physically do the work I would."
good,A typical day at work starts off by wearing company policy clothes and be on time. I enjoy being around other employees and customers to provide them the best  customer service that they want. I do what is required of me on a daily basis.
good,"Everyone on the team was very kind and agreeable, the managers are easy to talk to and a pleasure to work with. They're very flexible with the hours given."
good,The environment at my rite aid is always organized. Always kept tidy and neat with everything where it belongs. We also have great customers. That's why I love my rite aid
good,The hardest part of the job is when you have deal with the losses and come up with a solution to fulfill the sales requirements.
good,"Great environment, great co workers, great customers"
good,"This job was fun, not to much pay but well organized. They have everything put in right places and the management is very well."
good,Handled money by cashiering and ensuring delivery deposit . Respond to question and concern of customer to quarantee satisfaction
good,Rite Aid involves everything any other retail position involves -maintaining stock and caring for customers.  In a pharmacy each customer's needs can vary so its important to be able to make a connection with each individual.
good,"Greet customers, stocked merchandise and maintained a clean appearance for the store.  Co-workers were friendly and always willing to help.  Hardest part was dealing with unruly customers who would threaten.  The enjoyable part of the job was forming relationships with frequent customers."
good,The coworkers are great and work with you on your schedule. The pay wasn't great when I started 5 years ago which lead me to leave the company. Raises are very small each year.
good,I really enjoyed working for Rite Aid unfortunately they where not able to give me enough hours to work so I had to relocate would defiantly work for them again though.
good,"Greeting customers and receiving written prescriptions or refill requests. A pharmacy tech must have many skills, mixing pharmaceutical preparations according to written precipions, answering telephones, locating OTC items and managing inventory, etc,etc. I have an excellent professional relationship with my coworkers and I've made some good friends for life. Dealing with insurance company's is always difficult, they don't want to pay for prescriptions a lot of the time, and the customers can get upset. And when someone has a zero balance due, that is very rewarding."
good,Great place to work wish pay was better but enjoyed working in this environment great experience as a whole being here was a learning experience.........
good,I don't miss rite aid but I know more about the business and I was getting better at the business but they don't pay good enough for all the hard work they want you to do
good,"I do believe I will make a wonderful asset to your business and staff."
good,"I have not worked for this company in over 10 years. When i did work at rite aid they were union with great benefits. The managers were well trained and easy to work with, along with co-workers. Through hard work it was easy to work my way up the ladder."
good,Rite Aid is a good company to work for. I am currently just looking for a better paying job for my family & I. I have worked here for 3 years. We open at 9am and close at 9pm. During the day i assist the pharmacist on duty by inputting & filling prescriptions. I also answer phone calls & put away and count inventory.
good,"I have learned about a large amount of pharmaceutical drugs and their uses and their affects. Dealing with the drugs and customers on a regular bases allows me to associate patients with medications. By providing genuine customer service, customers feel they have a reliable and trustworthy staff taking care of them and ensuring they get the medication that they need. I regularly interact with a large geriatric crowd who don't understand insurance policies, several customers on many psychiatric medications, people dealing with terminal illnesses and observing medications. The hardest part of my job is learning understanding how to prioritize what the company requires of us versus customer service and timing prescription wait times. If the phone is constantly ringing it's hard to delegate extra time to customers in the store. The most enjoyable part of my job is feeling confident in my ability and my knowledge and working with a dedicated staff."
good,"The job I have as a shift supervisor comes with a lot of knowledge, patience, and hands' on tasks. The store I work at is fast paced and a bit stressful at times, but I've learned quite a bit over my few years of working there in regards to how certain things are handled and how to take care of various scenarios. The hardest part of the job was getting things done under such a short time constraint at times and management pushing these things more and more as the clock ran. I absolutely love the people that came in regularly and helping out with different problems people had. I also enjoyed most of the fellow associates & management team because they all make you seem like you're apart of this family and kept me going there for so long."
good,Seemed like a slow day sometimes but it was a very good eperience working for rite aid the employees are well managed and respected the task was controllable as in it was'nt too much to handle.
good,Wish they had not closed Distribution Center. I wanted to retire at Rite Aid. Had a lot of good coworkers and friends at Rite Aid.
good,"Rite Aid was interesting to work for.  I started out as just a part time cashier that led to full time that led to shift supervisor. although i was not crazy about some of the work ways of the the managers above me, I still conducted myself in a proper manner ..."
good,"If you want to remain in store there lots of room for promotion but its a long way from moving into corporate."
good,"Working in retail can be very stressful at times, but when you know that simple things such as asking people how was their day can go along way to bringing a smile on their face its makes the bad days a little easier"
good,"Working in the pharmacy provided plenty of field experience of how modern medicine intertwines with the daily lives of thousands of people. At Rite Aid, there was enough business throughout the day that kept all employees busy. However, the rush was not overwhelming. Gaps at certain periods would allow us to reflect on any other tasks or duties that needed to be completed and reconstitute ourselves before business picked back up again."
good,"I liked working with the public , this is a face paced occupation counter, drive-thru, multiple phone lines, drop off and pick up. Management was the usual , co-workers were fun, hardest part is they never had enough help even when business was growing, most enjoyable part is  you laughed everyday."
good,"I work under the pharmacy manager and he is great but with in my store store there is store manager who is terrible and often the store staff talk about her behind her back. "
good,Great experience working there. Team really cares about the employees. Work load isnt terrible.Management actually took care of the employees and was willing to do what it takes to make them happy.
good,I learned as a cashier you are the face of the company and it is essential to establish a positive relationship with the customers. Days can be slow or rapid paced but maintaining a solid work ethic is just as essential.
good,"Great place to work  at, very fast pace to keep up with but after practice it becomes very easy, plenty of hours as it is is full time and overtime is mandatory"
good,Typical work day active. Learned more responsibilities and working with others. Management was good. Co-workers excellent. Hardest part cleaning and rush back to cash register when customer is ready. Had fun with everything.
good,"Well a typical day at Rite Aid is very calm, fast pace, and very nice atmosphere I enjoyed my time at rite aid because it gave me the opportunity to better my customer service skills which I think is very important."
good,I truly appreciated the overall concept being hired and the experience to do fun things while showing my worth as an associate all 3 seasons long; Thank you!
good,My review on rite aid is that rite aid is a good company but lak support of some of the managers over all it is a good company with good benifits and good health care.
good,Rite Aid gave me several learning opportunities to advance. The company had taught me the basics of their company and I grew from Rite Aid helping me as I was working towards furthering my education.
good,"teamwork, slow paced, management was helpful, had a career path, was appreciated, flex time, good location, mediocre pay."
good,"In a typical day we do $1,500-$2000 in liquor sales, are rotating stock, updating inventory, reworking displays. In the office a lot of time is spent doing payroll and filing company reports. This is a fairy steady - fast paced environment that will keep one busy all day. There is always something going on and something that needs done."
good,"typical day is typing prescriptions, counting medications, working with customers, answering phones"
good,"A typical day at work is greeting my customers, asking they how their say is going or how it was, being able to assist them with whatever they need around the store. Management was always on the workers side whenever they needed them. Co-workers was always a team, everyone was there for everyone at anytime. I think the hardest part of the job was not being able to fully please a customer."
good,"A typical day involves f/u and diary check on existing claims, calling store and customers, working new claims, investigating all aspects of an incident, evaluating liability and working out a resolution."
good,"My experience at RiteAid was an overall good experience.  The location provided lots of opportunities to help people as it was always busy, especially on holidays.  The management provided great training and leadership.  There were some shortfalls in staffing, computers, and computer systems."
good,"Fun and welcoming place to work. Management was always willing to work around personal schedule conflicts, as well as compensate for particularly busy weeks with additional days off. Overall, a wonderful place to work."
good,"I love my job working in the pharmacy of rite aid, but the hours have been cut back due to lower prescription counts after losing a big insurance contract. Every day I learn new things about medication, insurances, and general computer advancements. My co-workers treat each other just like family its a great place to work. The hardest part of the job for me would just be when things don't move as smoothly as they should but that comes with any job. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help many people every day."
good,"Good workplace, high energy, hard working. Lots of customer service provided and well established, friendly management. Day consists of filling prescriptions, inventory, contact with insurance and healthcare professionals. Rewarding"
good,Great Employer for advancement.Everyone has good team work. The hardest part of working in a high volume store is being able to complete tasks in a timely manner.
good,"Nice Place to work. Management is strong and stable. Health care, worker union, retirement in available. Good to work with Rite Aid Corporation."
good,Overall Rite Aid Pharmacy is a very pleasant company to work for and I enjoyed working with my team. I found that job advancement is very much achievable compared to my previous places of employment.
good,"I love the field in general so that always out-weighed most issues. The company did a lot of ""updates"" that just made the experience more frustrating for customers. It was difficult to get answers to questions and to have problems solved. "
good,"Great learning experience, fun employees. I learned a lot at this job about costomer service and how to run a retail store, work a cashier, count money. Very fun job!"
good,"organized environment hands on experience. environment was small but it worked out. filled prescriptions and stocked shelves, cashier checkout. answer calls from doctors or call in refills."
good,"A typical day at work i go in do a 8 hour shift , I count the safe i do freshness , i tell the cashier what to do and what i expect from them , at the night i count all the register i do deposit and make sure the store is clean."
good,"I work at a busy pharmacy. We do a team work. I work with a cashier, an ambassador, one or two technicians. Working with them is fun specially during busy hours. Hardest part is to tell patient that your medicine is on back order and your MD has changed a better medicine."
good,My boss was always considerate about my school schedule. Everyone was fun to work with and the environment was excellent.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with while at Rite Aid. We were like a big family and went to bat for each other. The only complaint I have is that it is not a company that promotes growth wtihin the company. Many ended up leaving in order to advance in retail.
good,The whole day is spent helping customers find what they need. The workers are fun to work with and love to help each other out. the managers of the store are also a pleasure to work for.
good,"I worked at Rite-Aid for a lot of years. Rite Aid gave me a lot of room to work up within the company, and experienced different positions. I worked as an ice cream clerk, advanced to sales associate (cashier), that led me to work back in the pharmacy. I made employee of the month which gave me a promotion to become a P.A.C (pricing accuracy coordinator). From there I became involved in Loss Prevention. I really enjoy working in retail."
good,Co workers were easy to work with and management was there for assistance when necessary. I learned how to operate a stock picker as well as shipping products via UPS. I learned how to run new reports and how to re-slot product from one location to another.
good,I worked at one of the busiest Rite Aids in the area. My coworkers are wonderful people who work very hard and are very polite and considerate of one another.  My boss was the best boss I've ever had and would always make sure I was ok with my schedule.
good,"Advancement in this company is great. Great people, and overall atmosphere is awesome.."
good,Day typically consisted of stocking merchandise and putting product in the proper place on the shelves. Learned what it took to merchandise and gained valuable information in a semi-customer facing position. Management was irrelevant in this high school position. Hardest part of the job was the redundancy. Most enjoyable part of the job was the sense of accomplishment when finishing a certain project.
good,My experience here is one of the best experiences I have ever encountered yet. The employees here are so nice and fun and outgoing that it always makes me want to come to work. We always leave any drama outside and continue to have a good time while getting our work done.
good,WWorking for Rite Aid was such a joy!!! I learned a lot and fast!
good,"A typical day at work involves first and foremost getting the customer to be happy. Whether it is a return or any question they might have. I leave the customer wanting to come back. On load days, when we have our weekly merchandise, i break down all pallets and make sure all merchandise gets distributed where it needs to go to further our sales. I think the fact that i make a difference in my job whether it be customer service or store duties helps me be a better person."
good,"Patience plays a big role in this job, as does not letting an angry customer get inside your head. The tough people to deal with can typically be calmed down if you explain the situation in a polite manner. The staff, the boss, and a lot of regular customers are real fun to spend time with. One nice lady brought a sweater and cookies for Christmas, and I only know her as a customer. They have online training modules that will get you up to speed quickly so you can begin your work."
good,"Rite Aid is a good place to work in retail. Coworkers were very friendly and easy to get along with. Easy going job, and quick to pick up. Not as fast paced as some other jobs. Management was very friendly."
good,"Act as main manager in the absence of store manager."
good,"I love working for Rite Aid. The particular store I worked at, which is the highest volume Rite Aid in New England had it's ups and downs. Poor management structures, lack of support and recognition was the main reason I left."
good,I enjoyed working for this company early in my career. It gave me a platform to build on and grow. Great place to work.
good,I've learned medical terms in English and Spanish. I've learned medical insurance terms in English and Spanish.
good,"A good company to work for long term, good benefits, good insurance for my family."
good,"A typical day at work included: "
good,"RIte Aid is a good place just need a better pay rate and more hours. I've learned how o be more involved with customers, have great customer service, love when customers are satisfied."
good,"Good coworkers, upper management is not that pleasant to be around and the pay wasn't good."
good,I had a lot of fun working there. I learned the value of good work ethics at this job. Management was not to bad to work for.  After all they are in business to make a profit. I got along with all my other co-workers very well.  The hardest part of the job was working nights. However if I had to work nights again I have no problem with that at all. I can work nights. The most enjoyable part of my job was finishing all y assignments in a timey manner and going home to my family. I felt accomplished.
good,"The production was really good. People got along and worked as a team and I've learn so much with in the 2 yrs I was at Rite Aid. I started as a picker in 2008 and after that I made it my priority to learn every single position they had and to my goal was to become a manager. Due to the fact that I was let go, I still showed respect to the company and its employee's. I am a hard worker and I only want to make your company that much stronger by bringing me to a team that I can bring my work ethic and values to. I promise if you hire me you won't regret it because I will be someone that knows the in and out of how to be the perfect employer or atleast will work hard enough to be the perfect employer. thank you for your time and patients."
good,"When I begin my work I log on the NextGen Pharmaceutical system and generate my 10 day aged will call. I then go into portal and find the sales information and clinical services we provided the prior day and the goal objectives. I bring the marketing information to my pharmacy manager and discuss ways to increase our sales and clinical services. My goal is to make the pharmacy successful and to reach the numbers expected of our dept. along with superior customer service and clinical services. I call the patients who have prescriptions available. I submit once a week a report and the goals for our pharmacy for clinical and business communications. I pull the outdated prescriptions for my pharmacy tech. and place the NDC numbers on each bottle. I support my pharmacy team in filling prescriptions. The business communications and community outreach is my favorite part of my job. I enjoy greatly my co-workers and I bridge the front end and back end parts of the Rite aid teams. My goal is to get everyone on the same page in promoting the focus for the store. I am a team leader. I am self motivated and goal orientated. Providing fabulous customer service is my pleasure and doing whatever I can to keep their business is my goal. Advancing the clinical services for each customer is another personal goal."
good,"Started out to be a great place to be, however my last place was more challenging and difficult and the company/district had made so many modifications/changes that it was not as enjoyable anymore.  I loved my employees and they made my day for me.  They were hard workers and for the most part did what was asked of them."
good,"I was always busy. As a shift supervisor, I had to stay on top of my tasks and the cashiers as well. ""Customers come first"", so I made sure the shelves were stocks and the customers were satisfied."
good,Well educated pharmacists and good management. I learned a lot about being a pharmacy technician. Job itself was very stressful but always enjoyed what I did to help others.
good,"I loved working at rite-aid.The environment was very cultured. I got to meet a lot of different people, with great leader ship skills. The hardest part of the job was leaving. This is a place where I would love to return to and grow as a person and leader."
good,Typical work day is 8-9hrs. Expect to close at least 2-3 times a week as a part of management.
good,work on computer. check every one for errers. work in a hot and dusty wherehous.
good,A typical day at work is busy day. Have great co workers that always has everyone back when needed. Great DM and the HR department is great.
good,"I have been at my current position for almost eight years.  I have learned a lot about myself in respects of time management and self-reliance.  A typical work day for me is fast-paced and interactions with fellow co-workers to get the task complete.  I work in a controlled drug section of the building.  We strive for 100% accuracy on a daily basis as we supply 70% of the United States with our products.  I would typically pick product from the storage racks with the use of a MHE vehicle.  Once I'm done with that I would go help manually verify the controlled drugs to be shipped to Rite Aid pharmacies nationwide.  The hardest part of my job is when we find errors in the picking or verifying process.  Finding the error must be corrected to complete the verifying process.  This can be time consuming and push back on-time delivery of products to the Outbound Department.  At the end of each day, I feel a sense of enjoyment.  I know that I have contributed to assisting in someone's daily medicine needs in the nation.  The feeling of knowing I may of helped a person I do not know is most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"I worked as an Assistant manager, ensuring the store/pharmacy are running in an efficient manner. Ordered and maintained supplies. Performed and ensured employees perform all tasks provided. Cash handling, clerical, and customer service are highly important everyday. "
good,"My family is awesome. We still keep in touch to this day. I loved working there, and can't really say anything bad about any of them. I would go in with the expectations of having a great day everyday. I learned a lot about taking photos, like the lighting is very important. And the chemical mixture had to be perfect in order to get a good quality photo.I would have to say that the hardest part of my job was having to leave it because the pay just wasn't enough for me to take care of my family."
good,"Work consists of constant communication with patients, physicians, co-workers, insurance companies, and other healthcare providers. In order to increase customer satisfaction, I provide quick and reliable information to all patient inquiries. Because of the well-established relationships I have created with healthcare providers, I am able to provide for my patients in a more personalized manner. My co-workers and I function extremely well, as teamwork is pertinent the safety and efficiency of providing healthcare services. The lack of staff  on day to day shifts was once a struggle, but I was able to quickly adapt to this type of working environment, and take on a larger amount of work with much success. My favorite aspect of this job is directing and coordinating health and wellness corporate events. This task allows me to be creative and design marketing strategies based on observed healthcare trends, in order to successfully draw in patients that may benefit from health education services. "
good,"A day at your every day Rite Aid is ran smoothly and productively. My team members and customers are all familiar with one another and that creates a very easy going environment to work in. Being the youngest front-end manager has taught me that a team should be lead with leadership and skilled prioritization. This would be best implemented in a way that uses the strongest skill in each member you work with. I am able to work closely with a variety of personalities and several cultured people. My team members are very well qualified and seasoned in their jobs; with some being with the company for 20+ years! Unfortunately, a comfortable future with Rite Aid is unforeseeable due to consistent loss caused by excessive theft, a string of robberies, and difficult competition with pharmacies in department stores. Rite Aid progressed me to be knowledgeable in key management, interpersonal, and financial skills."
good,"the days are never alike, either a slow or well paced day or busy and problematic day."
good,"Rite Aid's a pretty good company to work for being that there are quite a few in the country so if you're in to run management you'll always have an opportunity for a 40/hr week. As far as my experience goes they've always been very flexible with hours, vacation time, personal schedule needs, etc."
good,"Fun to work at. Great staff but customers were in a low income area resulting in higher than average theft and loss of product. I learned to specialize in loss prevention while maintaining a professional attitude. Day to day tasks include; Seasonal setup, plan-o-grams, scheduling, deposits, lottery and western union transactions. I oversaw returns, modified transactions as well as fixing computers and registers. I have a good knowledge of manual labor and technical support. I managed a team of 7 people during my shift, insuring they did their tasks thoroughly and in a timely manner while never forgetting about the necessity of great customer service and maintaining a professional attitude in the workplace."
good,This was the best job I held. The people were nice willing to teach and there when you needed anything. Providing customer service to the public who actually understood that you had a job to do and they learned that from the supervisor that was over the pharmacy at the time of my employment.
good,A typical day as an assistant manager involved assisting customers and supervising store associate activity. Managers are also required to balance all cash drawers at the end of the night and prepare the daily deposit. The hardest part of the job was working multiple departments. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was interacting with customers and training associates.
good,I had a very positive experience at Rite Aid Pharmacy while doing my externship there. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The pharmacist's were knowledgeable and took the time to help me whenever I needed them. I'm glad to have met such a great group of people who I am still friends with today.
good,hard work with great hours. the people are nice and friendly
good,I liked the people that I worked with and the patients. We could have used a little more help
good,i worked good with all the customers i had and i was top on donations that we had in the store the childrens hospital.
good,"I did not really have any typical days at work. The reason I left is because I spent 90% of my time traveling and doing associate/HR investigations for an area of 78 Rite Aid locations in the Northern VA, DC Metro and Baltimore Metro areas. This is not what I expected. I was not able to focus on any other aspects of my core roles since the investigative work took so much of my time. The senior management is doing a great job changing the culture of the company and focusing on the associates and people centered leadership and this is the part of the job I hoped to focus on as well."
good,got to learn alot about how photo's are processed and how the pharmacy works
good,I learned to deal with different type of characteristics in people. i learned to supervise about 6-7 employees per shift. I love helping customers find what they were looking for and was happy to see them satisfied.
good,"Assist in opening the store, multi-task, complete small projects requested by management, back fill inventory at cash register and cashier for the day, greet customers, assist customers with their retail needs and promote products, handle cash and returns, been part of a re-set team as a store undergoes a remodling project, work with management, be a team player keep a clear communication with both management and co-workers and get the tasks done. I learned how to do plan-o-grams (lay-outs) for store and use their computer scanners to transfer product in and out of the store inventory, paying attention to detail, match up SKU's of product with tags, set up products, make it look presentable for sale. Meet deadlines and being efficent in getting product on the shelves on ""Truck Day""."
good,"I love working at our store, But our store is closing and I am looking to find a job that I can be at long term. The most enjoyable part of my job is that we have a great team to work with. We are all pretty close and it makes for a great working enviroment that you just don't mind going to on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job sometimes can be dealing with difficut customer's but I have a good personality and can usually soothe them and get them what they need to make them return customer's. My manager is an awsome person and her flexability on scheduling makes it much eaiser for us to make necessary appointments and she makes working at Rite Aid fun. I have learned a lot at Rite Aid and would still stay there if our store wasn't closing. But I need stability so I need to find that in another job I choose."
good,Working at rite-aid was great! i loved meeting people. my co workers where all friendly and helpful. It was a good experience!
good,Good place to work for. They seem to care about you. Benefits were ok.
good,"Started with this company as a one-hour photo clerk, within a year I was promoted to a key cashier, and within 3 years was promoted to Assistant Store Manager. For hardworking dedicated people this is a good company, not perfect by any means, but good."
good,"rite aid is a place to envance in ur jobs,they give u chancrs to learn new thing."
good,"As far as working retail goes, Rite Aid is probably one of the better stores to work for. Because of the pharmacy there are a lot of regulars that come in and for the most part you know the customers which, for me makes the days go faster when they stop to talk to you. My manager is very good about working with you when the schedule is made."
good,Working at Rite Aid for approximately twenty two and a half years was for the most part very rewarding. Upper management was very friendly and willing to help associates achieve.
good,I started work at 6:30 if there was over time we work the overtime. And a distribution center we all work together to get the orders out we picked them we pack them put them on the line went to shipping and out the door they went. I was hoping to stay there until I retired
good,"I enjoyed my time working there. For the most part, the staff were friendly and very helpful. I had a really good pharmacy manager. She was always willing to help in any way. I would like to have an opportunity to work there again if I could."
good,There is always something to be doing during my shift. My coworkers are great to work with and they all are supportive to new workers. The pharmacy is managed well and they understand when you need a break.
good,"A warm and friendly environment. Many options from candy, chips, different drinks, Sandwiches, Chicken, and tv dinners. Gardening, flashlights, gift cards"
good,"I enjoyed getting to know the customers and employees on a personal and happy level. I did well even though it was usually understaffed. My main issue with management was that I noticed I was getting intimidated for wanting to take a leave of absence from exhaustion. I went to the union and got the paperwork, but the manager was so put off by me asking he was not sincere and claimed hes tired too. I felt nervous by his reaction and it made me feel uncomfortable going to work again. I was doing pretty well there and even offered to help the pharmacy out as a cashier. Its unfortunate how things ended but the way I had great relationships with both workers and customers made me feel rewarded at the end of the day. I know I could have done great things for the company if I was given a fair chance. They were very lazy about giving us breaks and proper chairs to sit in which started to make me sick and physically sick I needed the keave if absence to figure it all it and the manager who was just a fill in for the original one who passed away, did not care about the employees, supervisors would feel so put off if they had to work around him, management had just started to change around the time I left but I was feeling so uncomfortable with him that It was hard to even go I felt awkward how he handled people with no emotion and generally felt very happy to know I could work gravyeard shift with anyone else because he purposely only worked early shifts. I know it was busy and so underataffed that 2 people would be working the entire store for hours, but the least I deserved was respect"
good,Working at Rite Aid was very enjoyable. It doesn't get that busy so you aren't really overwhelmed with customers. Manager and coworkers were fun to work with and made the atmosphere nice. As long as the store is stocked and cleaned there isn't much to do other than tend to the customers.
good,I really liked it there would love to go back if I had the chance I was a pharmacy technician which I enjoyed so much put had to take the test to become a certified pharmacy technician and didn’t pass the exam
good,The job was really good and flexible. Managing a pharmacy store was challenging and busy. They were opened 24 hours until Walgreens took over. Once Walgreens took over and owned all Rite Aid stores. The transtion was slow and difficult.
good,"I have worked my way up the management chain. While you are expected to work a lot, especially weekends & holidays. Although I have always enjoyed my job, and I think they provide you with ample opportunity to move up."
good,I enjoyed working at Rite Aid because it gave me the chance to work in retail for the very first time. I got to do multiple tasks such as working as a cashier and a stocks person.
good,"A typical day at work at Rite Aid is very challenging and fast pace. I learned how to manage my time, enter prescriptions into NEXGEN and calculate days supply. My Pharmacy manager and his partner (there were 2 pharmacists), were by far the best people I've worked with in a while. They were always kind and courteous and always took time out to help me succeed at my position if i had a question. The hardest part of the job I'd say was managing cashing customers out, filling prescriptions and counting."
good,"Great place to work. Sometimes understaffed, but manageable. Pay was good for me. Great co workers,and management. Would definitely work for this company again."
good,"As far as retail jobs go, this one was pretty good. The managers were all friendly, the pharmacists seemed to enjoy their jobs, and the cashiers were nice. There was a lot expected of workers and multi-tasking was a huge part of it. The hours were flexible and schedules could be changed a day before, which isn't always an option at jobs. Life happens and things come up, and the Rite Aid I worked with understood that. There was upward mobility offered to almost every associate and yearly evaluations for a pay-increase. But the paid time off was a bit of a scam, because you could miss a whole year's worth of vacation time based on a fraction of your average hourly work schedule from the previous year."
good,"As a tech, there is always something to do. There is usually a constant stream of customers to assist. You get to know your customers on a personal level and try to anticipate their needs."
good,"Very busy place to work, on your feet 12 hours a day, always lots to do, sometimes too much between checking and counseling and vaccinating and dealing with insurance companies. Technicians are not paid enough for the amount of skilled work they have to do."
good,Rite Aid remains my favorite employment opportunity to date. The other staff members became and are still personal friends. They all care so much about the customers and each other.
good,"When the day gets started, all the pharmacy workers would gather together to talk about our goals for the day when it comes to how many prescriptions should be filled for the day, the outreach that needs to be done etc"
good,"Rite Aid is a workplace where you are always helping people. "
good,I absolutely loved working for rite aid up until i had to quit due to a harassment issue with costumers that was not handles correctly. but other than that i loved my job and had a lot of room to advance within the company.
good,Overall a great place to work for people who are motivated and ambitious.  I would recommend Rite Aid to anyone looking to improve  themselves professionally
good,"If you have a good manager and are in a good area this job can be very relaxing and easy for the pay you get. It is not constantly busy unless you are in Pharmacy so it can be pretty slow paced which is good and bad. It's less work over all, but time goes by very slowly. Generally they get good people to work for them so your co-workers can be pretty awesome."
good,"I enjoy my job but I don't feel I am making the amount of money I could be making. I don't feel I have any more room for advancement. "
good,"omit, I really liked working at Rite-Aid as a Certified Pharmacy Technician sad to say I had to leave. Did have a change to go another Rite-Aid, but I got lost. After I was told to go there for the day."
good,No matter how tired you get and how slow workflow can be try to keep yourself busy and don’t forget to keep a smile as much as you can and be polite even when you are having a bad day time goes by faster
good,"Typical retail setting , very fast paced very busy met a lot of interesting people ,always fun and interesting from meeting different people from different cultures ,different views always revolving and fun and sometimes hectic."
good,I liked the company overall but it has been bought out by Walgreens so we have been going through a very slow transition. The transition is not going as well as I would have liked it to go.
good,I learned a lot about customer service and the management team and work experience in general was good. Rite Aid is a store that will help build your customer service skills and become a team player.
good,"If you guys are looking for a great place to work at for a first job; rite aid is a place for you , management was cool but strict when work is not done"
good,"Every work day is about the same. You have same tasks to complete and you have your usual customers. It can get hectic on the weekends, since the location has a huge liquor selection. The employees are awesome and are willing to jump in and help at any time. The hardest part of the job is having to juggle stocking and running register at the same time. The store gets super busy, so you will do alot of running back and forth."
good,I was still young while working so I didn't get to enjoy much of what was going on. I usually only paid attention to the pay check because I was working while in school.
good,"As in every business, if you train your employees right, you can then be the manager (or leader) you are paid to be. Otherwise, you might end up doing everything (receiving the deliveries, stock clerk, merchandiser, cashier, etc.)."
good,"This job was a good place to work with room for advancement. The benefits were also good. Like any small town, winter hours are limited. The staff here is great."
good,"I liked working there very much. I liked the fact that you never got bored, there was always something to do. I liked helping the customers in any way that I could."
good,"Typical day includes helping customers with their inquiries, stocking shelves and setting up planograms. Also, helping the customers connect to the pharmacy."
good,"Rite Aid had many ongoing programs for pharmacists to participate in. Unfortunately, the technician help was fairly insignificant to handle the heavy volume and the requirements of the job. Much emphasis on screenings, vaccinations, consulting, MTM's, and other patient services."
good,"As assistant Manager in Rite Aid , I did learn how to manage whole store, how to deal with costumer, vendor, deliveries from the warehouse , very good costumer services , guide the employees, to be sure everybody was doing theirs duties. Be sure the store was always welcome everybody in the very warm environment, to making them to come back over and over again to shopping in this store."
good,"Over the last year that I've worked at this establishment, I've grown very fond of all of my coworkers. I have never worked anywhere that has had a more employee-oriented environment before. We all come from different backgrounds and we're different ages and ranks within the company, but we all feel a sense of community within the ""Rite Aid family"". I know that sounds a little cheesy, but from previous experiences in poor work environments, a friendly atmosphere is definitely something you don't want to take for granted and something that I truly feel I have experienced at this company. "
good,"A typical day at work were regular opening duties. These duties included greeting customers, cleaning registers, tidying up store isles and preparing for vaccination season. I would learn new information in regards to medicine and proper care of wounds/injuries. I would get a look into pharmacy staff operations. I enjoyed discussing issues with the pharmacist and cultivating solutions to those issues."
good,"I learn a lot when I was working there I learn how to talk to the costumer and do stock. Also is better when you get to know all your partner, is fun."
good,"Being a people person this position helped me enhanced my customer service skills, and gave me an insight in the management culture of a corporation.  For that I'm very grateful."
good,"Have to work with a team. Every six months you can change the department or a truck ( forklift, rich truck..) every six month your payment will increase by some cents.."
good,Great place to work at. Very fast paced. Great customers. My co-workers are all very nice and friendly people to work with. I would recommend someone to go and work there.
good,"I have been with the company for 7 years and although every business has ups and downs, I love my job and the people I work with. My support team is get and always available with issues arise."
good,It's a small store pharmacy patient are mostly elderly. Have been treated well for 4 years. The 10 hour days are long but enjoyable. Love customers they are wonderful.
good,"A typical day at work consists of investigating potential employee and customer thefts. This is done using camera footage, a transaction database, and an inventory databases."
good,"A typical involved filling prescriptions, counselling patients, providing immunisations and resolving customer issues. Here I learned to be a better team player. The hardest part of the job was inadequate staffing for the tasks that needed to be performed. The most enjoyable part was helping customers to attain a higher medication related quality of life."
good,"There are days we can be really busy, as well as there are days we can have time to relax. Dealing with customers can either be peaceful but we have our moments as well as days it can be stressful. Besides that, our customers are what help us improve on ourselves and our ability to kmprove our work enthusiasm. Everyday there is always something new to learn no matter how many years you have worked there you will come across something new as the days go by. I wouldn't be who I am today if I weren't capable of gaining this experience working for Rite Aid. Life is hard as it is but working for companies that will help you find ways through your struggles to reach that achievement you will start to appreciate every part of it."
good,A typical day at work involved serving our patients with excellent customer service skills and making sure we as a team complete our daily prescription fill goals. I have learned excellent customer service skills and interpersonal communication skills. The most enjoyable part of my day was knowing that I am helping the community better there health by providing patients with the medicine they need and also working with my co-workers.
good,It's pretty simple just taking care of customers and stocking shelves and cleaning. To me the hardest thing to do was vacuuming the floor. I loved to help do truck it always made the day go by faster and I would get off earlier but the only downside was I had to be there between 3-5 am most of the time.
good,"On a typical work day, I help customers finish making their purchases by checking them out at the register. I spend time facing the store to ensure that customers can find what they are looking for with ease in an organized setting. I've learned how to approach people face to face and happily put others' needs before my own. Management is great because we have a store manager who is strong-willed and leads by example. Associates are encouraged to advance in their positions.  The fast paced environment makes work fun and keeps you sharp. The most enjoyable part about working at Rite-Aid is leaving customers satisfied with smiles on their faces as they walk out the door."
good,"I mainly worked at the register checking customers out.  Throughout my work day, I also answered phone calls, stocked merchandise, checked in merchandise, cleaned the store and assisted customers in any way possible."
good,"Nice place to work. Room for advancement, great opportunity. There was some favoritism that was accepted. Would go back if accepted."
good,"Data input, answering phones, counting pills, running register, customer service. Management is great! Hardest part of the job is the stress, like most jobs. My favorite part was interacting with our regular customers."
good,i was a pharmacy technician i actually loved it.. they were very flexible with me however it was only bc we had a limited number of work hours and i always got the least considering i was new.. but since working there it made me pursue a career in psychiatry..
good,"I've learned a lot working for Rite Aid. I started out as an associate. I've made my way up to a wellness ambassador. Not only did I learn HOW to do my job but I also was taught valuable life skills. My coworkers are like my second family, I share everything with them. I believe the hardest part of my job is the customers that leave disappointed; or less than satisfied with our service. But even with that being said, the most enjoyable aspect of my job IS THE CUSTOMERS! After all.. ""A happy customer is a loyal customer"". I've made good friends with my customers. "
good,I enjoyed the time I was at Rite-Aid. I met some wonderful people while I was there. Sweet Pharmacists and co-workers. I was only there for a short time. I had another job opportunity closer to my home.
good,Does well in engaging with customers. The management is great and the employees are also. I would really recommend this job to anyone in need of a career.
good,Rite Aid had a supportive and efficient work environment. The entire staff was helpful while learning and getting settled at the new store.
good,"A healthy work environment with great staff and management. I got closer to a lot of customers while building a friendly and professional relationship with them. A typical day at work consisted of maintaining store grounds, greeting and engaging customers, keeping shelves stocked and accessible for customers."
good,not bad for a year or two but for a career you might want to look somewhere else if your a field worker. co workers aren't bad but some are underpaid.
good,"I would come in working each day"
good,This place gave me the chance to be a very supportive and productive leader.This was a great leadership experiance. I loved the people and the the work environment.
good,I would recommend Rite Aid as a place to work. Good opportunity for advancement. The staff is great and is rewarding to teach. I find it very rewarding working with the regular customers who come into the stores who very much know the staff in their local pharmacy.
good,"Rite Aid is overall a great company to work for. The duties of the Job requirements aren't as hard as they seem and the benefits if full time are great, the work."
good,"I manage the team in the front,"
good,It is important to provide the best customer service possible. It is also important to inform customers how important they are to the business.
good,I started with this company at the age of 18 and only worked about a year as the main cashier in the pharmacy. Therefore I don't know the ins and outs of other positions. I imagine it is a lot like other retail opportunities.
good,"Helping and pleasing customers and able to see the smile when you've help someone.The hardest part of my job is turning a customer away when we are out of a product or rain check for a product, but over all the best part of my job is  greeting and hearing stories of most customers and how i was able to help them pick a certain product that best fits there needs."
good,"Going into work everyday was exciting because I was always learning something new with the medicine.Like what they where for and how you use them. I had a routine that I performed everyday for the pharmacist .My manager was one of the pharmacist. She was one of the most down to earth people that I know. She thought me about everything I needed to know. She would quiz me on certain things that we talked about just to make sure I knew the difference between different medications and what they where for. That made me love the job even more. My co workers where very supportive and would help train anybody that wanted to learn what to do. The hardest part of the job was to stay on top on the medications when they where coming in from different doctors offices . Making sure that they where done by a certain time because it was store policy . Making sure the customer doesnt come back upset because there medicine isnt ready when u tell them is going to .The most enjoyable part of the job is helping others .especially if i know that they need this medicine that we have ready for them. Knowing that I helped make them feel better, makes me feel great !"
good,At times it was annoying but I learned to appreciate what I had and kept moving forward. Long hours mostly because remodeling a store required moving and changing the store completely. Most of the people I worked with where kind and hardworking.
good,"A day working in the Rite Aid pharmacy is non-stop work. Being a busy pharmacy, we expect to consistently have patient medication prescriptions and requests in our queue. Patients are waiting to be serviced, phones are ringing constantly whether it be for prescription refill requests or doctors' offices. Being a pharmacy technician is both a stressful and rewarding position. One can learn a thing or two about time management, multi-tasking, and still providing excellent customer service by placing the customer still at the top of the priority list. My pharmacy managers consistently teach me new things and are willing to take time out of their day to do so. Teamwork is the main method of having a successful store and at Rite Aid, employees place emphasis on working together to get the job done. The most difficult part of the position is probably focusing on getting all tasks done, because one may have had to help four customers all at once and it's difficult to balance everything on one plate. Dedication and not feeling overwhelmed is difficult but doable. I really enjoy the fulfillment this job has given me, including the skills."
good,The work environment was very unpredictable; it could be very busy or boring as can be. My management team was extremely helpful and kind. Almost feels like a game to fill all the prescriptions in the work queue by the end of the day.
good,"The Manager & other co-workers were very helpful, very kind & very focused on doing things the right way. The job was very stable, you pretty much always knew what your day would hold. The truck delivery days were my favorite, because I had a lot to do at a quick pace, and it helped the day go by much easier and faster. The only reason I left was due to hour cut backs."
good,A typical day for me is completing all my regular duties in a timely manner. Co-workers and management create a good work environment. Work is not too much to handle and the atmosphere is not stressful. I'm very qualified for multiple jobs and have a vast knowledge due to my time spent at current job so I am open to help in other areas when needed. There really isn't a hard part to the job. Just be willing to learn and open to some changes every once in a while.
good,"I found I truly enjoyed the 6 years I was with this company."
good,"top priority. Served as Store Manger, District Manger, and Human Resources.  Worked with outstanding Pharmacist and management. Really enjoyed being involved with all state laws and controls. Had a strong working relationship with Loss Prevention. With-in my second year as HR  -  Won HR for the year over the entire Company, this was quite an honor"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of greeting, helping co-workers and organizing products and doing inventory counts and re-stocking, and helping customers be cashed out at the register. My store manager is new but he fits in nicely with the Rite Aid ""family"". The most enjoyable part of my job is helping people find what they are looking for and being able to introduce them to new things that the store has to offer."
good,"During the 12 hours that I spent on the job with Rite Aid, I was challenged and motivated to improve myself everyday as a Pharmacist. I was a leader as well as a team player, working with consideration for my fellow employee. While the workload was intense, it was likewise rewarding, allowing me to gain extensive experiences in patient management and prioritizing my time. With this experience, I look forward to moving forward in the field and building on my skills with persistence and dedication."
good,"Greeting customers making sure their shopping experience was great."
good,"I enjoy working with my co-workers, there is a smooth flow working with them. My job consists of a daily routine and completing the daily tasks in a timely manner."
good,I would get to work and get into whatever scripts came in. I learned about meds in my spare time. I didn't work with anyone but my pharmacist except for about an hour a day. The worse part were Mondays the best part was when it was done and knowing we were quick.
good,days are fun all the time  nice co-workers  job was never hard   love work with my co-workers
good,"A typical day at work included opening the store and counting registers, maintaining cash office, photo shop and inventory. Ensuring cleanliness and organization of sales floor. Assisting associates, pharmacist and customers when needed. I would make bank deposits as necessary."
good,"A typical day at work would be bagging merchandise, facing merchandise, and answering the phone when customer need help or information about a piece of merchandise. I learned excellent customer service skills. And I learned how to deal with customer that are upset about a merchandise or the policies in a matter that keeps the customers calm. My co-workers and I have a workplace relationship and we work as a team to get tasks done. My most enjoyable part about my job is helping people and selling merchandise."
good,"I am extremely comfortable with this company and the managers that I have at both of my store locations I work, and my LPM. My LPM is very supportive and gives productive advice when asked. My store managers communicate issues that they are having in store, especially theft situations."
good,"There is rarely a ""Slow day"" at a rite aid pharmacy. I have worked at two different locations in one year alone, and it is much more diverse than I thought. At the previous location, it was more about quality than quantity. We would give our 15 minute guarantee and we would make sure that everything went smoothly before calling the customer over-provided we didn't need additional information; at the current location, its all about the production numbers. The staff likes to do their scripts in great volume, they of course do not spare on quality or excellent customer service, but it is very fast paced. As a Pharmacy tech student, I learned alot about how the same principles were applied in the field in real time, how HIPAA was enforced, and what insurance companies would and would not pay for. I have always had the pleasure to work with very knowlegible techs and pharmacists, who always had something new to teach me. The hardest part for me was the speed sometimes, personally it can be a bit, rushing from one customer to the next to hurry an order they have asked for and then hurry along to help the person behind them; the most enjoyable part was the great friends I have made. I have made personal relationships with some of the best people you could have for co workers; I have not yet been displeased."
good,"wonderful place to be in,but they had no Pharmacist in charge for this store,all we had was floaters.."
good,Great company to work for.  Excellent benefits.  Great Management.  Great atmosphere.  I really recommend anyone looking for a long term answer this is it.  The only thing is getting paid more is a little hard.  
good,Great team to work with Job Advancement was welcomed and encouraged.
good,Show great customer service towards customers. Sometimes you work with upper management on different duties. Co-workers are nice and are willing to help.
good,"assoicates go into a mod of fun stuff to pick and pack for all the stores around the states. Managment is always there for help and questions, hardest part is making sure you have the right information tags to pick. The enjoyable thing is all that stuff you just picked will arrive at your stores to buy the next week or so for you to enjoy."
good,"A typical day was very hectic but a lot of fun. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and customers very much. The hardest part of the job were days when short staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and employees. I couldn't have asked for better bosses. There was just no room for advancement. I learned many different things such as; medication backgrounds and purposes, medical conditions, prescription information."
good,I have learned how to deal with all types of people as a cashier.
good,"clock in, start my computer and then start filling prescriptions for the day. Answer phone calls, help customers with pick-ups and drop offs. Ring out customers at the counter or at the drive thru window. assist the pharmacist with doctor call backs for refill request. Everday is a learning experience. Once a week I meet with the store manager and the pharmacy manager on our goals and sales progress reports to analize where we need improvements. I then pass this information on to the rest of the staff, both front end and pharmacy. The hardest part of my job would be to not complete all of my daily task do to lack of coverage(meaning some one has called out and I would be taken away from one task to do another). Other than that I love want I do. I enjoy all aspects of my job, I enjoy helping people in anyway that I can. I like it when I know that a customer has had a pleasant shopping experience with us, and to know that they will continue to shop with us and even tell a few friends about our service."
good,Management trusted employees to know their job and to make the right decisions. If you were a hard worker you had a high level of freedom.
good,"A typical day at work would be: help with straightening the store, making sure the store is kept clean and presentable, money pick-ups, money drops, customer service, making sure workers take their assigned breaks and lunches, backroom (pull repot), and some more customer service."
good,typical day at work is walking around promoting flu shots and helping customers find what they need and bringing them to the pharmacist when needed. my coworkers are great we all get along really well and management is very professional.
good,"A typical day at Rite Aid for me was walking in the door, clocking in and doing a walk through of the store, to see if there were any empty boxes or cases laying around. After collecting the empty boxes I would then tally the amount stolen. I would sit in the front office watching the front camera until I saw someone with shifty eyes and just overall suspicious. I would then slip out unnoticed and follow them. We had smoke tiles in the ceiling allowing me to be an isle or two over without them being able to see me. I would observe their actions and whether or not they stole something, is when I would take action."
good,Working at Rite aid was a great experience. The customers were friendly most days and they were easy to satisfy. I learned to overcome my shyness and built relationships with everyday shoppers. The managers were kind of rude to the employees but I just focused on the task at hand. I worked over time and I went days without taking a break and I didnt get paid for it. Somethings they wont train you on something until you do it wrong.
good,I was a field service tech for Rite Aid. Due to an illness in my family I had to leave Rite Aid. I wish I could have kept the job. The management was one of the better I have ever delt with.
good,A great starting place while gonig to school or even trying to advance your career
good,They are a little understaffed but all around a great place to work and move up. The hours can be a little crazy at times and they are open till 12 so theres not much you can do after work.
good,"Pay is not that great. Holiday pay, Christmas off. People are great. It is a fast pace job. Company wants more out of their techs, but no pay increase."
good,"I have had a variety of managers, and they can either make the job miserable, or a blessing. I do wish the company would stop pretending that they want everyone vaccinated because they care when it is really about charging insurance companies for thousands of dollars in vaccinations."
good,As a pharmacist I had the fortune of being heard when giving suggestions which would allow for easier workflow and employee safety. Sorry to see it go
good,"I enjoyed working for RiteAid which was a complete 180 degree turn from CenturyLink. I worked with the individual store managers on various technical issues and they treated me like I was human being. I loved my bosses and co-workers. Unfortunately I was unable to advance to a Network Operations technician because of ""Lacks interpersonal skills"". I attended college certification classes to address this issue, and when the position became open again and I applied with this certificate on the application, they wrote back stating ""nothing has changed"", this harmed me mentally for the rest of my time at Rite Aid and was afraid to apply to anything else."
good,I have learned a lot of skills and had lots of advancements in this job. They always worked with me to make me the best employee and to help others achieve their goals.
good,"Rite aid was a good place to work at. Learned a lot about the working world while I was working there. I had to wake up at 3 am for truck day, and thats when I started to learn working isn't a cup of coffee"
good,"Customers were great and enjoyed working with my fellow employees! The job was not easy balancing work and kids but they worked with me so I could make ends meet for both, home and work!"
good,"warehouse picker; pull select items from shelves and load container for delivery.Great hour.  Easy going co-workers, management need to be more equal no favoritism."
good,"Regular small retail. The store mgr here is awesome he actually does work, not just sit around dictating. He tries with the scheduling and is very reasonable. I really like my coworkers and we all really get along and try to help one another, we have are differences but it rarely turns into anything. The worst part is the lack of pay or even raises, 1.5-2% max raise is terrible. And there is a real bad problem with people coming in and stealing EVERYTHING. Having no AP really sucks and people are desperate that you dont know if they will shoot or stab you if you try to stop the theft."
good,I learned a lot while working for Rite-Aid.  I did a lot of CRT data entry and payroll.  I also did a great deal of phone work talking to store managers.
good,My Rite Aid experience was a great company to work for although we did not have any bonus incentives offered but it's still a great company to work for. Although my job is closing in a few months I still wish to remain a cashier with another company unless I go back to my dream job of being a Flight Attendant again.
good,"I truly enjoyed being a cashier at Rite Aid. Work attitude depends on management style. Luckily, I had the best manager. Flexible with hours, as a student this is important, as schedules change each term. The store ran smoothly despite being busy most of the time, and  having irresponsible coworkers who, would not show up at all, and they would eventually quit. A typical day, depending what shift/day of the week basically would be ringing customers up, customer service,  or/and on the floor facing, stocking, setting displays, bottle counts.... The workplace is what you make it!! Your attitude, your response to situations, determine your perspective on your job. Some cons, included minimum wage pay for whole two years working there, short staffed- often skipping class to come in, toxic coworkers - micromanagement by several ""supervisors"", 10 minute breaks, grouchy customers, etc. Pros include 20% discount, flexibility in hours, friendships created, strengthening my own skills, experiences.That being said, I would go back in time to relive my days as a cashier, as I became comfortable working with my team."
good,"Easy environment  to work in, great people. As with any retail job comes occasional frustration but definitely avoidable if you keep yourself from the drama. Overall great place to work if you know how to keep to yourself staying friendly and positive with the guests in your store. Keep in mind that in a pharmacy there will always be guests either sick or caring for someone sick, so being extra courteous with extra patience is a must, especially for “Wellness Wednesday” which extends to the guests 65+ and aren’t able to hear well or move very fast at the register. But applying the extra care for these guests is rewarded in a warm, pleasant checkout that instantly boosts your mood."
good,It was a great job and I would go back to work there if I could. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the customers that came in were great. Its a good place to work.
good,Fast paced work environment with a group of like minded individuals who treat patients as family and not just another person coming through the door. Everyone works together as a team to make sure patients needs are met and they leave feeling happier than when they came in.
good,RITE aid was a great experience. I've learned so much with customers and medication. It was always a fast paced environment. I was always on the go. Helped customers get there medication and helped fill as well.  Troubles i had was they didn't offer enough hours and didnt have a set schedule. I adjusted my schedule around rite aid which wasn't so bad but it seemed my hours kept getting cut more often then others. They pay was also minimum wage. Rite aid is the lowest paying pharmacy assistant. In the end I respect the company.
good,I was hired as a Pharmacy Tech with no experience.  The on the job training was exceptional.  I learned about the different drugs and how to package them for prescriptions.  I also worked the register in the pharmacy and spoke to the customers about their experience with Rite Aid.
good,I enjoy the company that I work for. They have very flexible schedules that can accommodate any person young or old. Working here has given me confidence in customer service. I highly recommend rite aid for a job opportunity.
good,Enjoyed profession very much. love to help people. Always gave 110% at work. I was taught at an early age in life to give my best at whatever endeavor I under took. Be honest and loyal.
good,Enjoyed my years with Rite Aid. My team feels like a family instead of just another 9-5. Pay could be better though with better benefits for employees.
good,"Work flow is efficient and quick"
good,Good place to work at. I had no issues with people. Management was great to work with. Environment was very relaxed. Quality was decent as well. Breaks we're good distance.
good,Check sales visit stores that were running negative sales. Learned about food and safety. Executed company policy and company programs. Store conditions  we up to standards.
good,Rite Aid was my first job I ever had. It helped me build my customer service skills and taught me a lot about medications and medical terminology. It also taught me time management because I was working while going to college full time.
good,"Rite Aid was a very stead paced, multipurpose store. A lot of focus is on customer service and stock awareness. The most enjoyable part of the job was the repeat customer base. Many of the same  customers shop the store weekly if not more for their medical needs, as well as, their everyday personal needs."
good,"Great team, great management, low turnover, low stress. Fun and flexible job atmosphere. Great opportunity for advancement. Family atmosphere. Customer service was included in decisions regarding new products and services"
good,I had a lot of fun working here. I learned a lot about retail drugs. Lots of training. My only grumble was the low pay scale. Team was excellent. Pharmacy manager was awesome. Very caring and dedicated
good,"Rite Aid was a very good place, and  would recommend everybody to apply ! The hardest part of the job as a supervisor was the constant back and forth between managerial duties and front end work."
good,Every store I worked at as a Pharmacy manager was enjoyable. The company gave their employees stability and a lot of work space in the lab . Loved working there as a whole and training pharmacists and technicians was a lot of fun .
good,I worked at Rite Aid for almost 6 years. its a fast pace job and you have to get your numbers every day. it is a great place to meet friends (it is where I met my husband) lol. the hardest part of working there was the summer time heat. when the outside temps reaches 95 it feels like 115 inside the warehouse.
good,"Provided many employee social opportunities to relax and have fun,  Management was fully engaged with employees. Objectives were clearly provided and proactively met all challenges."
good,Good management personalities. Directors and House Supervisors are pleasant. Co workers try to help each other and work well together on my home floor and others I have floated to.
good,"it is  a nice and easy enviorment to work at and you catch on easily."
good,"Room for advancemnt - great training services, and .well versed mixed management. Try to support you as long as you make it importamt to help yourself."
good,Out of all my jobs I would say that this one was my second favorite. I love my co-workers although at times they were annoying. I met a lot of new people. It was fun to work there. It keeps you busy and that made the day go buy faster.
good,"Had a great experience with this employer. Worked with my full time job scheduling to accommodate my part time schedule with them. Were also aware of my being a single parent and were supportive and understanding when emergencies arise (especially in lieu of the fact that both stores I provided cashier duties to were managed by the same person and she, too, was a single mother juggling work and home life.)"
good,"if you like to be in a high volume work place and prescriptions and patients are always on demand this is the job for you. A fast paced work environment, with calls, doctor offices calling n prescriptions and or faxed in, all prescriptions must be completed in a timely manner."
good,"It is currently under new management, however, the assistant manager is personable towards customers and staff. Typically start a little above minimum wage."
good,"The time I worked here I enjoyed every moment, this job was flexible with my schedule while in school , the environment around this area is well developed and safe, working hours are adjustable"
good,"Worked for years as a Field Technician.  Great people, pay and work.  If you are into. I. T field try them out.  Work life can get a little off balanced at times but nothing that last for ever."
good,"Rite aid was a lovely place to work."
good,"Productive and fun workplace. Would have stayed with company, but distribution center move it's operations to a new facility in Spartanburg, SC."
good,"The employees there were very patient with me when I started, they made me feel extremely comfortable there!  The pharmacy was usually busy, but we were very productive!"
good,"Good place to work but stressful I learn a little bit about insurance bill, coworkers are great but the pharmacy manager does not to how to train tech"
good,"My day at Rite aid consist of morning task, for example putting out tills. Assigning task to all employees for the day, and having a 10 min huddle with my employees. All of my employees are good workers.The hardest part of my job is running a store with little help, and the best part of my job are the customer's."
good,Great Work enviorment. Steady job with job security. Although there is no way to advance in the company. Overall enjoyable work enviroment with lots of ways to learn.
good,"My experience at Rite Aid has been great. I can't say that there is anything in particular that to absolutely hate. The store I come from is a high volume store. The fact that it's a high volume store keeps you busy and for the most part you always have something to do. I would say that both the management and my co-workers are a dream to work with. Teamwork is a big deal for us, and as a group we have learned to value that. ""The work isn't over until everyone is finished."" is the ethic that we work with. The hardest part of my job is also the reason I enjoy my job. Working with people. Im sure we can all agree that working with people can be a headache. Even so you do get to meet some nice and funny people though out your day."
good,"Ultimately I love working at Rite Aid. All of my co-workers have a great attitude and I feel like we all want to be there and work together. I have learned how to run two cash registers at once, handle problem customers (which are frequent in the part of town our store is in), multitask, and deal with different types of managers. My managers are great - the only problem is that different managers have different rules and that I do not like about the job. I think they should all be on the same page. The best part of the job is the people, customers and co-workers and everyone in between. The hardest part is pleasing everyone which, again, is a personnel issue."
good,"Great job, Love being able to assist customers and help them better their lives. Co-workers are great you work so closely together u become your own little family."
good,"Working at Rite Aid was a perfect job to have as a high school student. I learned how to stock shelves, work the cash register, and practiced working with a team. My manager and co-workers were very nice, and everyone was really respectful to each other. The only negative thing about this job was trying to find something to do to keep myself busy."
good,"It was always a blessing to wake up and get ready for work. I enjoyed  the new things i would learn, and new faces i would see. Work was challenge on most days, but i managed to survive. I learned how their system works, and the do's and don't of the pharmacy. Management was always welcoming, i met a lot of the managers from different stores and they had no problems with me. The hardest thing about my job was i had to travel to different stores. I was going to about 4 different stores in one week. I didn't drive so i would have to ask for rides, that was my struggle. The most enjoyable part of my job was i was able to work in a different environment and i loved what i was doing. Working in a pharmacy, learning new things and helping people was my joy."
good,"A typical work day for me, would be for me to come in at 9:30pm get  prepared for work that started at 10:00pm. After i start, I would work the next open register until 12:00 pm untill the customer traffic slows down. Then i would restock shelve and check innovatory until 7:00am."
good,this is a great start to your future. work hard to your dreams and one day you can become manger!
good,Responsible to implement fixed asset software. Able to implement the project successfully.
good,I enjoyed my time at Rite Aid. Everyone was out going and very helpful. I learned a lot training there.
good,"On a typical day, I help customers locate items throughout the store as well as prepare prescription orders for patients. I have learned time management throughout my seven and a half years at Rite Aid. I love the management team. The management team here are very helpful in getting employees everything one possible need in the workplace. My coworkers are like a small family away from away home."
good,"One of most enjoyable part when working at Rite Aide was getting to know so much different culture and people. The hardest part of my job will have to be finish my co-workers work when I came in for my shift. I've got along with my co-workers on and off work hours I still keep in touch with them today. Management at rite aid was great well manageable. When worked at Rite Aid I learn that respect and communicate will get for in life even when not working in a work place. A typical day at Rite Aide will have to be crazy, fast, and excitement there always something new and enjoyable to learn ."
good,i started as a cashier and was able to become managment within the first year and half. pay and benefits was great for the amount of expected work that needed to be done. customers and coworkers were fun and amazing to be around. everything was enjoyable and the only hard part was dealing with couponers.
good,"Would work there again. The staff was fun, nice, and courteous"
good,I found Rite Aid to be a comfortable work environment for the most part.
good,"I work at a very busy environment, where varies people come with varies concern and attitude. While working in such environment,  have learned that patients is key. As a team leader, I flourish well in a team environment and also work well with others. I give respect to my co- workers as well as everyone in my surrounding. The most hardest part of my job is working with difficult customers, however with patients and also as a helping professional i have to coop and redirect them in order to turn a negative situation into a positive one. The most enjoyable part of my job is always meeting varies people from all different diversity and leaving a smile of their faces after serving them."
good,"Wonderful place to work, great for college kids, flexible hours, competitive pay."
good,"Working as a Technician at Rite Aid was great."
good,i worked with alot of good people and learned alot about retail and customer service and i definately enjoyed the oppurtunity to work there
good,"An enthusiastic hard student who wants to find a position that will guide me in the direction of responsibility that would direct me in the right path as a young adolescent. I’m a reliable, trustworthy and dedicated young student. I am capable of working with others as a team and get the tasks at hand done effectually."
good,"The job is that of a typical cashier/stock-boy at any pharmacy. It consists of processing cash and credit transactions and providing good customer service to the patrons. Management is very approachable and attempts to help associate's in any way possible. As does any profession, the position has its faults and requires a great deal of patients when dealing with some ""difficult"" patrons. Over-all though, I have found my employment here to be educational in regard to improving my customer service knowledge and skills."
good,"I loved this job because its fast paced and it always kept me thinking. I learned a lot from Rite Aid such as SIG codes, different personality types of different patients, and how to work well and safety. The manager was very nice and patient with me as I learned the ways of Rite Aid, but I pick it up quickly. My co-workers were fun to talk to, even though they were all older then me, and they were always looking out for me as I looked out for them. We were truly a team. The hardest part about the job was talking and dealing with the costumers and their problems. Sometimes, I could handle it, sometimes, I called for back up. Sometimes, I was randomly yelled at by the costumer because something wasn't going right with their medication, but I didn't show any signs of being nervous, did my job to the best of its potential, and dealt with every costumer."
good,"I was a cashier at Rite Aid and also do customer service and also I do display, receiving inventory. my job was great"
good,"company sold to another Drug store company Walgreens, before that felt company was great place to work at. I wish they had no sold out and had the growth in which they really stood for sad that company folded"
good,I was to secure the store however I wanted to move up in the company so I got close with the manager and learned everything he knew. It was a fun environment
good,"I had a very patient and energetic manager that allowed me to learn with no pressure and was always going above and beyond to make me feel like I could always do more than my own expectations of myself. The salary was fair and the workload was smooth. Riteaid far exceeds Walgreens on all fronts in my opinion, and I've worked both places."
good,Good job to start off at if other companies would not want to hire the technician. A good way to start learning how most retail pharmacies work. Would recommend.
good,"Rite aid is a very good place to work. Great management, positive attitude co- workers, flexible with schedules if going to school. Fast pace environment with great customers."
good,The people that I work with was easy to around. I also knew a lot of people that work there. When I was working there the gas wasn't that expensive during that time.
good,"Rite Aid was a very good place to work. Relationships with upper management were strong, and there was always a sense of guidance. Rate of pay was competitive, and raises were given. I enjoyed my time at Rite Aid."
good,"fast paced working environment , friendly helpful co-workers and manager . It's also a learning place where everyday you advance more learning new things hands on"
good,Only downfall for me was that I had to get up at 3 in the morning to help unload trucks with ALL MANAGERS for an 11 hour shift. I know for a fact they got paid waaaaayyy more then minimum wage.
good,Its a regular retail job for young people it should be a place to start getting some work experience to start building up your resume but depending on who you work with it could be a fun work place.
good,"this is actually my first job and I'm still there 8 years later. I love meeting new people everyday and getting to know certain customers. you also are able to learn a little bit of management and price adjustment skills, dealing with couponers, LEARNING how to coupon etc"
good,"I started as a Cashier and soon advanced to be a shift supervisor, great friendly work-place and room to grow within a great company. If you work hard you will be rewarded! Great company and highly recommend to anyone looking work in retail or pharmaceuticals."
good,"Mostly stick to the register, but do more on the weekends with tag sales and then once every few weeks is truck day. Keeping the place clean is a necessity as well as rearranging some of the store set-ups. I've learned a lot about sales and how the system works. All of the management within the store are very nice and actually work with you. They make sure you know what you're doing before they start leaving you alone at the register, especially if you haven't had experience with a register. The hardest part of the job is finding things to do while waiting for customers to come in. This store does't get as many front-end sales as it does pharmacy. I like the easy-going environment. A lot of the customers who do come in are very sweet and enjoyable to talk to."
good,"I've been working here for about 5 years, management is simple and easy to work with, will work with you on scheduling, multiple job opportunities within the store, easy training. Benefits are great, full time is 32 hours, benefits come in at 35. friendly and easy on work/life management"
good,I've learned to greet just about everyone because it does make a difference in the customer experience. Being apart of the management staff taught me how to be a team player.
good,"Rite Aid was a great place for advancement.  I was able to become supervisor and had the opportunity to work with people that had a great work ethic as I did.  I learned to cashier there and supervise the store and it's employees.  I did recalls, ordered merchandise,  Stocking freight and working on planograms were just some of the jobs I performed.  The people there were great to work for and I enjoyed helping customers.  That is the best part of the job.  Helping people find what they need and making sure they are happy."
good,Rite Aid is a great company that really cares about the employees and their well being.  In the time that I've been with Rite Aid I have been challenged and have learned a lot to help me be a better manager.
good,"Helping customer find what they needed, helping the staff stack shelves."
good,"I go into work and I know already it's going to be an easy day. I know exactly what to do and I know I can get the job done. I learned that this job depends on a lot of team work and I love team work. If no one is communicating if they are having issues with getting work done there will be problems later so I like to ask people when I am finished if they need help. My co-workers are great people and they love team work. The management is some very nice people and they help motivate us. The hardest part can be when someone falls behind and we all have to go help them. I just like coming in, seeing that everyone wants to get the job done and that helps me get motivated for the day."
good,"Over Night Shift Stock Associate, and Cashier"
good,I learn how to wait on customers and how to have patient with the customers. I learned how to develop pictures and how to take passports. I also learn how to check in vendors. I learn how to fill prescriptions in the pharmacy.
good,"Rite Aid is a good company to work, I don't know right now but at the time I used to work it gives competitive salary, good benefit and compensation."
good,"I love working with the public. I learned a lot with this company. I have learned merchandising tips and ordering merchandise. I know it takes team work and I enjoy working with ever employee with Rite Aid .Opening the daily office work, checking on sales for the day and the week. Scheduling my staff for the day of their duties. Bank duties such as deposits and change. Walk the sales floor for stocking merchandising and cleaning. Ordering merchandise and store supplies. Greeting Customers and having a pep talk with my staff on sales and their ideals. All duties just different days."
good,Working as a pharmacy technician has helped me understand how important it is to have great attention to detail. The thing I loved most was the bond that developed with each of the customers. Essentially the patients were putting their trust in me to make sure I was giving them the correct drug to improve their health.
good,"Very hectic, and always busy it is a different type of experience the hardest part of my job is taking a lunch because theres never any coverage."
good,Delighted with the work life balance I found here. The management seemed genuinely interested in the career of their employees.
good,"I liked working for this company, was hired full time and hours got cut and money was not good nor the hours. Great staff and management, overall good store."
good,"I have learned many skills in my 5 plus years at Rite Aid. I have come across many different people, nationalities and ethnic backgrounds in this job. My co-workers are helpful and follow my directions when given. The management above me is helpful and willing to provide the skills and knowledge needed to advance myself in the job, and in life. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting the satisfaction of helping a customer find their daily needs and get them in-and-out of the store."
good,"I worked here all during college and they were super flexible with my hours. My co-workers were wonderful and the Pharmacists I worked for were great! The hardest part of the job is learning all of the medicines, but the most enjoyable part is getting to know your patients."
good,A typical day was fixing the product on shelves. I learned how to set up displays and planograms. My two managers were always helpful in answering questions I had about the job. The hardest part of my day was closing time.
good,morning customers are the best they wake up so golly its make u have a good day.
good,I really enjoyed working at Rite Aid. I learned the most at this job.
good,At rite aid I was a cashier. I would also stock shelves once a week and deal with customer service.  You get consistent breaks to eat or just relax and they are flexible with scheduling.
good,"A typical day at work was cashiering and stocking merchandising. I learned how to operate a cash register, how to do every transaction, sign customers up for the Wellness+ Card, where to stock the merchandise, where to put damaged items, and how to set up displays. The workplace culture was very good. I worked with a variety of people. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was organizing the displays for the customers."
good,"I love working with rite aid, but unfortunately I need a job with a little more pay.. my cost of living does not meet my income..I would recommend  rite aid to anyone"
good,Learn new things how to manage more the cashier also the schedules how to maintain the store give associate their assignments. Learn how to greet and socialize with customers
good,Great hours. Great pay. Great benefits. Willing to work with personal life schedule. Everyone is friendly. Break times are evenly distributed and spread apart.
good,"Rite Aid is a great, clean, organized placed. Management does a great job treating their employees with respect. Rite Aid is a good play of employment for people of all ages."

good,Working at Rite aid has been a wonderful experience. All the associates are so sweet and caring. We always make sure we get our job done but always have a good time doing it. I learned how to communicate with all types of customers. it taught me how to manage my time when i get busy or have a lot on my to do's list. The best part about the job is the bond you create with your coworkers and daily customers. the hardest part about the job is when you go home knowing your job is incomplete and the next associate would have to finish it.
good,"stocking the selves, running the cashier. Greeting the customers, cleaning the place inside and out.  Help the customers find thing. Learned the get a long with  Management."
good,"•	Receiving, filling and checking out prescriptions at register"

good,great work balance; everyone works as team and management is willing to assist at any time
good,Rite Aid was a great place to work. The work was easy the hours were great. I enjoyed being around people.
good,Rite aid is a very equal opportunity with new ways to learn and grow everyday. Everyone working there is like a family and always willing to teach you new things.   They have very loyal customers who love what Rite Aid is about. I learned from the when you take it personal then you have a much better outcome.
good,If I did not have to relocate for personal reasons I would not have ever left.  I honestly loved my job and the people I worked with.  They were like family to me.
good,I started working at rite aid because my major was biology and i was trying to see what field i wanted to go into. Biggest mistake was to work as a pharmacy tech.
good,"A typical work day would be very hectic, sometimes your co workers would be know help and just sit around and not do any work till the end of the month when the dm came to walk there store. Would not give a raise, wouldn't promoted you either."
good,"• Handled many of the customer service and clerical tasks at a pharmacy, allowing pharmacists to address medical concerns and dispense prescriptions."
good,The way that the company Rite Aid treats it's employees is wrong. They are always worried about the bottom line more than their employees. That's how I feel.
good,i would handle the register sometimes. then they would have me re-stocking the shelves. At night i would vacuum the store and make sure all the products were presentable.
good,"I Really enjoy working with the public, that's not the problem the problem is we have a manager who wont consider their employees and isn't sensitive to here needs At All!!!!!"
good,I would walk threw the aisles to clean and organize them and take and go backs that are up in the front. I would also serve ice cream to the customers who wanted to buy some. I would answer any questions people had on any merchandise.
good,"A typical day at work would be cashiering a couple hours, then on certain work days I would do some stocking and cleaning. A lot of customer service throughout the day with the public. I also learned how to set up and organize the weekly advertisements throughout the store. Management was a little more laid back than it should have been. Me and other co workers would never learn anything new. The hardest party about this job was dealing with angry customers at times and just having to keep a smile on my face and get on to the next customer. The most enjoyable party of the job was meeting and starting a relationship with regular customers that came in every month."
good,"I enjoy working with this company, including the employee. Unfortunately, the management has not been supportive. My hours are being cut unnecessarily and my days off are all over the place. This organization is not allowing me to meet my full potential."
good,"I enjoyed working at this position. It is a great retail job to take, but the most difficult part is the customers."
good,It's been an great experience and I learn alot but now it's important that I look out for me an my future.The paid need to be more after working years your paid doesn't increase.
good,"Not enough help...people always call in always on their cell phones, nothing is ever said about it and just need a change"
good,It was a okay job. the mangerment wasn't all that great but overall it was my first job and a great experince.
good,I enjoyed wprking with customer's. Providing help even if they didn't need it. Greet every customer. Working as a team with my co-worker's.
good,I'm a dedicated team player with a postive work ethic looking for a new job in fresno. Recently moved from the central coast. Looking for a company that i could exceed my skills in.
good,I don’t like I went from 40 to 15 hours with out a reason why which is why I wanna leave and find me a new job it’s also slot of drama and fights in the store
good,"An overall good place to work, however, my manager was inconsiderate and had a tendency to start arguments which was extremely unnecessary and unprofessional."
good,The work environment at Rite Aid was very laid back as long as you were getting your work done. There is always something to do so you were never standing around.
good,No room for Advancement. High turn over rate among shift managers and cashier. Customers are great to work with as with any public service jobs. Must be a people person.
good,management was fair and understanding for the most part. Most enjoyable prt was the customers and providing them great service.My coworkers minded their business for the most part. I really enjoyed my job there.
good,"cashiering, customer service worked hard keeping busy at times."
good,Daily i would balance and complet sales transactions including returns. I would do inventory counts and stock merchandise. I assisted in one hour photo when needed by developing film and handling orders. I received orders and payments for customer JCPenny accounts.
good,"Riteaid is a good company but management at this particular one was awful and made working there unbearable, they were rude and very unprofessional to other employees"
good,The District manager  speak down on employees even in the presence of customers. And go to another store to praise you. And come back to your to humiliate you.
good,"Working at Rite Aid was fast paced and fun. The management worked around my teaching schedule, but did not offer benefits to part-time employees.  There was a discount on purchases and everyone who worked there was friendly."
good,love the job but the pay sucks. they are not flexible when you have children. Trying to move up in a position as a mom working for Rite Aid is hard. They don't understand the meaning of motherhood and needing to be home with your children especially as a single mother. overnight is not going to work because who is going to watch my children.
good,I enjoyed my time working for Rite Aid and I appreciate the time spent with the company and the opportunities I was able to experience while there. I wish them much success through the transition process to Walgreen's.
good,I liked working at rite aid I miss my co workers and I miss my manger. Their were days where I wanted to walk out but that was because we was low on staff but I loved the customer and staff that I worked with and my manager. the hardest part of my job was trying to manage the pharmacy with just 2 technicians. The part I enjoyed was putting a smile on the customers face.
good,Work environments great but there's no real chance of advancement as a manager I only  made 9.00 an hour while some people made a lot more. Its a great first job or just needing to pay bills. Overall though if you can find better do so.
good,walking sales floor and greeting customer helping them with their everyday needs and locating items in store for them. I learn how to help prepare customer to meet with the  pharmacist and get them immunization ready also I've learned how to be sympathetic to our patients and their needs. The managers at Rite Aid are very understanding and sensitive to their employees feelings. My co-worker and very friendly we all developed great relationships every outside the work place. The hardest part of being a wellness ambassador is trying to help patients understand certain policies about our company and that we cant bend the rules to satisfy their needs. Most enjoyable part of being a wellness ambassador is putting a smile on customers faces.
good,"My first official job and it had its good days and bad days hand in hand. Basic cash register operations, dealing with daily customer questions and concerns, store maintenance, an daily inventory count, pull reports, and defects. An all-around job with experience in every way"
good,"Cashier- Customer service at the register of selling products along with extended service plans and enforced store policies.

Demonstrate excellent customer service skills between cashiering & customer service, with a high ratio of membership sales ."
good,"start filling sripts from que"
good,A typical day at my job would be to start my day out by stocking and taking care of all delivery's. At the same time assisting customers with wants and needs. Everyday is a learning experience. I learn new ways to complete my task faster as well as making sure customers are happy and coming back to the store. Management works very well with their employees to make work a better place. Co-workers get the job done and help make it a better environment for customers. I can honestly say there is no hard part about the job. The most enjoyable part of my job would be to see a customer leave satisfied and pleased with our customer service.
good,Not a good place to work.. low pay.. pharmacist seem very unclear of things. but if you are new to the field and looking for experience then this is the place for you.
good,The day started off with ten minutes of stretching and then putting product into totes sealing them and sending them out. I didnt learn much management was mostly great the workplace culture is like any other place good people and bad people.
good,"frieght, customer service. Some good products. Frieght and insuring the products are in the  correct placing. Detail to numbers and inventory. Supervise employees"
good,I would recommend this as a great place to work. The management was a fair and always resolved any issues.  The hardest part about this job was being super understaffed in the pharmacy
good,Making sure that the Customer Experiences a world-class experience when they enter the stores.  You learn that everyone that walks into the pharmacy is an individual that could be going through some rough times and you are there to help and understand them.
good,OK job to work for with a not too stressful of a work environment. the job did not have to much visibility with upper management and their was not a lot of room for career advancement
good,This was my very first job. I enjoyed learning how to operate the photo-Lab machines. The hardest part of this job was running the register while hanging and taking down sale signs between customers.
good,I often walk into a store that is flipped upside down. each day we are overwhelmed with customers and scripts. the way the schedule is made isn't always the most effective. Too many people leave at the same time and not enough come in after they leave the balance needs to be worked on. but each store is different.
good,"I was hired through a staffing agency to work for Rite Aid Distribution in Spartanburg, SC. Starting was great, the environment was nice some of the workers were friendly. I worked here for 2 weeks and was laid off my second week. I was upset about how they went about giving me the news. I was called after work for them to tell me i had been laid off instead of letting me know that face to face. I left my 8-5 mon-fri to come work for this company and i was laid off in return. I would go back and work for Rite Aid, just not through a staffing/temp agency."
good,It was a pleasure working here I enjoyed my former co workers. It was hard work but we always made our customers happy and thats all that counted. I havent been in retail for a while but Rite Aid was fun to work at and I loved it
good,Rite aid in Malone New York was the best place anyone could work at. I woke there for a little over a year and I loved it. The only reason why I left was at the time there was some issues with a temporary manager in the pharmacy and I could no longer take the lying. But over all I loved working there. Everyone treats everyone like family. They are so sweet and understanding and just really great people to be around.
good,went to work regularly the customers as nice and friendly polite I learned how to stand for long periods of time I learned what it means to be a security guard my managers ws cool I injoyed them they kind spirits and my co workers was welcoming. but the hardest part of my job was standing for so long but the most enjoyable part ws making customers smile
good,"worked there for better than 18 months. I learned how to resolve problem solve, how to run a register, provide great customer service."
good,"Good working conditions.  Meet/greet customers of a diverse population.  Management is good, good team work.  Job is not really hard, love what I do.  The only down fall is I work part time and there are no benefits offered to part time employees."
good,Thanks to Rite Aid I have had many happy years working for their company. Great staff and customers. A super experience overall.
good,What I gained from this experience would be that it taught me how to manage and balance my time. It was very demanding when it came to dealing with the tons of tasks that were allotted but I gained a bunch of experience in the short time I was there.
good,"It was a place of comfort and assistance. People friendly, very detailed and on the go .Everyday was different but exciting, The coworkers were a joy to be around."
good,"A typical day would consist in restocking the floor, checking and removing expired merchandise. Making sure every customer is in the know of the weekly sale items, enhancing every customers shopping experience at my location. As well as making sure the funds in the safe were counted before opening and after closing. Being very personable I was able to enjoy each of my co-workers as well as higher management. "
good,"Had a great time working for the company, but some of the management personnel had a very sour outlook."
good,"We get there and get all the scripts that haven't been filled. Fill prescription and keep store clean. cash out any customers that need assistance. I learned about insurance. Management was very easy going didn't stand over your shoulder all day. My co-workers were very pleasant and helpful. The hardest part was learning the computer format. The most enjoyable part was learning about medicines I didn't know about, compounding medicines and reconstituting."
good,"The typical day on a job is logging into the system and reading the problems report from each Rite Aid station in different states."
good,"I always had projects to do, team work is important, was easy to work with, co-workers were friendly, hardest part none, the customers."
good,Working there was a great experience. I got skills in customer service and I got to know what it is like working as a sales associate. Had to quit so I could focus on school. 
good,"Open /close store.Supervise cashiers,customer service,banking, training,stocking,inventory ."
good,Rite aid is a fun fast placed establishment.
good,"You can be fired  at any time,for even a un true statement  that you didn't  even  make.The young big headed manager's many call you a liar at anytime  and dismiss you.Just for any kind of excuses  they find  to satisfy  their self's"
good,"Rite Aide is truly an equal opportunity employer. The work environment is professional, friendly and compelling. The management team maintained an environment that is customer friendly. They cared about their employees. Flex time and call-ins weren't frowned upon. However, there was a limit as to how much time off you can receive. Also, they offered training for advancement within the Pharmacy Department."
good,Very easy and simple job if you don't mind walking around and greating customers and informing guest about products and taking the customers items and ringing the items up than this jod would be a perfect fit for you if you have manager experience and knowledge about sales and labor and inventory
good,Rite aid is a great company to work for they are a great team and take great care of their employees. And they can relocate you wherever you need and that was really great too.
good,I enjoy working at RiteAid. The environment is a peaceful place to work at. The people that work along side me are very nice and care about providing great service to our customers.

good,The company gave me an amazing oppourtunity. I was hired on to work in the pharmacy and the register on the front end. I was hired on before I had my state license. They have a training program they put all pharmacy techs through. The position is initially pharm tech in training until the program is completed.
good,I had to leave because there wasn’t a chance for me to move up after I had my child. That was the only negative part about the job I liked working there other wise.
good,"• Treating the customer with a warm welcome."

good,"Working at rite aid was a good experience and I would definetely reccomend it to someone else A typical day would be stocking shelves, working the register, and helping customers find what theyre looking for."

good,"It;s a very productive workplace. My managers were very nice and always helpful. They provided you with computer base training and one on one. The days always fly by. You are not stuck doing one thing all the time, there's always a variety of tasks that must be completed."
good,It was a horrible job. Standing behind the counter for 6hours except for a 15 min break. Selling all kinds of bad items and most people are rude. It was a bad job.

good,I really enjoyed my position with Rite Aid. The company have great core values and treats their employees with respect and compassion. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a position with Rite Aid to apply.
good,"Rite aid its self is a great place to work, but when working in the pharmicy even when you tell them you have to be there part time, it feels like they don't want to listen. I was called in all the time. I woked 10 hours day I mean the pay was good but not with how much time they want you to spend there. if someone calls in and your last man on the pole you will have to come in if its your day off or not. They want you to only be about work."
good,I enjoyed working at the Rite Aid in Jefferson. Unfortunately the store has since closed in conjunction with a Walgreen's buyout to enhance footprint optimization
good,23 years of service well spent. Learned many things and promotions were available. Reputable company with opportunities abound. I would recommend working for this employer.
good,"Needed more leaders and people who want to take their job more seriously. But overall it was a calm and collective working place, no problems and nobody was negative towards each other."

good,"The best part of this job is being able to interact directly with patients. It is very rewarding to speak with patients, hear about their day, and see how thankful they are."
good,I look forward to getting the job done. Keeping customers happy and  helping the pharmacist in all aspects. The most enjoyable part of the job is taking care of the customers.
good,Rite Aid was a great place to work with an amazing staff. The only thing they could do better would be to pay their people more. We go through a lot on a daily basis and work hard and the compensation at minimum wage is not worth it.
good,"Great co-workers and environment."
good,"I had fun working at rite aid, I was young but it was always a good time. We always got our work done and we always provided great customer service to the customers."
good,The Company sucks and is 100% not for their employees which is probably why they were bought out by Walgreen. But i loved the system and my other coworkers. Probably the most fun i;ve ever had
good,"We have a good team, but are shorthanded all of the time due to Rite Aid not wanting to pay a decent wage to starting technicians.  It's hard to find good help for little pay."

good,"I was a cashier at Rite aid. A typical day was getting my cash drawer signing on to start. I learned how to deal with customers, The managers were very helpful and kind. The hardest part about the job was the customer complaints and the most enjoyable was getting to know all my of my co workers."
good,"Slow paced, flexible hours, part time or full time, optional benefits. Management was wonderful. Relaxed environment. Great place for a first time job."
good,As a Rite Aid Asset Protection Agent you basically do as little as possible to stop theft. They prefer you don't call the police or do anything to get the thief caught. I was reprimanded for getting a guy caught by the police who not only had stolen goods but had an  arrest warrant in another State. Rite Aid is not interested in getting criminals off the street. They even allow thieves back in the store after they steal. They cater to honest and dishonest customers and do not support people they hire to prevent the theft. I would not work them again if they asked me. And I will never ever patronize them again.
good,"I enjoyed my time in the pharmacy.  For me it was a job between semesters and would never have been a career.  With that being said, management always made sure that I was always okay with family life and school.  Fast paced and before I knew it the day was over.  Sometimes it could be stressful but never that bad."
good,This company is a great one to work for. They genuinely care about their employees and put the customer first when making executive decisions. I would recommend this company to friends in the future that are looking for employment.
good,The Orrville location is fantastic. The managers are personable and friendly. They are caring and do not take themselves too seriously. I would recommend this store to just about anyone willing to put in an honest day's work.
good,"Great team work, great place to work. Great attention"
good,"Great  place to work. great staff and management. it might be bought out in the near future by a bigger corporation, which is why i would consider finding other options for employment."
good,I had changed locations and all the managment was very helpful and understanding. From time to time they allowed you to get overtime and almost always worked with your schedual. Except holidays. I worked a full day every holiday for the first year without time and a half.
good,I enjoyed working at this warehouse. I enjoyed being part of a team while also working alone. I liked having 3 days off. We worked long hours and had plenty of opportunities for overtime.
good,"This company will keep you busy very hands on and always busy."
good,This place was an excellent place to work at. They always put customer service as their number one priority and the other employees were very friendly.
good,I loved working at rite aid. I have a great store manager and she is awesome and understanding. Job is easy to understand and can be stressful at time but if i called my store manager she was always there to answer my questions.
good,"It's a good first job for when you first turn 16, it gets repetitive very quickly. Every Saturday is tags where you put up new sales tags for the following sale week"
good,Fun environment to be in while also being professional at the same time. great learning place to develop skills like multi tasking and customer service.
good,One of my favorite jobs. Met amazing people and had the best boss I could've ever asked for. Flexible schedule and welcoming work environment. Pleasant people
good,busy everyday.   Hardest is the heat in spring and summer   the people are ok.    management fair  learned how to select items for shipping.  can be long hours. a lot of different nationalities.
good,"This was a small store.It was only me,the store manager,and the Pharmacist at night. When I wasn't operating the register I was blocking product on the shelve.One or two days out of the week I helped empty totes of product from the truck delivery. When Cooperate Office sent down pages of price changes I also ran new labels for those. Rite Aid management was very easy to work for.We greeted each customer that walked through the door with a ""Welcome To Rite Aid"". There was nothing hard about this job."
good,"Rite Aid offers a flexible work schedule which makes it a perfect second job or part time job. A typical day at work for a shift supervisor involves checking in vendors who deliver products, assisting customers, completing sales, and helping cashiers. There is also miscellaneous task that must be completed everyday. It is very much a team based culture."
good,I have already written a review and don't understand why I cant skip this review. rite aid is a good place to work with quick days and good benefits. meet a lot of interesting people too
good,I like working at Rite Aid but the one thing that needs to improve is the pay. For the amount of time I spend there I do not see the benefits when I see my paycheck.
good,"I started working for the company in Maryland . I worked 40 to 50 hours per week due to the fact we where a training store. Then I started working in Edison in 2015 until 2017 when I got laid off due to lay offs I really enjoyed the staff I worked with in both stores, I t was a very good experience."

A typical day at work consisted of all the employees making sure the prescriptions were filled on time so the patients were satisfied. We were all very hardworking and provided  safe environment for each other. The hardest part of the job was keeping track of all of the prescriptions, but luckily the computer program helped us out with that. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting a wide range of people. Rite Aid had a very diverse range of patients from all walks of life."
good,The experience was enjoyable. I cultivated long lasting relationships. My co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was working nights. The most enjoyable was selling the products to the customers.

If a cashier cannot handle a customer's questions, then that person's personality is not suit for this kind of job"

I gained more of a family while working with this company. Everyone was always willing to lend a helping hand to a new pharmacy techncian which I was at the time. I learned so much in such a short amount of time due to the staff teaching me very detailed information! The team colaboration was very well balanced.

good,"Typically open the store at 9 am and works throughout the day to 9 pm. Right from the start I set the mood and the pace of the work flow at the pharmacy. E scripts are already auto populating in the cue and the leading tech is typing them in as they come. Patients are calling in refills and more patients are dropping off new prescriptions while waiting in the store for 15 to 20 minutes. I have to quality check the prescription and dispensed within the promised time. "

good,this is where i started learning retail.  this is where i also started learning about wine and liquor.
good,You are expected to fix every problem in specif stores. The associates expect you to catch every person based on limited information and management expects you to act according to policy
good,It's all about Sales. The faster you can get the old lady out of your way while providing excellent customer service. The better chance you have at obtaining a new sale which is what they look for.

good,"This was a great high school job, but not a good place to start a career. I was able to gain customer service experience and pharmacy education. The employees I worked with were great and the managers were nice. Not a lot of room for career advancement, just a nice part-time job."

good,I like working at Rite-Aide it was a good job. The hours was alright they should pay a little more.I also like the people I worked with. it was a good job.
good,"Great work environment its just the pay is not great. You will need to have a second job as do I, in order to pay all the bills.

A good job just to get some experience under your belt. Definitely not a long term career option."

good,Anyone who has ever worked in a pharmacy before knows just how stressful it can be to work in an environment where everyone is expecting you to be perfect EVERYTIME at Everything. Although this is not the reality with most places- in pharmacy- you have no choice. Which wears on you. It tears you down to nothing when you make a mistake. But it is also rewarding to see a cancer patient slowly recover- or to see the same patients over and over and really learn to connect. It is a very stressful job- but if you're looking for fast paced and stressful with very little room for error- Pharmacy is for you.
good,"What I learned from working with this corporation is that each employee is apart of one team where everyone has to be dedicated, knowledgable of company guidelines all while possessing character and common sense for the work day to run as smooth as possible.

Then I gave my daily speech to the employees about the agenda for the day before we open the doors for business. "
good,"If it wasn't for a very unreasonably rude and sarcastic manager I wouldn't have left. The job functions are not hard. Running a cash register and straitening products, making new displays. I actually had fun at this job and my one day work for them again."
good,"Albeit a very busy and sometimes hectic work environment, working retail with Rite Aid pushes your limits and makes you into a better worker.

good,very optimist and fun. I'm very happy to work in this place and my coworkers are very helpful. the only reason that push me to look for an other job is because the salary.
good,"I loved working here, it was very challenging.  Challenging because alot is required of you as a Pharmacy Tech at Rite Aid because of the low staff.

But because of this, the experience is great but the pay sucks."

good,Very great company to work for and the employees are very nice. They where always around to help and assit when when ever you had a issue or question.
good,Love my work place just need better hours to be home with my kids since they started school and to get an advance in your career you have to know someone and obviously I don't have that type of status there
good,Its a fast past work that you adapt to. There's a lot of people willing to help you work towards what you need to get done. It's long hours depending on the time of the year.
good,"Managers are awesome, they are always willing to jump right in and help you if you have a problem, as a new hire or with a customer. Customer service is always a priority."
good,A typical day is pretty stress free. As a cashier you learn how to operate the register and change sale signs. You are able to sign on with your finger print. Great management!
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company.  Although there was a lot of work to do, we always enjoyed ourselves while doing it.  Managers were supportive and understanding."
good,cashier and tech counting pills and takes care of customers front end of store and back end  doing the photo for the passports working shifts as nights and weekends again 32 to 40 hours
good,Need to be a responsible and customer service type of person. Is a great place to work. A very team oriented type of business. Fun and informational type of business.
good,"I literally loved this place.When I first started working there I thought it would be a company that I would retire from. Most of the people who worked there was great co-workers and some of the management was too,but for the worst they closed shop after my 17 plus years of employment."
good,"It was stressful at times because you have to deal with difficult customers. However, it is a fun experience working with others. I had some great bosses which made my training easier."
good,I learned a great deal of things while working at Rite Aid Pharmacy. The main thing I learned was time management as well as customer service. People want to be in harmony at all times but that can change when something doesn't go there way. Working in an industry where the prices can fluctuate to huge levels made me realize the sensitivity of communication. Not only did I keep the environment organized and maintained but I would also keep the customers happy. I would take into consideration their concerns while also performing my duties as a pharmacy technician. Working at the pharmacy was a very humbling opportunity and made me think in other's shoes.
good,A typical rite aid day is normally busy we are a fast pace store so your always on the go. Ive leave so many things over the yeara good customer service skill ive learned about medications and what they are used for i learned how to talk to others and communication skills everyone works well with others and communicate well and work together as a good team
good,i really did enjoy my time working here although my store manager was never in store but the assistant manager always got the job done it was a really comfortable work environment
good,"In this Work environment you will learn to grow across the board, from customer service all the way to stocking shelves and scooping ice cream. The hours very partially because most opening are only part time. Opened 365 days a year be prepared to always be called in at anytime."
good,"I would be cleaning in and around a few restaurants. Checking if there's was trash in the parking lot. Clean out the trash cans and backroom trash. Cleaned the stove, grills, windows and floors."
good,It was a good place to work but I was still in highschool at the time and balancing the two out sometimes made it hard on myself.
good,The workers are pleasant to work with.  There are days that it's busy and there are days that are not.  Customers are most likely older people which sometimes fun to deal with.
good,Working for Rite Aid was fun. I enjoyed the customers. I also enjoyed the hours the store was open. The hardest part of the job was when we were not busy.
good,"I had the luxury of working in a store that was located inside of a shopping mall.  The problem was that the mall was located in an entirely different county, which made for an extremely difficult and time-consuming commute. This is the general trouble with working for a company like Rite-Aid; the store nearest you may not be hiring, but on the upside chances are good that another store in your town is."
good,"I enjoyed working at Rite Aid for many years. I was given the ability to work around outside obligations and advanced to a supervisor in a short year. My coworkers were fun to be around and easy to work with and the customers were always happy to see you. The work was not difficult, however sometimes it was a challenge to perform multiple duties at once. It was a stimulating environment that I loved."
good,getting paid was basically the joyous part of job. The employees some were good some were bad but we got alone and got job completed. some management were good some were bad.
good,I learned a lot from my store manager as well as the other shift supervisors. They taught me how to successfully run the store while being the only manager on duty. They also taught me how to use all the store's programs to complete my tasks. I could ask for help as I was learning and was never made to feel like I was out of place in my job. It was a very good learning environment and I am so happy that my first management job was with that team.
good,"I love my job. my manager is great, along with all my co-workers. The job just doesn't allow me a full time position nor my desired pay."
good,"•	Ensure the accuracy and appropriateness of all prescriptions filled by completing Drug Utilization Review and Final Quality Assurance, applicable to state and federal Board of Pharmacy regulations."

good,"Assist customers with their questions, problems and complaints"
good,It was a great company that helped my learn valuable life lessons. I enjoy working for this company.If you need any additional information please let me know.

good,enjoyed working the job and learning new things. this is the place i completed my extern to become a pharmacy technician and i was hired after wards.
good,"Working at Rite Aid was a great experience. I had a lot of help and caring co-workers. I loved to make the customers happy and make their day better. Some days were a little hard but I managed to pull through it with a smile on my face. I learned how to improve on working with money, taking money orders and transfers. The hardest part I have to say was the beginning. Learning new settings and computer skills, but after a few weeks I got the hang of it and enjoyed my time there."
good,this job help me grow in to a hard worker. the only thing at the time i was working here i didnt have a car .but aside all that it was work hard and no play.
good,Management did a poor job. The employees were getting shorted on checks. Union fees were high! Customers were always mad due to the poor management. They would hire lazy employees. Would never work there again
good,"My day consisted of maintenance, stocking and inventory, working the cash register, money handling, coupon and food stamp handling, I did money orders and worked with Western Union to process codes to either send money or help the customer receive it. I monitored expiration dates on products and helped in customer service and setting up displays."
good,This was the first job that allowed me to openly interact with the public. It allowed for great work experience and taught me the values of hard work.
good,I started as a pharmacy technician at Rite Aid in college and quickly made the decision to further my career as an intern while in pharmacy school. I now how to stay with the company and further my career as a pharmacist for Rite Aid.
good,"Responsible for hiring and training all new hires. Scheduling. payroll, deposits, setting weekly ads and plan o grams. Ordering merchandise and provided a clean and safe store to shop and work in."
good,"Run cash register"
good,I have been working with a great environment. Including Manager and co-worker have friendly relationship.
good,"My day at Rite Aid is always a good one.  I normally unload totes on delivery day, ring up customers purchases and handle large sums of cash and credit cards."
good,"I would multitask by doing damages, recalls, planograms, and other tasks all while keeping up with the cash register and greeting each customer that came through the door. I learned good customer service skills and how to be more active in sales. My management was nice and always very helpful. My co-workers and I were good team players. The hardest part of the job was multitasking, but what I enjoyed most was interacting with the customers and being a helping hand to them."
good,Rewarding to be helpful and assist with training of employees
good,my typical day at work would be good I leaned great customer service how to be fast at the cashier to handle the money correctly and to always listen to the customers need. co workers very nice and helpful. The hardest part was not knowing what to do the manger didn't communicate with me. Enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers I really enjoy working with others and being part of a team player.
good,"The worst experience I had and I've been told has happened to other staff is working with Pharmacist CR on Peachtree Rd NE in Brookhaven 30319. The Prior Pharmacy Manager before the new Pharmacy Manager B & I arrived, transferred because CR creates a passive aggressive hostile work space in the Pharmacy. She acts bubbly with customers, but some have referred to her in mean terms. There was another Pharmacy Tech that CR used her normal passive aggressive hostility to shut you out verbally then ask to not be put on schedule with her then loss of hours on the schedule like she did me. I'm a breast cancer survivor 3rd year & working with CR was worse than my cancer experience. CR makes Rite Aid Culture horrible. Otherwise, it has great culture. "
good,"I would love to be an employee at any Rite Aid again!"
good,"Fun place to work but I am wanting a Fresh new job start."
good,"I love working there and my coworkers. A lot of benefits. Always work, job security. The job is demanding, management there is great. You work 40 hours a week. Ive learned a lot, I was even able to receive my pharmacy technician license through my job."
good,I enjoy customer interaction.  The monthly tutorials are also great.  Managers are mindful of individual work preferences.  
good,"A typical day at work would be assisting patients at the pick-up and drop-off window with their medications.  In addition, I would be calling in for transfers from other pharmacies and taking new prescriptions from physician's offices. I've learned how to operate the Rite Aid computer system.  My co-workers were loud and talkative.  Never did I have a boring day. The hardest part of my job is filling medications.  Not that it is difficult but it's hard to do for hours and hours.  The most enjoyable part of my job is talking to patients.  "
good,"The time working at Rite Aid during a typical day can go by quick if you are at a 24 hour store. If you enjoy a very fast paced environment, working at a 24 hour Rite Aid can be great. You never have to worry about not being able to get hours to work and there is always oppurtunities to pick up other shifts."
good,My typical day at work consist of listening to people complain all day and my hours are anywhere from 9 to 15 hours a day. I'm a really hard worker and love what I do but it's just not enjoyable working for this company anymore. The greatest part about my job is days off.
good,A fast pasted retail environment allowed me to get to know our customers & keep them healthy during their time of sickness.
good,a great place to learn about the retail business. everyone works good with each other. the hardest part of the job is learning how to be a muli-tasker on truck day. the managers work with you on the schedule when you have to be off a day. the most enjoyable part of the job is putting a smile on the customers face when they are having a bad day.
good,"Very hometown Pharmacy. Welcomed me with open arms, and my co-workers made it very easy to work. Pharmacy Manager also helped me learn a lot, and quizzed me everyday to get me ready for my tests. I loved my on the job training. I am very grateful for my Externship at Rite Aid."
good,Rite aid was a good experience of a work force I enjoy work for the company.
good,"Love what I have learned and wanted to continue to grow further under the it all if they will wanna rehire me I would love to go back . "
good,Longest and best job I’ve had worked overnight which was really easy co workers were really nice and super helpful   Would recommend this place for employment
good,Very nice environment to work in can get hetic but with help the day goes by fast. I enjoyed talking with customers and getting the store prepared for different holiday seasons.
good,Rite aid worked with my school schedule which was awesome and the people I worked with were very nice. Everyone always greeted me with a smile and was extremely understanding.
good,"Working at Rite Aid provided me an excellent career opportunity where I was able to learn, grow and add value. I was promoted to Supervisor and provided great learning opportunities. I left Rite Aid because I relocated out of state, and I really enjoyed my time with the organization."
good,"It is a large public corporation and the bottom line is the dollars.  From what I have experienced, the management has always been there for their employees and any issues including personal.  They do expect 120% out of you so the work can be difficult.  Overall the company is a good company to work for, culture is typical corporate america.  People that work there are great and have been there over 10, 20 and 30+ years. There is potential to learn as long as you apply yourself."
good,"My experience at Rite Aid was great. Able to create own hours, very flexible. Great coworkers. Able to train and learn via online portal. Provided with company vehicle, laptop and phone."
good,"Rite Aid provided a great work environment, a company vehicle, laptop, and cell phone. It was very challenging because things were constantly changing (new equipment, new software, etc). I learned on the job as things kept changing. The worst part of the job was the driving. My area was approximately 75 miles along interstate 210. Traffic was a mess during rush hour. I was the only person in my vehicle, so I was not able to use car pool (HOV) lanes. I enjoyed the compliments and gratitude from the store personnel every time I fixed an issue for them. It may be as simple as plugging in a power cord so a device would work or as complicated as replacing the store server and performing a store start over. My manager was the best I could ask for. I liked his style of management, and I felt he was a very good man."
good,very clean store with great employees who always put the effort into locating a product for you and ask you about your day. very nice staff including the pharmacy.
good,"Both my job and another associates job was lost by the merger as they didn't have the hours available for me and her position was eliminated. This job was fun for me. I worked as a cashier and focused on customer service.  I also learned how to do inventory and how to reset the floor each week. In addition, I helped with stocking the store.  ALL in all, it was an interesting job. I was never bored."
good,"I love working for this company.They have been good to me, so Im loyal to them. I have excellant benefits, pleasant people to work with and we are unionized"
good,"As a Rite Aid manager we do I lot of everything in the store , from unloading the truck to running a cash register .  I like doing all these tasks because you know what's going on in your store ."
good,"My first job training,RiteAid had helped me with learning how to interact with customers in a friendly and positive way,where I first learn to stock and organize merchandize."
good,Cashed out customers.  Helped clean at closing time.  Straightened up the merchandise. Sometimes was there to open and sometimes there to close.  Cleaned the bathrooms.
good,Not preferred for long time employment. They do not pay very much money and they quality of the management depends upon the location and ethics. You will not be micromanaged
good,"I really enjoyed working at Rite Aid but i did not think the pay was fair for the amount of work a pharmacy cashier was doing. I ran the drive thru, cash register, counted pills and labeled them. At times i was the only one there with the pharmacist. The rite aid i worked with was severally under staffed."
good,I had a great time working at rite aid. Never had a hard time learning new tasks. The other associates are very respectful and caring. Never missed a day of work unless I was sick. I would definitely refer a friend to work there.
good,I was let go because they fired my sister and I was the only way to get her home. They knew she rode with me to work . If I could get my job back I would go back.
good,"I waited on customers, stocked shelves, moved shelves, checked in tobacco, ran the photo lab and front faced products. I learned how to process photos and copy them. I also filled in, in the pharmacy as a cashier as needed. I enjoyed doing end caps and working with customers."
good,"My typical day at my job would include. Data entry of prescriptions, filling prescriptions, counting pills, insurance verification, talking to Doctors offices and insurance companies. Register transactions."
good,"Enjoyed working for this company, I was a dedicated employee that worked hard, gave great customer service, took great pride in seeing others succeed. The team worked together to have a #1 store in our district many years in a row."
good,It was a great part time job. Had lots of fun with my coworkers and management team. I would definitely recommend for a person just starting to look for a job or someone right out of college.
good,"Customer check out "
good,A typical day after opening the store 30 minutes early. Checking if the closing process was done. Store was recovered and coolers were filled. Restrooms were ready for the customers. Meet vendors and go through the order processes for the coming week. Check sales for the current week and make sure we are in stock. Work on truck and monitor the registers. Work with he management teams to make sure the daily tasks are being completed in a timely manner. Scheduling and looking at the P&L reports. Meet and greet customers and help them with the needs. Help Pharmacy with their daily needs. Maintain shrink levels to the lowest and making sure internal and external theft is controlled.
good,Great place to work. Lots of hours available to associates. Fun job to have as a student. Only bad thing about the job is the late shifts you have to work
good,working here requires alot of patience and having customer service skills serving ice cream may be a challenge but great outcome specially during the summer.
good,"Coworkers are very friendly.  Meet people from all walks of life.  Pharmacists are great.  Hardest part of job is doing truck, which entails allot of lifting. Mostly work on your own."
good,"Good place to work.  Opportunities for job advancement.  Different shift opportunities.  There are many employee functions throughout the year.  Good communication, and very safety oriented."
good,"Start up safety meeting, discuss jobs and work plans, had vendors of various equipment provide training on the various equipment that's used throughout the warehouse. Management just say we went through several during the six years before the department was outsourced. The work culture was good but a lot of policy changes that affected personnel employment at times, and the hardest part of the job sometimes was just attention to detail and time management, overall the company was a fun place to work."
good,"nice place to work, bad management, as we have a bad manager. nice and lovely co-worker and co-managers. I have learned a lot form my them. beautiful experience. really busy work place."
good,I really enjoyed working here especially that it was inside the pittsburgh airport so i got to meet all different kinds of cultured people and learned a lot about how to interact with them. Management was excellent. We would joke around with each other to make the day fun and worked together to get things done the right way
good,"-Almost always doing something different everyday. Kept the job interesting"

good,This was my longest held job. I enjoyed every day at work and my managers were always fun to work with. The customers were always funny and I would recommend that job
good,"Loved the fast pace of working there. Fun people to work with, very productive, management didn't do certain procedures right, pharmacist was very rude"
good,I highly enjoyed working at Rite Aid. Great place for multitaskers!  Physical and mentally you have to be prepared. Unloading the truck was one of my most favorite tasks
good,Typical day at work is we come in and say a prayer then everybody get sign to their area. If you complete the work before everybody is done then you help the next person until the work is done.
good,"This company and employees were trained well and always gave the best foot forward."
good,"I enjoyed working for Rite-Aid corporation,  I would start my day with unloading products, and pricing them according to the data sheet, cash management, banking, and customer service"
good,"I loved my work for Rite Aid, When I started i was a Cashier and worked really hard to Get from Cashier to Store Manager. Before I left the Distict Manager decided to have a problem with me. I learned the business from the ground up. I loved everyone that i work with and for up to the every end."
good,For the long term you might choose rite aid. You can get easy raises plus it's union. Advancement is very possible. And many coworkers have been there for a very long time
good,"A typical day would be meeting with all sorts of customer friendly and some grumpy customers  and working there to help them out with friendly checkout having them to come back again.I learnt a lot and lots of things like I didnt have any retail much experience before this.Learnt to be much sober calmer and empathetic.Management is ok not appreciative because they keep on changing so they dont have one fix management so every new managers would work differently some doo poorly some well enough.Co workers are awesome, So far i have met pretty nice and helpful but few of them were grumpy or not wanting to talk as if they have to pay to be friendly and I hate that.To checkout and meet all kinds of nice people/"
good,my first lp job. had no experince when i started and was given a chance and fell in love with loss prevention. its a good place to work for. as for me i have out grown my position and are looking to move to bigger companies to move up
good,This is a job where you need to be very responsible for your self and your time.  Can be dangerous at times but as long as you follow procedures you will be ok.
good,"Sales and marketing skills a must for Wellness Ambassador."
good,"A good starting job."
good,Well I like working at this job because well it was easy. It wasn't that hard all I had to do everyday was ring up people and put stuff back on the shelves. Also before we close I would sweep the floor and clean the counters. The managers were cool as well they didnt care to much as long as you were doing your job. They cared for their workers. The hardest part though and that would terrify me is the shoplifting. We were in a area where high crime was at and gangs and other things were there. Sometimes we would call the cops of people if we caught them.
good,The employees were always upbeat and cheerful. They worked around the schedule I needed for college. I enjoyed learning about all the different medications. The pharmacist was always eager to teach me something new. I loved learning all the ins and outs of the different drugs.
good,"A typical day at Rite Aid was always pretty calm and collective. I learned a lot of information with working with two supervisors. The management was so-so. I love my two co- workers, they showed me so much, and taught me many things I needed to know. The hardest part of the job was some of the disruptive customers. The most enjoyable part was the daily customers I knew by name."
good,"Rite Aid was a great place to work I really liked it there. I would still be working there if possible, but we found out that my step mom has breast cancer and being the only girl it was my responsibility to take care of her after she had a double masectomy and taking her to dr. appointments and taking her to do her chemo. So I was not able to stay there with all of this going on at the same time."
good,It is great place to work for community pharmacist. Job culture is great as well. They also have union for their employees.
good,"This is a very busy pharmacy, there is no room for getting bored on the job.  My co-workers are all very energetic but the hardest part of the job is when we cannot find a quick way to help one of our patients because of a medication not being available or covered by insurance.  The best part of the job is when I see a patient leave completely satisfied by our service because we helped them in every way we could."
good,Very fun work place. we had a great team. we all worked together as team. Hard part of the job was trying to stop shop lifting.
good,I have learned team work and enjoyed every part of my job with helping customers. Working with highly educated and knowledgeable  pharmacists was great experience.
good,typical day at rite aid was always busy always meeting new people  and always laid back if. there was any problems it was resolved without drama or any other problems or hard feelings.. overall good place to work great people to work for
good,"A typical day at work is running the cash register and attending to what needs to be done on floor. The co-workers were great, the manager not so much. The hardest part of the job was not having enough people working along side of me. There was only me, the manager(or shift) and the pharmacist/pharmacy techs. With having only one person running the front and maintaining the floor you learn how to quickly multitask and make sure your work is complete."
good,"A typical work day would be going to the correct department and waiting to do the daily stretches with the group, than we would wait t hear the daily log info and get told exactly where we were working. I learned how to read labels and tags and how to properly pick from the correct slots. Management was great no complaints. My co workers weren't all the greatest but i'd say the hardest part of the job was learning everything and where it all goes. "
good,"I loved working here. The customers, my coworkers made it fun to go to work everyday.The customers were easy to connect with."
good,"I learn something new at work everyday such as receiving different types of coupons that I have to enter manually. I get different customers rude and really nice ones its such a great experience dealing with different people everyday. Management is good but very poor communication. Something that needs to be worked on"
good,"great company, friendly staff, good part time work, fun place to work"
good,Great job and work environment! The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and helping people.
good,"itwas interesting"
good,"Management at this location was excellent. My co-workers were friendly, helpful, and reliable. The hardest part of my job was leaving. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with our regular customers."
good,A typical day at work is very customer based. I've learned that patience is key. I highly respect management but find it kind of difficult to advance. My coworkers are amazing. The hardest part of the job is the once and a while very difficult customers who always have to get there way. The most enjoyable part is enjoying my job and meeting new people.
good,"you will be seeing a lot of locals"
good,IT was just one of those jobs where you work hard and get nowhere
good,It was a fast paced environment that required good time management skills which I do possess. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers.
good,"managing the store inventory, monies, and most important customer satisfaction.  learned how to handle monies, communicate with customers and employees, how to stock, do some office work, close and open store, set alarms, go to bank i learned how to do planograms. the coworkers there are all like family. the hardest part of the job was when a lot of tasks came up at the same time and prioritizing them to complete which i learned successfully.  the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and caworkers."
good,"I liked working for this company, great people to work for. I did cashier mostly, I would clean behind the counters and the floors, I would stock the shelves when I wasn't behind the counter."
good,"A typical day at work was always full of things to do. In the morning there would be inventory to take and stock, while managing customers at the drive-thru and counter, as well as filling prescriptions and taking in new ones. I learned how to multi-task, how to work registers and use the computer system. My co-workers and management were all very helpful and considerate and very enjoyable to work with. "
good,The hardest part of my job was having to walk around and search for different items that were on sale while I was expecting.
good,"Typical day at work included ringing up patient prescriptions, filing away prescripions not picked up, and cleaning the pharmacy area. What I learned working here was how pharmacy technichians fill prescriptions . Management and co-workers very pleasant. The hardest part of the job was running between the drive-thru window and the counter to assist customers at the same time. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with a great staff."
good,"Rite Aid was work, just work. I punch in, punch out. While I have a lot of respect for the company for it did provide me with a job when I needed it, I still think it has a lot to improve in terms of management and culture. Discrepancies in pay and favoritism were the main issue. Sometimes it was not a teamwork, it was more trying to cover and finish what the previous crew didn't accomplish. I enjoyed that I was able to plan my schedule but when it came to holidays, there was just no fairness. Union is not the best to have for such a company. Union was totally worthless and money seeker."
good,"A typical day at work consited of multi-tasking- Answering phones, while filling prescriptions, helping customers at drop off, pick up and drive thru counters. Filling/counting prescriptions correctly and in a timely manner. Putting away stock once a week in a timely manner. Managment was amazing, had a very relatable boss. He tried very hard to get me a raise, but was unable to due to corporate stopping it. I learned a lot of brand/generic medications and what they were used for. Remembered patients before they were even at the counter and they loved that i remembered them, and said they were amazed by my memory. Was very personable to some patients and spent time with each patient to make sure everything as correct and had all their questions answered about their medications before they left the pharmacy. That was the most enjoyable part of my job, was helping out the community with their health, I just wish I could have done more."

good,"greeting customers was the first priority. Making sure every customer got what they needed."
good,I did not work here very long but overll this place was on okay place to work for.
good,"I would wake up at 6am to be there at 7:30 am. As soon as I clocked in I would walk down the store and check for misplaced merchandize. At 8 I would work the front register until 3pm. My co-workers were nice and fun to work with. I enjoyed working and dealing with all kinds of customers, some were nice others were not too nice but I always, somehow, managed to make all of the smile before they left. The customers were the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"Management is helpful and always appreciate hard work."
good,"lead man, worked in shipping and recieving, lumping trucks, clean and inspected trucks, load and unload trucks"
good,This Job was very fun. I enjoyed this job a lot. I hosted events with other businesses and I was also a pharmacy technician.
good,"I started out at Rite Aid as a cashier and within my first 6 months became the shift supervisor. I enjoyed the come and go of new faces every day and the development of familiar faces. I took much joy in assisting and befriending my customers as well as managing my team of cashiers and stock persons of whom i still speak with today. Working at Rite Aid taught me a lot about customer service, workload management and how to be a leader to my coworkers."

good,"I worked the overnight shift at a 24 hour riteaid. over all the experience was excellent and i would love to work there again. the store manager was understanding and knew how to take control of any situation that may arise. my co-workers were very helpful and easy to get along with. the hardest part of the job was keeping an eye on the shoplifters while working at a fast pace, but that's something that had to be done. The most enjoyable part of the job was during the holidays, and having long talks after work, or events that came up. also the competitions with other stores. we always aimed to be the best, and i loved it all."
good,"The most enjoyable part that you help patient to get medication.My typical day was filling a rx counting and selling rx, I learned to be a pharmacy tech. I like my mangment and my phrmacist and the other tech. the hardest part of the work with no job advancement."
good,Fun atmosphere but needs alittle bit of updating as far as technology.
good,"The job starting out was very crazy and unstructured. This particular Rite aid had just trasitioned from an Eckerd. When I started no one knew how to work on the new system so there where many unsatified customers. Mostly nice patient customers, pretty laid back job despite the fact that there is never a dull moment. Management was terrible and some co- workers. No chance for advancement at this particular location. No employee appreciation or gratitude for hard work. Low pay and no raises."
good,"fill prescriptions, help customers, i learned alot about different medications, hardest part was having to deal with an upset customer"
good,it was a fun place to work the managers were always nice the traing taught you everything you need to know so that when you got on the floor you were well prepared.
good,Team work makes a dream work! Great place to work. Always be willing to adjust to changes. Be prepared to do a lot of standing and work weird hours. Great Store!
good,The pay could be higher. The planograms that have to be done every week get pretty intense so for that reason I would ask for a higher pay. Everything else was acceptable.
good,The company was undergoing a merger and the direction was unknown.  Loved the culture but left due to uncertainty. Learned a lot and loved the leadership teams.
good,"Very structured protocols, very hard to fail because the resources are there to learn how to do your job effectively. There is not a lot of quality training on the system of the company so to truly become proficient you must read and teach yourself along with reaching out to team members."
good,"At my Rite Aid location in Buffalo, I had great managers. They were understanding, personable, and fun. I always had something to do, but it was never anything that I didn't like. The hardest part of the job for me might have only been unloading shipment, but it was still not a bad part of the job. The most enjoyable part was my coworkers and my managers."
good,Enjoyed working at Rite Aid since it was a very well known environment to work at. The workspace was very enjoyable and very fun to work at really was happy at this place and since I love working with people. I was able to fit in right away.
good,"I worked for Rite Aid as a computer repair tech for 18 years. Of course, with any job there were a few learning curves along the way. But, without a doubt I enjoyed the job, the people I worked with and the people I worked for. I really hope to find that same culture in my new position wherever that might be."
good,It is a good place to work. It is a focused job and management knows how to treat and work with people. Well organized as they do with there patients.
good,"learned now to do inventory "
good,"Awesome environment "
good,Rite aid is an amazing store but you start working at minimum wage. The health benefits were free but Walgreens bought the store so now we are a Walgreens store
good,"Slow paced job. Not stressfull. Required to assist customers locate products. Stock shelves, as well as work the cash register/ Fair pay, fair hours. Overall not a bad place to work."
good,I enjoyed my time working at rite aid. I had the best boss ever. It will be hard to top her as a manager. She was understanding and great. Rite Aid treated me well. I loved my job.
good,Great job for college students. Very flexible with schedules and needed days off. Very fair salary and coworkers. Low-stress and enjoyable environment.
good,I loved working in this environment with people I truly cared for. It felt like such a family atmosphere every day when I got up to go to work I really looked forward to going in everyday.
good,I love helping customers and being challenged every day. I enjoy working for the company but am unsure of it's future. It has come a long way from when I first started working there.
good,"Well it was a laid back job , good flexible hours and  the pay was good. Also I would get great discount which was great because I live right down the street so transportation was no problem."
good,"I started in the pharmacy not knowing anything about inputting insurance information or processing prescriptions. My Pharmacist was extremely helpful and encouraging, always taking the time to make sure I was up to speed and confident in my work."
good,"Having spent over fifteen years as a pharmacist at Rite Aid, I can honestly say that I enjoyed my time there. I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to get to know my patients, and assist them with their healthcare needs. While working in a pharmacy can sometimes be hectic, and stressful, it is at these times that it is important to stay focused, and organized in order to best help the customers.  I would frequently advise my staff (techs and clerks) to remember to focus on the customers needs, reminding them that our job is not about drugs, it is about people, and helping them to live more healthy lives"
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I learned a lot with the 4 years I have worked for this company. This was my first job in management when I was promoted to a shift supervisor.
good,"working as a field technician, was very fulfilling managing my own vehicle hours and even provided with a company credit card to handle any out of pocket expenses"
good,"it was ok to work there it wasn't quit the best paying job but it was easy, there was not soo much stress. the other employee were very nice and very helpful manager was ok had her days but was nice."
good,"Good place to work, fun staff, always busy but everyone is always super helpful, flexible schedule with very dependable hours. Would recommend others to apply."
good,"When I first started to work for rite aid, I was super shy and had to break out of my shell and that exactly what I did. If it wasn't for the manager that I had at the time to help push me and go the extra mile I wouldn't be where I am today. I thank my work experience at rite aid for if it wasn't for me getting that job it would be a lot harder for me to find other jobs down the road."
good,Rite aid was my complete favorite place to work everyone respected one another and we strived to help the company and one another succeed. Everyone was friendly and dedicated!
good,"come in and make sure your drawer is correct and lottery is all set."
good,"loved spending almost a year here , everyone i worked with for along & we made sure we got everything done needed as  a team . i worked in a small store so we were like family !"
good,"If there was more room for growth I would love it, but there is really not an option to advance past manager. The culture of the store I work at is great, I get along nicely with all of my coworkers."
good,A typical day was coming to work on time and being able to manage your time and dress appropriate. I would stock items and would also work the register. Answering questions from customers was a typical part of the job. I learned how to work back room when inventory came in weekly. The hardest part of the job was when the line at the cash registers were backed up and when a coupon wasn't working. Co-workers were very friendly and it felt like family.  Overall a good experience.
good,I'm a very eager person to learn everything about everything. At the beginning I was very excited to work for this company. I made lifetime friends. With time and management changes everything started to change until I was not happy anymore
good,It was A great opportunity for me. I assisted the pharmacist on A daily basis and also helped customers when they needed any kind of assistance as well as prepared medications.
good,Enjoy working there. It is very laid back. Always do what your manager ask of you and you won't have no problem. Also make sure you stay off the list and you definitely won't have any problem
good,"At rite aid you are easily accepted into the family. If you are willing to work it is easy to move up to a higher position, but because of the limited amount of stores, moving from shift/assistant manager to manager is very difficult. The hours are usually plentiful because of turnover issues, but this varies from store to store. If you want extra hours you can ask to work at other stores, but the DO NOT GIVE YOU OVERTIME. If you receive over 40 hours it is because they are desperate. My boss was a little strict, but still she means well by it. I cannot think of a better place for me to have started out. I hate to leave, but I have to be able to afford to live. Problem solving skills are essential to survive retail, so do keep that in mind, but most managers are willing to help you when you need it (without hesitation)"
good,"great company - worked here twice with a 5 year gap. love the managers and some of the cashiers. its retail- not much more I can say than that. "
good,"Cashed out customers"
good,"I really enjoyed my time working at Rite-Aid. The Management is usually pretty fair, as is compensation. The wide variety of activities as a Shift Supervisor made the job engaging,"
good,My store had a very busy pharmacy.  My team did an amazing job at working with the stress and keeping things light and fun most of the time.  Working with the team that I did made things much more enjoyable than other places that I have worked in the past.  We treated things like a family and not just like a job.
good,Challenging and rewarding in the same token took learning to a new level and much respect to management for making a opportunity of a life time happen for me
good,"Working at this company is good if you are a teenager and just starting out. This Job is not one that will give you enough hours or finical stability to work there solely, and not have another source of income."
good,"It was a good experience, I got along with my co-workers well, I never had any problems. I mostly enjoyed seeing certain customers because I would greet them very politely and they would smile some remember my name and loving coming to my register so I can ring them up."
good,A typical day after opening the store 30 minutes early. Checking if the closing process was done. Store was recovered and coolers were filled. Restrooms were ready for the customers. Meet vendors and go through the order processes for the coming week. Check sales for the current week and make sure we are in stock. Work on truck and monitor the registers. Work with the management teams to make sure the daily tasks are being completed in a timely manner. Scheduling and looking at the P&L reports. Meet and greet customers and help them with the needs. Help Pharmacy with their daily needs. Maintain shrink levels to the lowest and making sure internal and external theft is controlled.
good,"My job consist with pricing accurately the entire store ,hang sales tags , i had a freshness disposition report that i did the first and mid month . I did audits .. I’m HiPPA aware as well .."
good,"A typical day at work, just cashiering and stocking or doing go backs. Easy stuff. Learned lots , cashiered for front end and for pharmacy so learned in both departments. No hard part of job. Management was great hours were great. Enjoyable part meeting new friends and job is very relaxed but kind of boring when your just standing there."
good,The work day is nothing strenuous in any form. The only difficulty is the interactions with unruly customers and fellow employees. The work load clearly rolls down hill to the newest employees
good,"I enjoyed working at riteaid because it was a fast paced environment, My coworkers were very pleasant and i enjoyed the atmosphere that team work brings about."
good,Rite aid was a very valuable experience for me. I was given full control of a store and ran it proficiently . I was able to manage both the pharmacy the store .
good,"Rite Aid was a great learning experience because of the customers, there was always a challenge but always fun to give the customer service. Management was always willing to teach new things and help you grow. I learned on this job site more customer based work which provided so much as I went further"
good,I loved it there!!! They treated me so well! The only reason i left was because they cut my hours down to 1-2 days a week when i was trying to go full time. Would recommend to anybody looking for a good fun job.
good,"Counsel and answer patients' questions regarding medications, conducted office visits educated staff and physicians. Participates in Community Flu Clinics, providing flu shots to residents of the Memphis Metropolitan area."
good,A low volume entity compared to other retail organisations. Can get  boring on quite days and weekends.Micromanaged but still viable to work with.Mondays and Tuesdays are busy days .You are given sufficient help and even if staff are absent the work load is manageable.
good,"A typical day at Rite Aid would be I get there at 11:00 pm where I take out the trash, clean the parking lot and then start to face the shelves from top to bottom. I would cash out some customers when ever they came in the store and purchase items. I take my thirty minute break at 3:00 am. Then I would finish the facing of the store until the supervisor tells me to punch out to go home at 7:00 am. I learned to work at a face pace because there is alot to do during the night shift. Mangement is helpful and resorteful especially when it comes to trucking night. They would sometimes come and help out and treat the coworkers with cofffee and donuts. The hardest part of the job is keeping awake because your working overnight. The most enjoyable part of the job is the employees get a twenty percent discount."
good,"That was my first job part time, i enjoyed working with the public and learning new things in the customer service line of work. I had great managment and hours that flexed with my schooling that was very helpful."
good,Loved working here. Great job and fulfilling. Busy always. Good pay and good environment. Truck is hard work but the day goes faster with it. Plenty of chances to climb the ladder for higher position within store.
good,Its a great starter job but the hours are very limited no overtime. Great people to work with. Loved all the people i work with. As a tech you have to get licensed and finger printed which you have to pay out of pocket. Other than that its a great starter job. Or a job for a stay at home mom for extra cash.
good,When i worked with Rite aid it was a fun and productive work place. I went from part time to full time pharmacy tech after a few years of being there. One thing I didn't like when I worked there is they didn't give me benefits after I asked several times. The HR person pretty much let it go through one ear and out the other.
good,"A Typical day working at Rite Aid would be handling and communicating with customers. You really need to have patience in order to succeed in the workplace.As management there are a lot of rules and regulations overall a good experience , Being part of management taught me a lot for example communicating and setting tasks for other employers to follow and finish before the end of their shift, as well  as good time management.There is a lot of room for growth within the company.The hardest part of the job would be balancing it out with your personal life, schedules  are different every week making it difficult to plan future trips unless you sit down months ahead and talk to your boss. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with everyone as a team. Preparing for visits working together and getting the store intact."
good,"Assisted the store manager with the staff and schehduling. Managed to opening and closing functions such as bank deposits andn security functions. Also, created product displays according to company guidelines."
good,"fun, busy with lots to do. The manager would assign work schedule for the day with detail. I  would start the day with a knowledge of what needed to be done and I completed my work."
good,Its a great job overall Ive learned so much more about being a supervisor. Management is amazing the hardest part of my job is the pay its not the greatest but it puts the food on the tavle
good,Higher Management was not always the best and most understanding but the place was fun to work at. The customers were so friendly and there were a lot of regulars which made the job enjoyable. Very fast paced and busy every shift.
good,"I have learned very much from my time at Rite Aid. Most days at Rite Aid are busy, having to do planograms, price changes, recalls and other such work, however the most important thing is to take care of the customers that come into my store. The biggest thing I have learned is time management. It is very easy to get lost during the day with all the activity around you, but the need to keep focused on the task at hand is important. The hardest part of the job is not being everywhere at once, often I have to go from one part of the store to another, sometimes to get change, or to help a customer."
good,"I absolutely  loved this job ,however the management  was absolutely  terrible. I had several complaints from customers. The store and assistant manager were absolutely  horrible."
good,"Working with the customers was awesome, interacting  with co-workers was challenging and hectic,  immediate supervisors were awesome, overall a good learning experience"
good,I worked here for 3 years and it was honestly a great job. I was paid fair and treated fair. I'd go back to work here if I could.
good,"Overall I enjoyed my employment at Rite Aid although it is a very demanding and fast pace environment you learn a lot that you can carry on or take with you if you should move up in the company. Management demands are always clear for the most part on what needs to be completed at each dead line but difficulties came in when there wasn't enough workers to carry out divided task, but because we worked well together we contributed as much as we could, pinpointing each other weaknesses as well as strengths. Rite Aid is an ideal job for a person who is unsure what field of work they are interested in because its always advancement opportunities."
good,I loved working at Rite Aid. Lot's of friendly employees clean store. Overall good management a good work place. Recently started to offer 401K for employer's.
good,i enjoyed the customers and the relationship we developed. i provided satisfactory customer service and handled monetary transaction. i trained new hire
good,"I learn about medicine and how to stock the shelves, hardest part of the job was the machines, most enjoyable part was the employees and great customers"
good,the typical part of my job at work was providing the exceptional customer service. I learned how to overcome some of my weaknesses as well as to access the opportunities by proving capable for the provided opportunities. The management was great as there was always feedback for the work done and also no discrimination and everyone was treated equally. The co-workers was fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was to be able to provide exceptional customer service during the busiest time of the day and also to manage work schedule when people called off of work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to deal with different aspect of retail and also to be able to assist people  when they really needed it.
good,I had excellent managers to work with. They were understanding and worked with me while attending school. I was even allowed to bring my books to study while we were not busy.
good,On a typical day at this company we engaged with customer frequently. I learned certain policies on handling chemicals
good,This is an awesome place to work at and always works with you when needed. So many oppertunites that come out of working with this company its amazing. I love the staff and the customers always have  good story to tell to get you through the work day. Such an amazing company.
good,"A typical day at work consists of filling prescriptions, counting out medication, passing along the medication for the pharmacist to give their final approval on it, and to ring out the customer for the medication. What people don't know and/or see is the pharmacy staff calling insurances, making sure the proper quantity of the drug is in stock, figuring out why an insurance declined payment on a medication, all while trying to drum up more business. There's a lot that goes on behind the scenes that people are unaware of. Before I worked in a pharmacy, I thought it was just putting pills in a bottle, but it's more than that; a lot more. "
good,"Cashier"
good,"Work at Rite Aid as a  Pharmacy associate helped me learn medications, manage cashiers, contact with patients The hardest part of this job was to  familiarize with multiple medications from different Pharmaceutical companies. I have miss my co-worker greatly."
good,"Very productive, had to assure good customer service as well as supervising staff which wasn't hard at all. Coworkers responded well to me which taught me a lot about personality and presentation of ones self."
good,"I interact with customers on a daily basis and they are friendly.  Have interacted with upset customers and tried to help them when they have complaints.  The workers are good to work with and we all get along great.  I learned a lot since I started working here like doing planograms, resets, and revisions as well as resolving customer service complaints.  I have learned a lot about merchandising from this employer."
good,I enjoyed working with the public. IT was a great responsablility i held dearly in being able to handle patients medications..
good,not to bad good job slow steady nice management                                                                  fgfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
good,"Just go to work with a small group of people, you get to know everyone you work with extremely well. The work may be tough, but not physicality. I would recommend Rite Aid to anyone 18-25."
good,"Everyday presented itself with challenges to grow and exceed performance levels of previous days."
good,This is a very fast paced work environment with many opportunities to learn. It is very hands on and you must be good at multi-tasking.
good,"Work for Rite Aid was a wonderful first job for me. "
good,"filling prescriptions, assisting in day to day operations of pharmacy"
good,Fun because a typical day was getting ready to work hard and show the boss i can do the job and i learned teamwork with the rite aid team and communication skills the hardest part is opening boxes on a time but i was able to do it in enough time the most enjoyable of the job lunch talking to the team to help support idea's and help them move faster as we work together.
good,"A typical day at Rite Aid Pharmacy is extremely hectic. In entails being enthusiastic, helpful, fast-paced, organized, and friendly. The staff is very helpful and the teamwork displayed to get the job done is outstanding. The customers are often frequent and recognized promptly. Customers usually drop off their scripts and recommend a time they would like to pick up their completed medication. Some customers have more than 1 or 2 scripts to be filled. Frequently, we have periods where a numerous amount of patients bring their medications and expect it to be ready promptly. That's where the teamwork and well- organized staff really display their skills. Our customers are usually very satisfied with their services. The management team works are your schedule if you have kids or attending school. They always provide words of encouragement. I usually learn a lot of about drugs and what they used for which leads to being interested in different types of illnesses."
good,"When I was in this job, this job was fun by way of meeting new customers and employees from other Rite Aid stores."
good,I enjoyed being in workplace that required meeting the needs of people around me.
good,"I enjoyed working at Rite Aid for the most part, but the pay wasn't sufficient and the increase was disturbing. "
good,We play dominoes on our breaks and everybody enjoy working together there
good,"I loved that I was able to have assist customers, stock and take inventory"
good,"loved it here great job with plenty of hours, great work environment tailored for employees to spend all break time building friendly relationships."
good,"A lot of work, but there is always someone there to help you out when needed. Learn to Multitask it well save your life. From running the front cash registers, photo, Pharmacy, stock, cleaning, office work, an most important is helping anyone who needs it. This is all in one day.

good,I was front counter. I organized and cleaned and ansered phones. I learned alot about the interaction between a phamacist and a given doctor. I enjoyed that while working at the pharmacy the store I was located in didn't have me working both places.
good,Great place to work not a lot of flexibility hard to move around with in the company Advancement
good,I loved all staff member of all levels the pay+hours were good the customers were even better I loved the knowledge that was given to me and if I could I would do it all over again

good,"E Mails , Planogram handling customer service stocking office work"
good,"I loved working at Rite Aid, I remember my supervisor being very understanding about the hours I have asked to work due to personal difficulties. I loved being able to work in the pharmacy side of  Rite Aid, was very different that the front end. However very time demanding, and at sometimes no room for downtime. But I liked it, because the time actually went by fast in the back."
good,My supervisor  teacher me how to do filing and I enjoy it a lot it was a good learning process for me.
good,"I have recently worked in the Pharmacy for Rite-Aid for about 2 good years."
good,"I would fill and enter prescriptions into the computer. Ring up customers. Make sure all medication bottles are put back in order and bottles are facing forward. Reconstitute any necessary medication, count pills, clean up around the pharmacy."
good,It is a company I would like to work with again. The management does listen to your concerns.
good,I enjoyed my job at Rite-Aid.I believe that I learned something new everyday while I was working. The most enjoyable part of my job was taking care of the customers and meeting their needs.And also getting to know them on a personal level.
good,great customers and people. Good managment and tthe pay is minimun
good,Enjoyed working at Rite Aid. Would recommend it to a friend.
good,On a daily basis I interact with the general public. I help them find the items they are looking for and ring them out on a register. I also answer phones and stock shelves. The hardest part of the job is when it gets extremely busy. The busiest times of the year are the holidays. The most enjoyable part is knowing that I am helping others.
good,"I did enjoy this job, it was a lot of work from answering phone, to filling prescrptions...But the down side was the pay it was min wage"
good,I really look at all challenges in a positive light. I know for some this is very difficult. I enjoy working there because I am free to interact with different departments. By keeping in touch with others I find my self in new situations in which i can learn from. So no matter what the pay is at least I can feel confident that I am helping my self and others.
good,Rite Aid is a great place to work. Management tries to give you opportunities to step out of your regular working day. It is truly team-oriented.
good,helping with inventory.
good,"Loved it, there was always something to do you were never just standing around. Got along with all my co-workers"
good,I would start my day by counting drawers and making sure all necessary things were ready to open the store. I would work on planagrams as well as work with pharmacy techs and employees.
good,the company was a good company to work for with great benefits there were alot of friendly people willing to help you if needed
good,loved working here. the co workers and customers where awesome. i loved the hours and my pay.
good,"A nice starter job with out it i don’t think i would’ve got another job. It was a great workplace with great management, i can’t speak for all locations but mine was a pretty good location for someone with little experience."
good,"•	Assisted customers, responding to inquiries and problems."
good,"The atmosphere is peaceful and quiet. "
good,"Rite aid encourages team work, honesty, and has an open door policy. They respect my school schedule and are respectfully accommodating of personal time."
good,Valuable experience in my career training and advancement. I wish that I could have continued in my career with Rite Aid but my  store merged to a Walgreens.
good,RiteAid was a company that recognized hard work & rewarded employees for it.  It was a shame the company closed.   They made sure their employees had what was needed to make them successful.
good,great place to work.I learn alots . I need to a better opportunity  a company that I can growth and be a better person in life. the most enjoyable part of the job is packing the shelf.

good,Working here was a very good experience. My co-workers were very friendly and welcoming. The Managers were very nice and helpful. When I had an idea to implement regarding the job they were willing to listen. Overall it was a very good work environment.
good,It's a nice place to work as long as there is team work. Managenent makes the difference at the work place. Rite Aid offers a chance for advancement and assists those who want to further their education.
good,Learned a lot of new  and different things. Could be a plaxe.for advanced  opportunities and different positions used  however supervisor s are.well knowledged.
good,Rite aid is a good company but some managers shouldn't  be in management. If managers are lazy then responsibilities are on everyone else. Some workers bring their homestyle on job.
good,"i enjoyed my time working for rite aid.They were recently bought out by Walgreen, but all previous employees got to keep their jobs. They had given me the opportunity to get my associates degree while working there."
good,"Rite Aid is a good, place to work but they don't have any insurance.  They make- up by having 401K which is good.  The managers and assistant managers are very kind and I like the way they treat, their employee."
good,"A lot of caring people and employees. Was once a stable place to work, but with stores closing down things are unstable. Excellent benefits and services through the company."
good,"Worked with the comapny for a while(9 years.)"
good,"I enjoy working here and like my co-workers. The environment is nice and the majority of the customers are nice. My only complaint would be the training I received initially. I wasn't given the opportunity to complete tasks on my own or taught all of my assignments completely. This was eventually adjusted, but only after the DM was involved. Other than that, I would recommend working here if that is ones' desire. Although it can be stressful at times, my experience with Rite Aid has been positive so far."
good,"Better training or new hires and longer. Staffing has decreased over the years and responsibilities have increased, need to compensate for time RPh have to perform other tasks."
good,"•	Daily interaction with customers resolving issues ensuring the completion of the daily functions while training new employees,  completing  payroll/daily schedules,  and working as a back-up pharmacy  technician."
good,"I enjoy working with the customers and making sure they shop with a smile on their face "
good,The job was easy to get a hold of. Everyone else working there helped me when I needed it and  vice versa. I would recommend anyone and everyone to give it a try.
good,"I enjoyed my position very much, an enjoyed what i did for my title. The only negative comment I would have to say is if other employees had to call out i would have to do there tasks plus my own, which i would always do,but other than that a great place to work."
good,working in rite aid was a big addition for my career experience. once you work hard you get promotions.  the hardest part of the job is the lack of the employees.
good,I personally loved working at Rite Aid. I worked back in the Pharmacy. The two head Pharmacists were awesome and very easy to get along with. I also worked out on the floor helping stock shelves to gain extra hours.
good,"I was able to greet customers, help them find what meds and product they were looking for, I also was able to be trained to fill meds and also put them in the computer for people. I was able to interact with customers and cash them out."
good,Rite aid was a good company to work for. DMs just weren’t that great. If the management up top we’re better I would have stayed longer. They just weren’t organized and together with things.
good,"A nice and professional place where skills are recognized and promoted.A place where diversity is promoted, where there is no discrimination based on skin color or cultural background"
good,It was a decent place to work.  The general manger Gary was a good person to work with and very flexible.  The other manager in charge Tammy was always it seemed in a bad mood and not good to work with at all.  I had flexible shifts which worked with my other job so all in all it was'nt  a bad place to work.
good,"Great place to work when I did work there. They trained me to be an Pharmacy Tech, but I moved on to a different career. Wish they could get better people in the store now to create a better work environment."
good,"While working at Rite Aid I learned how to stock shelves, set up display wings and ends, scoop ice-cream, use the scan gun to find store item locations, clean bathrooms, check dates on refrigerated dates, handle customer complaints. "
good,Rite Aid was one of my most laid back jobs I had. It was located in a suburban area so not many people visited the store; it was mostly those who came to full prescriptions. I would be in charge of checking out all the customers in the from and doing my daily tasks. I liked that it was a simple paced job and I never had to rush to do anything. The only thing I didnt like was having to take over checking out prescriptions for the Pharmacy when they had time to do it which interfered with my job tasks.
good,"The best part of the job was my customers. I loved customer service."
good,As a Pharmacy Tech we prepped and dispensed prescriptions and helped customers find the items they were looking for. The opportunities to learn life advancing skills come very often.
good,"I really loved working there. Going to miss it. I loved getting positive feedback from a lot of the guest that walked through that door about how clean the store is and how polite, friendly, and helpful the store associates are."
good,I had a decent time working there. I left because of lack of hours. My store manager was great. He knew allot of info and trained me as well as he could.
good,I like being here. They are very caring with the employees as well as the customers. The management has been very helpful in trying to help me relocate
good,Hardest part of the job was dealing with coupons on Sundays. Management made it worth staying. I learned how to best handle difficult customer situations.
good,i love working fo rthe compay they people was great i meet alot of people when i work there over all it was great now hmm not so much i think a lot of change since i been there
good,Currently working on a part time basis.  I am a cashier on the front end of the store.  I enjoy working with the public.  Coworkers are great to work with.
good,"This was my first job in high school, and it was a great experience. Everyone I worked with was always helpful and never hesitated. There was always work to be done, but there was also times for some fun when it wasn't too busy. The first manager was, and still is my favorite manager I've had. The one that came after him, not the nicest guy in the world but had a good agenda. I don't believe he is there anymore."
good,"As a night shift Employee for Rite Aid i did it all. Your formal title is Cashier however Restock, Facing, Janitorial, Customer assistance and Truck-Nights are also part of the job. All or the mangers and Assistant mangers were flexible and understanding people who worked hard for their store and associates. Rite Aid was never a stressful environment ( Except the holidays but what retail store isn't) that was physically demanding but worth it."
good,"perfect first or in between job. My coworkers and managers were friendly, funny, and understanding. the employee discount was nice and family/friends were able to use it as well."
good,"Still working for rite aid but is a very fun environment "
good,"It was enjoyable to work there and during the, Christmas season it was lots of fun getting to see all the customer rush in and buy everything. It was busy and everyone worked together to make things run smoothly."
good,"I'm a cashier, stock person also in charge of putting merchandise out and also doing weekly sales tags. At the store we work as a team and that's why I enjoy job."
good,"A good place to work. friendly culture. I loved this job."
good,"In midst of my time working for Rite Aid was a comfortable, stable and mainly exciting working for that store. Throughout my time and experience working there I connected with both co-workers and the in coming customers on a repetitive basis."
good,"I believe that any job is fun and enjoyable as long as the people working there are nice, polite, and supportive to one another. Typical day involved placing orders, completing inventories, filling prescriptions, contacting providers with any issues with prescriptions, billing 3rd party insurers, and providing patient counseling at the same time."
good,Rite Aid has provided me with a relatively low stress work environment that made it conducive to interact closely and frequently with the patient population we serve.
good,"I like working at rite aid i love their system its easy to use and i got used to the whole environment there but i wish i had more hours given to me , in the beginning they used to give me all my hours but now they cant find me enough hours"
good,It was awesome working at Rite Aid the manager was friendly and supportive. The work environment was very people friendly. They allowed me to work over time if necessary.
good,"Rite aid is a good company to work it, very easy to relocate and opportunities to move up in the company are possible. I would recommend working here to a friend."
good,"Very accommodating on hours and scheduling, good communication between management and employees. Advancement can be very rapid for good employees. Very good retention for very good employees."
good,"Excellent work place culture. Advancement opportunities, bonus potential, excellent benefits including health, dental, vision, 401K with match, stock options, FMLA, LOA etc."
good,"I would balance the cash registers first. "
good,Don't get me wrong. I loved working he but compared to other jobs the pay Is low and the money is good solely for survival.It may be good for its benefits like Medicaid and paid vacation but its too demanding for a job so little in pay..
good,"I liked working there, I moved so I had to quit because I didn't have my car at the time. It was a easy job working the cashier but I didn't like standing in one spot all day so I didn't mind that I had to put in a 2 weeks notice"
good,With a strong union it is almost impossible to get fired. The pace is reasonable and the staff friendly. This is a great place to work with very little stress. Raises are yearly as per the union contract.
good,"I enjoyed my time with this company. I enjoyed our customers and ensured they would return time and time again. There was always changes of product and placement, which I enjoyed making look clean and profitable."
good,I learned so much working at Rite Aid. The pharmacists were amazing teachers. The scheduling was always equitable and coworkers were easy to get along with.
good,"I would clock in ,count the registers, write down the list of workers that came in, be cashier ,mostly re-due ,planograms, then take my break, continue with the planogram then clock out."
good,I enjoyed working for Rite Aid.  I wish I had more hours though.  I had to get a 2nd job to make up for money that I was missing out on.  Management was really good to me.
good,"Job is not overwhelming unless you're not good with dealing with customers. There is always work to do. Pharmacy manager is awesome, and considerate especially when you have kids, Overall its a great place to work."
good,"Great work environment. Friendly customers and coworkers. We're always busy at my location, which is great. Just an all around great place to work!!!!"
good,"Busy But Structured, Pay Wasn't Great "
good,I had the opportunity to work with very caring pharmacists and store manager there. Patient satisfaction and customer service was number 1 priority and most of the patient knew that we care about them and their health. It was very friendly work place and I had a good memory of the time that I worked there. I learned a lot and I went there with happiness to help people who were in need to improve their health situation.
good,"If they didn't lay us of do to store closing a problem would have my on store with in two years. I only didn't​ like working on Christmas, and every weekend."
good,"This job requires employees to attend classes to get certified, providing more opportunities in the field. The management was very friendly and very flexible when it came to the employees' schedules and availability. I learned Medical terminology, different medications and their uses, and reading scripts dropped off by the patients or sent over electronically. The workplace is very busy and fast paced. Multi-tasking and prioritizing are a big aspect of the job. Also, abiding by laws, regulations, and HIPPA regulations are a must."
good,"Working as a pharmacy assistant at Rite Aid Pharmacy, I was granted with the opportunity to improve my communication skills in order to help the others who had questions regarding insurances and transferring their medications."
good,"Everybody got along. Our daily routine is come in and go to your positions, clean floors and stock shelves. Take a 30 minute lunch break and then continue with your duties for the rest of the day.Then sweep floors and close the store."
good,Enjoy my coworkers. Flexible hours. Punctual. Fast paced environment and room for diversification of work responsibilities. Multi tasking a must. Customer service skills very important in retail
good,A typical day at work at Rite Aid can be great when working with a great team. I believe the hardest part was unpacking and stocking shelves. Some of the items were very heavy
good,"Rite-Aid was a great opportunity to use my Customer Service skills to their highest potential, The ability to enlighten customers on any question worth asking. A great Challenge for me in means of me being the youngest team member associate, Lead Cashier and Lead Store Stocker. My loyalty to the company resulted in great benefits such as customer recognition, compliments and rewards as well as Corporate compliments and reviews, A true Pleasure. Team members were very kind and pleasant to work amongst, no complaints needed."
good,i really enjoyed the fact that management held regular lunches and giveaways for hard work. they made sure workers had what they needed to work their best. they did their best to make sure you felt appreciated for your work.
good,typical day at rite aid was fun I loved my manager. what I learned well that was my first job when I was 16 I learned customer skills and how to manage money by working on the cash register and numbers. Management was great have a great connection with Tim Cavallero my first boss. Hardest part about work was staying late while going to school. Most enjoyable part of working there was getting trained by older people to become a great worker now.
good,I have to say the last 2 years I have worked at RiteAid I love it. Our store runs great we get along and work together great. our MultiStore Manager is awesome. A little concerned with the but out in progress and new corporate people coming into play but hopeful for a positive outcome.
good,"Working with RiteAid was like working with close family who care about one another and care about their service to their customers. Working as a Rite Aid supervisor has enabled me to become efficient in communicating and modeling goals required of me and my fellow coworkers. Meeting day to day store, customer and employee needs and expectations has shown me how to perform as a team member; I am able to centralize focus and clarity in achieving goals set by our managers. Through daily notices and updated policies my experiences at Rite Aid have allowed me to take part in varied marketing and advertising strategies."
good,"Rite Aid is the one pharmacy that really and truly centers around the customers, making it a personable and friendly environment. Customers desire the one-on-one relationship with their Pharmacist and Rite Aid seeks to do just that. Customers feel comfortable asking questions without being rushed here compared to other Pharmacies. Overall great experience being a part of a team that pushes health promotion techniques for the overall well-being of others."
good,"I loved working for this company. It taught me more data entry, receptionist skills, how to be a multi-tasker, and a team player.  I answered phones, sent and received faxes. Scanned prescriptions into the computer and filed the prescriptions into the filing folders."
good,So far this is the best job experience I have had. Fantastic coworkers and management is pretty awesome. And the pharmacy is always awesome if you ever have questions.
good,"I looked forward to seeing everyone. It was a friendly family store. I had the best manager! I was taught just about everything, from cashier to ordering stock. The hardest part for me was getting back into the working environment. And leaving to start a new life"
good,I really liked working with the co- worker's and taking care of the customer's and learning about different types of medicine and it's medical terminology
good,I learned how to pick items and management were very nice. My co-workers were also nice they help out a lot. The heat was the hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable part was we all got alone with one another.
good,"Gathering vast knowledge of the preparation of medicine"
good,After clocking in i would go to my Mod and attend our daily meetings discussing our goal for the day and also discussing any and all  issues that may have happened from the previous night. after that we would be split up by floors in our mod then begin our job.
good,"Working for Rite Aid has been a very positive experience."

good,"I work for good people. Rite Aid works with my schedule. It's got a good atmosphere and keeps you busy. Customers of the store are mostly regulars, so it's easy to get to know people."
good,Day to day store operation.  Manage and develop employees to meet their potential.  Work life balance is challenging.  Most enjoyable part of the position is see an employee develop to move onto the next step in their career.
good,"Helping customer find medications , as well as cashier work in the pharmacy department. Stocking medications , entering prescriptions into the computer."
good,I've been working for this company since it was Brooks and I was a cashier. I've worked my way up and I've been very satisfied. They've recently removed a lot of the smaller districts and put them in the bigger Metro Districts. So there has been ALOT of moving around of Management (District Managers/POD teams). My ultimate goal is to be higher than a Store Manager but with the new management moving (I've had 3 different DM's in the past 2 years). You have to prove yourself over and over. Which is fine considering I'm able to. However its exhausting to be promised over and over that I can begin my training for DM and then that manager leaves (rinse and repeat). But it's a great company all and all. I just want something bigger.
good,"Great place to work with great coworkers and respectful upper management.  We do have goals as a store but all departments work together to achieve them.  Its not always easy to be in the line of fire for unhappy customers, yet the most enjoyable part of the job is customers thanking you for the hard work you put into fixing their problems.  Great place to work and a positive environment."
good,"Opened and closed the store, usually closed. Counted tills in and out of registers, Balanced safes and the end of the night, and made cash and check deposits, great customer service."
good,"Provide great customer service, increasing customer satisfaction "
good,I learned alot here about being in the pharmacy as well as handling customers.  My data entry skills have improved from working here as well as my time management.
good,"fairly busy good management,"
good,"I learned so much working here, kills I wasn't taught before that I can use for the rest of my life. On a typical day, I would operate the cash register, while stocking, then late on checking in magazine along with putting them out followed up by a box up on old ones. Another example is cleaning procedures, I would get boxes in on shipmen day and we are to crush each box and put them in trash bags to help not cause a fall-slip hazard. Also, I learned even more skills on customer service working here; besides greeting every customer and asking what I can help them find, I answer the telphone and then run back to the register to help the cashier in any way with the customer, along with running back and fourth stocking, helping find products, answering all question, and taking care of the store. In conclusion, I learned so much working at Rite Aid and it was a great experience!"
good,"Got job at L B Security It was good place to work It had good hours"
good,"Rite Aid helped me immensely with my management skills. I enjoyed working with the staff and the students. I learned a great deal from Rite Aid, they treated me like family."
good,This company has a great atmosphere and cares about the need of its employees. Fun and outgoing individuals who care about the company.
good,I learned how to operate a cash register.  I learned how to have superb customer service skills.  Also how to organize merchandise.
good,I learned a lot about customer service working at this particular Rite Aid because of the very diverse community.  My co-workers were friendly and always willing to help.
good,Head counselor for an afterschool program and summer camp program for children with autism. Diverse group of coworkers and members. Taught me many skills in working with children both mainstream and those with autism.
good,I would greet customers and direct them to products they needed. I ran the cash register and stock and straightened shelves. I loved working at Rite Aid it gave me a chance to build my customer service because I worked alone and I had to figure things out on my own that training could not teach me.
good,"A typical day consisted of the same thing almost every day, very tedious. "
good,"This was my first job, it was very busy on the week ends but it was fun at the end of the day. everyone here really cared about there job."
good,"Everyday was a busy day"
good,"I love my job, I meet so many different people from different culture who I build a relationship with"
good,"It depends on the day , some days I worked in the front of the store as a cashier and help asst. my customers , put our product on the shelfs and other days I worked at the back of the store as a pharmacy tech doing refills and filling up new scripts ."
good,it just a great place to learn and and everyone is there for you as a team
good,"well at ease"
good,"learned to do orders, helping customers and balancing cashier's drawers"
good,"Working at Rit Aid was fun and enjoyable. The hours were great, but there were not a lot of employees so it gave little room to move around the schedule. Management and Co-workers were also enjoyable and diverse. The only hard part about the job was manually changing prices and placing them around the store. It was very time consuming but the job gets done. I enjoyed it because it was a central store in the neighborhood so it was always filled with shoppers. There was never a stand still moment in the store. I learned a lot of patients working at this store because it was always busy. I also learned how to work at a fast pace but also efficiently."
good,"Working at rite aid was a good experience the people you meet and work with are pretty nice and fun easy to get along with learned to work with people, unloading the trucks was pretty much the hardest part of the job best part were the people you met"

good,"Provided A quick and Accurate distribution Of Medications"
good,Great work environment.  Good company to learn new tasks.  Career growth opportunity.
good,"Assisting customers with questions and shopping."
good,"I was in high school when I had this job and I enjoyed every second of it. I was a cashier in the front and i stocked and faced shelves, cleaned up around the store, and assisted customers to their cars. This job was not challenging or fast paced but it was a nice place to work as a teenager. I enjoyed dealing with customers all day and solving problems. I was good at keeping the store organized and making sure everyone had a smile on their face. My manager was motivated and direct. He knew how to get things done and I really liked that. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the bathrooms. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a smile on everyone's face before they left my store."
good,"A typical day in the pharmacy was always a positive challenge. I learned the meaning of superior customer service. You have to be highly skilled at muti-tasking. I personally was in charge of over seeing all weekly orders that included: controlled drug orders, all inventory management, out dates, over stocks, returns. I was the middle person between insurance companies and patient. I toggled between three pick up/drop off windows while answering phones, sending faxes and typing presciptions. The hardest part of the job was staying on the same page with my co workers. I feel I thrived at this. I also learned I work great under pressure. The most rewarding part of my job was the look of relief when I got a certain medication covered. At Rite Aid on Manchester in Encinitas the customer was more than a patient thery're like family."
good,"Shift Supervisor ..work with customers , cashiering , stocking ,end cap didplays ."
good,"Team work, inventory management, excellent managers and co-workers."
good,I enjoy helping people with any problems or concerns they have
good,"A typical day at work for me consist of coming in early to do, what we call a pull report. The pull report is a report that prints out daily with items that we have in stock in the backroom that were sold the day prior. My job would be to collect all these items and restock the shelf. After this task is completed I personally take it upon myself to visually check for empty spots in the store and double check if we have any of those items in stock. After all that is completed I go from aisle to aisle facing the store. Facing is a term basically meaning, getting the store into presentable form. I go into all the aisle and put all the merchandise where they belong and make it look neat."
good,"good place to work,  just need more hours and pay.  also need to be permanent."
good,"I enjoy helping my customer and working with my coworkers. the hardest part of my job was not being able to meet sales sometime, over the years of working at rite aid I learned a lot."
good,"I love working with people, going out of my way to help someone find something they are were looking for."
good,"Loved working on Schematics & Cashiering "
good,"A typical day at Rite Aid includes entering and filling prescriptions for the pharmacist to check. I also ran register and drive through as well as cleaned and made sure inventory was up to par. I had a four pharmacist rotation and they all have the best attitudes and the pharmacy manager is understanding, which was good for my previous internship. The only hard part of my job is having to be the bad guy a lot, I had to inform them that they have super high co-pays and we cant fill their prescription just yet. The best part is the most difficult prescriptions, telling the patient they went through and their sigh of relief and how thankful they are of you."
good,"I started working for Fays Drugs when I was 15 and a junior in high school.  Fays was bought out and became Rtie Aid eventually.  I worked in all aspects of the store, cashier, head cashier, video clerk, clerical, and pharmacy.  I enjoyed every job that I had, from stocking shelves to help prepare daily cash drawer to helping pharmacist .  "
good,"Stock, maintenance, cashier.I learn hoiw to stock stuff in there selves also learn how to handle an cash register. I got along with all my co-worker the hardest part was when i first started.the most important part was when i was doin stock because i had to get it done a certain time "
good,Enjoyed my work around my co workers:)
good,Everyone know what they had to do and the only down fall was how many people were picking
good,"There was always something that needed to be done. I learned the value of customer service and have gained the respect of all my customers, as a result. The management teams were amazing people and reliable employees. The hardest part of the job was probably having to stock the beer coolers and shelves throughout the day and at the end of the shifts. The best thing about Rite Aid was the customers, who were always cheerful and glad to shop at the store."
good,"Receive in vendors, stock merchandise, help customers find product and ring up sales."
good,"A typical day of work for me consists of assisting customers with merchandise help or any questions they could have about a product. My co-workers are great and fun to work with and they are always there for me when I have an issue or concern. The only issue that could arise that could make my job difficult is when a customer has an issue and is not willing to be nice but rather difficult. I always keep calm though and make sure to call a manager to help with the situation if I can not resolve it myself. Throughout my eight years at Rite Aid I have learned no matter the issue and no matter how difficult a customer is, it is best to always have patience and understanding with customers. I have learned never to be rude and to always make sure to have great customer service."
good,"I work in a fast paced retail pharmacy. We have fun while maintaining professionalism. We make sure patients are cared for in a timely and safe manner. And we try to save them money while still making money for our company. It is a great place to work. Everyone is very helpful and understanding. We talk to local Doctor's offices and insurance companies, always willing to go above and beyond for our patients."

good,"enjoy workin with customers everyday, working as a shift supervisor is a great job, my co-workers are team players, i have to make sure they are doing the job i ask of them..the job can be hard when the store is super busy, you have to take care of your customers no matter what...i love working with customers..."
good,"Work hours flexible, I learned many things..like doing up shlves for ads, and how to organize a work station. Co~workers were always great and helpful. Hardest part was when trucks came in to do stock. Most fun was just working w/ a great crew, and making money at it."
good,"I enjoyed truck day because we were very busy working and the day went by quicker. By stocking shelves I learned where every product was located in case a customer asked. I really liked my boss, she was so easy to get along with & set a good example having a strong work ethic. I enjoyed my co-workers, they made me laugh. I guess the hardest part of the job was having to work on Christmas Day. I really missed being with my family."
good,Greeting customers and working with my amazing co-workers.
good,I love going to work everyday . The environment compensates for the lack of money and benefits
good,It was a great place to work and it was nice and clean staff was great would love to work 3rd shift there if they move back to charlotte nc
good,"I run the register, I am supposed to be training to be a pharmacy technician. However, the district manager has cut hours, and I'm working about eight hours a week at this moment. My training for a technician has been put on hold for the time being. A typical day at work can be very busy and involves multitasking, but that's what I love about it. I do not like standing around, I'd rather go home then. There is always something to do there, or I find something to do. I have the best managers ever, they work with me (even if I only work eight hours a week.) I am almost done with my prereq's for nursing, and they have totally been supportive. I give them credit for my 4.0 for this semester with taking 14 credits. The hardest part of my job was learning all on my own. We did not have time to really train me, so I've had to watch and do things on my own, but everyone has been willing to answer all my questions. I love the people there and the customers!"
good,I had a great time while working in rite aide pharmacy. Ater 10 days of my joing the president of the company visited and they were very happy with my work.
good,I been there for 10 years so I have learned so many things. I started as a cashier and worked my way up to an Assistant. I employed over 20 employees. I enjoy working with people so its easy do that job. Customer Service is my biggest attribute.
good,Exciting company to work for! Learned a lot about management and the Arts.
good,"Take prescriptions over the phone and in person, work with health professionals and customers, help mix medicines, count pills, measure medication, label and give instructions for medicine, and help take payments."
good,I worked at Rite Aid until Walgreens closed the store.  I had a great boss and a great team.  I transferred to another Rite Aid but left when it was scheduled to convert to Walgreens.
good,A great experience to work with people of diverse cultures and beliefs. The organization is well structured and working groups have been segmented with different departments each specializing in a particular working activity.
good,"This was a great place to work , the staff was friendly the managers where understanding and very helpful. If the hourly pay was better I wouldn't stayed."
good,I have enjoyed working with a wonderful group of coworkers who have made my life as a pharmacist enjoyable. I owe them all the good days I have at work for doing their job with dedication and allowing me to lead them.
good,Di todo lo mejor de mi como empleada haciendo todos los trabajos de ka compañía hasta el día del cierre.
good,Great company to work for. Had a great boss at rite aid was very willing to help when it was needed.i learned a lot  while I was working there. Everyone was very helpful while I was learning
good,"I was treated well by my coworkers as well as management, everyone was supportive and easy to collaborate with. Working the front end of the store could get stressful, but with everyone's kindness the burden was lessened."
good,"I personally loved my time at Rite Aid(30 years) until my position was eliminated. I met so many good people , some of whom became very good friends. I worked in an ever-changing direction department, but I loved the diversity, others may not. Rite Aid overall is a good company to work for."
good,"The riteaid I worked for was a very busy high paced environment,  that was very team driven for success.  It was a fun place to be and the employees were hard working and reliable."
good,Rite Aid is a great place to work because you get to put your customer service skills to good use. They teach you a lot in merchandising and setting up displays to promote visually appealing environment. Its also a great place to become well rounded in everything as you can help out in pharmacy.
good,"I really,  sincerely love my job at Rite Aid due to the customers, coworkers,  and local management.  I have been given a lot of flexibility in my schedule, which is important to me.  However,  the pay is ridiculously low and although I make less than $10.50 an hour,  upper management has declared that I am maxed out as a cashier.   In other words,  I can't get an annual raise.   Ever.  Unless I want to become a manager,  which I  do not."
good,Working at rite aide pharmacy was a good customer service experience. Not only did it add to the other years of experience of current customer service that I had prior to working at rite aide I met alot of wonderful people at that time even though it was brief interactions with the customers.
good,Even thought the pay is ok and could be raised a bit. The team and management i work with make my experience with rite aid great. The opportunity is there if you work hard and take pride in your work
good,When working at rite aid u have to be willing to be very hand ons and have good costumer service during the weekdays it was usually slow but working there I learned the right way to do things at riteaid . The hardest part of the job is managing time it can get slow so u need to keep yourself busy
good,":  Providing excellent customer service, Greeting people at the door coming in and going out of the store, keeping watch on the cameras of the store at a podium,making sure the stores assets are protected at all times.Making sure the cashiers are performing on the registers up to company standards.  checking documents as far as shrink reports, cashier performance reports, and product protection reports.  Catching shoplifters as they try to exit the store when passing the last point of sale and following each step of the company protocol to detain the shoplifters until the police come or until I decide if I want to take further actions.  Issuing the proper paper work to maintain the protection of the assets by barring the shoplifter from going into any Rite Aid's and enrolling them into the shoplifters recognition system."
good,I love my crew at right aid. Great crew a lot of hard work but always a good day to work with those guys. The company is a good company to work for. The manager is awesome
good,"But sometimes they cut down our hours wherein we need those hours. But that how it works, so we don’t have any choice but to keep working in RiteAid.."
good,"on a typical day at work we can fill easy 100-125 script per day. I learn how to multitask a lot, there were times we could use a third person. The hardest part of the job not enough work hours was given. But the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and greeting the clients."
good,"Working at Right Aid is the easiest and nicest job I have ever had. I worked at a store that is in an area of wealthy people so please take that in to consideration, but the main reason why the work environment was so nice at my store was mainly because of my store manager whom is not just a really nice person but a great manager, and that is what creates the whole employee family experience. this is not true for all rite aids and my store is pretty much the exception not the rule."
good,Unfortunately my employment end in December the are closing the warehouse a corporate decision looking for other employment I am a hard worker willing to learn other skills and always on time at my job never late.

They need to improve the compensation and give better holiday and vacation benefits.  In a retail setting, a good work-life balance is difficult.

Management, was the best in retailing; due to the managers showing support by doing as you would do. Co-workers, were great, but never really got to see them all as much. The, hardest part of retailing would be completing planograms, stocking products, getting inventory, yet still having to please the customers with only two people on the floor.

My co-workers were very polite and helpful in getting me started in my pharmacy career. The hardest part of my job was just trying to get all the work done at a reasonable speed to satisfy the high volume and customer demand. The most enjoyable part of my job was the feed back I received from my boss about being a great worker. I really felt appreciated."

good,"I would usually watch the front, and the managers would give me easy tasks to do. I learned how to be more responsible, and basic functions in the retail environment. I loved most of the managers, but there was one or two I thought were very rude. The hardest part would be keeping an eye on the customers, because sometimes when you're on a task you don't hear them and they end up waiting at the cash register. The most enjoyable part is getting to meet tons of people all day!"

I learned how to muti-task between answering the phone and counting pills, and waiting on customers. My managers were great and it spoiled me thinking that all managers were the same in every work place. The hardest part of the job was looking for a script when a customer came to pick it up because it was sometimes still in a basket not showing on the computer. Another difficult part was trying to learn all the brand/generics, but eventually it was easy to catch on. The Most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers, they were awesome. I loved getting to work with them every day."

good,"I loved working at Rite Aid, unfortunately there was times when the boss at the time could not meet all my health needs . Overall, I loved the people I worked for and what I did."
good,"Busy day, from opening, to getting cashiers ready for the customers, to the pharmacy department making sure they had all they needed to complete their day."

good,I would open and close the store. Manage and assign task accordingly to employees. Maintain and clean and respectful workplace. Work together to ensure all tasks and procedures are done per day of work.
good,"I enjoy working here but I would like more hours.  I work evenings and I provide customer sales and services as a cashier at the check out.  I interact with customers and help people find what they are looking for.  I usually work with one other coworker each shift.  The other worker is either my supervisor or my manager, who is supportive. The hardest part of the job is the down time.  It is sometimes slow during the night, especially in the winter.  I would prefer a faster paced job which would keep me busy for the entire shift. I like meeting new people who come in to shop.  I also enjoy my fellow coworkers."
good,"As an employee of Rite Aid, we are not only a place to be employed, it's also a place where you gain a family.  Everyone is there to help one another where and when needed, everyone cares.  Once bought out by Walgreens Boots Alliance, it was very difficult to split stores from the current co-workers because the environment in our company alone was one none of us wanted to let go of."
good,Enjoyed my time there .. Very organized kept clean.. Learned alot about team work to get the job done if 1 department needed help another department would send people to them .
good,Rite aid was my first management job outside of food service. They’re both retail but compared to chick fil a there were slot of differences such as floor moves and business plans.

I would recommend anyone to work there. great benefits. nice work environment. great employees. great management. very layed back environment. apply online to become apart of their team. hiring can be a little long depending upon back round. they do drug testing. you have to become certified. good luck with becoming apart of Rite Aid work team.
good,"a typical day at work is a slow moving day i learned to always ask question to always be high alert most difficult part of my job is coming to the ending of the day, when people are going home from work the store will be pack and that when people gotta be moving around getting to all the customers"
good,Working at ride aid gave me a life time opportunity to have a new fresh start. My first job where i learned how to balance money and be able to be part of a team.
good,my coworkers made working at rite-aid such a good experience. They have helped guide me into my confidence which has allowed me to flourish into a great shift supervisor.
good,"Preparing prescriptions, helping costumers in the store, stocking vials and medications, and maintain a clean work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing your helping everyone you see have a smile on their face when they leave the store"
good,"I had the opportunity to first work in the pharmacy, then the front end, and eventually as a shift supervisor.  I learned multiple jobs where I could manage the store most of the time.  The hardest part of the job was the lifting while unloading the totes on delivery days.  My most enjoyable part of my job was customer service and office work.  I did the banking as well.  "

good,"Good company to work for,  good work environment,  good management,  employees work together to better the company not just out for themselves,  tough work but a sense of accomplishment"
good,"I liked working in the rite aid i did work in there were a lot of local customers so that was very nice. Also the hours were incredible "
good,"Moving from entry level to manager, I must say they have given me the support to move myself in the right direction. Better culture than all other companies I have worked for, although some departments I see could being a challenge to work in"
good,"I liked it, but that is my personal preference, i like fast moving jobs, keep me busy at all times not waiting around or sitting around. Everyday you most likely work in different areas, so its interesting to even see what you didn't know the company sold."
good,For the most part my time there as a floating technician in the begining was great during the merger it became a little scary as we were re positioned due to the closing of some store but my manager was very accommodating insuring I was always in a healthy environment.

The management was amazing and I loved the people I worked with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers, however, most of the customers were enjoyable."
good,Loved working with  my Manager. Hardest part of the job was standing but I got use to it. Loved working with Co- Workers. Loved meeting new people. Learned how to deal with all types of people
good,This was a very fun environment where you always feel valued. As a manager you always have support from other managers in the area. This made for building a great rapport with others.
good,"You connect more with the people and build friendships; Not just in the store, but at different flu clinics....building trust."
good,"All I will say is Rite Aid was a fun place for me to work, and everyone was exceptionally friendly, and easy going. My overall supervisor was great!...I worked the pharmacy end of it all...It was a fast paced environment...so if you're looking for that type of work, to make the day fly by...that is the job for you :)"
good,"I enjoyed wprking retail,i would have stayed had i not have to relocate .I enjoyed helping people, an even now sometimes when im in the store people ask me where things are.I learned alot from working at payless-Rite Aid. I had great manigers at the locations that i worked."
good,Worked for this company for over 10  years.  I left due to a relocation to another state.  This was overall a good company to work for.  I had a good working relationship with my District Manager.
good,I enjoy the people I work for and management is very fair. Any issues are addressed immediately. Like being given the responsibility to have a section of the store that I have control over. I order and ensure items are in stock and do cycle counts to maintain inventory levels are accurate. Work well on my own but to get along with others. Very flexible and upbeat and always work with a sense of urgency. My last two reviews were above average.
good,"The management at Rite Aid cares about the employees strongly and also goes the extra mile for our patients and customers. Coming from CVS where we were treated like garbage, it was a nice change."
good,This was my first job as a cashier. At first I thought it was going to be hard but after the first few days of the simple processes and friendliness of the coworkers it was a great place to be. After seeing the same customers day in and day out you get to meet and know who is who and what they are needing.
good,Being a certified pharmacy tech has been a wonderful experience.  I really enjoyed it.   I love working with people and I am a very good listener.  My pharmacy manager was one of the best people I have ever worked for.  Helping customers was the best part.  I have made so many friends from Rite Aid.
good,Great place to work. Rite Aid has great benefits for their employees. Only downfall if your good in your position they will try to keep you in the position.
good,"The work environment was great. I had a great manager who worked with my school hours, vacations, school events and family events.

good,I worked here and I liked it. It was a good experience. I liked the fact we had union and benefits. Thanks for the time. I got moved up to a supervisor within months of employment.
good,"Rite is an excellent place to work with true professionals running the company.  Pharmacy is main focus of their business.  It is a very busy place to work.  My immediate supervisor was a very fair man.  Often there was not enough technician help, but still made it through the day."
good,"Working in retail can be hard for anyone, even the friendliest of the friendliest, but working at Rite Aid has been very enjoyable especially with the management staff. A few of my coworkers and customers can be strenuous at times, but I feel like I'm sensitive and can take things very technically. I don't intend to build tight knit friend/relationships in the work place and while people may even strive for that. Rite Aid is a very tight knit willing place. They want you to be ""a part of the family"" and I don't want to be. Thats the only downside to working there, I'd say."
good,"I was a cashier so basically just rang customers or was working in the aisle"
good,"Approving cashiers schedule, auditing on hands inventory, running freshness report in the system to get rid of obsolete products on shelf and backroom. Counting the registers and closing the store leaving and nice and tidy for the next day. Store Manager is very understanding and cooperative, he is available to answer to any questions any time. Rite Aid is very diverse, employee work together, delegating tasks to them. The hardest part of the job is dealing with situations where a customer is not willing to cooperate, it is very hard to satisfy the customers need and fulfilling the company's policy at the same time.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with an outstanding staff that is always willing to help out in every aspect."
good,"I enjoyed going to work each day and being a part of such a positive team and customer service environment."
good,"While I worked here, everything went very smoothly. I never felt like I was being overloaded with tasks to do. All of my coworkers were quite easy to get along with. Some days we would get some bursts of being fairly busy, but beyond that it was quite enjoyable."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my employment at Rite Aid although it is a very demanding and fast pace environment you learn a lot that you can carry on or take with you if you should move up in the company. Management demands are always clear for the most part on what needs to be completed at each dead line but difficulties came in when there wasn't enough workers to carry out divided task, but because we worked well together we contributed as much as we could, pinpointing each other weaknesses as well as strengths. Rite Aid is an ideal job for a person who is unsure what field of work they are interested in because its always advancement opportunities."
good,Great place to meet and help customers find what they are looking for. Training is provided in person and by computer. Able to do community outreach with seniors and local business.
good,"Some days at work were slow but steady and gave me enough time to finish up or complete any tasks"
good,Great associates and great management.The customers were great and friendly. The hours we're flexible and Management are willing to work with your schedule
good,"Working one on one with customers for in store needs as well as pharmacy needs.  "

good,"Working with customers and being able to help others."
good,"Worked there for awhile and was truly able to get a grasp on what the job was about."
good,"I loved working at Rite Aid, I love helping people find what they need, tending to the isles when they are messy, overall I was appreciated there and was paid well which I find very important because without happy employees theres not a happy business."
good,"I had a great time working there, there is a lot of responsibility but you get learn many useful skills. The store manager is a great person to work for, the company doesn't deserve a person like him."
good,"Rite Aid Pharmacy was a great company to work for as a young adult, trying to figure out what I wanted to do career wise. I believe it would also be a great job for a high school student."
good,The employees  were kind very supportive. Taught  me a little about  retail also stocking and kindness.the customers  enjoyed having me work with them and vice versa. It 21st a great experience  for me as well as my customers. I would  go back and work  their.
good,"During my time at Rite Aid, I was able to gain and maintain several skills in all fields of Management. Under my store manager I learned everything from Payroll all the way up to Inventory Management and maintenance."
good,"I have been with company two months, made new friends, and the staff there is exceptional. I enjoy customer service and have learned skills such as cashiering, replenishing and the ins and outs of store etiquette. My co workers are helpful to me and others. Hardest part is when everything is done and trying to find more to do. I have learned a lot and continue to learn daily."
good,"I always had something to do at Rite Aide. I constantly was stocking, doing office work, and working as a sub-in in the pharmacy. Quick days and great people!"
good,Rite Aid has given me the freedom to run a business as if it were my own.  I have hand chosen every associate that works there.  There is a synergistic relationship between the Front End and the Pharmacy.  The team at my store are focused on taking care of each other and our customers. The simplest things make all the difference when exceeding the customers expectation of customer service. We escort our customers to the item they are having trouble finding. We assist customer to their vehicles as needed. If we don't know the answer to their questions we find someone who can help. This is the culture at my store.  I am very guarded as to who I allow to be part of the team.
good,"I did great customers service interact with customer excellent place to work I feel welcome working with the staff.I show them the best of my ability to work.I always,on times for work. I appreciate my customers I always make them laugh and smile I had a good relationship with them."
good,"Advancement options are less and once you move from Full time to Part time. Very hard to get back to full time."
good,"Great positive environment, very clean and organized. The staff was fantastic. Everyone did their jobs and was very punctual."
good,This is a great company to work for and the management is good as well.  I had a very good experience while working for them. I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,"a typical day at work is meeting greeting customers, helping them find the product that best suits  them. cashing out draws, lottery making sure employees take brakes making sure employees is respected as well as the customers. making sure the store is in tip top shape. I have awesome co-workers we are like a family work off each other. my most enjoyable part of work is my customers satisfaction."
good,As a Pharmacy Associate it is a great learning experience because they show you the ropes on what pharmacy tech does on a daily basis.
good,"Every day at Rite Aid is different. In the mornings you would come in and get everything ready for the day, count all the registers in, make sure the deposit is made, and finish all daily office paper work. Then you would do the daily pull report and freshness report. Towards the end of the day you would have to face and recover the store completely. Now each day there was something different do to whether it was placing orders, setting planograms, changing the monthly profit planner, setting sales, and so on. While I was working their my co-workers and I grew into a family like bond, since we had all worked there for numerous years; my boss viewed me as her right hand man. The hardest part of the job I would say was dealing with irate customers and truck days. The most enjoyable part would be the environment between co-workers, everyone got along and it was a fun place to work."
good,"Very stressful work environment"
good,"While working here, I have gained great skills, such as customer service and management skills.  Trying to advance in this company is a lot more difficult than expected."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management"
good,"I've learned how to multitask , learned how to stock shelves, learned cash register really well, learned how to work the photo department and take passports. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers. They were really nice and respectful."
good,Working at Rite Aid can be a bit slow at times but management will always find you something to do to help pass the time.  Customers are mostly friendly and it's easy to build relationships with the customers because they are all regulars.
good,This was my very first job when I reach the required age to work.  I ended up staying with this company for quite awhile.  This company help prepare me for future jobs ahead. .

good,Have learned alot in Leadership. The company has excellent benefits!! Rite Aid company is a great place for advacement !!
good,My days were really educational for the position I was in. I had the type of store manager who was very active and a person who would like to challenge his employees. I must say the store I was placed at had the best co-workers to work with. My store and assistant manager taught me a lot about my management position.
good,"I worked for Rite Aid for three year. A typical day was working the register, stocking and tiding shelves, and helping customers choose the right products. I have little to say on my co-workers since few of them did/do their jobs as they are told or at all. I still keep in contact with my managers and shift supervisors as I got along with them very well. My store manager had started to train me to be a manager a few months before I left to start university. The hardest part of the job was having to clean up the messes of the customers and my co-workers. I enjoyed most interactions with the customers, though there are always a few who are more difficult, but I never found it hard to have a smile on my face and help everyone who came in the store."
good,I loved working at this job. The pay was great and so was the benefits. Provided you with great food in the cafeteria which was catered to you. Free fitness room that you can use to exercise in and a shower room to was up in. Faced pace environment that kept you on your toes and kept you busy.
good,I enjoyed working for Rite Aid and the team culture. It has great leadership team and the upper management are down to earth people.
good,"I was with riteaid for 11years so I knew a lot of my customer on a personal level which I loved about my job and a lot of them asked for me personally because no matter what kind of day I am having I was always happy and bubbly ...... I learned how to change prices, process outdates, receive vendors,inventory the store,process western unions,money orders,order supplies and merchandise,helped with management stuff like approvals getting money for registers"
good,"get to work, start doing my personal care with residents, then i work on maintaining the facility."

There are many things that I learned at Rite Aid that will help me with my career down the road, such as knowledge of medical terminology. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with unhappy customers, medication is a personal thing for people and sometimes they allow their temper to get the best of them. If I had to choose the most enjoyable part of my job it would be the appreciation I get from my co-workers, I'm a big over achiever when it comes to my job and they are very thankful for that."
good,great overall company to work with. i worked in a low volume store now and i am the only guy to lift and tote heavy merchandise and that comes with a low payroll. i would like to work in a store with more payroll to have more flexability and have more employees. you have to be a very focused manager to get all jobs or tasks to get done each and every day i liked working there or i would not have worked there 25yrs.

The staff treated each other as if we were one big happy family. The store manager and assistant manager showed constant care and concern for all of the employees. The hardest part of the job was having close the store permanently and say goodbye to that family that I had become a part of. I loved taking part in the prevention of inventory loss by walking the store and keeping eyes on people that we knew were coming in and being dishonest."
good,"I worked for a very busy store. I had just enough time to get what was required of me to get done.  I really liked everyone I worked with and all of our customers. I especially enjoyed dealing with the public and assisting and satisfying their needs.  I was trained to be effective in my duties by our manager.  The hardest thing was to scoop ice cream and help customers in line at the cash register in time as to make everyone's experience a pleasant one. We all worked together to accomplish this.   Our store was always faced and well stocked which took all of us working together to see the store was very clean, neat and organized.I was transferred to another store when I moved.  The manager there really helped me improve my abilities and skills to the best of my performance. He was the best Manager I had ever had the pleasure to work for. Everyone in the Encinitas store were a valuable asset to the company.  We also worked very well together to perform our duties and helped each other accomplish what needed to done in order to ensure the customer satisfaction we were well known for. I learned more about how to react to difficult situations and more about managing other employees so that the company would be satisfied with our performance."

There was also a promise of more training to come. That was fine for some time. I liked working there. I developed relationships with the shoppers. After a long while I got tired of doing the same things all the time. After repeatedly asking about the training for advancement that never came, I decided to move on."
good,Believe the pay rate should be a lot higher due to the volume of pharmacy prescriptions generated each day.  This job is non-stop from the time you walk in the door.

She would get out there and work harder than anybody and she was hardly ever in her office if she was she was doing paperwork or on the phone other than that she was out on the sales floor with me or whomever was working. I learned a lot from my manager. I learned how to set planograms, to use the handheld to look up merchandise and see where and how many we had in the store and the the price.  We had fun out there when nobody was in the store we would dance and cut up.  The hardest part was some of the customers and then our last day there.  It was a very emotional day"

good,"I liked working for Rite Aid as a pharmacy technician.  The work can be very fast paced and stressful during rush hour, but I liked the challenge.  I started as a regular pharmacy technician at one location and then was asked to be an assistant to the Pharmacy District Manager, which meant that I worked in all the stores in my PDM's district.  I prepped each pharmacy for inventories, corporate visitors, auditors and inspectors.  The only reason why I quit was to become a foster parent."
good,I worked for rite aid for 18 years. I probably would have retired from there. Its a shame corporate is terrible and had no clue how to run a company and walgreens bought them.
good,"Working is a pharmacy is hard work and it takes a ton of organizational skills combined with lots of multitasking, all while providing outstanding customer service. I typically work 10 hour days on my feet but the day goes fast because of the non stop flow of work. I have learned so much while working in a pharmacy including how to perfect being diligent while being very fast.

good,"After I clocked in I went to computer to see what I was doing for the night, I printed out my forms for moving and replenishing for the pickers. I moved items from location depending on season. I also did cycle counts and put returned merchandise back into system. Also when new merchandise came in we checked it in and found location to stock item to. We worked alone. We had what needed to be done for the shift and we did our job and left. Not a lot of supervision for quality job. Turned in papers before we left on what all we got done on our shift."

good,"This has to be the easy job I have every had. Stocked inventory, cashier duties and provided excellent customer service. Make sure the store is nice and neat."
good,This was one of the best jobs I had worked. I went from a front end cashier to a pharmacy cashier in only 3 months. I learned a lot from the pharmacy managers about different medications. I also learned how to issue money for lottery tickets and how to do Western Union transactions for sending and receiving money.

good,"Like the fast paced job, I like both picking and stocking and my co workers.Had production goals we had to meet . Like the casual dress code but not a big fan of the steel toe boots."
good,Definitely a numbers thing here all day so as long as you’re willing to push yourself it’s great!  Mostly depressing but the paycheck weekly brought you back
good,"I personally enjoy my job at Rite Aid, my coworkers were great and I saw my managers as equals and friends rather than people in charge of me, the work environment is relaxed but there is usually some work to do, probably the hardest thing to do at that job was truck day where we got new products to stock on the shelf, even then it wasn't very difficult. Overall it was a great work experience and I greatly enjoyed it."
good,I loved! Management was wonderful. If you had a problem they would work with you even amongst the other cashier. Everyone worked together. When I move back That's where pull be working again. Except in management. I was in the process of it before I had to move

I learned about medications & its uses & how to handle stress in a very busy workplace, This workplace is very diverse & is a second family to me. The hardest part of the job is time estimation when someone drops a prescription off. The most enjoyable part of the workplace is we help each other out with everything so one does not over stress."

I was always challenged to do better, I improved so much in a short matter of time I understood the hard work and pressure our pharmacists go through every day it's definitely not an easy job it takes time and most importantly patience to work under those circumstances and making sure no mistakes are made and keeping the customers satisfied and happy with their services. I miss being around this environment very friendly I might add."
good,Working for Loss prevention at Rite Aid was a great experience. This job taught me how be inconspicuous. After learning my store it became easier for me to be more alert and manage my duties independently.
good,An advrage day is working the cash register front and facing the store While assisting customers. The delivery truck would come every two weeks and we had 2 day to put everything in it correct place. The only problem is you get a 30 min lunch brake.
good,"Great place to work around different people everyday cashier  ,customer service . I handle store accounts,inventory control,unloading trucks, handling bank dropsan opening ,closing of store"
good,Go in at 5:00 pm if I had to work the night shift I really like working on stock days because I really like looking at we would get if there was some new stuff. But if I had to work the day shift I had to come in at 8:00 to 5:00.
good,"I have been in retail for more than 15 years, I have been a store manager or supervisor which is the current position that I am in. I work well with others, I enjoy working with the public. I believe when you work for a company you are devoted to their set of rules, I strive for excellent customer service, control shrink/theft, hold employees to the highest standards and maintain a work friendly environment."

My favorite part of my job is the fact that every day I am challenged to learn new things and constantly improve on my performance in a supportive environment."
good,"Managers were helpful and understanding. The work was enjoyable and kept you busy. Assistant managers would go out of their way to make sure you took your breaks, weren't feeling overworked, and happy overall."

good,I go in and make sure dont noone take anything that do not belone to them they is a good company to work for I just want to have more then one job
good,"I loved keeping the store in order, it always looked neat. My manger was the best boss I'll ever have. She also turned into my best friend. Co-workers were great, with the accessional few. Planograms were actually one of my favorite parts. Worst part would be customers from the pharmacy needing me to ring up prescriptions and causing problems because I couldn't do anything about their refill."
good,I enjoyed the growth in my customer service skills and working with such an amazing team and management. Overall wonderful work environment.
good,"they actually promote from within, great training, great pay and benefits. I am very sorry they left Rome. If they came back I would be first in line to apply."
good,A typical day we fill prescriptions and help people by ringing them out or answering their questions over the phone. I enjoy working with all of my co workers.
good,"working at Rite Aid was absolutely fun for me. I enjoyed working there. Only con would be not taking breaks while working your shift, which ranges from 8 to 10 hours. Imagine standing up on your feet for 8 hours and not taking a break. it was very tiring."
good,The compensation could be more. However I enjoy the environment. The manager is awesome. A typical day is data entry waiting on customers filling medication orders.
good,lots of advancement opportuninites. can get hectic when you have to balance personal life and work at the same time. i would return to this company if i really needed to
good,A typical day at work for me consisted of cashiering and providing excellent customer service. The management is very nice and able to work with employees on their schedule needs. The coworkers are very friendly and know how to do their job correctly.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Rite Aid. I was a student so I had a lot of balancing to do with work and school but my employer always worked with me. I received a great deal of knowledge about dealing with the public and how to handle negative situations. Overall, a great place to work."
good,"I am in school to become an Art Teacher, so Rite Aid is a temporary job. Usually I will be behind the register helping customers, restocking shelves, making sure our customers are finding everything satisfactory, or going around the store to make sure everything is in order. I've learned that patience is very important and that to do my job I must be okay with handling all types of customers. I must be willing to understand everyones situation and help them when necessary. My co-workers are all very hard working and very nice. It is a great working environment for my first job. The management is understanding and they are willing to accommodate to my school schedule which has changed twice during my time there. The hardest part of the job is being the only cashier in the front at times. It is usually just me up front and I will have to call for back up quite a few times through out the day. Sometimes management will get stuck up front with me because of a very long line preventing them from doing other things in the store. The most enjoyable part of my job is creating relationships with customers and making everyone feel welcome."
good,"A normal day of work can vary greatly, but overall I learned many valuable skills while working for Rite Aid. There is a procedure in place for nearly every aspect of the job, and I enjoy that kind of structure in a company."
good,"I have trained Pharmacist and new Techs, there was a grand feeling of team work. Each person treated the other with respect and concern if there would be any situation. We could always depend upon each other. The benefits were great. My boss did not see herself in the roll as my boss but as her partner. She expressed to me on many occasions that I should become a pharmacist. If one person needed the day off of work that person would feel comfortable asking another to cover. District Managers gave me more hours due to 2 of the girls being out for long extended times. Both my Pharmacists refuse to share me with other Pharmacist."
good,"Managers were great, I loved working here but it got boring, not many people come in. The hardest part was unloading totes and restocking, it was tedious."
good,"Typical day at work started with filling prescription refills, and then waited until customers came in to fill their prescriptions. I learned a lot about the pharmaceutical community and how things work behind the scenes. My co-workers were mainly my bosses, and they both treated me as if I were the sons they didn't have so I cannot say enough kind things about them[Chris Lim & Nhung Tran.] The hardest part of the job was leaving to finish up my school work, I really didn't want to leave. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my bosses, they made the experience so enjoyable it really didn't even feel like work."
good,"Good place to work with patients, you gain a lot of experience. A lot of good patients and the work schedule is flexible when its for appointments for kids"
good,I loved working in Rite Aid. It was different then what I was use too. I love the challenged and I loved learning new things. I liked that the customers felt good around me and that they became more then just my customers but my friends. I love waking up and going to work.
good,"A typical day at work would be for me coming early for work, assisting the pharmacist in preparing the cash register for transactions, making sure everything is in order, and turning on all the computers to get the program for processing prescriptions ready. The beginning of the day would be slow, steadily growing into a faster pace of duties. Prescriptions would come in and be typed and printed through the computer. Then medication would be dispensed and labeled via bottle, vial, box, or by other items. Patients would then pick their prescriptions at the cash register and pay for them. During the shift, the phone would also ring and I would assist them if they had any questions, needed me to do something, prescription wise, or needed me to transfer the call to someone more knowledgeable about certain medications. At the end of the day, garbage is thrown away, medication is stocked back properly and in an organized fashion back on the shelves, and every area is checked to maintain a clean working environment for the next day. There are many things to learn as being in the position of a pharmacy technician, an example being patient with your co-workers and your customers to maintain a positive, calm, and smooth work flow and day. Everyone at Rite Aid was friendly and welcoming, whether it was management or my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is seeing a customer not go out of the store happy, or that when their questions were not answered due to frustration from both parties. The most enjoyable part is the opposite of that, it's helping out a customer 100% and seeing them"
good,You're either waiting on customers or asked to perform other tasks in the store even at the same time. Tasks Go as far as unloading truck and putting away store merchandise to setting planograms to simply cleaning and straightening merchandise. Changing out ad signs on a weekly to monthly basis. However there is a great team to work with and it really feels like a family environment.
good,Rite Aid Pharmacy was my second job it was a nice place to work I meat wounderful friends and my two bosses where great strict and respectfull at the same time.The most enjoyable part of this job was the every day was a new experience new coustomers new stories to heard.The hardest and dangerous part of this job was work in night shift with money and  when thiefs try to take free stuff from our store. I loved this place I work here for five years.
good,It was nice to come to work everyday and see the same people that you work with everyday. Since there were only a few employees at the store you got to know your coworkers on a more personal and friendly level making work more enjoyable.
good,"it was a good experience for a high school part time employment , the managers were very helpful, i learn a lot and got work experience. it was basically pocket money for me"
good,"Great place to work for. Great relationship with customers. Employees and management work great together. Fun, fast past place to work"

good,"I enjoyed working for all these company. With Rite Aid I learned  how to count medications and how to process it via telephone. I liked working with every single coworkers. I loved my Supervisor. She had a lot of patience not only with the clients and customer, but also with the employees. She was by the book Supervisor but she had a great heart. Ms. Beechner taught me when to draw the line in being to kind. Whether it was a customer or a client that would mistake my kindness for weakness. I had to learn to recognize when my kindness was taken for granted."
good,"friendly work environment between customers and staff."
good,i came in to work and made sure all exits were still locked and not compromised. following that i start count on the inventory. keeping up to date notes on what was stolen are damaged. checking bags of employees after they clock out of their shift and people as they left the store
good,"very friendly coworkers and management, they are very willing to teach new employees. they greet everyone and work hard to have a relationship with customers"
good,The staff I worked with was some of the best in the area. I learned I could beat any goal set by the company. With hard work along side a team anything was possible. I exceeded goals. Trained the best stores and went home every night feeling rewarded from my accomplishments!
good,"I had a great job here. Management was always great, I loved my work, and had a great time while working there. My favorite part was working the photo department."
good,"Nice place to work, challenging at times, but rewarding. Pay is not the best, but you will learn a lot. Management is very friendly."
good,"at rite aide you went to work it was dark out and you went home it was dark out. but the work was easy to do , the goals were easy to meet."
good,my typical day at rite aid was to be on time count the safe and do the supervisor work. open the store by 9am and be ready for customers. you learned something daily weather how to do plan o grams or how o be better in customer service. mamagemant was always near to land a helping hand. the hardest part was writting soeone up for things they knew was wrong.most enjoyable was the holidays for we could have pot luck or any dish to share with others.
good,"the rite aid distribution center was a great warehouse to work in. the employees would help you if needed and guided you on how you can hit rate without stressing out. easy to get along with the coworkers and the job was fun and easy. the warehouse supplied us with everything, good food, a gym, and the fun toys like pool table and all sorts of other stuff to make it an easy relaxing enviornment."
good,The management that was there at the time. He was the most wonderful man I had ever  came in contact with. I really enjoyed coming into work knowing that he was going to be there I learn so much from him. I enjoy my co-worker as well we all work as a family in this place. The hardest part of this job was closing we could never get out of there on time trying to make sure all of the customer was well satisfied. Once again I must say I learn how to run the front end of a store give the best customer service. By the time I left there I was able to run the store with no supervision. And for that I must thank the management team at rite aid.
good,you have to teach yourself people get mad if you ask to many questions and they give you little short answers it can be very stressful and your coworkers can be very shady and grumpy
good,We all work together as a team to get things done without a problem. Our bosses are close so if we ever had a problem they could be there soon. We all had responsibilities to do every shift so it was our job to get them done.
good,A great way of learning retail pharmacy. The systems and people that I work with make it a great experience.
good,"Handled payroll, schedules, trained new hirers, handled all orders."
good,Riteaid is a great company to work for but i am looking for a closer work place to my home.
good,A day at rite aid is a great time.I only been there for 11 months im told i learn the company quick. We have people there for years and they don't do half the work i do. The drive i have to learn is what makes me out shine some of my co-workers.
good,"Very friendly people to work with and everybody is willing to help out if someone tends to get backed up with customers.  A typical day starts by completing the orders that are in Order Queue and answer calls as they come in throughout the day.  Prioritize patients' request via phone or in person.  Replenish supplies daily, store incoming medications on shelves or use to fill prescriptions that are on backorder.  Rotate inventory and check for outdated medication.   I learned how to use the NexGen Software, ScriptPro dispensing machine, enter a new prescription into database, maintain patient profile, update demographic information and respond to customers questions regarding their prescription.  Greet customers with a friendly smile and use a low tone of voice when ringing them up at the cash registers."
good,Great place to work. Business was steady. Great benefits. The hardest part was adapting to and learning how each pharmacist wanted things.
good,"As a cashier my job responsibilities are to ensure that each guest receives outstanding customer service by providing a friendly environment which includes greeting and acknowledging every guest by maintaining outstanding standards, display solid product knowledge as well as assist in floor moves."
good,"A typical day at work would be me on the register. I loved this job, and the interactions i was able to have with many people. The friendships i have a cured over the years i worked there. I still to this day talk to my co-workers, and some of the customers that would come in regularly. My Managers were awesome, and made work very enjoyable. My co-workers were amazing, and like my family, The hardest part of my job was learning new things when i moved to the pharmacy. And i loved every part of my job."
good,"a typical workday would consist of opening the store, getting deposits ready to go to the bank, helping customers and the employees under me. stocking shelves. Basically whatever needed to be done."
good,"it was a great work area, great people to be around, great work habitis, good boss's, good benfites"
good,"Very relaxing work environment, managers where nice, pay was reasonable, and I was able to get as much overtime as desired."
good,"wonderful place to grow and can become more, great place to achieve some goals"
good,"Rite Aid promotes the culture of forming customer service ties with all customer that shop at the store.  Many customers are primarily pharmacy customers and rarely shop the front end of the store.  Regardless those customers are cultivated by front end associates to listen and assist these customers when needed. "
good,"Rite aide is a fun Place to work because your interact with different people,the management is great anything I needed to learn they where there to show me and the employees are ease to work with"
good,"A typical day for me while working at Rite Aid would consist of my  checking people out at my register, but another main thing I would do is stock the whole front of the store, I also got to help out in the pharmacy which was an amazing learning experience. my management and my coworkers were the best I've had in a job in a very long time. The hardest part of my day would be the try and manage stocking and checking out customers. But the most enjoyable part of my day would be getting to meet the locals of my town."
good,"-Stocking shelf, unloading incoming stock, working at the register, assisting customers,answering phone calls"
good,On a typical day at work I learned how to Handle customer related issues and to assist my managers with whatever was needed throughout the work day. The most enjoyable parts of my jobs was talking with the customers I am a people person & love to meet & talk with anyone.
good,you could get a better position  after so many months on the job. they gave good rises.they didn't put up with nonsense. they made sur you did your job.
good,"Becoming a pharmacy technician is on my bucket list. I find filling a prescription very soothing for some odd reason. From deciphering sloppy doctor handwriting to recognizing Latin acronyms and abbreviations, this position is also extremely important for the development of an entire community. I was a high school student at the time and was not certified to be a pharmacy technician, but I stuck close to the pharmacist who helped me understand how pharmacies worked. I learned more at this job than any other. I learned about drug & allergy, Drug & Drug, and Drug & Food interactions. I learned more about how insurance companies cover prescriptions and why they don't cover certain ones. I've learned how to bill an insurance company electronically, how to write up a script, how to check NDC numbers for generic and name brand drugs...and the best part of my job was always counting by fives! I'm kidding, the best part of my job here was working with down to earth people, learning from those who took the time to teach, and also working in a fast paced environment. By far this was the best job I've held down."
good,"I would clock in everyday and stock the shelves, help out customers, work in the photo lab, clean, and work at the register. I learned how to talk to different people of different back grounds. My co-workers were nice and very helpful. The hardest part of my job was leaving the customers."
good,"A day at work would normally consist of 8 hours on my feet, being left in charge when my store manager was not present.  Worked with money, and customers all day.  Was able to resolve customer question and complaints without ever stressing.  Worked in a retirement development, so I needed to be there a lot more for the elderly in our store.  My co-workers enjoyed my company and hard-working, and I enjoyed there's as I pushed them to their full potentials.  My store manager gave me the opportunities to open and close our store, as well as handling cash deposits, inventory, in and out of store shipments, planograms, and cashier reconciliation.  The hardest part of my job was when customers came into the store with the wrong attitude and would put that towards my coworkers and myself.  Although I always tried my best to resolve there problems to the fullest and brighten there day.  My most enjoyable part of my job was putting smiles on customers or coworkers faces that I would see everyday I stepped into work.  When everyone is happy together, the work becomes more fluid and consistent."
good,"Regular get raises.Great benefits,Great hours,Good management,Breaks,You can pretty much stay to yourself if you don't really care to interact with people."

I also traveles to other stores to help out when the district manager or another store manager needed me .I hope you will give me a opportunity to prove myself im a very hard worker."
good,a typical day at work for me would be coming in at 9am an getting on the computer and pulling the orders setting up for the customers when they would come in stacking them on the shelves  until the customers arrived then ringing them up when they arrived. What I learned was the basic pharmacy rules and laws. My co- workers were nice and enjoyable.The managerment was the same. The hardest part of the job was having less hours but the most enjoyable part of the job was helping the individuals who needed it and to make sure individuals got what they needed when they needed it.
good,I always felt welcome and enjoyed my time working there. I loved my co-workers and we all quickly became friends to the point that we began to hang out outside of the work place. The job was never that demanding so it made me want to come to work. I could easily balance school and work without my performance deteriorating in either.
good,"*A typical day at work consisted of greeting customers upon entry, re-stocking, cashier work, simple maintenance, assisting customers with their shopping experience, answer calls to the store,  make announcements, and closing the store when necessary.

I was a 19 year old shift supervisor and all my co workers were older than me, yet there was hardly ever an issue about age or rank when asking them to complete certain tasks. My manager was great about promoting from inside the company! I was hired in as a cashier and after 2 months, there was an opening for shift supervisor and she offered it to me many times before I finally accepted it. They train you fully, so no need to worry about knowing everything. Also, all the tasks are super easy to learn and catch on to."
good,"I would like the opportunity to return to a retail setting as a PIC or staff Rph. I believe my years in retail, and 19 years as a Board of Pharmacy (per diem) field investigator has been an asset as a trainer with respect to the practice pharmacy and pharmacy law."

good,My district manager was a womanizer but finally left the company after I did. Other than that this job was the best career ladder I’ve ever worked. The store managers were all kind. They all let me have my creative thoughts and train over 125 class room instructed training session on wellness stores. I had the best pharmacy base store where 5 years later we all remain in touch. Good environment but is a numbers game.
good,"My Rite aid was bought out by Walgreens. "
good,My manager was amazing and very understanding. They pay okay for being a cashier and using it as a job while still living with parents but definitely not livable wages on your own. They have a pretty fair discount also. The only thing that would make this place better is if corporate seemed to act like they care about the people working for them.
good,"A typical day at work includes calling a patient's insurance company for eligibility or a prescription override. In addition, I may call a prescriber to resolve prescription questions or inaccuracies, or resolve insurance formulary problems.

The hardest part of the job is acting as the median between insurance companies and their clients when discussing prescription costs and insurance formularies."
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced which I like because I love to stay busy. I've learned more patience which is a plus anywhere you go especially at the workplace. The workplace culture is great because I've worked with different customers and characters as far as us as employees we're like family. There is trust, companionship and respect. For me there is not hardest part of my job. I enjoy my job and the people i work with. I sometimes actually look forward to going to work. Actually, the hardest part of my job is receiving a pay check that wasn't enough to pay my rent. The most enjoyable part is when I help customers and they leave satisfying smiles."
good,I had a great time working for Rite Aid. Management was always helping out and the crew was excellent. Would have loved to have stayed on. Manager and crew were fun to work with. Everyone was always willing to help the other person out if they needed it.

I learned how to fill prescriptions, interacted with customers in the store and on the phone, and learned how to operate the pharmacy NextGen computer system"
good,"Rite Aid is a flexible company that truly understands that life happens.
