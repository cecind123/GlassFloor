rating,review
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Do not know how people work for this company. They made billions and just pay cents to their employees. Their pay rate keep people on poverty level. Do not matter your experience or level of education. In order to have employ discount they basically force you to open a credit account. Horrible employer!
bad,I would never ever ever work here again ! Maybe I’ll never work for Macys again. Management is horrible ! Never organized very confusing. Just a waste of time. I only learned one thing there and I was there for 6 months. Absolutely ridiculous
bad,The director of the fraud department & management made your work environment & experience intensely uncomfortable with their constant intimidating demeanor & actions. Nevermind you were doing over & beyond your job they expected you to kiss up to them & act as if they were doing you a great favor by allowing you to work there.
bad,"management could care less about their employees it's always all about the customer even when the customer is in the wrong, you get in trouble for calling off even if you are having an emergency ."
bad,"typical work day 12 hours "
bad,Have nothing to say at this point the company is not a good company to work for my experience there was very disappointing I was criticized and was not offered any help with the problems I was having
bad,"Worst company in Retail."
bad,"Bad management,  really disorganized dpt stores. Bad paid. NO appreciation  for employees.   Bad benefits.  Any flexibility in schedules I will never recommend anybody work for then."
bad,"Management holds back its employees and consistently berates and disrespects us. They speak to us inappropriately and never resolve issues brought to them. Even if you take the appropriate channels, the company never aids you in resolving issues reported. Managers get away with a lot here. I just feel undervalued. I’ve worked here for 3 years. I work on my off days, pick up shifts, go above and beyond for my clients. It’s ridiculous."
bad,"Blacks with carreer goals are shunned. Meaning if your getting paid a grade 8 in-which is the minimum pay, you are the nicest guy in the both buildings. As soon as you rise to a grade 12 which is the I believe to be the highest pay, As a minority you will experience lies being told about your job performance, but they will not report to a Black supervisor, they would wait to complain to a white manager repeatedly..."
bad,I was over worked and underpaid. They hours were all over the place. Didn’t have a full schedule. Even though I was a full time employee I got part hours
bad,"I worked here for 3 months, I never got hours. They pushed you out on the floor after watching hours of training videos on the computer. To get your discount you had to apply for their credit card or get a prepaid one. If you wanted to shop there on your day off you had to walk down through the parking lot and and get in through the back. I was gonna miss my bus once and they wouldn’t let me get off the back elevator . I had to go down and then walk back up. if you walked in through the front doors you could be fired."
bad,poca paga y muy cansado ambiente de trabajo mediocre y los manager son pesimos
bad,"I work at the “At your service” counter and honestly the pay that you get here is not worth it. You’re constantly working with complaints, attitude, and disrespectful customers it gets tiring and mentally draining. Macy’s definitely needs to offer the people who work at this department more money. Cause we are literally the head of this store and we deal with everyone else’s mess to be getting paid minimum wage."
bad,Was treated so badly because I was  former Kaufmanns management that I could do nothing right.  Manager was hateful and offered no encouragement.  Worst job experience of my life. Job tasks impossible to complete.
bad,"Had many supervisors that would tell one employee one thing and tell another employee the opposite.  Has a dress code, but never enforced. Other employees are very selfish and would make others work harder just for them to have a good day."
bad,I didn’t know expanding your education was such a bad thing! I was encouraged to go back to my studies and when I did my college was an issue for the company!
bad,I did not have a great time working at Macys I'm very happy I left they had a very strange system and didn't care about their employees retail was definitely not my thing that's why I left.
bad,"Barely any hours , pay is horrible nothing is welcoming about it, very busy no pto no over time just a strict come in do as i say for 8 bucks need to pay more for work required,"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"MCCS in Mason is a sad place.  Do yourself a huge favor and stay away from this company. There are many incompetent managers who have ZERO people skills. You are lied to about hours, job duties, policies, and pay. Systems are unstable and crash or malfunction multiple times daily. For a company that relies on technology---the internet, the ordering platform---they have incompetent, uncaring people in charge. We can't figure out how to have a chat window pop up as an invitation to chat, then when the customer declines, have it minimize and hang out in the lower right hand corner of the screen like every other company.  NO, we have it continually pop up in customer's faces so that they get annoyed and shop elsewhere.  No manager is there to assist you with problems, no escalation lead will deal with angry customers, few managers work the weekends, though they are required in almost every department. Training and resources are a joke!  It's fend for yourself with no life preserver. Our job descriptions (and all the jobs posted this year) say ""4 out of 8 weekend days.""  Don't believe it. You will be scheduled for 3 or 4 weekends in a row, and if you have plans, family obligations, other jobs already and call off, you will lose an attendance credit AND be made to make up the weekend day. Everyone in every department has been made to work the phones--even if that was not in out original job duties-- and do store support, which means you are talking to ANGRY people who think they are calling the stores. The store employees are not required to answer the phones, number 1, and IF you"
bad,"No training, managers have no problem lying to your face I was lied to from the start at the interview . I was promised a permanent position with set hours in the end ended up with neither. Mangers just push you to the side no help ever"
bad,"My time working there was miserable,  most of the managers dont know how to speak to the associates. I will NEVER, EVER shop there AGAIN. I couldn't even shop on my lunch break!evenshop o"
bad,I feel as if we were under paid and under appreciated for the long hours and the work we did. They should offer more pay to employees and help them when they need a more flexible schedule.
bad,"There are multiple good reasons people would rather swallow a denim jacket and pants than shop in Macy’s. The stores are underperforming, antique and absolutely disgusting. I’m glad I’m free! Worst job experience I’ve ever had."
bad,They even cheated me out of hours and never paid me for them.They treated me very unfairly no one really wanted to be bothered with me so most days I just wondered around the store for hours
bad,the management for dept i worked in sucked the total experienc e sucked people were mean the department management refused to hirer me back and i dont know why
bad,unprofessional managers treated poorly. was not a happy employee. was fired with no valid explanation. general floor manager did not like me treated me unfairly
bad,"People are disgusting at Macy's. Macy's is the dirtiest place I've ever worked at and the worst co workers and managers. Pay is ridiculous, you can work at McDonald's for more money. I think you could work just about anywhere for more money and nicer people to be around."
bad,"No management came to look over the employees and you had to work for 10-12 hours without any breaks and no lunch, can’t leave the your spot other then going home at the end of your shift."
bad,"Working at Macy's sounds awesome but in honesty it really depends on the location. The one I worked at was located in Bayfair Shopping center ( San Leandro CA ). The managers suck at their jobs, all they really do is walk around and chitchatting, taking long breaks, never to be seen when you really need them. I had a horrible experience with the managers there. No support system at all."
bad,They are racist they do not appreciate their workers of color and they only promote white people I can’t stress enough how much work I do just to get treated unfairly and improperly
bad,"They exploit labour by systemic AI points. Terrible place to work at especially for part time positions. No benefits, except for the twenty percent discount which you get after you apply for the macys store credit card otherwise you wont be eligible. It absolutely is terrible."
bad,"Terrible management. No leadership. No support. Upper level management will treat you like trash. If you are beneath them you are considered invaluable. Little to no growth opportunities. Terrible work culture. My manager has said some very inappropriate things about everything and everyone. She has also been discriminatory against me, not sure if it’s because of my race but wouldn’t be suprised if it was. Oh forgot to mention Human Resources is a complete joke. Good luck if you come across a real problem at work and need to speak with HR. It literally doesn’t exist. Girls are throwing up in bathrooms due to extreme cases of anxiety. The atmosphere is so depressing and toxic. Overworked, underpaid. Worse job I’ve ever had in my life. Work somewhere else."
bad,Management are snake's and dont appreciate good work. Only people who are willing to kissup and play ball with the schemes management conjours. Sincerely enjoyed Macy's but management sucked
bad,"worked downtown RATs everywhere one day the rat was in the bread box at the restaurant in the sky bridge - the mama rat ran out when someone opened the box she started screaming - all the dinners started screaming - so her 10 little rat babies came running out of the bottom of the bread trolly all screaming, you never heard a shrill like a rat family in panic all screaming, we felt sorrier for the rats than the people it was horrifying. People started a chain vomit situation - the paramedics came."
bad,"This place is a retail nightmare. Very low pay, 8 hours of video training only, never learned about security or cafeteria or employee entrance.  Very understaffed, only 1 security person from 9:00pm - midnight.  If he takes a break, no security!   Security alarm rang for days, no one seemed to care.  They left me alone in fragrances when everyone went to lunch, I only had video training and some “shadowing” and was NOT qualified to be alone.  Never learned how to transfer a phone call, so I hung up on people.  There is no corporate support, they keep cutting costs instead of improving customer experience.  "
bad,"Working at Macy's helped me because it showed me what kind of place i should not be working at. My coworkers were nice but that was not enough to continue working there, I did not feel like I had management support. I started to have body pains from carrying all those clothes. And the pay was terrible was not getting paid for the amount of work I had to do."
bad,"This Macy's Columbia location's Human Resource and Store Manager seems to have bad attitude toward some of their employees. They treat you like you are not a person. They have no idea what is going on in the store. They never help new employees when they need help. This place is  a very unhealthy place to work. I worked for couple weeks and I had to quit. I was all alone without supervision or direction at all. They are always understaffed. It overwhelm the few employees who have angry customers. I rarely get break. If you don't treat your employees right, it will lead to a bad business. Some employees overworked but no one from HR cares. Every single time when I needed help, HR or some managers never helped me. They should be ashamed of themselves."
bad,Don’t waste your time. The compensation sucks and there is NO employee discount. The schedules are not flexible and are computer generated. This is by far the worst part time job to have. Run and run fast from Macy’s!
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"If you thinking about working at Macy's, asks about the high turn over. How do they feel about diversity, equal pay and fairness. Everything you asked, make sure you check the information you received."
bad,"Don’t work here it’s boring and old fashioned and so so 80s."
bad,I worked at macys seasonally. They insulted me and verbally abused me until I had a nervous breakdown and had to quit. They refused to give me my  w2 form. I had to call the head quarters in new York to obtain my w2 form and  pay $20 . I worked extremely and the manager would not give a good recommendation to obtain a better job. I had a college degree and they treat people like trash
bad,They work u like a dogg and not care about u. U do t even have a training session. The management team sucks. The store owner u never see. The upline is super terrible
bad,The managers always accepts return of merchandise even if the dress/shirts were worn and smelly. What's worst is  putting it back to the floor for sale regardless of it's obvious bad condition.
bad,"No work life balance. Employees are expected to slog like dogs and there is no appreciation. There is favoritism and underlying diversity bias. There is no job security, or growth possibility for most."
bad,I could not stand there! Management was lousy and abuse their authority. They would intimidate employees if they did not meet their sales goal and royalty goals weekly. Be general managers that where over this location at the time I was working there or hot mess. They did not care about the customers nor the employees just meeting their status and numbers. They were  sneaky with firing people that are beneficial to the workplace because they do not like them. How childish is that do not waste your time at this place
bad,"Company couldn’t care less about employees. They just push you to hit sales goals. Poor pay and no benefits. Managers favor certain people;thus, manipulating the schedules. Management is not connected to reality/employees."
bad,I only had Horrible experience working for them.They very unfair how they treat their employees. Management plays favoritism to when comes who and how they take action Against their employees. Overall is not good company to work for.
bad,"This store was very hard to work in the diversity in the workers was mainly black and I was white and the other employees treated me different for the color of my skin which should not matter, but here it did, other employees will steal your sales while your trying to match or make sales goals. I have worked for other Macys stores in other states and the stuff I witnessed while working in this store most employees would of been fired on the spit. Management is aware of issues but ignores the issues. The store has a high turn over. There was always confusion on the floor customers were mainly black and treated me different cause u was white. This kind of business is old school and only happens apparently in the good old South. Personally if you need a retail job go to a store that does not treat you like the minority and their plenty of other stores to work at."
bad,Not enough hours. You do the work of 3 people with out any support of management. Sometimes you get taken advantage of if you don't know your rights. Not enough staff to take breaks and lunches.
bad,"Doing multiple things hard work like housekeeping and get pay less."
bad,"The best part of the job is the people that you meet along the way. Most of them are in the same boat you are, and it is always good to have someone to empathize with."
bad,"Your pay is poor, "
bad,"You are just a Number, they don't care about the employees. to them you are just a money making machine. you only get a 30 minutes brake, it sucks....."
bad,You better be fast doing your job or they will find any reason to let you go .you should probably learn to kiss culo there are snitches backstabbers all over the place .
bad,"Horrible Place to Work!! Management doesn't care about anybody but themselves. They only pay at the bottom of the pay scale for the jobs even with years of experience, and then give you pennies for raises."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Backstabbing at best...LIARS..No support from my peers.  Unrealistic goals.  Poor morale in this store.  Poor upper management who think they can berate and demean you.  STAY AWAY
bad,This company is more focused on its profits and has lost sight of its employees. Everyone is just a number not a person. They have lost sight of what each individual store needs.
bad,"I worked for Macy's for almost a year. It was the worst experience ever. They show favoritism, they have you work in almost every department, but want give you a raise for what you can do. If you make a complaint with HR they want do anything about it, because they are all friends SMH. I am talking about the Macy's warehouse in stone mountain ga. They're a MF joke. I applied for unemployment, and they denied me saying it was my fault"
bad,"I rate Macy’s a 1 overall at the Springfield Mall location in Springfield, PA. The environment is not friendly, not inclusive, there is no room for advancement the managers will harass and make other employees uncomfortable."
bad,"Do yourself a favor and don’t work for this sweatshop they call a friendly company. I worked here for not even a full day but was treated like dirt right off the bat. Here’s how my first day went: I was supposed to be a packer but got sent right to “patrolling” instead. It was like a bad dream I couldn’t wake up from. We have scanner machines that we put on our wrist for all the packages that come in called “gladiators.” Mine had been malfunctioning the whole day so I had to keep asking questions about how I can fix it. My trainer got very annoyed at my questions, basically saying because he went over it once, I should just know. It wasn’t my fault for this technical difficulty.. yet: Turns out my gladiator stopped working completely. Whatever it scanned did not go into the packing system. I had no idea. it was my first day and was still learning. The trainer got even angrier and made me and my partner literally retrieve every single one of the packages that didn’t go through by the tiny numbers in the barcode. It was nearly impossible we were both new and spent hours pacing back and forth looking for packages with no luck. The trainer actually ended up doing the work because he was the only one that really knew what to do. He was unable to teach us! There were no extra gladiators yet the trainer still snapped at me to do my job with the thing. I was having an anxiety attack over it all, and knew for a fact I wasn’t cut out for this kind of work. Another problem I have is the utterly disgusting working environment. There is a thick layer of dirt and grease on everything you"
bad,"After being in the industry all my life, I was excited to start at Macys, but soon realized everything was a facade. People spied on you, talked behind your back, and there was no trust level. Management was concerned solely about themselves and had no real concern for anyone else."
bad,I worked here while in college and in between jobs. First you are the “on call slave” your be lucky to get 10 hours a week and when your there they will expect you to be their slave for chump change. If your not in management your be treated as if your existence is not very important. Your be expected to dress well.
bad,company aint worth anything  nothin but back stebbers could never reach my full potential because of people always attacking my great work ethic especially in pack and icqa
bad,"The woman that was the VP of Furniture division was clearly gunning for me. She worked hard to get me fired, using every opportunity to criticize my work and my relationships with co-workers. Never understood if it was my race or age that caused her to dislike me so much. "
bad,They hired me and never used me after I did my training. They put me in the back to do stock when I was hired to work on the floor. I felt like they hired me just to say they did and when they seen me because I was big girl and didn't where make up and have great hair was put in the back.
bad,"Don’t do it no one stays we’re constantly understated it just sucks and for what that want you to do it isn’t worth the money, there’s never enough hrs being flex one week I could have 15 hrs next we  39 it’s not consistent at all"
bad,If you like being talked down to by mangers who feel like that they can talk to you anyway they want they will not doing thing about a person who bring fentanyl in and trys to sell it to co workers overall no respect for work ethic or people
bad,Lack of communication from the management. Over the course of my time there I have seen them eliminate positions and people lose their jobs because of these job eliminations. Most of the jobs are now being outsourced and it is creating a great amount of frustration for customers because of the language barriers.
bad,"I specifically worked for Macy’s in Chandler AZ. The management team was awful, incredibly nasty, and constantly yell at you for discussing your pay, even though it is illegal for employers to ask for that. My coworkers found out we got pay cuts even though we were told multiple times that we were “top sellers”. Then when they hired new people, those people were hired at $12 an hour and we were told raises are not an option in our department."
bad,"The customers are good. But the employees have a work enviroment where everyone is just waiting for you to mess up. You have also managers who get terrified if you do work similar to them. And on top of that the union has a bad representation of te workers. You ask for help with work related problems and they ""beat arround the bush"".in adition they charge you a fee to do nothing for you"
bad,"The pay is so low, and it used to be even lower. I don’t know anyone that likes working there. I don’t even like the things they sell. They are so out of fashion, expensive, and poor quality."
bad,I disliked the managers there because they only care if you are selling at an extremely high level and its very hard to make a living off 9.00 an hour.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I started at Macy's super excited to work there. But as time went on I started to dislike the job more than any job I had ever had. As a new employee I was thrown into multiple tasks that I was not ready for. Almost every customer ring up there was some new issue or coupon or deal or something new every time, and I was by myself and expected to figure this out while at the same time keeping up on clearing out dressing rooms, etc. At one point the manager came to me saying I needed to sell more star rewards cards within my first week. "
bad,The management treats you horribly. The paid is less than mediocre and they expect you to give up your life for them. They don’t abide by the policies and anytime you try to enforce them with customers they come and make you look stupid by undermining what you have said. Overall not worth your time. It was so mentally and emotionally draining. There is so much favoritism you don’t even feel comfortable bringing anything up to management if it’s involving someone they favor.
bad,"Why would I go to work at Macy  ????"
bad,"Not a good place to work! The supervisors are all about making sales. Not good co-workers, people too compatitive.They have you work by your self, with no help!"
bad,Macy’s has been one of the worst places I’ve worked at.  They expect so much from associates they want you to at least open 2 new credit card accounts per day and so much more. I wouldn’t mind opening credit accounts but to be paid so little is ridiculous. Not only is the pay low but for your first 6 months of work they don’t pay you extra or anything at all for any holidays you work but most definitely expect you to be there
bad,Don’t recommend working at Macy’s in Grand Rapids. The cosmetic manager should not be in the position she is. Absolutely no management or people skills.
bad,The supervisors were so mean plus they take advantage of you because you are flex temporary and they give you too much work then they control your hours per week for example you can’t work over 8 hours per week
bad,"Was hired for the “security guard” position, which is not really security. Mainly you just stand at the door as a greeter and wear a red jacket. The store manager will from time to time ask you to help fold clothes and count sensors. If you want a real security job go get a Maryland security guard license and do actual security work, if that’s what you’re looking for. If you want to be a door greeter then you’ll like it there. Time can move especially slow while you’re just standing in one place all day. Occasionally, they’ll ask you to stay late. Management is some what compensating, the other employees that work there are relatively nice. The loss prevention position is a little better, you get to watch cameras and do internal investigations."
bad,"I would not recommend Macy’s as a good place of employment unless you are a high school student. The pay is not enough to survive off of, you barely get enough hours and management is very inconsistent. You are more watched by security than the customers are. You are treated horrible and lower than scum. They work you to the bone with so much work load and you are consistently on your feet for hours. I will never go back to retail."
bad,"Management is a poor, never willing to help associates and always no where to be found. I enjoyed working with my employees, management lack leadership skills"
bad,At first when you start everything is very confusing nobody knows where to put you and your given go back to put away immediately because nobody else wants to do them then I put you on a cash register was no training you just have to watch the person next to you there is a review but the training is ridiculous and many years behind also in the fragrance department the older women there will take product out of your hand and bring up the merchandise for the customers you're helping under their numbers so they can get a bonus and you don't get anything if you have any problems you go directly to your manager and your honest with her the next thing you know you're being blamed for everything which is ridiculous and their store is extremely messy to close a load of floor it's an embarrassment to Macy's and the problem is nobody wants to clean up the mess I just leave it all over the floor and they need to hire specific people to pick up that message disgusting the new the new
bad,"The same people you see working at Walmart are the same type of people working at Macy’s. Toxic environment, run by minorities. Power trips run amok! Low pay and not enough hours!"
bad,It was made very clear by the night management from the start of this job that I was not a candidate to remain past the holiday season. I was not included in in directives for the day's goals and pressured to cut corners.
bad,"Management has favoritism "
bad,If your looking for a good job thats not complicated then this is the job for you. Its a really easy job but being in dress shoes all day and night can be really tiring on your feet
bad,They don't give you hours because business is very slow. you asked them for more hours and don't give it to you. management force you to do multi performance job and don't receive the gratitude
bad,Not organized and not worth the pay. Managers were never there to assist and help associates. It was a lot of hours being cut and unkept promises. I did not like the job.
bad,"This place will rob you of your joy and soul. Management is a joke. Many kind souls work here that will make it bearable, but that's the only perk. The building is falling apart and corporate won't pay to fix it. The pay is abysmal ."
bad,"All the big wigs on top of Macy’s care about are numbers not the associates and what we deal with. Upper management do sneaky underhanded things to get people fired or pull away a job advancement from you, they try to get people fired deliberately. Store manager has made women cry. There’s a verbal abuse culture, where anyone higher than a sales associate or manager sometimes scream and yell at you or talk to you as if you’re stupid. Pay is trash for what you deal with."
bad,"It wasn't the best experience for me, it might be different for others. There weren't enough people working there, so most of the time two registers would be assigned to one person"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Management promises you commission and you get nothing even when it is owed to you. Manager is a Micro-Manager and peers around corners and pops up like a Ninja to make you feel incompetent. You never get the hours you talked about during the interview.
bad,Hated working here. Managers were trash and didn’t care for anyone’s well being! The only thing I did like were my former colleagues. They made the day go by fast and some of the customers were nice. I wouldn’t recommend working here!
bad,"In the particular store I worked in, I felt like it was difficult to report issues with the management."
bad,"Same as above, just very bad environment in every way you can think of or possible. ALL FAKE, not what you think at all. Will not treat you fairly or especially help you grow or move forward. Filled with bunch of cranky old housewives that have nothing better to do but just spend their time calling it “working” and going back home for the most part."
bad,"I was a sales associate for one year and eight months. I had a regular 20 - 28 hours work week and was a student. I was quite reliable and productive for them. There was an ""attendance"" points-system in place. That system wasn't reliable with frequent technical errors affecting attendance times, and they recently removed it and restructured organization and management - this a for profit organization, and it is not for your profit. The attendance system is currently regulated as a ""percentage"" out of your locked set of hours, and you continue to be the one who picks the hours. Make no mistake, it is NOT as flexible as it appears. The HR still controls releases of shifts, which you can see as available and pick-set for weekly schedules in the system. Other employees may release and swap their shifts with you, however, HR ALSO controls it. Now, they do BAIT and SWITCH JOB ADVERTISEMENT. They will give you nothing in writing, except an email announcing a ""phone interview"" at a ""soon"" time. They will completely ignore your job application and offer you the lowest job and pay. They will try you very low with shifts, hours, volume and pay completely other and way lower than your application. Have you an idea why? No need, run!"
bad,"Wage is low, no proper training, one minute they want to act like bosses next minute they do not care, don’t trust employees they will get you fired, they do not give a steady schedule."
bad,They fired me because grown people didn’t want to do there job. I got in trouble because people didn’t want me to tell them what needed to be done they wanted to do they own thing.
bad,"I absolutely hated it overall!! Too much responsibility and not enough help... I was the Visual Security Officer (VSO) and would be the one to call out suspicious people or potential theft or fraudulent activity via two way radio headset to the detective team who would get on camera and start working the case.... a lot of the time they had me personally putting myself at risk by having me be in the immeadiate area of the subjects and watching them. Wearing a bright red jacket that said Macy’s security made me a little obvious!!! Or they would have go to a door subjects would be heading to and I would be by myself with 2 or 3 subjects already agitated and possibly armed with some type of weapons!!! When apprehensions would be made , many times subjects would want to resist be arrested and try to struggle/ fight to get away.... some the detectives would struggle with gaining control of their hands and I would have to intervene and help bring them under control/ get their hands under control to be able to handcuff them!!"
bad,"Terrible experience working at Macy’s ...to many Negative people and they loved to talk Negative about  other employees!  If you weren’t in the Click....forget it , you definitely had to  or you weren’t liked ....too many Chiefs and not enough Indiana !!!!"
bad,"I did enjoy the people I worked with and the many people I helped but was picked on and expected to do absolutely everything whilst many times working on my own. With unrealistic sales goals and expectations"
bad,"They do not provide a great work environment, stressful, no time off, no advancement, cutting hours, not flexible with your own schedule, job loss. They hire people at minimum wage and no raises will come until you work hard. Not 1 person had a raise after 4 years of working there. Hire people with no experience. Management is never there when there are problems and no one to turn to. No holiday pay is provided (people in certain job categories are not eligible for holiday pay, so if you work the holiday, you do not get paid, just a straight hours whatever you worked). People have left this store at least 10 people at a time and never return. skeleton crew with no one available on most days. You are overworked on the holiday months with at least 12 hours and 20 days in a row worked with no break. Lunches and breaks are sometimes not taken. They have broken a lot of rules when it comes to breaks, lunches and days in between off. I believe they will close this store or are driving it into the ground due to cutting hours and less staff. Employees have worked hard to the point of passing out on the floor (I've seen it happen). Air or heaters in the store depending on summer or winter months are controlled by corporate, which in the summer, when it's warm, they don't get turned on until after 8 am. So if you come in early like 5 am you will sweat to death."
bad,Don’t work for Macy’s greenbriar horrible staff very ghetto and trashy no type of class not even from the store manager it’s like slavery and they show no appreciation for their employees
bad,"Macys is absolutley the worst company I have ever worked for. I worked the holiday seaon of 2018 and it was a nightmare. The department I worked in did not give you an option to work part-time, meaning you had to work the 50hr+ weeks from 5pm till 330am, unless they made you stay later. Pay was promised to be around 13.50$ since we were supposed to be given an extra dollar an hour since it was overnights. Yet my pay, and many other coworkers usually ended up being around 11.25$ an hour. I had a case with sexual assualt with an upper manager and it was never taken seriously, that manager is still working there while I was let go and fired."
bad,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at the Westminster Macy's, Management at the Victoria Garden Macy appeared bias. I requested a changed to a different department after I felt I was not as fast as others in the department and did not desire to bring the overall rating of the department down. My request was not acknowledge, I received punitive treatment for my request. "
bad,"I am not sure about the store fronts, but the warehouse is a horrible work environment, some of the supervisors are cool, the last one I had was horrid, always had an attitude, and even threatened to dock my hours (even tho she couldnt) if I wasnt at the back of the warehouse at 6am (even tho we were not supposed to clock in until 6am) thankfully did not deal with her much, upper management is just bad, I was told during the interview process that they work with college/school schedules, which is why I took the job, and once my classes started I brought in the papers showing I was enrolled and the hours I would be in class to the HR department, and they passed it along to upper management who then denied my request, and was then told they do not modify work schedule for anyone, the pay when I was there was horrible for the work conditions, probably one of the worst places I have worked."
bad,"Very unsafe environment and felt as if there was no peer support. Loss prevention was always dealing with hard criminals that would fight back."
bad,"I worked in support, which is not commissioned.  My job was a 2 person job.  I was the only one that did my job.  I was also the only person in the entire comoany who had my title.  I worked 4hrs a day except on truck days i worked 8.  I did everything in the department except order products.  I would have workers take credit for my work, take long breaks, and i never got appreciated."
bad,Not a nickel an hour raise in 1 1/2 years despite being #1 producer in my department. Zero advancements. Management doesn't listen. Commission employees refuse to do anything but sell. Will let the entire department become a mess while waiting for customers. 80% of the female staff only work there for discounts. Their time is short.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Only gave 1star because No stars was not an option. Warning. Run do not Walk away from this sad source as Fast as you Can. Not owned by the Macy's family anymore. Saying they are Crooks and do not care about anything but the almighty dollar is just the beggining........
bad,"No sense of management, and when management does want to "" take charge"" their request are completely out of line of what is needed to assist the customer"
bad,"The majority of the Sales Associates  that is approx. 99% who passed training in the training room came unto the floor to work the register and did not know where to even begin/ start. They were not even able to do the simplest of the transactions. They told me they passed the training and did it well because they had the  training book in front of them. They were pulling the Recovery associates to the register ans demanding the Recovery Associates to do their job. The majority of the customers were also pulling the Recovery Associates to the register and demanding that the Recovery Associate ring up their merchandise. They were allowed to continue to work on the register while receiving one on one training on a real register.by a manager. The store manager and or HR. Managers did not report to the corporate management that the training to learn the register in the training room did not work the majority of the time.I wanted to learn the register but I did not pass the training in the training room. I was not able to learn that way. I learned  a little bit on the real register"
bad,"Horrible, too much work & stressful!! Definitely not enough pay for the work, management was horrible!! Too many chiefs & not enough Indians! Ruuunnn, hiring process is too easy that should have told me something!"
bad,Its always something happening people not following rules some works just walk around avoiding work nobody says anything. The work load is unfairly distributed.
bad,"Great place and fun loving and looks after employees well  They are great people as employers and I have nothing more to add"
bad,"Don’t bother with this company."
bad,Not worth your time or energy unless you enjoy being treated like you're less than dirt. Management is a joke and cant even do their jobs correctly pay sucks too.
bad,The Macon Store is ran by one person who doesn't like taking request from male figures. Two managers are feuding and the workplace is very stressful. A particular manager will watch your every move and micromanage everything you do and will keep a journal of it. This manager has control issues especially from men. The Receiving Team Lead position is the most stressful position there. At first it's all cool and then BOOM. You will be place in the middle of chaos between the two managers that can't get on the same accord when it comes to working together. You do not have any reliable coworkers most of them have been there a long time and take the short cuts of doing their duties. There is only one person probably capable of doing this position at this store and it is because she's a female and has worked with the nagging manager. I feel sorry for this location because it will never grow back to it's original potential. This location is going down hill. Good Luck.
bad,The last store manager hide out in the housewares department because that was the only place in the store he felt comfortable ...he was promoted and moved to another city.  Store was a mess and he hide racks of go backs when we had store visits from the boys.
bad,"Don’t waste your time! Management is a joke but most of all the manager on the third floor. She has perfected poor management, does t care at all about her employees just poor management all around! Sad because the employees are great she doesn’t care to see it at all! I wasn’t even there for 3 months and knew I needed to leave. Feel so sorry for those who are still there dealing with that sorry manager"
bad,"This was a different experience for me. I have always enjoyed my work and the people around me. Macy’s was like working in Hollywood, a lot of fakeness. Would not suggest working for them unless your in high school, hence that is the daily atmosphere."
bad,"You are under paid and unappreciated. The store manager has a morning meeting every day with the entire staff and she dances and acts jolly and offers her assistance if needed throughout the day, but as soon as the meeting is over she turns into Dr. Jeckle. If you ask her anything she has a horrible attitude and insults you. The rest of management is pretty much the same. They are no where to be found. They all leave to go to lunch together leaving the store unattended. Pay sucks!!! The two days you are supposed to get off every week if you’re lucky enough to get them can never be together. It is always broken up. At the end of the day DO NOT APPLY FOR A JOB AT THIS COMPANY. You will need a second job because you are under paid and the work load is outrageous!!!"
bad,"This is by far the worst job anyone could have. Clueless managers, below poor wage and unrealistic work hours. What a joke!! This place needs to burn down to the ground."
bad,They are the worst they treat you like your below people they don't even pay u the right amount of money and I'm gonna sue them for everything they own
bad,The Macy's in Yonkers New York was the worse job I ever had. I was working overnight when I started and the manager overnight treated everyone like dirt. When I got transferred to the women's shoe department.they barely gave me hrs. At one point they scheduled someone for like 20mins or a half an hr. One of my paychecks I never received. Just a horrible experience.
bad,Let me just say management gives hours to workers whom they like. If your not liked you will receive no hours and pretty much when you are there working your doing everyone else’s job. Macy’s in queens is a unfair place to work at. I don’t recommend it to anyone!!!!!
bad,this is a place i would consider as a part time occupation for retired people or individuals who are only looking for extra cash. This is not a job where you can make a career
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I was put on a hold while working there because I was terminated in place of an employee who quit because we had the same name.  Management was bad at relaying information.
bad,"I applied for the job as a sales associate at Macy's online and was given a time online to show up for the interview a few days later and confirm the appointment time, which I did clearly state I would be there.  I did show up in time at the Human Resources Office and there was no one there!  There were a couple of girls working in the Office and I was completely ignored for about 10-15 minutes until I asked one of them who was going to interview me. They told me I did arrive at the correct place, however, they had nothing on record of my appointment. I asked them if they would kindly inquire for me because I did take time out of my busy day to be there and to be on time.  They acted like I was a bother but she did check for me.  I waited 30 minutes before one of the department managers showed up.  I was asked ""when can you start"" by this manager and that was the only question.  She said they would call me in a few days and she told me she had to go back to work!  This was the worst interview I ever had in the 35 years I have worked and it left a sour impression."
bad,"Management was really bad, there was a lot of favoritism. Managers would sit there and talk about there workers with workers. Taken advantage of, while that layer back and chatted."
bad,The 2.5 years I've worked at Macy only shows how selfish and convoluted they are. At first i was excited because this would be my first real job. (I've done plenty of paid internships in the past) in short story I've been working with Macy for a pretty long time and i don't feel needed because the pay for the work i do does not reflect the amount effort i put forth for them.
bad,Expect to more and more and to get paid less and less. Don't show any initiative or do anything to question the status quo. Just be the little corporate robot they hired you to be. Expect to get fired at any time for anything. Very stress filled workplace culture.
bad,The staff and manaagement were way too cliquiy. I felt like I was in high school. They wanted an 8 hour shift done in four hours. And they wanted you to dress like you were on the sales floor when you weren't.
bad,Management is horrible. Coworkers are mean and very messy. The store manager pays the favoritism card. Does not pay fairly. Not the best retail job. Does not work around other schedules
bad,Fast pace sale fragrance both men and women. My manager was fair and organize with a positive attitude. the work place multicultural. Having to work with respectful co-workers in a good environment.
bad,I was told that I will never get a raise anymore with no explanation and they didn't care if I leave. All my goals there exceeds all expectation. Management there is very unprofessional with no accountability. People make more than me and still got raises and do way less. Jealousy and hate is so apparent. Managers talk down to you. HR refuses to do anything. I feel ashamed working there. Look forward to move on. I know I will not shop there anymore.
bad,"horrible management can’t keep staff employees quit every day not enough help or staff to accomplish goals and daily tasks or to assist customers, no clear direction and no help i had 4 days of training for a manager position and hat is no where near enough training. They also expect you to plan events once a month and know all these different financial reports, coaching bad behaviors is ok but they have older people who are NOT able to complete they job duties and they been working there for 20 plus years. No team work , they have fitting room issues 40 rods of clothes from the fitting rooms, they need to have someone stationed at the actual fitting room co trolling the amount of items going into it. They need a fitting room team 5 days a week not 2. Poor leadership i am very disappointed how i was treated and how they expected so much from me being brand new to the company."
bad,"The company is just about sales and making the stock holder rich! They don’t care for the sales associates. They company pays very low, after union dues, taxes and medical some associates are making less than $200 a week, these are people who work anywhere from 32-40 hours a week! Who can live in SF on a $800 a month?!"
bad,They don't gove you mich training they only gave two days of training for so much stuff to do in that warehouse need more of training to know everything you have to deal with there
bad,"Worst place in the world! They were focused on associates getting credit card apps, horrible pay, customer is always right even when they’re blatantly wrong."
bad,They have policies that change time to time along with a scorecard  if you work in furniture sales you have to meet dollars per call and that changes as well  if you don’t pass your scorecard  3 times  you can say goodbye even if you sell a million dollars  you will get fired !!
bad,The only good thing about this place is 3 days off.There’s management are very lazy they gave all there work to the Supervisor’s so they can take an hour 1/2 for lunch. Sit there office talk on there cellphone a who ever they talk to.Would not recommend MACY’S fulfillment center to anyone.
bad,Management there sucks.. Store doesn't have large selection for customers. You can't find help. Some managers walked and talked never getting supplies that we needed at the registers.
bad,"Its an Ok start up job, specially for young people who are still in school and they want to make some bucks, who don't mind the late hours and weekends."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Turn over is high for the competent employees.  The HR Administration department doesn't fire anyone that are stagnant and fail to perform and allows them to be dead weight to the department.  "
bad,You are horribly underpaid and made to feel bad for wanting more money. Makes it hard to be positive. If you work there you won't be able to afford your bills
bad,"macys is your basic over work, under paid situation with micromanagagment. if that's what you're looking for, have at it. i'd never work there or anywhere similar."
bad,Over worked and underpaid very rude co works mangers picking favorites.This was a stressful job a lot of times you will do others work. They customers treat the store like trash throwing and walking all over the clothes.The management and Mangers don’t appreciate hard workers that why the store constantly need help work come and go .My suggestions stay away not worth the headache.
bad,"The sales associates quit because there is no incentives other than employee discounts for them. You are like a slave once it gets busy because the work environment can be hostile and one person will work multiple departments and like a Hebrew slave. No breaks are in any continuity. You can literally fall out and the management wont have anyone to help you because of extremely high turnover rate for employees. Most associates quit after their initiation of rush- Rush general public and customers take advantage of the lean sales personnel with horrific thefts and endless stealing and even store security have too much work and no help, thieves know this and they take advantage of these opportunities and disorganization of upper management and lack of concern for employee's quality of employment."
bad,This is by far the worst job I have ever had in my 20years of working.the way the workers are treated to the rude customers. It's so unpleasant and unprofessional
bad,"Would never recommend "
bad,Not that bad of a place to work at very strict on time management always have to stay on your toes all the time wearing comfortable shoes will be doing a lot of walking
bad,The management was awful they work you to the bone. And they will not let you sit even for a secon then you get written up. Never again ! And I was put in time-out for 30 mins and then thrown into a closest and yelled at and now i have ptsd.
bad,Kitchen is always a war zone. Due to high turn around during holiday season management doesn't show much interest in getting to know you.I worked for Macy's for 2 months and they were a waste of my time. I was only getting 1 day a week. My manager at the time lacked communication skills and I eventually was let go because of it. I ended up getting another job because of the lack of hours and days and not knowing when I was scheduled to work.
bad,It is a job that they promised you the world but never deliver the draw against commissions does not work you always end up owing them money they make you do all kinds of extra tasks and come in an hour early to do fafilmemt for $900 am hour not worth the time or the effort
bad,Wasn’t very good pay at all. Job sucks not worth the pay. Before applying make sure it’s full time or you won’t get any hours & I work full time. Too much work not enough pay.
bad,Macy's is one of the lowest paid companies out there they treat their employees really bad or work force you to work every weekend can I request any days off but I being penalized Walmart Target wallpapers in Macy's I would not recommend Macy's to nobody
bad,"MST management is completely disconnected from what the Field Techs did on a day to day basis."
bad,I don’t know about other Macy’s. But Macy’s Florida mall is the worst company on the planet they don’t care about their employees they pay awful and expect you to work like your making 6 figures they lie to there employees. The cosmetics manager there is horrible she doesn’t know what she’s doing she pretends to care and doesn’t understand why people quit when she doesn’t even put in the effort to address the issues going on there. A lot of gossip and trash place to work
bad,"Once upon a time there was:  2 cashiers, 1 person outside the dressing rooms to do the ""go-backs"" and re-merchandise and 1 person inside the dressing room area to assist.  NOW a Retail Sales Associate position does the following:  rings up all transactions, cleans out the dressing rooms and hangs everything back up, puts all the merchandise back on the sales floor merchandised nicely AND Mgt. added that the Retail Sales Associate handles all BOPS - that's their acronym for customers who buy online and pick it up at the store.  The customers scream at you (the ones that have zero patience or understanding) for standing in long lines. You seethe inside wishing you could tell the customer that if Mgt. wasn't having you doing 5 jobs, there wouldn't be long lines.   IF your Manager comes around (which is maybe once a day) and a customer grabs her/him and complains about the long lines and waiting, the Manager very unprofessionally yells at you in front of the public - instead of jumping onto the other register collecting cobwebs and assist the customers and you.  Don't do it.  You will hate your Life after 1 week there.  Look at the employees - see any of them smiling? Hmmm?"
bad,"They onboarded and trained me in one day. Then I was thrown right out on the register. The manager of backstage did not like coming up to the register to approve discounts. I was given the title of ""Magic Captain"" and she gave me her login I.D.# to handle and approve customer service issues on my own. I was fired for giving a discount. No warning or write up! Right before Christmas"
bad,They demand a lot out of you with little to no appreciation.  The company has been losing lots of their employees.  Better management would make people stay.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Look else where believe me. I was happy when I first got there but the hours are terrible! There are RUDE supervisors smh its just not cutting it for me!
bad,"I was harassed everyday for almost a year by my manager and no one did anything about it. I've written multiple reports on my harassment, which ended up being thrown out the window and prevented me from leaving my job, so I was forced to stay there. Everyone has an attitude for no reason and managers/store manager cant even do their jobs right. Macys is a joke."
bad,It was the worst company I have ever worked for the department store in Ventura is very old the escalators don't work people fall down escalators and the light bulbs are mostly out and they won't replace them. The carpet around counters are filthy and they won't replace it . It was disgusting having to bend down to get products and touching that disgusting carpet and floors.
bad,"If you need help with a customer or change for the cash register the management team will take their time getting to you, or to cover you for the bathroom.(story) One day after lunch I had to really, really had to go .There was know one as cashiers to cover for me ,so I called management and they said ""Oh, sure we'll be up."" About an hour later,I closed up the register and ran down to the bathroom to releave myself. I was gone no more than ten minutes and with no customers around what's the hurry? As I was going back one of the managers came looking for me and yelled at me in the middle of the store for leaving. I told her I called you an hour or so ago? "
bad,"They are not consistent in their message. On paper, they say one thing, in practice, totally disconnected. At my location, the work environment is oppressive. The temperature is never at a comfortable setting.  EVERY day customers and employees complain and NOTHING changes unless there is a corporate exec visit. The customer service is not genuine; not part of the real culture there. The majority of employees are closet miserable and complain all the time. They put up with customers to get them to go away.  I'll work there until I can find a better job. Management doesn't walk the talk!  They complain about low customer service scores, but don't speak to employees or customers unless necessary!! They are very superficial and shallow!  Boarderline elitist in attitude.  And then they wonder why they're not taken seriously. "
bad,Working at macy’s was the most hot and uncomfortable place to work . it was always so unorganized and they had me training people my first day . i highly would not recommend
bad,"Macy's does not care about their employees, all they care about is sales and how to run a person down. Management is a huge joke, lazy, and unqualified. The only way some of them got promoted, is because they kept quiet, never spoke up about the unethical behavior that goes on there and was well liked. The pay is below poverty, if you work 60 hours a week, you still will not make it. Store manager is useless and should have never been a store manager of anything. A lot of favoritism! They have a high turn over rate because who wants to be stressed at a low paying job, dealing with all types of issues that arise with no support. Apply somewhere else and save your sanity, you will not be happy working at macy's!"
bad,"Don’t work for Macys unless your trying to punish yourself because karma isn’t working fast enough. Poor management, poor pay, very poor hours and flexibility. This company wonders why brick and mortar stores are dying out and Macy’s definitely contributes to that factor with the culture they promote. The upper echelon company managers only care about hitting target numbers, and in turn, the floor managers scramble around doing nothing to help make that happen. They treat the sales employees like trash, so now the sales people treat the customer like trash. I can’t believe I wastyso many years here, and was thankful to finally to be free of them!"
bad,"The north dartmouth Massachusetts location is terrible to work for. The managers can’t be trusted, they talk badly to & about associates. Barely any staff so always expecting so much of you , with little in return. Probably one of the most selfish , self centered companies I have ever worked for .."
bad,"Worked for the company for 28 year, upper management decided that a 3rd party company could do my job better. The stores are already complaining about the new company not doing the job. Just not right to let dedicated employees go who have traveled and spent days away from family to ensure company success and completed projects with extensive hours long day and sometimes 24hrs at a time."
bad,"N/A first company to work for management is rude and "
bad,"Macys has bought up all the localy run department stores, That used to pay high commission and give great service. Now they pay full time employees 9 dollars an hour in 2019. And sell overpriced clothes. At this point they’re just a glorified Walmart. Most employees can’t even afford to shop there. Take care of your employees and they’ll take care of you!"
bad,"1, Its retail"
bad,they pay min wage no way to survive you will work yourself to death to pay bills and the managment will complain abut everything. no room for advancement
bad,"One of the worst places I have worked. Never get sick, don’t have a life outside of this place. You will randomly lose hours, regardless of how well you perform."
bad,The factory was hot but needed to ware pants and shirts. Always get cut by something. The people are sweet very caring. You can walk up to 7milea in one night
bad,"If you like being overworked then suddenly dropped with no warning, apply for Macy’s. Not only did they work me just enough to avoid going overtime, they just stopped giving me hours after Christmas, wouldn’t answer my calls to ask why and then eventually sent a generic thank you email to tell me I had been let go."
bad,"I was scheduled for an interview this week at 5pm. I get there and no one acknowledged me. I waited for about 30 mins and as I was walking out to leave someone in HR finally asked was I waiting for something, I said an interview. So after interviewing I was told ill here from someone about the job and never heard back. I work at my full time job handling the same issues at Macys and it was a bad experience just interviewing and a waste of time. Not recommended if they cant get it right before you're even considered for employment there."
bad,"No management to back you up, and the gossip is a big thing at the store. Management will take sides. Everything is a big rush to get done and the second floor is always short staffed."
bad,I wouldn’t recommend anyone working here . The managers do not act like managers . The managers are very immature and speak of u to other associates . They definitely play favoritism . They under pay you ( $12) the environment is disgusting regarding associates . I regret slaving at this place !
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,The management is awful. They over work you then treat you like you are nothing. They would rather hire new people than let their current employees advance. They treat customers better than their own employees. I don’t recommend this job at all. The store is always a mess as Well.
bad,"my work day was full of co-workers and managers coming up against me and lying on me, taking hours away, not paying as they said they would if you open a credit account. they had favorites and the rest of us was not even looked upon except to beat us down. I am glad they are closing. The managers also treated black customers really rude, watching and following them throughout the store. They also watched me with black customers."
bad,"They are selective people, without good selection of people. Retaliation, calling pointed selective employees to office at all the times. Poor support management. Employees fearing loosing their jobs. No employees cooperation. Fear of loosing their jobs if help one another for support."
bad,They feel employees are disposable. Hard to advance. Unprofessional behavior by management. Unappreciative management. Pay is low for the industry. Do not recommend.
bad,None they force u to open credit cards to people that's all they care about.  Did not treat people nicely.  It's very sad how they treat all employees.   Do not respect  them at all.
bad,The people are rude the management is very poor an if your not a lead or manager you'll be treated poorly no training everything is on you rather you know how or not managers take as many breaks as they want an return from break when they want they hide from the team that there suppose to be leading for the day an they all stick together to keep there position so never tell on a manager
bad,"The Macy’s on BrookWood mall always getting  robbed from The jewelry department ,also getting robbed from the men’s department and women’s department. I was working part time , yet I was working a full time shift which made no sense! Yet , you only get paid $7.50 hr don’t work their!!"
bad,"If you work hard you'll never go anywhere. They drive the hardworking employees into the ground while relying on a revolving door students and invalids to make their bottom line."
bad,"Worst job I ever had , no room to growth  . Their only focus is on sales , they not care about the associates. Very low pay , poor management, low hours."
bad,"Me and my little sister was working there and her friends they had my little sister call them everytime she clock into work, out of work and also when she about to use the bathroom and go on break. At first my sister didn't understand why she had to do that but one day she asked her Manager why did she have to do that everytime she manager said because all your friends work here yall can be goofing around and then one day her and my sister had a huge argument she asked my sister what did she want to do and my sister responds was wym what u want to do you want to fight she said its whatever at first my sister was going to fight her but then my sister had to think about the cops being called and false accusations my sister went to the highest person and told them about the problem but aided with the manager my sister told my mother and now we are going to sue them for harassment"
bad,"I would not suggest anyone work for the specific Macy's Warehouse that I was employed at. Management is very unprofessional, plays favorites, and does not enforce any rules whatsoever. The culture was very clique-ish, not all that friendly of an environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work itself. I enjoyed being trusted to be left alone to do my job."
bad,Horrible management. Management is arrogant and condescending. Manager doesn't know how to work the desk. Supervisor has horrible time management skills. Training goes fast and doesn't teach much. Almost all training comes from coworkers. People being rude and insulting you all day. Leftist politics are everywhere. ABSOLUTELY NO ADVANCEMENT. Raises are only cents. Management plays favorites. Building is dirty and falling apart.
bad,"awful place to work, management is horrible, your co workers are rude and competitive this company is going under and promises things to employees it cant keep. I was supposed to work 40 hours a week and i was lucky if i could beg people for hours. When i didn't need hours i was thrown into to many hours with tons of breaks so i did not get overtime and had no option to go home with 4 or 5 thirty min breaks in a double shift."
bad,"If you like getting paid a fraction of what you deserve for dressing business professional than this is the place for you. If you enjoy long hours, rude entitled customers, and not being able to express yourself at work, then you should work at Macy's. An average day consists of handing out hundreds of dollars in promotions but getting lowballed on your wage, the complete and utter co-dependency of customers, and being forced to look like you’re busy when there’s nothing left to do. You could sell half the merchandise in your department but won’t mean a thing unless you open up another credit card.. the list goes on.."
bad,"Asset Protection Management was poor, they will overwork you and do not acknowledge you. Underpay you and will not properly train you. They don’t care about your work environment nor your safety."
bad,Management is horrible and AP watch their workers more than customers. They harass you. Pay isn't enough for what they want you to do. I wouldn't recommend.
bad,"not enough people and do not know how to manage their employees, they do not pay enough to the employees and need to be trained right to manage how they treat employees"
bad,"This company has no clue how to treat employees, very unfair practices. They have a revolving door on their call centers because of faulty hiring practices."
bad,If you aren’t liked they will find a way to fire you. Or make you “voluntarily resign”. I was wrongfully accused of something I did not do and that’s not fair. And they did it on a weekend so I couldn’t reach HR and it became a “voluntary resignation “
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Your hours are constantly cut. The pay starts at 11.70 and stays that way. It's vto every single day. Poor management. They don't care about their employees. It take 5/6 mins to walk to the time clock when you come in the front door. Security watches you constantly like your going to steal. There's never any work and your trying to find work for yourself. The list goes on. You have to pay for everything. Barely any incentives. A single item in the warehouse is with more than my paycheck a week. No hr on site. Everything is on the computer. It's terrible. If you have kids or real responsibilities I would never in a million years recommend this job. And my commute is 30 mins. Paycheck a week 260. That's childcare and gas to get there. You do so much more than what you're paid for. It's hot as a sauna.
bad,"Macy's is very corporate style greedy when it comes to their discount, as you have to sign up for their credit card just to get it. The only good discount you get without signing up for a credit card is Starbucks for 10%."
bad,If you can find another job I recommend taking that one instead of any position in retail Macy's. This establishment is in need of unionization. Don't expect much from this job.
bad,You can't take a break and get any fresh air at all working at this place!!! Every single person who works here smoke cigarettes!!!!! Terrible place to work!
bad,"The AP manager isn’t concerned about you or your life. You don’t have much free time because he is always having you on the clock meanwhile he comes in extra early so he can leave early, he isn’t visual nor does he have much compassion. The place is a revolving door. I was there for MONTHS before the guy certified me. It’s a joke and it’s been tons of people in and out!"
bad,"Not intrested in ever working for this company "
bad,This Is not a job to work if you have kids and bills.You can’t provide for your family.. the supervisors didn’t agree with females doing a males job and be good at it also.
bad,After speaking with every manager the emotional abuse and bullying continued and even got worse. I was retaliated against and the last straw was getting boxes thrown at me repeatedly
bad,"It’s been the worst experience of my life . Never again , please stay away from that place , u will regret even going there to apply go somewhere else"
bad,Worked with a bipolar narcissit co-worker. Tried to make friends with her but ended up leaving when they chose her over me due to her violence and anger towards me and others. She had reasonable accomidation for MS and even used a cane which I never seen before. Love watching Macy's sink. Karma is a b h
bad,"There is no worse place,worse maneger,and worse people i will never forget,liars they tell you a thing at the interview and then when yo start working is another you will know what I talking about"
bad,"Good for young people to start but there is a lock of advancement. Manager was excellent but the manager from the store was a dictator. she yell too much and used to make cry to most of the employees but not to me not I ever reply to her just stay quite to which she did not like it, Pressure is too much for accomplishing the sale and to open account. Thing were going worse since they were telling us to avoid giving information when you open an account. But indeed we have to give information when customer ask and then they decline to open account because there were a lot untold detail that are not giving if you do not ask."
bad,There was a very minimal amount of communication or training involved at working here. Management set unrealistic goals and did as little as possible to help see those goals through.
bad,"too little time to get things done within the time they needed it done, got no encouragement to get anything done, got mad at everyone for their mistakes"
bad,"Most of managers do not have professional skills."
bad,I was really surprised that a supervisor on one of my reviews put down that I did not participate in their activities there and activities included bring in donations for other people I’m there to work and I need donations myself so how could it possibly count  against  me on my review I think it was unethical and unprofessional and I will never work for them again this was in the fraud prevention team in Mason unreal I really regret not calling the labor board
bad,"Place is hooooorible. Glad I left. I can't believe people still work here. I think management takes advantage of everyone since they are the only full time employees. Everyone else is part time. I left a few months ago, and I still can't get this job out of my head. I want to warn everyone who wants to work here. DO NOT WORK FOR THE MACY'S LIVINGSTON NJ LOCATION!"
bad,No one cares about anything. Everyone does their own thing. Training is horrible. They put you in front of a computer for 3 days so you learn their “mission” and understand how to work the cash register.
bad,Negative atmosphere.  Employees negative and are continually beaten down.  Management is never happy with anything that you do.  So short staffed management can not possibly help.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Macy's encourages you to get customers to apply for credit card or up grades and when you get them there mad and question how u get all those and then look on cameras like your a thife and are upset cuz a few customers apply more than once for a card if coustomer wants to y not let them. and insted of telling the team hey help out when they see a line there is a empty regester they get on you and tell you let your tem help its not my fault my customers are willing to wait for me. I always inform them there are other regester but they love me and want to wait Macy's don't appreciate good hard workers. Average is what they want anything above that they assume something is wrong. And nothing is confidential they tell everyone everything. And gossip gossip lots in the break room. no team work at all. Loved my job and customers but did not love the store and there Outlook.
bad,"Horrible management team never on floor . Never pick up calls. Shows favoritism . Unrealistic expectations . Not open to ideas or feedback, promote unqualified ppl ."
bad,The Typical day was chaotic because their was no training for employees. You have to basically learn your job on your own with very little help. Management doesn't care about anything or anyone as long as the job gets done. Most of the general employees are good people but almost all of Management  is uncaring and deceitful. There are only 2 Supervisors that know how to do their jobs correctly. Most of the time they are willing to teach you how to do your job correctly but they are so overwhelmed because the Managers and Upper Management rely on them to fix everybody's mistakes they have no time to do any training. The hardest part of the day was dealing with  all of the chaotic messes and trying to fix them. The most enjoyable part of the day was going HOME!!
bad,"Helping customers in the store , checking out customers. Helping customers in bedding department, place orders at the registers. Handle all returns. Put up displays."
bad,There is no room for much growth. The compensation from this job is not very substantial towards paying the bills. It is a great job while your attending school.
bad,"Wanted you to work wonders for low pay, staff or management really didn’t get along, you’re just really working a job for maybe a high schooler If you are a adult."
bad,Managers are lazy. I was never properly trained.  The managers allow customers to mistreat and abuse the workers.  The managers abuse their position and authority
bad,"Macy's was definitely a learning experience however, I am now able to tackle more challenging obstacles in my life. I want to focus on my career and stick to longterm goals."
bad,"This place was awful. No matter how hard i tried to move up, they would move everyone up but me. My sales goals were met, but still for some reason, the would only move up their favorite employees."
bad,"I rated this company accordingly,  I feel like they lie to save face to be completely honest. I'd never recommend them, legit ever lol.................."
bad,"The morale is this Macy's is so low, people, including managers, are quitting. The new attendance policy is ridiculous and punishes the people who actually show up and work. The old attendance policy was a point system and worked really well. The problem with that policy is managers would go in and override the system when an employee they liked was in trouble with losing their job. The new policy is a percentage policy where you have to work at least 95% of your schedule to keep your job. This policy is not good for people who have other jobs. For example, I have had to miss days they scheduled me for even though I was 'not available' for those days because of my job. Also, at the last minute, I had to go out of town for an emergency and could not go in. Under the old policy, I would have just lost points. Under this new policy, if I missed a weekend of work due to an emergency, I could very well lose my job and I am one of the hard-working people at this store. Terrible policy. What should they do? They should keep the poiint system, but not let new employees use it. New employees should be on a 90 day probation when if they call out on ANY weekend for A N Y reason, they are terminated. These younger kids just don't understand the meaning of being reliable and working. "
bad,Macy's was the worst place I've ever worked the management was very terrible they did not train you they did not help you the fitting room was crazy it was no open baskets 4 clothing it was very on organized they had only one person perfetti roll it should have been at least. 2 people doing the fitting room very unorganized clothes were everywhere but I understand no one wants to work there the supervisors and management they suck they need to be retrained themselves the Indian woman was very rude she's the manager in case you run across her Barry Road and races I felt very uncomfortable with her.
bad,Macy’s was a great job. I liked working for them. The environment was good. The management was okay. The rate of pay could be better. But overall my experience was good.
bad,"I worked fas a lex time merchandiser. Most of the lead associats we're unhappy with their job and were mean. The moral of the team was low, with everyone willing to find a better job. The management were aware of the problems but didn't care."
bad,The coworkers you are with will make u feel like an outsider. I worked with the entire store as security and out of all only 4 in total were nice people.
bad,"clock in"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Macy's pay is atrocious. There is a lack of respect for store associates. Some managers do not know anything, and have to be taught by associates. Despite this sale and support associates are paid very little. Macy's has little regard for the time or well being of its employees."
bad,use to be good till management change then hours cut for bonus for manager. was to long ago since I worked there. no interest in going back with all changes
bad,"I use to like to work at Macy’s. After working for 2 years. The company has gotten worst. They don’t empower the employees. All our hard work is for the benefit of Macy’s. All employees get is a Macy Magic Card.  Managers  put stress on employees to open up Macy’s credit cards. We only get $2 Macy’s money to use towards shopping at Macy. However, Managers get more vacation time.  If we don’t open Macy’s credit card. We have to open a membership Bronze reward card. The Union sucks. We pay a useless organization that doesn’t benefit employees. The health insurance is terrible and we only get 7 days vacation a year. It takes years to accrue more vacation time. People who work retail need more than a 7 day vacation. Macy's want us to add customers to our online clientele so we can text / call and harass them to come shop. It doesn’t work. It actually pushes the customers away. The managers grade employees on repeat customers. Why would they grade us on whether a customer shops with a individual employee? They can shop with whomever they want. They grade us on how many credit cards we open too. Most people don’t want a high interest rate credit card.  The store often have DJs. It’s is a loud and  obnoxious  place to work. Walking through the beauty and fragrance department is like walk through a sea of  piranhas. Working at a beauty counter is like working with sharks. We don’t have work life balance. The store closes at 10:00pm. The next day a person can be scheduled to work at 9:45 am. Macy’s only cares about employees making money for them. The company and management see us as"
bad,It’s a well place Macy’s the story more beautiful .......for that Im want work there
bad,the management here treated you like a slave or the had favorites never promoted from inside and the racism here was much based on skin color and also one of the worst place to work
bad,Almost all the managers were horrible to the employees. The hours were always good but there is never enough people working so I would always end up working 12 hour shifts
bad,"Working there is comparable to slavery. Working hours don't really count. The time clocking machine is a cheat. When you complain, no one listens or care about you. The hiring door is revolving. New hirers leave as soon as they're hired."
bad,not friendly very low morale management is terrible. if u stop for more than 2 seconds to take a breather u get jumped on about productivity and work pace.
bad,"From beginning to end, you will see loads of red flags warning you ""Do not work here"". I was interviewed at least three times until finally, someone threw me a bone and it really was not worth the trips."
bad,"They refuse equal pay. Been there several years but refuse to match my salary to starting employees. Derogatory, authoritarian, punish for minimal things. Do not work here, its soul crushing ang depressing. Never have I felt so so low in my life. They are uderstaffed, disorganized, bad pay, they play favorites and lie to you then punish you later. Worst place ever. "
bad,"Continuing turnover caused by hiring and firing. Some People quit or lose “ points “.The managers will make up lies just to fire someone. Some locations have security or A loss prevention department that instead of doing their job go in on the abuse,mistreatments of employees."
bad,"I would not work for the Medford location! Coming from almost fours year working for the company(different location) I received an offer to launch a brand in Macy’s for the Medford area. Did phenomenal and out beat sales for Harold Square in NY. Soon that company pulled the brand from the Medford area where I was then brought on board to fine jewelry employed by Macy’s. Was going good. There was one incident where I had tough situation with a manager there. When coming to approach me with it, all the managers were there. I felt gained up on and specifically asked for the manager that I was having troubles with not be present. They did not listen and not to mention had everyone else there. I was treated like a child and not an employee. I was still employed they gave me a “warning” which I graciously excepted, even though I disagreed full heartedly. Mind u the incident was over a simple misunderstanding with a customer who I had thought was already being helped. The customer saw me take a sip of my coffee and complained that I was not helping her. Immediately I apologized and ask what I could help her with. Long story short the managers all emphasized the coffee, and how I wasn’t supposed to have coffee at the bay(never once refused to throw it away after they asked me)and I at which point looked to everyone of those managers and said it wasn’t a matter of the coffee the customer felt ignored and that’s where the problem lied!  They all agreed!!!! Anyways, a few months later, I was in the middle of opening a credit account and 3,000$ sale as well as signing up for thx for sharing"
bad,"Something is wrong with the company right now. Its making employees not want to come to work...,...............................    ..   .............."
bad,Training is nowhere near the actual job at hand. Very stressful. Would not recommend. Hours are only good during the holidays. You're basically on your own with no direction. People can be rather meanspirited.
bad,"The department manager threw you on the job and the"
bad,"I love my co-workers, but the management is all over the place. They hire anyone and those new hires end up being unreliable. They don't train them well and throw them on the sales floor on their first day, after completion of computer based training. The managers always point out your mistakes, but never recognize your achievements. They praise the favorites, but forget the underdogs. I have only worked at 2 Macy's stores and the one I am at makes me miss my old store."
bad,"i could give a super long summary and state everything wrong about working for this company, but just take my word for it. its miserable for me here.."
bad,This place run like a high school and every who works here hates their life and miserable. Very high turn around rate I’m the only person left from my training class of 15 and I’ve been here 3 months
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"High stress. Management majes promises they dont fulfill. Huge letdown for $12. Hour doing Operations managers work. Sometimes didn't even get a break. Just a 1/2 hour lunch on a 10-12 hour shift. "
bad,"Very aggressive with credit, they cut hours without notice, they give verbal on the floor with customers watching, a lot of gossip, management does absolutely nothing to protect employees."
bad,"Macy's is a sinking ship. Poor upper management, dated initiatives, and archaic processes and infrastructure have driven this company into the ground."
bad,This is not a good place t work the management are snot nose stuck ups but kissers who have nothing better to do than sit on their buts and make the seasonal workers do all the work.
bad,I didn't like the fact that I lost my job because people were not stealing. This was a problem for me. They are mostly about sales. Most department stores are.
bad,"there is nothing nice that I could say about Macys."
bad,I felt like I was in high school with all the drama and cliques. Management refused outright to allow me to go to a different area to work when I told them how rude my fellow co-workers were being. One in particular was was childishly trying to be a bully when I brought it to management's attention. In the end I felt very uncomfortable at work so I ended up ending that career choice.
bad,"I honestly don’t think i was treated well , "
bad,"The customers are rude!  The managers are incompetent and inexperienced. The some sales associates are unprofessional. Their is no teamwork. The company doesn't care about its employees. You always work weekends. ALWAYS!!! You have to get a manager just to get vacation time! The hours are minimal. People steal alot, there is no security."
bad,"Worked there 4 years, my manager was shady. Did things behind my back to make me look bad. Pay was horrible. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Management was out for themselves."
bad,This is a terrible and toxic place to work. There is no room for advancement. The managers don't know what they're doing. The benefits and pay are minute too.
bad,"Very bad   to  work into ,  they  fire people for stupid things and are very very bad in raising the payments.One of the  worse places to work , and the people who works there should be machine  that don`t think ."
bad,we was underpaid while they made thousands of dollar daily. we never received bonuses. we never was directly acknowledged for our hard work.We always had problems with payroll.
bad,"I would NOT recommend anyone working for MACY""S. They do not want to pay their employees for the work expected from them. Extremely LOW hourly wages and lots of work expectation. Management does nothing but sit in the office all day and new employees with very little training are supposed to handle rudest customers. Stressful workplace that is not worth at all."
bad,"The management needs to be replaced. Screaming at employees and customer is the norm. No bathroom breaks or coverage for lunch. Some people have worked there for years; they are treated poorly as well."
bad,"Minimum wage pay, bad department management and little to no training. Employees get blamed for not knowing how to do their job even though they were no properly trained."
bad,"not a good place to work, heavy turn around, low pay, some managers have getto attitude, they are rude and have lack of interest in associates' concerns, lack of communication."
bad,I worked there over the holidays and spent all my time alone thrown to the wolves trying to survive and after season so many people were working that it was pointless to have so many people when we weren’t busy and all they care about is opening new credit lines witch is cool but it literally is impossible when you’ve hounded them so much and the got denied just a week ago honestly terrible place to work
bad,it was to stressful for the amount paid t and they were totally unfair to some because of who they chose to be around the only way i would go back is if i absolutely had too
bad,"You can not give decent service to our customers on the time frame they expect us to on each call. It's literally ridiculous. They expect you to be rude or a robot to meet their expectations. There is no room for promotions or they will promote someone fresh out of college or be manager with no experience. There is so much favoritism. If your opinionated,  then might as well  be prepared to be written up. They'll find a way to fire you. New hires getting hired almost same amount as some of us that have been here 10 years."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I was fired for having a allergic reaction on the floor. I had been working non stop for a week. When I came back I asked for more hours, I was told there was only 4 hours for the next 2 weeks. I told her I was not able to survive nor able to pay for anything with only 4 hours of working .I have been calling and reporting it but  obviously to the wrong people because nothing is getting done."
bad,Macy’s was the worst place I worked I am thankful for everything I learned about working with the public and customer service. The managers were not kind and some would even gossip about you.
bad,Working here was very unusual. We didnt have set hrs. I could work 20 hrs one week and 4 hrs the next. The manditory black friday 12 hr shift was rediculous and if you didnt show up you were terminated.
bad,I worked there for four years with no raise and the seasonal hires were getting paid more than me to start out. Do not work here you will regret it. I didn’t have anxiety issues before I worked here and now have to go to the doctor because of working conditions.
bad,"- jealous coworkers"
bad,"This is a job that can best be summarized as a set up for failure on all levels. There are strict policy’s in place. If you break them you can fired. However, if the policies affect the customer, ie.... a return policy or a customer wanting to use a stolen credit card, you can also be fired for not helping the customer. Even tho it’s policy. So, beak policy your screwed don’t break policy equal resulted. No upper management will offer any assistance or guidance. Just canned condescend lip service about how they will open a case for termination."
bad,"Poor work  culture, No planning, no technical resources at higher level, Vendors sabotage rivals, suffocating, vicious environment. No respect for Individuals, toxic environment"
bad,"Inconsistent hours, too many one week, and none the next. Expect employees to stick around in the hopes of getting more than 10 hours a week. Co workers were great however."
bad,"Changes with company effected moral in store........................ A lot of turn over within management, sales are slow, lack of support from upper management"
bad,"from staff, to management, to customers. It was awful. Lets just say, bomb threats SHOULD NOT BE NORMALIZED FOR $15! Everything about this place was a joke."
bad,"DO NOT WORK HERE. The managers are incompetent and do not care about their employees. Moreover, the customers are entitled and rude. This company does not want to see any of their employees succeed. I am a college graduate that is an excellent worker and was never offered any opportunities."
bad,"I would have listed lower but 1 star was the least. "
bad,"Management is incompetent and indifferent. Hard work is not rewarded. Promotions are few and far between. It's a typical large corporation that simply pretends to care about it's employees, which is more annoying than just staright up not caring."
bad,"We reserve the right not to post your review if it contains any of the following types of content or violates other guidelines:"
bad,They expect five people to do the job of twenty and then wonder why the work isn’t done at the time allotted. It was a great environment when I first started it slowly has gone downhill
bad,Overall I never really felt welcome and I constantly had to overlook my coworkers talking about me. A typical day revolved around just doing what needed to be done to get through the day. I learned what a working environment should not look like and once my hours were significantly lower for no reason I looked for employment elsewhere.
bad,"Low wages, bad management, everybody very rude to each other. No set scheduling. No advancement. No benefits program for employees what so ever maybe good fo"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Quite frankly, Macy’s is a joke. There is no room for advancement and the pay was laughable. It wasn’t worth my time or effort going to that place. Don’t waste your time"
bad,"Very unorganized, not much training to start off with& the customers can be rude, mostly the older ones. For a job that doesnt pay much you shouldn't have to kiss so much BUTT."
bad,This is a second income type of job. Unless you're corporate.They make you work long hour they are very slow you cannot juststand round even when undone.
bad,"For the Crabtree Valley Mall Macys managers are all childish, petty, irresponsible and liars. it feels like your in high school all over again with all the drama. "
bad,"there is no help, they ask to much, give you little ,the building it self is ready to fall down.Sometimes you do find fellow coworkers that fun to work with and others why you have no idea why there still working and other management too. The retail business is in trouble."
bad,I worked at Macy's water tower for the Christmas holiday season.They made me feel very uncomfortable everyday I went to work .I felt as if I was being picked on because of my skin color .I was a hard working arriving on time and doing what I was told but they was so UNORGANIZED they also over work you and don't like to pay you for hours you really worked.
bad,"My experience at Macy's was horrible , the supervisors/managers were horrible . Whenever i had to pick up shifts none were available and they never helped me to pick up any. Overall my work experience was not good at all"
bad,"Macy's is a great place to work. They believe in work, life and balance. Also, they take care of their employees. There are great opportunities for growth if you choose to do so"
bad,"I worked for Macy’s for about a year in the Loss prevention department, my team and boss were great and we produced good numbers! We were on track to be the best store of the year.  "
bad,Terrible culture and environment. Sales goals absolutely unrealistic. Turnover through the roof. Management engages is abusive and gaslighting techniques to keep employees. They let customers get away with murder and expect the employees the give stellar customer service while being screamed at and degraded. Cut back on employee incentives and perks over the years. Also cut back the staff every year and expect just a few individuals to cover an entire floor then berate the staff when a bad customer survey comes in saying a sales rep could not be found in the department they were shopping in.
bad,"There are 15 work stations and 5 employees on the floor. "
bad,"I can take any where from 60-100 calls Dailey, My job is to help in bound callers with questions regarding there pay stubs, benefits, elections for  health insurance. The work place is good we do special things monthly, food days , Trivia and word puzzle for prices."
bad,"I wouldn't work there ever again. I had a terrible experience, the managers weren't right, and every day I worked, I went in blind and had no idea where I was supposed to be."
bad,"This company will tell you what you want to hear and later change rules to suit themselves.  A lot of favoritism played. Schedule is awful at the beginning, if your lucky you can get it changed. Training is awful and not helpful at all. You have to meet your required CP60, staff time, which changes without anyone telling you. They set you up to fail."
bad,Macy's is a great place to work for people who study at school and looking for a part-time small income job. I was working in the cosmetic department and all there was no diversity. The majority of the people working in my department was Spanish/Mexican people who spoke on their language all the time. My manager who is 3 times older than me would keep me in the stock room because I did more sales then she ever did for her 18 years of working at Macy's. All depends on your team and your manager. I also was working every single weekend for 8 months of being there.
bad,Macys is a good company but they could grow in a lot of areas.  I sometimes feel we are not treated well when I hear of stories from former employees. I feel they want us wear several hats but only pay us for one hat.
bad,"I worked in the cosmetic department.  Macys management is non existent.  The floor managers are lazy and walk around an empty store asking for unrealistic sales goals. Counter managers are inexperienced and unable to lead. There is always a lack of stock. The store is beyond dated, it looks horrible. Account execs. Never are in store. Zero proper communication. Turnover of management is ridiculous. This company has no clue when it comes to customer service or employee respect."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Unrealistic sale goals, management gives to much pressure without encouragement to employees. Management gives to much favoritism. Little hours and pay is low"
bad,"Not a pleasant place to work. Daily work loads are unreal, not enough support. Expectations are down right ridiculous with minimal pay, not enough crew members nor time to complete tasks in one day. management is always worried about colleagues getting overtime. So it's nearly impossible to maintain a healthy work environment. I worked in the distribution center for 5 years, I have to say the best thing about working for Macy's is the relationships you develop with other colleagues."
bad,I've been doing housekeeping there about 3 years ago and I've went thought a lot with the manager and she would cut my days for giving additude. Wouldn't help
bad,"This job is not fun"
bad,"I started here the week of Black Friday, minimal training, my only job to fold clothes and fix messed up racks. I ended up being the only person working a department with no register training on Black Friday, was asked to assist another department with register backup and was reprimanded for training myself on a register. Horrible management."
bad,Macys was my first job and I just don't understand how a workplace could be so messy and unorganized. were worked like horses and we got paid the bare minimum.
bad,"worst company to EVER work for. management does not care about associates at all. some managers tend to be bullies (homophobia, misogynists, fat-shaming, racism, etc.)  and lazy and never lift a finger. they take about 20 breaks a day and never appreciate hard workers. they would skip you over for a promotion for their favorite person. they have favoritism also, letting their favorites slide and not work either while everyone deals with the madness going on in the store. only way I recommend this job is if you're desperate and need little cash cause the pay is atrocious. little pay for hard work. place is like a high school with grown people who are parents and grandparents. this place just needs new management because they honestly don't be caring about the associates. no appreciation whatsoever."
bad,I never was accommodated to leave for church I had to miss church over a month before I left . I found myself always getting sick there and the employees and managers keep up with all the drama
bad,"Macys does not care for their employees. Macys needs to hire the RIGHT management team for their departments, and not just allow whatever manager to be on duty. Worst company ever."
bad,"I hated working at Macy’s. It was very stressful, very very messy and I always was under pressure to open  the store card for customers. It was very hard to get the schedule. Overall I wasn’t happy working there at all"
bad,"Worked for Macy's about 4 yrs and It can be extremely cut throat, stressful environment.  I had 3 managers where one in particular thought I was her own personal food delivery assistant.  The other 2 managers when they had ample time to get their own lunch themselves, they wouldn't because of weather reasons (its raining, too cold or too hot) or just lazy. They would interrupt my lunch break so I can get their lunch.  I only had 1 amazing manager.  You will get blame for something that the manager mess up on their own and won't take ownership of their mistake.  They blame you and make you feel as if you're the guilty."
bad,"Macys was a very awful  experience. Glad that I was able to find alternative experience."
bad,"Macy’s is by far the worst company I’ve ever worked for. I would advise anyone and everyone against working there. The management is the absolute worst. They love drama, and backstabbing. They love throwing others under the bus. The pay is garbage the bennifits are also garbage."
bad,I've worked here for 3 years and stay thinking it may get better due to empty promises. Truth is macys doesn't care about its employees and doesn't do enough to protect employees also poorly managed.
bad,"The only reason I would keep a job here is if I was part time, which by the way, Macy's only gives their part time associates 3-4hr closing shifts only a couple times a week. Full time is given 28hrs minimum. Unorganized management. A break is a rare commodity. They promote all of the wrong people and keep good workers in their areas so that they can keep the area functioning. There is no HR only through online to submit cases. The list goes on. A very unpleasant workplace."
bad,worst place to work. customers are rude. managers are rude and think they are above everyone. the place is always messy. they make you stay after late and do not compensate very well.
bad,They changed management from the top to the lowest department managers in one years time and not longer followed the rules and regulations of sales that they had made.They also moved what they called the last act stuff that is clothes that have not sold and put it next to suits so all of the bargain shoppers now used the suits filling rooms so lmore than 3 hours a day was spent cleaning up after these folks.
bad,"helping customers, fitting customers, opening credit cards is their only concern, no money is made here in sales unless your sale shoes, just something until you find something better"
bad,"EVIL CORPORATION"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"When I first started working there, it was fun since it was my first job. But after years of working there, I wanted to grow and pursue a job in business. They had no thought in doing so even though I was going to school for business. Even though I poured my heart and soul into that company, they wouldn't even let me go participate in the Macy's day parade. They only let they co-workers they were friends with go. After five years, I had to go. They didn't see me as potential for growth but someone to slave over minimum wage."
bad,Love working there but older employees would be allowed to steal commissions from newer employees.  Department managers and store managers were told but nothing was ever done.
bad,every day grown men followed me and nothing would be done. They managers did not do anything in their position to make me feel safe at work. It got to the point where a man grabbed my arm to sniff me.
bad,The working conditions is no healthy. The stress from the managers that don't know their own task hover co-workers as if they are prisoners. Knowing the task at hand is all good because you will learn different things.
bad,No home life. Run away. Too stressful to work in retail. Management is bad. Loss prevention makes you feel like your always a target for something. I quit because of no home life and was contacted by loss prevention because i suddenly quit so i must have been doing something. Horrible work place.
bad,Managers are racist and rude. They never helped and left every employee to do the job and work that they were supposed to be doing. Everything always fell into the hands of the employees.
bad,"Working here was alright, it helped me learn how to speak to customers and learn customer service skills however it got old quick when I learned there was no room to grow and pay was pretty bad."
bad,"Working at Macy's was very exciting, attending meetings and learning new things everyday. Sometimes it can be very frustrated dealing with some customers but overall I loved it."
bad,"Working as a receiving associate at Macy's was the worst job I ever had! First, there was no HR because they were laid off a few months before I was hired. So, I didn't get an orientation, only did the second part of doing the computer aspect. I was clueless to how the company worked such as polices, breaks, PTO, medical, etc. Second, the workers in my department were nothing but a clique and verbally abusive! Things did calm down when a manager was hired but after a few week that horrible receiving team ganged up on her and caused her to quit. So, then their toxicity was directed back at me. The new manager was on the receiving team and a VERY  disgruntled worker, very unprofessional and a bully! I had been there only 6 months and that whole department still treated me like a F.N.G.! They played so many mind games, they would tell me one thing and when I did it, it made them angry. It was damned if I do or damned if I don't! There was no HR to file a grievance so I left! I strongly advise anyone to not apply for a job at the receiving department at Macy's in Kahului unless you don't mind being bullied. I had never had a job as awful as the one at Macy's and I've had some bad jobs!"
bad,they don't care about employees they always nag. I wish that the management actually manged they micro mange. If I would do something different I wouldn't work their.
bad,Workplace is hostile I work for Macy's for four years and to come upon unexpected life problems and for the management not to care what is happening in my life all they worry about is how fast you work and they don't care if you have a place to stay if you have your whole life is falling apart and they don't care it's not a very good feeling that you gave company for years of your life to know that you could put out on your tail even though you're fighting homelessness
bad,"Although I enjoyed cashiering, I never want to work again at Macy's in Casper, WY. I was placed on the fulfillment team despite applying to be a sales associate. Most my work on the sales floor was spent reorganizing items that customers left in total disarray. The remainder of my time on the sales floor involved finding items that had been ordered."
bad,Joppa warehouse for Macy’s is a terrible place to work. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. The managers there are lazy and backstabbing and only care about themselves and are very dishonest
bad,too much work with low pay poor management crazy amount of workload once you finish your work keep working for others only thing to enjoy was the employee discount
bad,"I worked here 10 years ago. Hopefullly things have changed. We drank a lot. And I mean, A LOT I Macy's is only concerned with selling Macy/s cards. And that is all"
bad,I really don't know to much about macy's I haven't been working there for to long I don't like the fact that when I first started working there no one trained me they just showed me where I was going to be working at then they left me and I really didn't like that.
bad,"Unless this is your first job right out of high school, where you need the work experience, and you still live with your parents, so they can oay fir everything, I would pass. Human resources very disorganized, and rude."
bad,They will screw you over hard. Eliminate your position wont even give you a chance. Totally stupid company over ppl who absolutely need a job just to eat.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,The pay is horrible for the amount of work and horrible customers and employees you’re dealing with. Pay isn’t even double digits. Macy’s is the most understaffed and unprofessional place I’ve ever work. They treat you like slaves. No matter how hard you work or how long you work there you will not get a raise or promotion
bad,Boring stressful place it's too fast paced. Hours kinda suck cafe  is expensive people are judgey managers are kinda hard to get ahold of to many different systems you have to work with.
bad,"This place is a terrible place to work. "
bad,I regret working here. The have worst managers who care about themselves not their employees. I'm glad that I will be leaving soon just like everybody.
bad,"Working here was a mistake. I worked as hard as humanly possible and Macys set unattainable goals, and a terrible environment for employees to try to thrive in."
bad,"-Work load is crazy, we're understaffed but the managers do not look to hire additional help quickly. "
bad,If you don’t open a lot of credit cards they will try to get rid of you. They bribed you with candy to motivate you to open one. Pay below min wage and no benefits
bad,"I've never been much into retail and it was supposed to be a temporary job, however, I ended up working there for almost or around three years.  The management was not great as they really lacked professionalism and played favorites."
bad,"Managers do not help develop you."
bad,"Managers rude,not upto date w/ polices,undertrained,belittle you,equipment is old,terrible training,if goals are not met manager makes you feel awful."
bad,Macy’s is a horrible place to work. Management sucks from top to bottom. They will try to take advantage of you. Pay isn’t good at all. They want you to do everything. It’s not worth working here. Currently looking elsewhere.
bad,"One of the biggest issues with Macy's - the pay doesn't match the work. A typical day (if you start at 9) , was this- "
bad,"This store was great at one time, but after they got a new manager at the store it fell apart and wasn't the same as before. I use to enjoy working there but it became more stressful and un happy employee. Most of the good managers left to work different stores and replaced then with young kids to management to run the store."
bad,"Constantly changing schedules, Rude Customers and even ruder management. Sheer lack of respect towards other employee's and their work ethics, the management is all over the place with schedules and direction. "
bad,this job only worrys about itself they have poor pay and poor work ethic. if you work in a commision based position and dont sell enough for them they threaten to fire you.
bad,"Retail is not for me. Not only is the customer culture a different breed but so are the employees in some of the departments. I guess it would make sense if the customers have give the employees thick skin but yea, I was glad to move on."
bad,The managers are never present. Many years ago there was more communication and now there isn't. There's no Human Resources and everything is online. They need to go back to the old way because there's a lot of managers taking advantage of the fact that they can terminate anybody at any given time.
bad,Working retail is hard. Macy's doesn't seem to put their employees first. It is all about the dollar that they can make and how many customers come through their doors.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Downtown Brooklyn macys had, bad management, lack of leadership, discrimination, poor customer service, favoritism, poor work conditions, fraternization!"
bad,"unless your going to be there for management or just a student, not very much opportunity for advancement without going broke first.it's right for you if you really really enjoy that type of work."
bad,Store managers pick favorites and those people get what they want.  Not being hourly you have to work way more than 40 hours and it was frowned upon if you called out sick or went on vacation.
bad,A company I would never want to work for again. They are more worried about making sure a person has signed up for a card with their store than an actual sale. They want you to meet a certain quota per day of signing a person up.
bad,Macy's mangers are very jealous and will make sure you don't advance. They will force you to open credit cards. Not very family friendly. Very competitive.
bad,"Macy’s suppose to be this classy reputable company. However it seems like that has changed now. I arrived for my on boarding appointment at the designated time I was given. The lady in Hr acted lost and unorganized. I sat down for 30 minutes before being told what to do next. At that point I should of walked out. Fast forward a day later when my on boarding is complete. I was given a so called walk through in my area which was backstage. Backstage team members wear a Macy’s t shirt and jeans I received only one  t shirt and no badge. The manger of that area wasn’t even there and I was told to wait until she calls me to return to work. I set up my hours on the scheduling system and it only would let me put my hours in for next month which means I start next month. If I knew all of this beforehand I wouldn’t never applied. I won’t be waiting around for a minimum wage job.  I wasted gas and time  because of these people.  If the hiring process is like this I could only imagine how it will be actually working there. The staff at this location was very unprofessional and disorganized.  How do you hire someone and have no hours available??? Avoid,Avoid,Avoid!!!!!"
bad,Worked there before and has been trying for months to be re-hired and keep getting sent around in circles. Nobody is interested in figuring out why I can’t be hired.
bad,"Store #414 "
bad,This wasn't my favorite job because of the management. I learned people skills - in-genuine people skills at that. I learned haste in a work environment. Use the opportunity if it's temporary or for college in my opinion
bad,"Management is very poor "
bad,Donot work for Lancome counter in macy's the counter manager at the store I worked at was mentally abusive  and I  went to management nothing was ever done because she made big sale numbers. I feel like being a bad person was rewarded. I had to leave.
bad,"Macy's definitely helped with opening more doors for me in retail service for sure! Though the hours and pay weren't met, I still appreciate the oppurtunity that was given to me."
bad,"They want you to make sure products do not get stolen, but allow customers to abuse you. The asset protective team watch the employees, while customers are stealing."
bad,"The worst place to work at. They don’t take doctors notes as excuses. The manager is very unprofessional, and favoritises. The store manager will ask you to change if theres something she doesnt like. They never listen to requests. And will find the dumbest excuses to fire you."
bad,"The managers when I worked at this location were never around when you needed them. The ""training"" was a joke and I pretty much had to train myself if I couldn't find someone willing to help. It is very competitive since it is a commission based job."
bad,"This was by far the WORST job I have ever had."
bad,"I was 8 months pregnant. My floor manager was fine with me standing at the register for a few minutes to not be walking so much. My store manager however was completely rude. Didn't let me sit or even stand for a minute, had me lifting big boxes of vacuums, etc and carry them down about 20 stairs. I finally quit."
bad,"Good luck if you take this position. Associates are sharkey, managment is a sham, and the customer is slowly is falling apart. If you need some quick money work here but do not intend to work there for longer than a season."
bad,"Manager does not know to manage the departments. I learned to deal with difficult customers. I work in the Mattress Department. I enjoyed helping customers, and working with associate."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,More staff appreciation more acknowledgement of the  workers as far as Employee of the Month. Less pressure on making Commission. More affordable benefits for people with families
bad,"MCCS has a policy of looking at tenure over performance. With regards to associates requesting a different shift, it is impossible for a young enthusiatic employee to have a more desirable shift over someone who has been there for years and is just a body in the seat. The same tenure policy can be said when applied to supervisors. That company needs to thin the heard and remove the dead weight that has been dragging the company down for years. The gospel preach by management and the current VP to employees is not something that they practice themselves. The new VP Matt is a stain on that company and the hard working associates deserved a leader that has charisma, charm and genuine heart. Not just a yearly United way fundraiser to show he has heart. No one was ever forced to donate, but if you didn't.............."
bad,Management is unstable. Long hours. Very competitive when it comes to growth. No room for growth. Not enough training for growth. Workplace culture is unrepresented.
bad,The lack of work hours they provided wasn't up to par. They never gave any opportunities to advance. Also the pay was terrible but they wanted to work you to death for a 8.50 an hour.
bad,Bad company to work for they don't know what they're doing they don't know what the customer really wants when the people on the sales floor know what the customers want because they're talking to them everyday
bad,"Hours were minimal, management barked orders and never said hello, workers had no character, management was not willing to give more than 5 hours, and administrative assistant had a bad attitude.  Don't ever work as a flex employee because they will give you zilch.  I'm never working for Macy's again!  Thanks for nothing, Macy's.  You ruined my day."
bad,understaffed i was only person working my department  when there should have been 5 and they still didn't keep me after the season even though they were understaffed didnt make much sense to me I doubled or tripled my sales goal every time and helped insane amounts of customers without a problem but its ok i wouldnt want to work there its a dump now
bad,This location was very rude when it came to teaching someone how to do certain things for the store. Also the boss's really didn't take time to understand their employees
bad,"While I was working at Macy's, my main mission was sales. Because I was a good team member who met goals on time, I was floated to different departments to help the team achieve their daily and weekly sales goals."
bad,Upper Management has no concerns for those under them. Training was slim to none with no one to refer to for ill answered questions which were required to handle the tasks of the position. Very inhospitable place to work.
bad,"Sucked. Culture is about money and that's it. Worked there and worked very hard only to be worked even harder while the white male in my department could sit in chair and sleep. When I complained, I was terminated."
bad,Macy's workload is a lot. The store is busy everyday. There is many customers coming in and out of the store. Greeting the customers is important. Helping them with their shopping is a must. Spend most of time at back of store. Unloading the truck and helping stock the sales floor sometimes.
bad,"I really didn't enjoy working there at all, I was a high school and the weren't really being lenient with me at all scheduling me longer than I'm suppose to or sometimes none at all."
bad,When I first started at Macy's I liked it. But as time went on and I kept getting passed over four time slots or positions that I asked for I started to change my mind on Macy's. I was wrongfully terminated and fought to get my job back won and they had to pay me all my back pay for missed work. Too much favoritism goes on at Macy's.
bad,"General Management confused with little respect for employees, even of long standing with the company. flexible hours if you're a student, pay way below standard for the area."
bad,"Long hours, slave labor. The pay is minimum and the work you will do  is more than the job description. The only good side to this job were my coworkers."
bad,"Worst place to work"
bad,"The only reason why I stayed at Macys was because I had a great team and I really felt like family to them. Unfortunately, senior managers change frequently, last year my direct report changed 5 times, and each has there own opinions and expectations. Insanely stressful to complete projects on time with no support / budget and got coached on for completing the project but I had to stay longer to finish it. Not a good company to work for in management."
bad,Not really a good job.Treat pretty bad  and manager do not even care about you but expect to get it everything done less 4 hour.Only hire people on-call and not a good thing. Was not treat fair but disresepcetful by manager.
bad,"Macy's has lofty expectations. You have a certain sales goal you have to make every day and open two Macy's credit card accounts a week. Some days, there's literally no one in the store to sell to. The managers constantly hound you about Macy's credit card accounts, or ""Stars"". The morning meetings were pretty much a waste of time. The only redeeming thing about that place was the coworkers. I worked with some awesome people there."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,nothing to say about a place that treats its employees like their working in a sweat shop. most of the time working at the place was a struggle to find hours
bad,"No Help"
bad,I worked at the Brooklyn Macy's store as a jewelry sales associate during the winter season employment and it was a travesty. The management was horrible and completely unprofessional consistently with no consideration for their customers time or their employees.
bad,Macy's managers only worry about themselves and would do anything to better their career even if it ruins others lives in the process. The benefits isn't that great either
bad,They work people at 36 hours a week without giving them a title of full time and don't give sick days. It was horrible. It is a giant cooperate company and they blame you for computer glitches when it comes to you schedule
bad,Applied and got the job. I was told to look online for hours. Every single time I would look for hours there wouldn't be any work. I left and applied for another job.
bad,"A lot a banter & does not make you proud to work there."
bad,Macy's is the worstest place to work for an I would never want anybody to work for them ever they suck two thums down worst job I ever had in my life.
bad,I worked here because i needed to find a job. i didnt stay long and decided to go back to school. i had to stock but the pay was not so good. i really didnt learn anything here
bad,just bad supervisor were asking too much or certain employee giving them full time hours when they were part time because they didnt want to hire new peple
bad,Since my work status was only temporary I can't really speak on a typical day. I worked in different sections of the stores depending on the availability of shifts which can be taken quickly leaving you sometimes with work available.
bad,"To be such a large company, Macy's management at the store level is poor and they were very inconsiderate regarding my work-life balance. The workplace culture was not good. People were out for themselves and did not want to help with your success."
bad,It's good if u wanna learn skills but don't try to make this a career.. My co-workers were great it was just some of the supervisor who don't want you 2 benefit or succeed if they are not benefiting from it
bad,"Early mornings, always on your feet, breaks are short, pay is low, short of staff, customers are rude, have to push credit accounts, tons of returns to deal with. Working on holidays. No skills acquired that can really be used within another company."
bad,"I worked Macy's at a time that was TOO FAST PACED for me. It was the holiday season of 2015-2016. I HATED the job. I never want to work there again! Yes it the store is accessible by bus,but I was not able to complete my assigned job duties to where I could be hired for a longer stay at Macy's. DO NOT fill out a job application for the Macy's company."
bad,"It was stressful, barely worked any hours. Expected a lot of work in such little time, no training, had to learn on my own. Macy's was not a great place to work at."
bad,Company treats employees poorly.  Does not treat employees fairly.  Discrimination against Asians.  Discrimination against women.  Steels commission.  Yells at employees in front of customers.
bad,"They work you like a dog for a little of nothing, then had the nerve to tell me I owe them for vacation time I took lmao, this place is a complete insult to character and a joke I hope they go out of business, because they treat their employees like their irrelevant!!!"
bad,Not suitable for anyone looking for in job advancement because most positions aren't permanent anyway. The store is so busy at times you're lucky to get a break via lunch or restroom.
bad,"Making their sale goals are their number one quota, which sometimes can reflect negatively on the employees if it's not met. Management was horrible. Sometimes, the work environment would be hostile and nothing would get done."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"unless you enjoy being over worked and under paid than run away as fast as you can. management is a joke. and with open sell at macys beauty department, enjoy the life or death stealing of petty sales."
bad,"Working here was horrible, the competitiveness of the staff and also promoting compensation for reporting wrongdoing from fellow employees is sick. You won't look forward to working here if you detest hostility. But still good for a start off position since it does look good on a resume for other jobs."
bad,"very political, strict dress code, didn't have the chance to do very interesting work. the Internship forces you to work on a project that they say will probably mean nothing.  This job is the number one reason why I'm not considering a very corporate environment."
bad,You get the phone interview they say it full time but once you step in for your first day they say it’s only tempt because there waiting for someone to come back. After 2 years.. before receiveing the job. Call H.R. before you go!
bad,"Macy’s was a sneaky lowdown place. They hired all of us until after inventory , then laid most of us off without telling us. I found out by going in the store to b"
bad,"I dedicated an enormous amount of energy and time while working at Macy’s for little pay. Management is terrible, they are constantly changing their minds about policies and procedures. The district team visits frequently, requiring associates to get the store in order creating a fake appearance of what the store really looks like. Managers are constantly asking you to work last minute due to excessive call outs. I have received multiple texts from different managers asking to work different shifts on the same day - get it together Macy’s! I would never recommend anyone work for this company."
bad,the hardest part about this job at macys is the fact that they are not reliable . I would get called in for a week doing 12 hr shifts and the next week they wouold have me out for about 2 until the need me again .I'm in need of something permanent .
bad,Once management changed certain managers were given their position just to give it to them and they let it get to their head and treated their team horribly
bad,You will be treated as a lesser person and worked lime a dog. They've had associates urinate in the shoe dept and let them continue working there. They don't care about their employees at all.
bad,the managers at Macys are absolutely ridiculous they don't care about what associates need help with all they care about is pushing for credit cards and they don't even know anything about the actual products
bad,Macys only cares about Macy's after peak you are nothing. You are nothing but a number to them. They definately have their picks. The point system they have is terrible. They claim they are a family oriented company well that has a lot to desire as well!!!
bad,"They never called me to tell me I got the job. They never called me to tell me to come do my training. They never properly trained me. They were never available on the job to answer questions. They never informed me that my position had been terminated, I only found out when my name stopped being on the schedule. Overall the worse job experience I have ever had."
bad,Great experience with all the normal customers simply getting to know them all personally is always the best and serving the public as a whole is simply a joy i find in life.
bad,"I worked at Macy's for 9 years only to be replaced by a friend of a managers, they did everything they could to get me to quit. Worst job i ever had.."
bad,Extremely high turnover no job security the company looks out for its own best interest not for its employees or staff. I would not recommend to anyone not even worst enemy.
bad,"back to back phone calls"
bad,"This was ultimately a bad decision to even join Macys.  They are so blind to the concerns of employees and business improvements that it became a joke amongst employees.  "
bad,"I was only a seasonal worker there for $9 an hour. The promise was to retain me after the holidays if they approved of my work. The training was very poor and I had to"
bad,"Company doesn't value employees, high exceptions, company would set dollar amount goals, and if you had returns come back it would put you in the negative."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"The company worked you to the ground, not enough staff and the management was poor. Supervisors never helped and are not team players what so ever. I would not work there again."
bad,"Yearly ""reorganization"" leads to massive lay-offs.  This company is desperately trying to hold on to market share against Amazon.  Common customer complaints about messy store and not enough sales associates."
bad,"I worked at Macy's North Park Mall Dallas,Tx the management sucks you'll be lucky to find a sales associates to check out. The pay is $9.00 hr you can not possibly live off that. You can do much better than this place don't even waist your time here. This is only a good job for a young kid to work to support there habit. Extremely high turn over job."
bad,"Management is terrible. It's a do as I say, not as I do type of place.  My boss took off whenever and expected us to handle the rest. Two full time asset protection guards and both new employees. Gave me a scheduled day off and then said I didn't show up for work! Really bad!"
bad,Not a fun atmosphere. It's a job that will have you doing more what than what is actually needed. Poor management and not enough communication. Employees don't really know what their doing.
bad,"Not consistent with requirements of associates.  The associates ran the store the way they wanted, not the way a Manager should want it run.  Not a good place to work."
bad,Was not for me. The hours were too short and I didn't feel appreciated by the management. I would work very hard and go above and beyond for the customers and when my supervisor tried to explain this to management they refused to acknowledge it and would not allow me to pick up more hours even if a staff member was willing to give me those hours.
bad,Long story short the management was HORRIBLE! Head managers gossiping and starting rumors. Creating a very confrontational work environment. Hardly any work days
bad,"The managers and supervisors working at the store are not very well trained and don't have good skills and knowledge. The promotion is based on the store manager's biased decisions which are not fair sometimes, because wrong people are recommended to be promoted. There is no audit or job transparency. For example there are people who can work extra hours and get over time from 10 to 20 hours per week and there are also people who can even get their full 40 hours a week. The store needs new management and strong team to fairly manage the store."
bad,Not a company you should feel safe in-drastic cuts every year.  Customer service issues with no help. You get the brunt of complaints.  Expectations/reviews did not change with less help.
bad,"What an awful place to work. The management is atrociously mediocre. The systems are from 1995. The systems went down on Black Friday and we had to manually enter prices with discounts. A lot of the employees are so stupid they didn’t even know how to do the math. They’ll hire anyone, one of the managers constantly harassed me, claiming my pants weren’t workplace approved. I wore the same pants trying at a 50 billion dollar life insurance company! Avoid this place at all costs!"
bad,"Poor management inconsistent work schedule at least in the location I worked at. One week they will schedule you 40 hours and then the next it will be 14 unless you're full-time. The managers don't know what they're doing . Benefits aren't great at all, its just not a great place to work at in general."
bad,Lack of proper leadership chain. extremely poor management. Severely poor wage/work ratio. Almost zero chance of advancement. Very poor work environment with an extreme lack of safety concerns.
bad,I was only hired seasonal but lack of advancement opportunities. Great business culture. Hardest part of the job was finding available hours to work. I was only hired seasonal variable labor this means i had to go online a pick all my hours.
bad,work is slow and the pay is low for how much you do. Management is rude and not understanding. hours were scarce and veteran employees are proud and get mad when you need help.
bad,"Low pay bad management and sloppy store"
bad,"Some managers will make counter productive decisions in order to save a penny (scheduling employees to work as little as 4 hours a week), and not think of how those decisions will effect future revenue in the long run."
bad,"I thought that Macy's would have a fair amount of daily activity, due to its name. However, it was very slow paced. There seemed to be no organization, structure, or room to advance."
bad,"Back when I was working for the company, it was not an ideal place at all. Things have supposedly changed, but I would never recommend this place as a place to work. The schedules are flexible, but that's the only pro about it."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Macys was a very stressful place to work in.  Management is very unfriendly qnd everyone was scared of our store manager.i do t recommend to anyone that is looking for a job
bad,"working at macys i had answer question about merchandise,showed enthusiasm with customers, recorded customers orders using computer system,complete all cash and credit transactions."
bad,This was a job where you could do what ever you wanted to. I dont recall being under direct supervision ever. The only people I was slightly familiar with was in human resources. I myself like to have a clear directive on my work and just milling around trying to find something to do does not work for me.
bad,Terrible company will never work there or recommend someone to ever work there mangers wasn't the best nor the employees I had to work with very uncomfortable work setting.
bad,Macy's is all about status and who you know. This job was not welcoming and everyone treats you as less if you've been there for a shorter amount of time than them.
bad,"I worked two Christmas seasons there.  As a non-commissioned employee the first year, it sucked.  The second year I sold shoes and made commission on $7/hour.  Pay sucks.  Dead times all the time."
bad,"This was one of the most terrible jobs that I have ever held, I would not wish it upon my worst enemy. Management expected too much, which I am more than capable of giving, but with so little direction that it was impossible to complete tasks to the satisfaction of anyone but my many pleased customers."
bad,macys is a good place to go while your honing your skills to do something else or go back to school. if you like working on your feet all day this is the job for you! also job turnover is very high.
bad,"managers were unfair and definitely had favorites, the store was very slow pace so everyone jumped on one customer, making it hard to earn a reasonable commission."
bad,"The majority of the managers are very condemning and play favourtism, including finding reasons to belittle your work role activity and will harass u."
bad,"This particular location, had poor management, chaotic environment. It was was very slow paced and segregated environment. It was a seasonal job for Christmas. I was offered full time but turned it down. To fad for little pay."
bad,All managers do is favor people and they are not on top of things and expect you alone to get everything done. Macy’s is suppose to be a nice well-known company but Stockton Macy’s do not make it seem that way. They take advantage of Macy’s employees
bad,For me I made the decision to leave when a co-worker made references and jokes about my heritage.  Made working with him very uncomfortable. The store was brand new at the time and that particular co-worker is still there.  I will not even shop at the store.
bad,"worst job ive ever had "
bad,again no proper work like balance. no room for growth or advancement. constantly ignored after multiple attempts to speak directly with management about relocation or advancement.
bad,I wasnt at this company for very long just seasonal but it was fun working there and if you earn certin points you receive rewards and money towards things in store
bad,Lots of favoritism and verbal harassment within the work place Have you work six day work weeks during October and December lack of work life balance.
bad,Its no fun being responsible for duties of several other fired employees due to downsizing.  Hovering Manager didn't help either. Mandatory  involuntary schedules during the holiday season is also brutal.
bad,"Terrible company with absolutely no opportunity for advancement. If you are not ""cut-throat"" and willing to perform unethical practices you will never make any money."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Managers do not care about you or your well being and will kill you if that's what they think it takes to get the job done but aren't willing to help without a frown.
bad,This is a terrible place to work. The management is awful. including HR. they threaten to fire you if you do not work on holidays even if you ask for time off. Management is awful. Terrible place.
bad,"This place is complete garbage stray and stay away from here at all costs."
bad,if you want to get into management at macys and you are a leader and you have your own opinion on how business can be ran macys will never promote you into a leadership position
bad,This is not a great place to work but that may have had more to do with management than Macy Inc corporate policies.  I would not work here in the future or recommend it to anyone who is seeking employment.
bad,"Macy's was one of the worst places I have worked. In order for me to pick up a shift, I had to stay up all night on Sunday-- until Midnight. I had to do this to call dibs on a shift before the other employees took all the open slots. Even waiting until the very beginning, there were barely any shifts available. I felt like I was gambling with this job, whether it was picking/finding shifts to work,."
bad,"employees were rude to customers "
bad,The managers only are about themselves. If you don't kiss their butts they will do everything they can to make you leave or fire you. Very close hates outsiders.
bad,"Loved my customers!  Built a little business within Macy's with repeat customers.  Many came back to ask for me.  Repeat business is the most enjoyable part of working at Macy's."
bad,"They look for any reason to replace you. I left work after clocking in to get a pregnancy friend a coffee in the mall because she could barely walk. They accused me of Time fraud for being gone for 3 minutes. And fired me, 2 years of work an not so much as not meeting my sales goal."
bad,macys is not a job that you would like to work at nothing is organized and you could never find a manager when you needed one. The general manage when you would see her she was shopping and looking at the different clothes.
bad,A typical day is dealing with irate customers and poor management. The pay rate is very poor therefore it affects the way you perform at work. You always have to do multiple jobs duties because there is never enough coverage in the store.
bad,This place really wasn’t where i wanted to work but they were hiring at the time and i needed a job so i said what the heck.I worked here until i started college the rest is history.
bad,I was part of a team that was eliminated with out notice.  After my department was eliminated we were not given an options to maybe transfer to another department.
bad,"Placing items and helping customers. "
bad,Micromanagement and no support in the fragrance and cosmetics department. Understaffed terribly because there was not enough management to help when you were having a problem and it made the customer upset and you often would lose the sales.
bad,"A typical day at Macy's would be working long hours standing. "
bad,Poor and ineffective communication. You have to figure out everything for yourself. You are scheduled every single weekend. The expectations do not equally measure up to the pay.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"A typical day at work; stressful, no direction from anyone...and then at times too much direction, making you be in too many places at one time, very confusing place to work!"
bad,This job Can be stressful.  If you like working in a call center it would be for you.  The benefits we're not so great.  There is a cafeteria on the premises.
bad,"Just a job, the pay doesn't equal the job title,  for what I make, I'd rather not supervise.  The amount that I make should be for the hourly associates. Macys is not as diverse as they claim to be"
bad,"nothing to said about it. I had a bad experience with the company. low pay, didn't really like management and staff, rude customers, didn't really like some of other associates."
bad,"It was very slow being that i was in the stock room. Some of the people higher up were extremely rude. They made my job unenjoyable and therefore i wanted to leave , which i did. I didn't learn much of anything there. The breaks were short and the break room was always dirty."
bad,"most full time employees are commission, so the seasonal hourly people are treated horribly. Very few team players. Most supervisors very unfriendly and most not helpful. I only met 2 people that were friendly co workers."
bad,"Working for Macy's made me feel like a slave. They rushed you and lunch flew by fast. They would have you everywhere. No good floor managers, and poor hours. You work all day for a seasonal check up to 240.00 dollars and that's some weeks."
bad,company is full of bigots and treat employees unfairly divides retail from cooperate and treats retail as expendable dont work for this company thiers no future in this company
bad,"Brick and Mortar , stay away, their focus is on survival in a new world of shopping.  One is just a pawn till they figure out what to do or just fade away."
bad,I did not like this job. Rude management. Had door slammed in my face. Locked in store before . Clear separation between staff members. Hours were given depending on who's been employed longer.
bad,"For the most part, they only have 12-hour shifts for warehouse floor employees. During these shifts, you will most likely be standing or walking with very few breaks.  If you are a seasonal employee, they treat you worse than regular (core) employees, who do have the luxury to stand around and work at a slower pace while the seasonal employees are required to work at a much faster pace and are tracked more closely to see how much work they are doing.  The pay is lower than other fulfillment centers. On the upside, you really don't have to think much when doing this repetitive job, and if your only seasonal, the extra cash comes in handy."
bad,this was a horrible place to work the management was horrible i didnt get any hours the management was mean to associates no way to move up in that company
bad,Macy's has no clue what their doing or how to treat their employees. its a joke. benefits suck. I've been there long enough to be sick to my stomach when I walk in the door. The directors upstairs have no clues what is going on.
bad,"your just a sales machine. not the best working environment, always a messy store, managers will treat you like your nothing but a tool. they dont care about you as a human being."
bad,Bad employer. Very stressful. Working hours are horrible. Inventory counts until 4AM twice a year. Company did not treat me properly. Corporate policy is horrible.
bad,"-Management was so unprofessional"
bad,Not a good   environment management has no management skills at all just backs manager yells at u like ur his child and also made me even cry a few times while being at work that’s how nasty they are and don’t even pay ur rent working there full time
bad,"Goal Oriented"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"The work day was horrible. I learned nothing. Management was unorganized, there were 20+ managers. The workplace was confusing, sometimes you wouldn't even get a lunch."
bad,you do your job and you get fired. Sure the availability is perfect for home life. they ask for too much with little pay. Bring up something back a year ago and part ways with you.
bad,"The location I work at has snooty works. They pride themselves on being the most sophisticated branch, but they act more like middle school students than full grown adults. They also send out messages to let you know what your place is if you challenge the nature of the environment. It's oppressive and I wouldn't recommend it."
bad,Macy's Warehouse in Joppa is a terrible place to work at.. the management is terrible the entire warehouse is understaffed and filled of rude employers.. typical day of the job was fustrating the managers do not know how to talk to you they treat as if you are slaves while they have too much favortism. there are people sleeping in the break room while they yell at people who are actually doing their work..
bad,A typical day of work included picking up lose clothing and returning them to their proper place. The managers were very rude and played favoritism. Hours usually depended on whether or not they like you not work ethic.
bad,"Management, pay, hours, and work pace was poor. The main problem with working for this company was the direction to constantly push credit cards without explaining them in full to customers. I personally thought this was morally wrong to try and talk people into a credit card without explaining the dangers of credit to the customers. Management was constantly telling us to push the Macy's card to customers even if the customer said no multiple times. Management praised pushy and annoying cashiers for talking unwilling customers into Macy's cards."
bad,"Poor management, poor communication, short staff, store so busy trying to save money, which means lack of customer service, no career advancement , lack of proper training for management, favoritism in work place, no recognition for good work"
bad,"Horrible management, horrible co workers, poor pay, no advancement, horrible hours, too many cuts, hard work is over looked, again horrible co workers, horrible management"
bad,"waited on tables "
bad,"Typical day is always learning, always changing, management in great, culture is diverse, hardest part is what you make it, enjoyable part is helping the customer."
bad,Honestly everything they do sucks asss they don’t communicate they blame you for everything sooo it’s honestly pointless to work there. Sometimes they would even let me take my breaks
bad,Employees never worked together. Everyone had to be better than everyone else. You are just a number here not a human being. No training. You are forced to learn on the fly and teach yourself.
bad,This job had me eating cereal bars in downtown Minneapolis.  I had to leave the city due to lack of money and Macy's policy that you could only work there while employed.
bad,Macy's is a good company to work for for a first job or seasonal work during college.  The turnover rate is rather high for being a retail store. Business is very slow all the time
bad,"All the employees in the back got treated horribly, the manager has poor management skills and had to have employees working there for years tell him the run around in the company."
bad,Good luck working your life around the crazy hours you'll be working at Macy's and management won't accommodate you at all and doesn't care. You're child's sick and you need to leave early to pick them up.. to bad.. you need to take your sick dog to the vet.. to bad. You can use one of the 5 ptos they give you and call out but you better make those 5 pto's count because that's all you get for the year. Also you only get 5 vacation days per year! Lastly the only thing the manager's care about is you opening credit and making sure they micro manage you to The fullest.  The pay is horrible and Macys considers 29 hrs a week fulltime.. you dont get a living wage nor enough hours to survive. Could go on and on but basically what I'm getting at is that Macy's does NOT take care of nor value their employees at all and no I'm not a disgruntled x-employee.. I still work for the company but am just being honest about some of the things to expect if you're thinking about working there. Best of luck.
bad,They have terrible management. People are very disconnected in their communication. They continue hire people. The people they hire they do not treat them right and working there is the opposite of an opportunity.
bad,"I disliked everyday I was there. I worked only to survive, fresh out of college. Macy's is a great place to learn how to work with people in a group to get big projects done. Management was most of the time HORRIBLE. Rejects with power issues. There was no workplace culture, there was only work to be done. You learn that customers are unreasonable and terrible most of the time. As a young person with no money, the holidays is a great chance to get hired, work loooooog hours, and get paid minimum wage for your hard work. Minimum wage is adequate because it's a skilless job."
bad,"little hours 4-15 hours a week, on call job!! Unload and loading trailer all by your self. Slave work. management is terrible, doesn't tell you when your working, your expected to know everything. no training whats so ever"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"management had no idea what it was doing. very low paying job, no support and no direction forward. worked hard for little benefit. not worth applying"
bad,"I love the pay but the hours are so long, the supervisors are very rude, not professional at all. I understand long nights everyone is tired but since it was so crowded everyone was rude, some badge scanners didn’t work. It was a very easy to get to point a to point b"
bad,"Too many chiefs to do a good job, they all seem to have their own thoughts on how things should work. Newer ones think they have new ideas, but end up being the thing the store tried before and it felled. Managers hired from in store where they were sales associates, get big egos and the associates will not respect that person. They should trainsfere to another store. "
bad,"Just a seasonal part time job that was very stressful and demanding with heavy lifting. I enjoyed the hour lunch and working independently. However didn't like that the schedule was crazy all over the place and they wanted us to start way too early in the morning before the store even opened. Overall, I was glad when I quit. Pay was terrible being $8.50/hr."
bad,Don't pick shoe sales commissions ! Just trust me . There are so many managers constantly hounding you for different reasons . Rude and entitled people!!!
bad,"worst job ive had. was very fast paced. you get very little time to have bathroom, smoke breaks. was let go from the job for something that I didn't even do. there was no looking into what happened just please leave the store sir."
bad,Horrible management doesn’t know how to treat workers. Managers doesn’t work they sit around and not do their job. The pay is horrible oh really don’t get paid slot and then you get paid weekly.
bad,"Wasn't the right fit for me. I worked long hours for barely any money, I also felt like the manager gave all the late hours of the day as well. I was glad was able to go back to school and stop working."
bad,"not for me I didn't, like the slow work pace and no active movement.. there were so many weeks where I would only get 12 hours throughout the whole week..."
bad,Very few hours only a job for teenagers or someone starting out or going back into the working field.  The upside is employee discounts and selling incentives.
bad,"Lots of stress, never enough staff to handle customer flow, prices changed from morning to evening due to specials, the hardest part of the job was dealing with lack of respect from Store Manager, she had poor people practice skills."
bad,"Manager was very inconsiderate. unorganized, rude! no room to grow within the company staff are underpaid for work that they do. i hated working here they did not care about you r personal life. if you could not do what they needed you to do they did not care. i would never recommend anyone to work for macys at willow grove unless there is a new manager, supervisors etc."
bad,I was new and the majority of the time was left alone to figure out how to work the discounts and the register. As well as management never picked up the phone when I called.
bad,"bad management cosmetics very unprofessional, lack of experience, pore judgment, no knowledge of product,  lack of communication, pore leader, selfrightious..."
bad,Crazy hours. Lousy pay. High expectations.Management is the worst. Employee moral is horrid and laughable.   Horrible environment. Don’t care about sales. Only about selling credit cards and CUST needs. Feet killed me.
bad,I would not recommend working for this company. The concept behind most of their rules and principles are sound but they are not carried out well. Most of the time the employees get away with murder
bad,I was hired and they forgot I worked there. Called me a week later and said ops! Would you like to work.Worst job I have ever had. Management has no idea about what there doing.
bad,"Just poor, management, experience, payroll. Alot of back stabbing,  no appreciation for hard work. The store manager was vindictive, and had her favorites."
bad,Store is filthy and merchandise is disorganized.  Counter space for employees is cluttered and you can’t find anything.  Macy’s only seem concerned with pushing credit card on customers and less concerned with the makeup of their stores and merchandise.  After working here I now understand why Macy’s is losing money.  I use to be a shopper because of the the deals but I will be giving my business and time to Nordstrom.  Macy’s pay is not competitive compared to other department stores and the only store worth going to is in NYC.  Very disappointing company to work for.
bad,"Highly stressful, cutthroat, huge pressure, unreasonable working conditions, managers constantly looking over your shoulder, only advantage was employee discounts on merchandise"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I did not enjoy working for Macy's at all. It was not fun or a good environment. Some of the employees that I had to work with were not friendly and were very stuck up and rude to me and to some of the customers. My overall experience working for Macy's was terrible and would never go back to work there again. I definitely would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"Hard to find parking upon arrival. Then a cattle-like herd to get to your work area. Long line just to clock in.  Vague threats from manager (basically you NEED this job so be careful). Stretches? Then off to work. "
bad,The company has high expectations and did not want to train nor pay no one. No one seems to understand the process and how to forecast the daily budgets. The culture is that productivity out weights everything even safety.
bad,management had favoritism all the time. also hours suck even though we had alot of work load. I wouldn't  recommend people to work on the support team cause they get treated like trash. the company doesn't really care about them even though they are the ones that make the store look nice when the sales people just stand around and do nothing but they are the that get all the credit.
bad,"working in sales was a job i could do, but not a job that was permanent some can do it but some people can not the stress of trying to sell credit cards to keep your job is horrible."
bad,"the only reason I stayed past one summer of working thru college was because I got along really well with my department manager and I just enjoyed working for her. otherwise there isn't much respect and help to associates, they are left for themselves to figure things out."
bad,"macys was very unorganized, you apply for one job and end up doing 5 different jobs with no extra pay. those that spoke up were let go under the pretense of not being a good worker."
bad,"A lot of drama, no manager, no organization. The people I worked with where not very nice, would talk about customers on the floor. It was not a good environment."
bad,"Retail. NO life, time to your self. You are a slave to the business. You have no time to your self. On a regular basis you there is an outrageous goal set by incompetent ill-trained managers."
bad,Don't work for this company. Highly under paid for the work you do. Employees are not disciplined as they should be and management is only focused on money
bad,The Management didn't take care of their people there was always favoritism in my department. they never listed to there employees they promote people who are lazy and not the hard working ones
bad,Macys in Bend Oregon is a terrible place to work. The managers are rude and mean and over paid the little they do. As an emloyee you are way under paid and even though they offer benefits those don't work on anything. This is a terrible place don't work here.
bad,Be there before the store opens and stock the area that your assigned to. Set up displays for sales. Move merchandise from the truck to the backroom of the area that you are assigned to. Help customers with questions.
bad,"This company doesn't care about its employees in anyway shape or form, they are an awful company to work for and I don't think I would ever recommend them to any one."
bad,"garbage lack of communication, management are young kids on internship who don't know anything about security. the flag ship store is the worst those guards are not even guards their more like brand ambassadors  ."
bad,Macy's managers do not care about their employees and give their employees no work/life balance. Pay was unfair and employees are treated very poorly.
bad,"oh well not really.  this made me to do this review and i kept daying no, so doing this to get passed this point.  stop making people do this.  I dont"
bad,"Poor management, horrible pay, terrible treatment of sales associates.  Managers mistreat their associates, no restroom breaks.  No praise for a good job done,  only worried about their store numbers."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Over worked not enough pay, if your not in cosmetics don't even apply. They make the most money and if you work in clothing you'll be paid min wage with no commission. its sad"
bad,The commission departments are very challenging and the management doesn't stand by your side.  They seem to have a click and well that's unfortunate.  I did my best to work hard and know I can live with myself.
bad,"I found my time at Macys to be very unpleasant.  I quickly found that Macys pretends to care about it's employees but really only cares about their profits.  I was a supervisor in the collection department and was given a cookie, literally a cookie for being part of a group that collected 1 at least 100K for Macys."
bad,Nobody Cared everyone was very passive aggressive and rude very cut through never clean you cant advance there is no growning here what so ever its just a starter job
bad,"Working for Macy's is a pain.  They actively try to screw their workers out of pay, benefits and job advancement.  The pay is poor with no benefits to speak of."
bad,"I used to enjoy my job. Sadly that has changed due to changes in store management and company policies. The company doesn't provide enough hours or help to get the work done. It's extremely stressful. Management is not supportive,yet expects us to support them. It's all about making them look good to the company. The staff is hard working and deserve better pay and benefits. Without these people the store could not function."
bad,This is a decent job if you're a teenager or someone who doesn't care if they're going to be doing mindless work all day long. It's your average joe job.
bad,"nothing to do usually just fold clothes or roam around."
bad,"good as a starting job but not for long term. the employees are full of drama and the managers are disrespectful, they also push way too hard about selling macys cards"
bad,"But they beef up their staff from August to December.  (From the big back to school season until the end of the holidays in January.)  After that, they shrink down to nothing.  The number of people on the floor is pretty full so unless you have been there for a zillion years really the only way to get a promotion is dead man's boots."
bad,You work a lot and do so many things for nothing. They don't give you a race. They don't let you succeed in the workplace. Macys is a place for starters.
bad,"Employees told horror stories and complained.  Mall owner/management created hardship for employees by moving parking far, far out so employees coming into the store in the early hours walked across a dark parking lot.  It was unsafe.  My manager never communicated with me.  Total lack of communication between management and employees and also mall management.  Everyone complained.  Store has high turnover."
bad,the management was terrible no consideration that i am a college student and i need some flexibility. The system is very confusing. Had too many requirement for a part timer. it crazy.
bad,"Poor management "
bad,they over watch their employees like crazy. thats all i have to say. blah blah blah i don't know what else to put. i wouldn't ever recommend this work place to anyone.
bad,I worked here for several years and in that time was unable to advance because of not being able to get people to sign up for credit cards. I worked here when the economy was at its worst and had a very hard time convincing people to worsen their credit with this awful card.
bad,Macys has a lot of their priorities messed up and it can cause an associate added stress especially if you're in school just looking to make money to help pay for school etc.
bad,Pay rate is horrible. Management as well is bad. Employees are disrespectful and working conditions arent fair. Need to improve in pay rating. As well as better management
bad,"Horrible place to work!  Management is a joke!  I knew more than they did,they had no clue how it actually worked on the floor.  They wanted me to do things that did not pertain to my job particularly, clean up after other lazy sales associates."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"The company is continually changing things.  However, the changes were not for the better.  Lots of ""politics"" with management.  I would not recommend this company to anyone I know."
bad,"You will be taken advantage and feel this is the worst job you've ever had"
bad,"Poor Management, schedule was often changed by managers without notice and regards to your personal life"
bad,There is a TON of inconsistency at this place. The managers tell you to do one thing while another one walks by you and tells you to do something else. Highly stressful.
bad,this was the worst job i have ever had in my life. terrible management team.... the store was always untidy... it was a waste of my time...i had to leave
bad,The customers were rude and they threw clothes everywhere they never cleaned up after themselves. The managers had their favorite people. They were always unfair and pressured you to open multiple macys accounts.
bad,"the pace was slow they was disorganized when it came to how everything was ran, including if someone stole something they wanted you to act like a cop umm no thanks not in that pay scale"
bad,The whole management was fake and they would find a stupid excuse to fire you. They would lie to customers.  It wasn't the best experience ever. Even all the people I've talked to hated working there.
bad,terrible place to work. Horrible HR department. Horrible management team. inconsistent hours. Short breaks and decent pay. No guaranteed weekly hours.
bad,It is an okay place to work did not give any flexibility for me for drs appointment (I had found out I was pregnant while working there) and did not like that I had morning sickness and sometimes I got sick at work
bad,Macy's was a drama filled place that was miserable to work at. When they cut my position the moved me to another position but lowered my pay. i was over worked and under paid.
bad,worst place i ever worked. The company has no loyalty towards its employees. The shifts always included working all holidays except Christmas.all they were interested in was production
bad,"Beware! I worked at Macy's for a couple months and during that time I was never fully trained on what task they wanted me to do. When showing up to work for my scheduled shift the door was locked numerous times, leaving me out of a shift. With not even so much as an apology. They hire you on with the understanding you'll be working 20 hours a week, only to be told later you'll be working at most 12 hours a week. Will change your schedule that has already been made then not even bother to tell you. The best part is they have a point system so if you miss a day of work you lose a point. I went from 9.5 to 5 points due to the door being locked and me being unable to work. All I have to say is apply at your own risk because the managers are absolutely terrible and unorganized."
bad,"Macys was a great proving ground. Not only did I learn how to put the customers first, I learned how provide quality customer service. Therefore I appreciate and respect Macy's"
bad,"If Your Really Competitive This a Right Company "
bad,"If I could give Macy's NO stars, I would. "
bad,"working in the makeup industry was fascinating and fun, it was the lack of management in the area and store I worked at that actually made me not want to work there any more."
bad,It's a great environment and good benefits . The management really sucks they have no control what's so ever and employees fighting over sales . All they care about is making sales and opening credit cards .
bad,"During my time at macys I learned retail and sales at a fast paced, the culture was no sufficient for growth, both me and my employer benefited from the contract of employment"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Macy's is easy to get into. The pay is decent for the physical work you put in. Nice for to have for the holidays. Not my ideal career path, but it works for some people."
bad,I only worked there for about 3 or 4 days because it was on-call and it wasn't told to me until after I started working. I also wasn't allowed to pick up shifts and wouldn't get called or scheduled either for several weeks. I also did not receive any proper training and all I was doing was helping out people in random departments instead of receiving formal training on what needs to be done and when.
bad,Managers watching you and not being professional alot of favoritism the company is losing money and they are desperate for customers you are not allowed to talk
bad,Managers are unprofessional and favor certain employees ... They are never available to handle employee issues or do their job. The management is very unorganized
bad,"Not enough hours, poor pay, not enough to even dare to make a living. If I were to work for Macy's I'd probably end up being in the streets. Need to increase the pay and give someone hope with working for this company."
bad,"They suck. Period. I used to go the extra mile to get my job done. Not only were the customer's rude, the employee were not smart at allll!!! Aye I dont even want to continue. The best part is the beautiful females that work around the make up and perfume area. Haha"
bad,"The managers are terrible, they never know what they are doing and they are all abusive of their role. The company over all does not care about the employees. The schedule flexibility is the only upside. But the shifts are long and drain you. Its modern day slavery, they do not pay people well and they simply make it a horrible environment to work in."
bad,"So I started the job at a lower pay that they posted, worked hard yet it was never enough for the management.The walk so you could go t lunch could sometimes take ten minutes and they were on set times so you would just have less time for your lunch and would be marked late if you don't come back on the exact time."
bad,This store has closed now. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and my coworkers. Macy's is about making magic with their customers. I enjoyed the fast pace.
bad,"Its just such a horrible place to work I cant even explain it. If you end up working here you will see what I mean, and good luck. Just a horrible hostile working environment."
bad,"wasn't the job for me I'm glad i quit management was rude they didn't care about the associates only the money, staff is also rude and don't believe in working in teams ."
bad,management there needs to be better because anytime there was an issue they would ream you for the problem. they were not friendly to their employees or customers.
bad,"You have days where you wish you can be swallowed alive!"
bad,"I always used to shop at macys, it was my go to store before I got a job there. I was a seasonal hire that was promised a permanent job once the season was over and reapplied and got approved only to come to the realization that it was all a lie. The managers are rude and not helpful at all. The schedule is made by me at the times I have available to work. Management sometimes just schedules you without asking you if it was okay, my coworkers were probably the worst thing about that job, they are very competitive and never let me help a customer out and would yell at me if I stood around shadowing them in the beginning of my training. The only good thing about this job was the hour long lunch I had every day."
bad,"macys has many differnt departments to work in. the most enjoyable part of the job was taking a break. working at macys is alright, the manaement isnt that great, the work there is overwhelming, and on a typical day you are so busy that you often times dont get time to realx"
bad,I have learned what it takes to get what you want in life. It is important to work hard and understand that time management is important. Dealing with customer service has taught me how to deal with individuals on a professional basis.
bad,"I don't understand how macy's is still in business.It is very badly managed: we expect you to make this square peg fit this round hole,we will not give you the tools to do the job properly and we want it done yesterday"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"If I could give this company a 0 or negative number I would. This company cares NOTHING about its employees. They are paid below average wage of fast food workers, and demands much more of them. Managers are nothing but workhorses, expecting 80+ hours worth of work from what they are typically scheduled. Hands down one of the worst companies to work for."
bad,"Never helped with new employees, Kind of threw them at everyone else. When needed to address a problem, managers weren't available. Low Pay, Bad hours and non organized."
bad,"If you are looking for a summer job this is it. But Macys is not a ""job"" for people looking to make a proper living. Macys works on a rotating schedule which basically means that you will never make more than 15 to 20 hours."
bad,I did not enjoy working here. Management was very unhelpful and so was Human Resources. It was hard to have any good training because no one wanted to help.
bad,This company is falling apart from the inside out. The reality is that brick and mortar stores as suffering nation wide and Macys is no different because its failing to change with the market.
bad,The companies sales goals were unreachable by the entire store. Management spoke very condescending to their employees and did not value their employees.
bad,"Managers are unfair,They show favoritism and allow certain people to stand around while  hounding the dedicated employees treating them like prisoners. They would constantly force us to give discounts which the managers deny when asked by corporate.Instead they terminate loyal employees when they are questioned about stores revenue loss. Would never recommend this place to work especially Friendly Center in NC"
bad,"The way they treat the workers at least in the receiving department is very poor, having mostly young managers inexperienced leaves poor treatment and poor accountability."
bad,You are under compensated and expected to the work of 10 people while the people who make double digits barely do anything and they get away with it too.
bad,Awful. Company I wouldn't work for them ever again treat their employees very poorly do not appreciate people or hard work and expect you to sell sell sell
bad,"It is very hard to connect and build a team when management keeps changing in the store. In the short time that I have worked at Macy's, I had five department managers. As well as three store managers."
bad,"no room for advancement. same day to day job no growth in wage. no benefits, scheduling is difficult, favorites is a factor. management had no idea how to do their jobs"
bad,"When a guest enters my area or department, my first and most important responsibility becomes to acknowledge, greet, and engage that guest."
bad,"Meeting and making a connection with customers, asking questions and listening to shoppers' needs, then giving options and advice on meeting those needs. Inspiring the customer to buy, celebrating the purchase, and creating a lasting positive impression of you, Macy's, and the purchase. Ensuring that fitting rooms are ready for customers by promptly clearing our merchandise and returning it to the proper area of the selling floor. Maintaining selling floor presentations, and restocking them as needed. Learning Macy's systems and procedures to enhance selling efficiencies and complete support duties. Handle all returns courteously and professionally. Responsible for achieving personal sales goals and Star Reward goals. Maintain a professional attitude with sincerity and enthusiasm reflecting Macy’s commitment to our customer – the most important person in our stores."
bad,pay isn't that great and they cant afford to give enough hours to everyone. only 12 hour work weeks. I wouldn't apply or work here again considering the work avaliable
bad,"absolutely the worst place to work, customers and coworkers are rude. Managers often missing in action, hours are terrible if you're on call or part time and no benefits."
bad,The company is not a great company to work for you will get no hours. I did learn how to unload the truck. The hardest part of the job was making sure everything was done on a set time.
bad,Extreme lack of management. No job security if the district decides to change. constant pressure to get people to get a credit card and if you don't you can lose your job.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,All workers are underpaid(minimum wage) and definitely over worked. Management never communicates w/ one another and when insane customers have complaints the managers agree and talk smack about you to the insane customers! they say they have opportunity for advancement but it takes a while and the managers usually only pick employees they're friends with so its b.s.
bad,"I'm going to keep it short because there really isn't much to say about this place. The management was horrible. Absolutely no support. Trying to change shifts was beyond a dilemma. If it weren't for the nice coworkers I would have left after the first day. I'd never recommend anybody to get a job here, it's a joke."
bad,Macys is a company that also has a high turn over rate. There quota to meet is not unattainable.  They make it to where you dont have a chance at all to make it anywhere in tge company to advance
bad,This company sucks! i worked  there for over a year and it was completely miserable. Not enough hours given.Short breaks and the pay sucks. managers were unprofessional.
bad,"Macy's provided me with no hours for a whole month and a half. And when I do get hours they aren't substantial enough to provide for anything except the fare to get there and back. The managers can never be found when you need them. Lastly, you never get any type of training they just throw you in and expect you to know what you're doing."
bad,I worked at 2 different Macy's in the 4 years I worked for them and encountered the same difficulties in each location. Macy's does not pay a competitive wage compared to other retailers for the same position. The management is also disrespectful and is not willing to train and grow their associates.
bad,"Stress, uninformed, no one cares what you think."
bad,"No organization, Need better management, need better benefits, not a stable job, and workplace is multitasked with little pay. Need better work environment improvements."
bad,"schedule changes made with no warning, forced to work in departments other than the one I was hired to work in, not allowed to leave until supervisor says job is done"
bad,"The managers were rude and not helpful. They would always keep me from going to my break. I wasn't given the hours that were promised during the interview, much less the pay that was promised too.They will act nice at first and make it sound amazing to work there with a decent pay but don't fall for it. Its just below average and disappointing. Nothing enjoyable about working here. Not worth it."
bad,"pay is terrible "
bad,"I do not know what is happening with this particular location, but the job culture seems to be leaning towards favoritism and force out all of the old employees through aggravation. Moving up seems to be impossible as positions are created out of the blue and eliminated without notice. Management seems to be non existent at times and floor staffing is rather sparse. The culture of the job is gather gossip about people and spread it around the store. Raises are mediocre and are an insult to the amount of work put in. Hours are really hard to come by in general. Another major problem is the lack of prioritization of duties as everything is priority and everything must be done in one day."
bad,"The management was very unprofessional and immature. Never had any workers but never wanted to make me full time. Lots of drama and so much work for just $9? I worked 50 hours one week i had about 15 hours of overtime, the friday i got paid they deposited two amounts into my account and it turns out they took taxes out of my check and the overtime too! I was heated this is the worst place to work, mainly the galleria location. don't do it!!!"
bad,This company is on the way down. Management is despicable. They lie they pay very low and treat you horrible. Long hours for minimal pay. No benefits. And management is corrupt.
bad,Long hours on your feet; they don’t really help and when you ask a question about anything they look at you like you’re dumb. And management can never be found when you need them.
bad,"Managers are unprofessional!!! They care more about the managers and costumers than their employees. The department i was in, was handbags and Its the worst experience ever!! Its super slow and no one cared for the deparent.. besides, most of the employees are ugly and non helpfull people and managers still dont do anything about it!!!! Working at Macys was a complete nightmare and wouldnt recommend  to anyone!"
bad,"This is a great job, if you like being sent home 2-3 hours into your shift during the off season. I was just a seasonal employee, but was having issues getting hours in November. It would seem that a place like Macy's would be in peak season in November-December due to the holidays"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,This is probably one of the most inflated companies in the world. No one needs an $800 puffy coat. Working in a Macy's warehouse is like being on an extremely tall mountain with very thin air. Every year they  hire more and more people for seasonal work which makes the air even thinner. There's favorites all a crossed the board and people who get away with chilling in the bathroom or walking around doing nothing all the time.
bad,"They treat there employees like trash , no room for growth. Management does little to communicate . There terrible to there employees. Pay is awful. They get rid of you without a hesitation or not give you any hours to work. I would stay away from this company"
bad,Macy's is never ran right. Customer service is so bad. I worked a short month there and hated every minute of it. Employees are mean to each other and the managers don't do the job right
bad,"Retail is a tough business, however when an entity is run like a chop shop good talent will definitely leave quickly.  There was favoritism with the GM and it just wasn't a place to work.  The pay was commission with a draw which was set up in a way where the employee was actually paying Macy's to work there because they were taking all of your income."
bad,"This supervisor in women shoes is rude, nasty, mean, and a bully I think it's really oxymoronic when someone like her is being a hater and blocking you from making sales when you making them look good I mean starring at me everywhere I go on the floor always calling my name like she trying to pick an argument she makes work hostel and a bad vibe"
bad,"Working at Macy's sucks. No customers, no paid time off, they don't use you, and you don't get paid much to do absolutely nothing. Don't work here not matter what."
bad,Not a fun place to be at. I did not enjoy the customers or the staff. Management was all over the plce. Tons of people would never show up to work so your stuck to do all the work in more than one department.
bad,Working in sales is not fun for anyone. Please stop making me answer this. This was not a good enviorment to work. very stressful and cutthroat did not give support.
bad,"There are no hours and they are always short on staff. The job is very demanding, they will ask a lot of you and you won't get anything in return. Meaning, no raises and switching to other departments."
bad,The management was ok. The work day was very short most the time but when the Holiday season came around I had long work days. When I did have a longer shift I had a great lunch break.
bad,"I only worked their a short amount of time , the time that I worked their I gained some work experience but not much , The management team wasn't so great."
bad,Bunch of wannabe tough guys that will flip on you.  They dont back the associates or managers who have done great work for them.  Obviously this is why they are going out of business and closing stores everywhere.  They expanded too far and spread themselves thin while forgetting to take care of their own.
bad,Be Ready to be in one position for 5 years before advancing. The advancement opportunity is terrible here and it feels like youre replaceable all the time.
bad,Working there was a experience but if you are trying to make ends meet don't bother. If you want a career don't bother it a place for students or retired people who don't have to worry about money.
bad,"Most managers were no where to be found working out on the floors, or even at all if they were ever needed for assistance. I was basically told what to do at the beginning of my shift with the bare minimal supplied needed to complete the given task. The employees were nice, most minded their business and just clocked out at the end of the day. The supervisor was a bit diva-ish and would very much so demand of you what she would like to have done and in what way."
bad,"Jr department the worst , stressful , bad management to work in  not enough staff to help out .  Not much to grow from . The most messy and worst department ."
bad,"A star for Macy's is too generous,you ought to have a minus system.Horrible company.Inept management on and on.The only thing that kept me going was the people I worked with and I actually like the position.Awful company run away from it."
bad,Never work at macy's. They take advantage of all the workers and the hours and pay suck. It's basically slavery. Unrealistic goals they want you to fulfill and its all about opening accounts which sucks.
bad,Dont work at macys its low pay and they show disrespect to there workers. Maycs os not a place where you would want to grow in life.maycs will tell there works lies to make them think that everything is ok when its not maycs is a really bad place behand the scenes.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,The worst place I have EVER worked.  Store Manager and Cosmetic Manager have NO clue what they are doing.  They are not helpful and can not answer any questions you ask. The cosmetic manager ask what you think she should do about situations. They are the most unorganized people I have ever met!
bad,Macy's is in big trouble and you can tell by the non existent staffing and the revolving door of associates.  Most days when I come to work I cover 2 different departments alone with out break or lunch coverage. Customers are frustrated and so am I.
bad,"difficult hours, horrible management, low commission, bad traffic. I cant think of anything else. the only reason I stayed was because of lack of experience. I treated that place more like a stepping stone."
bad,"the pay was terrible, but it was fun working here. I didn't get too many hours, the people weren't too friendly. i wish they gave more hours to people who needed it"
bad,Nepotism runs rampart at the local level. Office personal is all related on way or another. If higher up wants the job you hold for one of their family or friends you will be fired.
bad,The best part of the day was making friends with the coworkers. I learned to fold clothes and make people open more macys account. I learned that some people do returns without receipts. Rude people. horrible scheduling.
bad,working at macys was very bad cause i had to work over night and they would paid very little and there was alot to do in that store because customer drop there clothes very where in the store
bad,I would like to get back to clerical.  You stand for your whole shift and some customers are nasty  Asked to work part time but scheduled for full time
bad,"Worked 10 hours a day in 4 days, it was very stressfull.  Picking heavey purchase to pack and ship them, by the end of the day my feet were killing me"
bad,"I absolutely disliked working for this particular facility. the pay was not good for everything they had me doing, the hours were horrible and the management only scheduled me once or twice every two weeks"
bad,A typical day was a 12-hour shift a day with managers that do not know how to manage. There is no proper training or schedule when working. The managers will criticize a person for not doing a small task but when someone else is not doing their job at all. No one that works at Macy's is reasonable
bad,I really enjoyed interacting with people and did like the fast paced environment.  The management was not good at all.  The hardest part was standing.
bad,"They are only out to make money, they don't care about their employees.  They tell you one thing and then do another. They expect alot out of their associates but give little in return.  Not the best company to work for."
bad,"no support, no benefits, inconsiderate company.  training is for 2 hours on how to use the cash register and there is no shadowing of the older  employees, you are expected to do the job on the spot"
bad,we didn't get paid that much money i get 117 or less some weeks unless its a holiday you won't get paid that much. this was my first job so i thought my pay was normal until i showed my friends my check and i found out i was being payed little to nothing
bad,Managers lack sensitivity and too young.  They need Emotional intelligence not just academics. They hire just to hire.  Very uncreative place lacking entrepreneurship skills.
bad,A typical day at work would vary on the sales occurring as well as any overtime hours that were needed to do (which I enjoyed doing).  I learned not only a lot about myself but a lot about other people and how to deal with customers both good and bad.
bad,One of the worst job I have ever had the displeasure of working at high stress no benefits. Managers were highly incompetent any critiques or suggestions given were ignored. This company only cares about one thing and that is money and credit.
bad,I Kind Of didn't enjoy working for Macys because people were rude and that was mostly why I didn't really enjoy working there but I did enjoy helping others
bad,"And as such made it difficult to attend school at the same time. Work consists of managing a section of the store, in my case it was men's fashion. You have to assist customers, work the register, stock items, and make the floor presentable."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"This store is horrible. The management is the worst I've seen and I have many years of retail experience. Department managers aren't familiar with the culture or products of their department and that causes major issues. Specifically, cosmetics."
bad,Terrible company to work for!  Overwork their employees till they burn out.  No compensations or raises after 90 days or even a year.  Money hungry manager who only cares about herself.  Most of the employees steal (especially the ones that have been there for a while).  Not a good temp job or full time job
bad,"There was no management and min-wage pay. Depending on your union rank, you are not always guaranteed to work in the department that you are assigned to and you don't always know if you're on the schedule until a day in advance."
bad,"Do not apply for this place. It is absolutely the worst place to work for. Managers are horrible, the customers are the worst. Never again will I work here or recommend this place"
bad,"The managers would never come to your every need. They also had there pick and chooses. Would never give you a break, would have to request it yourself."
bad,"If you don't get the ""loyalties"" aka people signing up for credit cards the management team will treat you like you are nothing, because that means the department is not meeting goal and also they won't get their monthly bonus."
bad,"Management are bad "
bad,"Unless you are completely desperate, do not work here. Employees steal, management is rude and condescending.  They pump you up to want to provide excellent customer service, but give you NO tools or time in which to work your ""magic"". Tons of meetings and rallies for nothing. They are full of..."
bad,I would come in we would have meeting and then start off scanning things and then price or move things around. They were very picky about timing though.
bad,"Product line went downhill,transient management,and listless management.they are closing several stores,and deservedly so.poor merchandise quality,poor management,etc."
bad,"great learning experience, greet customer, assist the customer in any help they may need, make them feel comfortable so that they would want to come back to the store."
bad,no hours. management plays favorites. no growth. the best things was not working weekends on support team. tho support team was rarely invited to meetings or given any rewards or perks of the job.
bad,i enjoyed working for the macys company but the supervisors did not communicate well with the employees. also the way the hired on and let go was not well
bad,"what can i say thats already been said about retail positions. The pay was bad, the hours sucked. Loss prevention manager accused me of being ADHD and demanded i go to a dr, it felt very unprofessional there."
bad,"Dynamic workspace. Nice salespeople, hard workers. You have to memorize a lot of things which also change on almost day to day bases. The shifts can be or way too long or too short."
bad,"High workload/minimum wage job. Someone who can focus all their attention in this job might be able to pull a good amount of money. They have an attendance system on which you need to log in and out when you come, leave, or go on break. "
bad,"Working here was an absolute nightmare. The hours were horrible, the clientele was either extremely snobby or extremely up-tight.Working here is the biggest reason I will NEVER shop at a Macy's."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I worked as On call merchandiser, BUt after a year of working they didnt make me regular, I never had 40 hours a week. And needs more improvement with management and operations."
bad,"This is not a good time for retail at big, department stores.  The entire field is in transition, trying to figure out how much of a physical presence to have that will preserve market share.  Staffing levels is a major challenge right now, with most shoppers complaining that they can't find anyone."
bad,"Working full time at Macy's is hectic, long hours. Management is rude and condescending to younger coworkers. Management and security spy on employees"
bad,Macy's screwed over a lot of people. Macys knew they were going out of business and kept hiring people so they could help shut the store down. They made no mention of this and threw everyone to the curb at the last minute.
bad,"Very un organized never pleased the employees , HR was never around for help, wouldn't recommend this job to no one. Benefits are not good when having a family"
bad,this company also had a hectic environment and did not work with employees. management continued on you to manage a fast pace. very tiring and not worth the pay.
bad,the customer threatened me one time my boss told me that it was cause i offended her. they treat employees like garbage. Never shop there. Their customers are gross.
bad,managers will lie to your face and spread rumors about you to other associates even though the manager has never spoken to you. extremely unprofessional.
bad,"I was hired late in the holiday season because of my experience. I started part time in January 8-12 hrs/wk and then later rehired as full time in February. I was hired as full time. I felt my training was incomplete, it didn't include enough practical training. Other than a few,  most associates did not want to help with many questions I had. I felt I was dangling in the wind. A few times I did reach out the answers given were wrong. It was all about selling Macys cards and pushing numbers. I became very disinchanted with the management. I couldn't wait to work for Macy's but unfortunately that soon changed."
bad,never stable enough hours. lots of sharking of sales from each other. union fees made it hard for college students to pay while maintaining hours. called in for absurd amount of times to cover shifts that should have been given in the first place
bad,"Managers are not respectful to people trying to do there jobs, they are rude and think that the company belongs to them, Horrible need new people to come in and clean house.  They talk about everyone behind their back even people that claim to be friends its a joke."
bad,"The managers are lazy, expect you to do all the hard work and then take the credit for it. Understaffed, so you sometimes can not take a break or your lunch and will sometimes have to stay 4 hours after your shift has ended because of lack of scheduling."
bad,"I myself did learn much a great deal from working for Macys, I also enjoyed working well with awesome fun co-workers, which made the work space that much more fun."
bad,"There is no work life balance. Your entire future, life, career depends on the opinion of a single person-your boss. You can be the most loyal, hardworking, dedicated employee but if your boss does not sign you off you will be stuck in the same spot."
bad,"So so, sucks they dont teach you anything, temporary, they fire a lot stuff like that ig. It's a job i wouldnt have minded working there but it was seasonal/."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend Macy's to work for, I regret working for this company please don't waste your time it's a set up for failure. A very disrespectful and place to work for."
bad,"I would highly recommend staying away.  Culture is cut throat as well as their points system for time and attendance.  Commissioned based sales with hard goals set and expected to meet. Company is closing stores and restructuring.....Associate discount is a joke as they take the 20% off on the back side. You have to apply for a Macy's credit card or other ""Secured"" debit style card in order to get the discount."
bad,The number one thing bad here is there management do not care about the employees only the self they are not leaders they are bad managers especially the store manger. He comes out as someone who wants to be intimidating
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,i enjoyed it while i was working there and ever nice people and wouldnt mine working for them again.every hard working people there and learnd alot while working for them
bad,It is a decent job. Management is not the best. The chain of command is very bad. Your co workers are usually just as inexperienced as you are. Training is very sub par as well.
bad,fast paced environment. lots to do especially on the holidays. ive learned to take my time helping costumers more and work much better with co workers around. the hardest part is keeping your patience with both employees and customer. the enjoyable part of the job is making connections with the customers and getting to see them satisfied with what they've found at the store
bad,"There isn't much room to complain since it is retail, but Macy's can treat their employees better. Especially after all the money they make. Just because it's retail doesn't mean the workers have to be treated with disrespect"
bad,"A typical work day is very busy with different tasks at hand, senior mgt is not helpful with transition, only if you are not a minority you will be go far in this company."
bad,"Like a lot of big companies, Macy's doesn't care about their employers. They made my life way more difficult than it needed to be. On many occasions, my own manger wanted me to do her job while she sat around doing absolutely nothing, and I got in trouble when I politely told her that not a manger. When the day got really busy and my department was under staffed, I'd call a manager and ask them to send some people to help, they would either deny it or say they would, but never will. And of course, that led to my department falling behind and getting yelled at."
bad,"You basically teach yourself everything. If someone does have to show you how to do something they get mad.worst job ever, looking for another job now"
bad,"macy's was one of the worst places to work for the pay was very low, the breaks were not on time and sometimes not giving per the CA lobar laws in place."
bad,"A long boring day of sheer repetitiveness is what that job severed me. Terrible management. Rude co-workers with nothing going on. Everything was terrible for me. The most enjoyment I got was walking out of the door after a long tortuous day,"
bad,they treat you like dogs and family discount yay right its literally only immediate family like the woman that raised me not my mother but because she was not my guardian growing up she didn't count her my step sister lame place worse decision i ever mad never shopped here since
bad,The job gave you no help and everyone was stressed out and not friendly. I hated being there. Management support was minimal.
bad,Management really suck they always find a way to benefit them. Doesnt really care about there employee . If your not apart of the union you dont get a raise or bonus.
bad,too many managers and little pay. and you only receive benefits if you're full time and when you're full time when i was working there they made your scheulde according to when THEY needed you and use to tell me the business comes first. Care little for employees
bad,"The job is Retail so decisions are not based on what's best for the employee, only what benefits the company. No work/life balance whatsoever. Poor benefits. Low pay."
bad,Everyone who works here is stuck up . Old people who have no lives and have horrible attitudes. Poor management . Too worried about making friends and not enough worrying about better pay . Sucks place to work do not work here !!!! All they care about is making friends!
bad,My Experience at Macy's taught me responsibility and customer service. I learned how to build clientele and how to maintain relationships with my coworkers that created a great environment to work in.
bad,"A lot of claims that they will accommodate you, but honestly they won't. Say goodbye to any social life you may have or may want to have. Upper management is all about numbers, and they don't care whether you work 2+ weeks straight."
bad,"Got hired right away which was cool. I don't see why they ask you when you are available,  instead they should just ask you which 2 days out of the week are you available. They give you nothing of hours. Manager is very condescending, just says little to nothing about what they need done and leave,  no supplies unless you ask and then they get annoyed. Discount system is a joke. If there are no lockers for your belongings you have to carry them with you wherever you go."
bad,Worst must uncaring company about their employees ever worked for.  Employees are totally disrespected and allowed to be mistreated by management and customers.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,They was not for it's employees. They do not give insight on the oay or the insurance and if you donot go into the employee portal and read the do's and the don't you will not know until it comes up
bad,The co workers and the discount was the only good thing about working for that company. The hours suck and everyone is on call expect for a few that are part time. Their really unfair with merchandisers.
bad,"We were either overrun or dead, the store manager never left their office, don't even know their name or what they look like, the management team is full of hypocrites, who are rude to customers."
bad,"long hours for a litlle money "
bad,Lack organizing new people been registered are updating information on and how they can place with the rite company to not make them look good and not bad...warehouse work pays good but they talk to like if you are a robot not good for the company  are agency
bad,Pay is bad and the hours are bad. Some managers are but most don't care and don't do their jobs. Some times you only get 18 hours a week due to lack of work.
bad,"Worst job ever employees would mess up other departments and nothing was done about it. No growth potential none what so ever, unprofessional."
bad,"Macy's is the worst place to work for. They don't care about you. You give your all and they praise you for two seconds but once somebody in management they look up an excuse from 5 months ago and fire you. Nobody is happy working there and complain all the time but nothing gets done and the customers are the most rudest, greediest and mean people who cant figure out a computer to shop on."
bad,"I have no cmment.  It is not a clean environment.  You feel as if you are a object.  This is all I have to say.  I have no problem in working in a environment that teaches me something, this one doesn't."
bad,In my experience this company has a very negative demeanor in the way they manage which makes for poor employee moral as well there is no job security just google the company and you will see the coming of an end of an era for macy's sales are tanking I believe due in part to not pying associates enough and poor management which in turn becomes poor employee performance.
bad,"When you first start they treat you good and praise you for the hard work. But they pick and choose the employees they want on the team, then they stir up trouble to make you look bad, force you to quit because of things they bring up."
bad,Worked there almost half a year. Training was almost done completely while working with live customers. The tenured associates were given special treatment like work off the phones to sit and chat with management and supervisors and gossip about agents. The company promotes job advancement then makes it difficult to find out how to move else where. Management and supervisors are lazy busy chatting and gossiping all day long.
bad,"Nice coworkers and I had a really nice counter manager but the salary was unlivable, no job security but I did learn a lot. Clinique as company was amazing."
bad,"Worst place to work for. You in competition for customer, you hate to go on break. Because co-workers steal your customers. You can't call out or have any emergencies. Because there system is based on points. So if you have serious illness and have to go to the doctor a lot. Then you should not work there. They will fired you in a heartbeat, even with doctor's note."
bad,always making sure the patients are well taken care of and seen on time. Things can get very hectic sometimes and our job is to remain cool and keep the peace
bad,stock sales ran the floor sets changed out plans help customers not to structured not to much respect no. meet many new people
bad,"I enjoyed the people, my position was eliminated after 23 years of service.  I was able to work my way up from sales associate to HRM.  Enjoyed the work I did"
bad,"Poor, prejudice management. No one communicates. They make this job sound so exciting, but there are no bonuses in place for this position. The people that get the money are the store detectives and supervisors. Half the time, the store detectives aren'the in place when you call suspicious activity out. Waste of time. Macy's would rather hire someone from the outside rater than promote fro within. Theread is  one opportunity for advancement even if you are a model employee. Try another department. This one sucks!!! Just here until I finish school then I'm out!"
bad,"I worked there for 5years and they never promoted me.  Also I'm still payed minimum wage,even though I worked hard to excel in their goals."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Completely disorganized & not a lot of support from senior management. The co-workers are great, people are there to help you don't you can't count on management"
bad,management is un orderly and no matter how good you work as a seasonal employee they will never ask you to stay on and will find ridiculous ways to fire you.
bad,Former cosmetics Manager is a rogue manager.  Hired her friends and the store manager was also a rogue manager.  Employees sucked and some thought they were managers without the label.  Many uneducated people work there.
bad,"If you are looking for a job that pays for the amount of effort you put in then this is not the place to look. You will find out how dishonest this company truly is during your first week on the job, and if that is not a turn off then the grueling conditions that you will face in the stock room definitely will be. Overall I would say keep looking unless you are extremely desperate."
bad,"The Company had issues, it brings you in on a promise. but never truly delivered. you got (1) Shirt,(1) pair of pants. and no real training. just told to report to a supervisor, who was no older then your child. given a tour of the site. and a (Good Luck) Buddy kinda feeling?"
bad,Not a lot of hours available and no opportunity for growth when required. Communication with the customers were the best times. Assisting the customers with their shopping ideas.
bad,"my first months at work i was enjoying it until they start changing managers, they don't care about employees, they don't care about people and they are so rude with employees cuz we as employees we are also costumers where we spend part of our paycheck to buy and they dont care they treat us like we are nothing had the worst experience ever and dont recommend this job for nobody and the environment is really  toxic and the store manager is crazy and rude. Macys lakeforest mall!"
bad,"very poor communication , rude and disrespectful management, terribly selfish and greedy company, inhuman service. same rude customers everyday and uncomfortable work environment."
bad,Omg where do I start! The macys in hulen mall is absolutely terrible! My supervisor quit and we ended up getting the supervisor from ridgemar mall when they closed down. She cut our hours and started hiring the people she worked with at her other store. The pay sucks! The only positive is the discount. That store is sooo old so many problems so many safety issues no one cares l!!!! Please run away from macys in hulen mall.
bad,This place is the saddest company in all of America. They care too much about coupons and deals so they can't afford to staff the store properly. Makes it a terrible experience for the employees and customers.
bad,"A typical day at work:"
bad,"i rated this company all in 1 star because this is how we are rated when we did the best performance after a customer concern is done.. Entering the world of macy,s was such a challenging and exciting role being a call center agent(Customer Service representative) for there you would learn exactly the value of patience, same as well the virtue of  setting goals to uplifts one's performance. And at my account you could feel mutuality, teamwork, associable with your higher associates."
bad,"They don't pay you enough, and there isn't enough people working to clean up and put things away.  There are too many supervisors and there are so many meetings."
bad,"Macy's in general was a very complicated and difficult place to work for. The ever growing turn over rate made life there difficult. The days were often unorganized due to constant change of upper management. I always met my deadlines, but it was not easy. My co-workers were lovely and I have continued my relationships with them.The hardest part of working there was the constant under staffing. The most enjoyable part of my jobs at Macy's was working with my teams and the customers."
bad,The worst. most unorganized job i have ever had. The management does not know what they are doing and nobody ever shows up for work
bad,"Great shift. Poor professionalism in work place. Robotic routine, excessive work administered outside of job description. Immature co-workers. Most enjoyable part of the day was punching out."
bad,"Bipolar management and draconian sales tactics. The only winners are HR, who have little to do with the insanity that is the sales culture  of the company."
bad,There is no respect for your schedule. They will call on you day off and nag you to come in. If you are working they will harass and nag you to stay longer.
bad,"many job requirements"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Not a good company to work for at all. Very judgmental.. The owner doesn't allow criminals to work for this company even if your case is 1,000 years ol.s"
bad,this job is run by greedy snobs that don't give a single care about you. one single bad customer experience and you're fired. two years i put myself wholeheartedly into this job and it was for nothing. never appreciated or recognized for any of my accomplishments
bad,Not the best place if your American. especially in NYC. 3 different times at two different locations and the same results.
bad,only get 10 hours a week.  hard to get excited or up to go to work.  Not the most interesting place to work.  trying to be pro active to get more hours
bad,I work on a on call basis. There have been cut backs due to the store not making profits and my hours have been cut back to no hours in last four months.
bad,All the managers here are on a power trip. All the people who work there that are not managers think they are and want to boss all the new people around. It seems they only want to hire part time people who are able to qualify for the credit card because it is a way to get their quota up. Then people spend their little paycheck in the store. If you don't qualify for the credit card and don't spend much in the store you do not last and they stop giving you hours.
bad,Brick and Mortar Stores are a thing of the past.  The stores are dying and willing to step on the associates to stay alive.  Disorganized and unrealistic work expectations.  Productivity standards that would work for a properly setup new store.  But the old stores which were not designed to handle the volume and growth over the years are suffering.
bad,The management has no idea what they are doing and they have no respect or appreciation for the employees. There is no room for advancement. Even if the management sees that you can move up they will throw you lower. Overall the worst work experience and the worst place to work at.
bad,"Macy's was awesome. I enjoyed assisting customers with questions about the merchandise they were inquiring about. I also welcomed tourists with genuine answers to their questions and interest. We had great opportunities to move up in the company and were awarded discounts and ""Macy's money"" when goals were met."
bad,ive worked for this company for 4 years and the mangers and supervisors dont treat the employees good at all. The store manger is always rude and nasty.
bad,Working  at Macy's is a horrible experience. computer training then out on your own with no guidance. no commission for season workers and the hours weren't great. Barley made money.
bad,Full of catty women whose main focus was one-upping you and taking your customers and sales. I enjoyed my customers but the women I worked with made coming in a nightmare.
bad,"for a multi billion dollar company, they are horrible to their staff.  i worked over 5 years and they could not be bothered to transfer me or  to make sure I was employed until a transfer was done. "
bad,"I'm sure Macys is a great place to work, just not for me. It's way too big and often confusing for my liking. I don't even like shopping there because of the size."
bad,"No job security, bad management, no benefits or compensation"
bad,"Working at Macy during the holidays is a workout. Customers will constantly bully you over coupons. You also have to put back returns constantly while having to help customers at the same time. After doing this for a while any person will tire out. Now that is not allowed because management will hound you to ""walk faster"" while making fun of you with comments such as ""you're the slowest person Ive ever seen"". All of this with a smile mind you. After a couple of weeks dealing with this you will wish that you never took the job and cant wait till the seasonal work is over. But this is not he end because if you get food stamps, the welfare office will ask a for a letter saying you are no longer working there and guess what they wont give you that letter so now i guess you stave. Remember its the magic of Macy's."
bad,Managers in macys are highly irresponsible from loss of items customers purchased. to having Inappropriate relations with coworkers to fighting and threatening customers on a daily basis.
bad,Very unprofessional managers and HR members. Not worth the pay or time! They do not value the associates and are always thinking of ways to put them down! Do not waste your time here.
bad,didnt learn anything. everyday we just stood around cause there was nothing to do. coworkers were great. management sucked
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,No typical day. Nothing but cashier. They management show favorites to they same race if anybody who not they're same race want to move up they wouldn't give us the spot or don't give us a chance only they same race I seen it before. Co-Workers disrespectful and not good workers.
bad,"I enjoyed working in the cosmetics/fragrance arena for over 25 years in sales, management & also on the vendor/representative side as well. I've worked in almost every major dept. store from mass to class (Sears, Penney's, Broadway, I.Magnin, Neiman's, Barney's, Nordstrom & Saks) & finally, Macy's, last year from May- Dec. I wish I could say I saved the best for last but I'd be lying. The common thread shared by many former employee's is the awful scheduling system that Macy's swear by. It has either to many or not enough staff most times & asking for addional hours falls on deaf ears or you are told its not in the budget, then you will see 2-3 new hires with no experience who have better shifts/days then you with years of experience. Also the lack of customer service skills or training is clearly evident in lazy coworkers lacking motivation who do the bare minimum amount of work. Talking to a manager is an exercise in futility because they have absolutely no follow through & no communication skills. Since they are never on the selling floor they're clueless to your frustrations or will dole out another broken promise. The worst to me was the lazy & stingy coworkers who would rather throw away gifts, testers & samples than properly using them to increase sales by giving them to customers or even fellow sales associates. It was a very disappointing chapter in my retail career."
bad,to much work for the little amount of money to many things to do working for free is not cool to much for those sill credit cards
bad,It is a pleasant retail environment. Some Management harassment issues by department Managers is covered up by the General Manager.
bad,"no benefits, messes with your money, decreases salary, switches positions on you without notifying you and the supervisors are catty"
bad,The job consist of working varies hours dealing with different customers helping deal with the shopping needs of the customers daily.
bad,"I was hired as seasonal and although I was aloud to put myself on the list for hours, they would always take me off of the schedule so I wasn't aloud to work."
bad,Everyone working together getting along helping one another .working together helps the day go by smooth and faster time goes by quicker when everyone works as 1 and communicate
bad,Working here wasn't too bad schedule wise but it was not a work environment that I felt as though I could advance or gain new experiences.
bad,"Poor Management"
bad,"Macy's is the most cheapest company I ever seen. They want customers to shop there so bad that they are willing to let customers return items from over a decade ago . Try reselling a dried up moisturizer!! They don't care how it effects your sales, however , if you don't meet your goals they are on your back. I worked as a counter manger for Clinique which made my job even worse. Clinique's  management and Macy's management never got along which made it worse to plan anything. The vendors work against you while Macy's just leaves you to fend for yourself. Once your fed up they are ready to blame you for anything and everything. Their scorecard ratings are annoying and unreasonable. The customers are broke and the force Macy's cards down your throat. You have to wait one entire to qualify for their terrible benefits. If your in a location like mine that requires you to pay for parking don't expect to be reimbursed."
bad,"I worked at Macy's in Brockton,MA,the worst job I ever had.The managers were horrible, the customers were horrible,and the pay was embarrassing...."
bad,"all i have to say is the location in el paso, tx is just an overall bad Macys's.Management there is really bad and they treat their employees awful.. when they are about to get a visit they yell last minute to get everything in order.. management is just in the office taking it easy while giving everybody else orders."
bad,"Interviewed for a part time seasonal sales associate. At the end of the interview the lady informed me they actually had no open positions. I drove out there for a position that they didn't even have an opening for. Apparently they do this for when other employes quit..I guess they have a hard time keeping their associates. "
bad,I come into work not knowing where I'll be working that day. I didn't learn very much all I learned was how to make a display and restock product.Management was awful there was no one to be around to supervise. I had no coworkers to ask help of. Not knowing what my position was or where I was supposed to work.The most enjoyable was being able to go home.
bad,The Valley Stream store is the worst store.  Management manipulation of employee schedules and commission compensation.
bad,"This is a terrible place to work, while I was there 3 people died of heat exhaustion. They never fixed the air conditioning to prevent more deaths."
bad,"This company is a joke to work. For because for the pay, you are expected to do everything. Don't take seasonal work... It pays worse."
bad,"It's very easy to get a job in Macy's specially on holidays. Every job is very easy to do and you get a chance to meet a lot of people. Employment is 100% chance and earning money while not doing your job is also 100% chance."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"It is a commission based job upon which employment there is almost totally contingent"
bad,"horrible company fired me for not rotating the cameras while telling me to complete other task.This company is shady and do not pay. They will have you completing all types of things thats not relavate to your job.Everyone is having inappropiate relationship in the workplace. If u recieve a complement from someone higher in the company your co workers get jeolous and spread roomers that u are sleeping around. Than u have other coworkers that will try to get you fired because they want your position. My experience and work ethic is far more greater than this love shack company. "
bad,"management was god-awful. all about numbers, its just a game. no advancement and job politics are strict. nothing fun about this job and pay"
bad,Macy is a good experience to shop and work. Macy's is one of my favorite store to shop and very successful. A good balance to work with your co-workers and managers.
bad,"The only bright spots were some of my coworkers. Otherwise, everything about this job was awful and it had an extremely negative effect on my sense of self-worth and my health. Was so relieved when I finally moved to another company."
bad,"The store I worked at had fantastic management. Leadership was a word that was unfamiliar to the higher echelon and it was one reason I left. When concerns were voiced, they were ignored. When the store manager said the store would close at a certain time, he ignored his word because the company said to remain open even after the majority of the customers had left and the store spent more on electricity and worker pay then profits compensated for."
bad,"In Macy's I learned alot as a beauty advisor. I started off as a on-cal associate and I worked my way up honorably,I learned how to professionally apply make-up on my clients and do weddings, special occasions make-overs and I would do little workshops to teach my clients how to apply and get the look they wanted. I went to beauty school and got trained how to do massages as well. The hardest part of my job was recruiting because their were other lines but once my customers tried the products they were pretty satisfied of the benefits and quick changes."
bad,"this is a retail job where it was not the best work environment. management was very unsatisfied, i rather not say anything about this job."
bad,No management skills. Supervisors hard to get a hold of. co workers lagged in energy and professionalism. Employees did not get any encouragement or guidelines.
bad,showing jobs available in winston-salem....went for interview and was told all positions filled.  Wish they would have called and told me.  could have saved me a trip and getting ready.  Not very professional at all.  Better check before goin on interview....may save you a trip.
bad,Macys is and continues to be a great place of employment. One is able to train and advance within the company. Macys complies to working with your schedule and is passionate in making sure their employees are satisfied just as well as the customers.
bad,"Bad Experience based on lack of management support from start to finish."
bad,"Wow. Id rate lower if I could. The company plays games with their hiring process. The interviews they give are a joke. I went thru 2 and didn't hear from them for 3 weeks then get a call out of the blue for another interview for the same position and no record of the first! I know they dont give full time, like to lay off, and have a bad atmosphere in store. The staff hound you thru the store to buy into their reward cards and their credit cards and to top it off their store stock is grossly overpriced - in short, couldnt pay me to buy a pack of gum from their store"
bad,"macys treat their customers great, their regular employees great, seasonal employees aren't really welcomed by regular employees they are very rude and bossy. management really favors you if you've worked there already. no support, not welcoming, and I would never work nor shop there ever."
bad,"I learned great interpersonal skills, how to learn and think quickly on my feet, organized efficiency, and how to work a different operating system (along with other methods of technology). I would say the most enjoyable part of the job has been my co-workers. Other than that, this place pays the absolute minimum wage, makes no effort in supporting or caring about its employees (the corporation), you get a quarter raise depending on how you rate as a sales representative, there's barely any commission to noticed within the paycheck itself, there is continued pressure within the work place (and they are never satisfied, even if you manage to fulfill all the goals in one day), and they keep tabs on you like you're a child. Oh, and they force you to open a Macy's account as part of the ""application"" process. Basically, you're lucky if you can keep your sanity and not turn into a raging alcoholic. You're luckier if you've found another job to replace this one and never have to come back."
bad,Worst company to work for because of management and pay. Customers are ghetto and they expect you to treat them like gold.
bad,managers are unprofessional and disrespectful scheduling is the worst and you work on base plus commission and base is usually minimum wage so most of your pay will come from sales so if you can talk and sell this would be a good job for you
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I worked in jewelry vault 2 years as seasonal holiday worker ,POOR. MANAGEMENT NO COMMON SENSE SHIPPING DEPARTMENT WAS SENDIND OUT WRONG ITEMS THAT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE WHEN IT CAME ACROSS MY WORK AREA I NOTIFIED MANAGEMENT AND THE SUPERVISOR TREATED ME BAD SINCE THAT DAY,BECAUSE IT SHOWED SHE WAS INCOMPETENT OF DOING HER JOB,REPLACING AND EXPENSIVE ITEM WITH A SALE ITEM NO TELLING HOW MANY WWENT OUT!AFTER THAT I WAS TOLD NO MORE WORK! Then i got called and hired permanent for weekend nights $15 hr this was crazy for 3 weeks i only had 2 days work how could i consider my self permanent with no hr after roming up and down the stairs from 1vault to another trying to find something to do I WAS TOLD MY SERVICES WAS NO LONGER NEEDED ANOTHER SWEATSHOP FLOODED WITH INDIAN MINORITY WORKERS WITH NO EDUCATION AT ALL!!!!"
bad,"I would only 4 hours twice a week, I learned the value of customer services and working with great department. Management needs to work on communication skills with their staff."
bad,"they ask you to sign up for work , to receive tax Dollars from your employment only for the books. Where it benefits them to have a certain number of people receiving state benefits, they compromise the individual, and get tax breaks on their behalf."
bad,"There were always too many people scheduled to work in commissioned sales areas. Most people worked for less than the current minimum wage in the commission sales area. Making commission was barely possible with there being such a large number of associates working in an area at a given time. They do not comply with your stated availability and often schedule employees for shifts that are not in accordance with the agreed availability that they stated upon being hired. They treat their employees like children and try to motivate them to make sales goals by offering them candy of all things. One good thing about the work environment is the kind disposition of the managers. They were always really nice, but on a professional level I would have to give this company a low rating. My apologies."
bad,Processing merchandise to the floor. I've been in this field already not really much to learn & as far as advancement no one has time to coach & train associates. Hardest part of this job is the workload & time constraints; best part is interacting with different people both customers and employees.
bad,"Your day begins with the organizing of the store, greeting your customers assisting them to make there shopping there a great experience."
bad,"My experience her was not good i would not recommend this job to no one, managers was never doing their job and personally i think they need a hold new system."
bad,Most enjoyable part was helping the customers. Friendly co-workers. Did floor recovery and sorted clothes and put them back. Management was terrible and liked to gossip. Horrible pay. Never had food or beverages for us. Always asking us to stay later than what were scheduled. It was like they were forcing us. A lot of people have quit here. Including a few managers. There just wasn't enough help. Very tiresome. Management thought we were Superwoman and men.
bad,they have zero respect for their employees. The location is appalling and managers have nasty attitudes. i would not work here unless you are desperate.
bad,I can not think of many good things. I like my coworkers.  The pay is bad. They assign way to much work for the small salary.  It is good to work around your schedule but not as a steady income.  Do not expect great things from this job and they never listen. Everything is your fault.
bad,boring place to work at. very poor pay managers are never on the floor. left due to lack of communications. dont bother applying here
bad,Macys is a awful place to work ive learned alot from when i worked there but the just over work and take advantage. Their also vary unorganized. Not a good experience.
bad,seasonal employment during the holiday season.  not full time employment.  great coworkers and staff.  would definitely work here again.
bad,"Unprofessional, seems more like gossip hour rather than employees focused on work. Many people stepping on others' toes unnecessarily."
bad,As a beauty consultant i worked on a commission based salary that was very beneficial when i had the hours. The work environment was very nice and had a lot of different people to work with. I learned a lot about skincare and beauty products
bad,"I believe this place is lacking management, not providing enough training, and not paying enough wage. I have suffered for that short period of time which I was employed that I have no intention to go there as a customer any more."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I enjoyed working for Macy's I will say that pretty much every position you work in there is opportunity to grow and have a real career in that position.
bad,"This job was seasonal, I learned customer service                           skill as well as cashier. I would meet greet assist and make my quota on a daily. At times this job can become stressful in some situations but I learned to treat customer with kindness and usually they give in"
bad,"What can I say? Horrible, low pay, management doesn't know how to schedule always short staff. Management is horrible only one of the assistant managers truly does her job and need to take her talent elsewhere. As for the other managers they know how to hide from work and love to stay upstairs in the office away from the public. This location truly needs an overhaul in management."
bad,"Managers are rude and expect you to do way too much for the amount of time they set for you, even the supervisors agree on it. I learned that if you kiss up to the managers you can get away with showing up when you want, leaving when you want, texting while on the sales floor and not doing your job efficiently. Management made their favorites based on who would talk to them more not the work they put out. Many female coworkers spent the time gossiping and not working or texting on the sales floor, being rude to customers and getting the entire group in trouble for their mistakes."
bad,"Get to work and begin to unload trailers of store items. Remove items from boxes and wrappers. How to receive items. Transfer items between departments. Manager was rude occasionally. They were upset with the pay and amount of work. Only making 8.75 an hour, trying to pay my bills with that. I got along with my coworkers."
bad,I rather keep the mean things to myself. If your store manager actually cares about you then you will love working there. I just work there. But you will have customers who actually makes your day at work. I've met some wonderful customers there.
bad,Personally i feel underpaid for the amount of labor required from me on a day to day basis. There is very small room for improvement or advancement.
bad,"I loved working at Macy's, until they laid me off at the end. I loved the coworkers and honestly loved the managers until the end of my seasonal assignment. They are such a screwed up company. They notified me at the end of the assignment that they WOULD hire me on when positions opened up. It has now (at the time of writing this) been two months and I haven't gotten a call back. Not to mention that, I recently walked in and there were several new workers. My manager insisted that there were no positions open. Obviously there were if they are calling new people and interviewing and hiring them."
bad,Worst company I have ever worked for treated people awful did not care about family life............................
bad,"this company is ok. I was paid little to nothing however, I learned a lot. if you want general experience this is the place"
bad,"Dedicated 8 years to this company only to be laid off and offered a new position at minimum wage."
bad,very stressful and unfriendly place to work. Managers are very rude. The scheduling system is the worst if this was my first time working in retail I would've been forever scarred
bad,"i would say gm come in punch in then start cleaning up the store waiting on my manager to give me my task for the whole day, help out the customers as the enter the store take my first break then help out with layaway and the gift wrap department then take my lunch break after lunch i help out with the cash register for a while then go to the shoes department help out there before punching out to go home, what i like most about this job is getting my work done and helping out my co-workers when need be"
bad,Everyone is nice get macys money when you open up star rewards credit card and also they reconize hard working employees
bad,"Horrible atmosphere, lousy pay, no benefits, lousy hours, little chance for advancement, a lot of pressure on uncontrollable events"
bad,Does not treat their employees well at all.  Very low pay and the benefits are expensive and not worth it.  They do not value their employees at all.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,If you are looking for a job that you can just turn your brain off to do this is it. As long as you are willing to take some abuse from customers and management it's really not too terrible. Nothing out of the ordinary for minimum wage pay.
bad,"Over work their employees. "
bad,Very disappointed with this company. Management was horrible. A lot of favoritism. HR did not do there part in protecting the employee.
bad,"I was hired by a very good manager and the first supervisor I had was very nice and helpful. He was a man and didn't hover over you or micro manage you.  If you needed help, help was given.  I was then asked to work in another department, for a woman supervisor, whom I liked.  Her co worker would come into our area and tell us what to do, and tried to take over for her.  I think we all felt very torn between who was really our supervisor and the lack of direction.  It's a classic case of the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.  I worked for cheap and the dressing room attendant made more per hour than myself. If you had a suggestion, and it made an increase in sales, someone would get upset with this and either change your suggestion without warning, or during the morning meetings, the store manager would try to make you look ridiculous for even suggesting it and call you out in front of other employees.  The worst, was employees notoriously calling out sick on One Day Sales and leaving you short staffed, underpaid, and frustrated."
bad,I worked for Macys during the holidays and sometimes during the summer. Overall Macys is a place where I would communicate with customers. I learned how to deal with customers no matter what type of attitude they may have. I had the type of co-workers that would assist you if you were having problems with finding merchandise or any other service you may need. The hardest part of the job was standing all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and being able to be of service to them.
bad,Poor training of associates and management. A large lack of integrity hinders productivity and company moral. Difficult to get benefits that each associate is entitled to receive.
bad,I went to work everyday with a plan to meet as many new customers as I could. I really enjoyed meeting new people.It was just a milestone to get to wherte I want to be in life as far as the beauty industry.
bad,"Macy's is unfortunately not a good place to work.  The store is terribly understaffed, the fixtures and old and decrepit and during one the coldest winter in history the store had no heat.  I would not recommend working there."
bad,It is a fun job. But it doesn't matter how much experience you have or how good you are. Unless you become a favorite early you never will be. That also means you don't get recognized as a person basically. Little training. Little pay. Horrible hours. And a culture of making you feel less than.
bad,"I was excellent at my job at Macys . I worked closely with co-workers and always exceeded my goals. I  was in charge of schedules , motivating  and striving to make counter goals.  Sold fine watches and repaired them. I loved my customers and enjoyed the people I worked with."
bad,"The management here treats their employees horribly. They say they care but they really don't. All it boils down to is numbers—they literally do not care about the wellness of the employees. They don't make it a ""magical"" place to work. They don't pay you enough to do all the things that are expected of you. This company is run by cheap skates and cheats. They cut positions because they don't want to pay their employees. The demote them. "
bad,Hard to advance within the company. Work/life balance is terrible. Had more knowledge of the job than my supervisor. Was not pleased with culture of the office.
bad,"The worst employer I have worked for.... Ever! Definitely do not recommend. You can be the best sales person or manager, but that won't matter at macys, you will always be treated with disrespect. Macy's only cares about their bottom line, not their employees"
bad,While working for this company I was hired as a seasonal cashier. I applied for this job to make some extra money during the holidays. It seems as if the management didn't communicate with the employees. I felt extremely belittled and unimportant to the company the entire duration of my employment. This was a total bummer because I really developed strong relationships with my customers and enjoyed helping them out.
bad,"Very demanding with very little pay. Sometimes very rude customers , and their ""cashier goal"" system is ridiculous. Not only do you have to compete to get the job but you have to compete with other employees to keep the going for prolonged period of time."
bad,"Meeting and making a connection with customers, asking questions and listening to shoppers' needs, then giving options and advice on meeting those needs"
bad,"Not a fun work environment, stressful, personal sales goals to meet and competing with other associates adds drama to the work place, rude customers."
bad,"I was a Fragrance Ringer I didn't do much but I did ring the Customer merchandise up and I did get to make commission for the Holiday season."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Macys pay really low but except a lot out of you. The holidays they make you work crazy hours. Macys is a company for people that great people skills
bad,"it sucked working here. I learned I love working in customer service more than I thought and I care more about the customer than any of my Co-workers did here, they just came to work for a check."
bad,"Management was poor and let the store fail. If an employee had an issue, it was hard to get the proper help to fix the issue."
bad,"I started in the summer as a sales associate and nobody would teach me anything they put me around a register that I wasn't familar with and then they would go one side and talk about me when I couldnt use it.they never ever gave me any hours apart from when some one suddenly calls out and they need some one right away then they would call me a minute before the time and expected me to come there. There pay was terrible for the things they would have you do running from department to department having only yiu managing 2 -3 departments with no help nor training.  The managers were mean and unwelcoming they spoiled my name calling me somthibg different every day.I would reccommend working there to anyone, I had a very ooir exoerience and wouldnt wish it on my enemy."
bad,Company is awful. Don't ever work here. It's completely awful and they have unacceptable expectations. Especially of salaried associates. The end.
bad,I worked here during school. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and that is all I will say on this place of employment
bad,if your looking for a job just to make ends meet or just to say you have a job work at macys
bad,"Macys San Bernardino is not the Macys to work for. Between the poor management and the rude customers you feel constantly frustrated. Unfortunately no matter how hard you try to get a promotion, your hard work and determination are never noticed. Breaks are out of the question and when you need a manager for some help, they're no where to be found. Your constantly pressured to sell more and open more credit accounts, but regardless if your numbers are high, it's never enough. There's absolutely no coverage, only causing problems to escalate with customers because they're having to wait alot longer than they'd appreciate. In the reality of things, there can be drama wherever you go, BUT the drama that went on in this store was unimaginable. The managers would openly say things about  coworkers in front of other coworkers. It's a terrible thing when management gossips the most. Take my advice and work at any Macys in the world, EXCEPT this location."
bad,"I could fill pages upon pages of the incompetence, corruption and disrespect Macy's has to offer, especially in Naples, Florida. A tremendous setback for me and my family. I have about 75 photos you would not believe."
bad,"Typical day at work was oriented to whoever was manager on duty and his/hers mood."
bad,"The associates are , rude , conversate about the other associates too much , they dont do their job. Lack of communication"
bad,worked there for three holiday seasons and the  company makes these incentives  to work during the holidays and makes empty  promises about bonuses and fulltime employment
bad,Low wage for such high goals at the store. Nobody is helpful there.
bad,Macys is a horrible place to work at. All the managers care about is covering their rears and doing anything to make themselves look good even if it means belittling your employees. Never ever will i work there again.
bad,This company training for seasonal work should be months in advance.  Management needs to communicate with each other and their employees.  They expect a lot out of you and have not properly trained you on the right procedure.  Different rules apply for different departments and they want you to know all rules without having the correct means to obtain it. I understand now why this company has a high employee turnover.
bad,"Poor management. "
bad,I would never work here again management is not professional at all.
bad,don't like it sucks cant make a real living off of this little pay check they gave me work me like a slave couldn't get a raise but what every. I worked so hard there and nothing happens had to make a sale goal that was super high and I didn't like it everyone is always trying to steal your customers like really I don't get paid enough to do this I really don't and for me to be down town please out there mind didn't learn any thing besides  if I didn't make a sale goal I wouldn't be recommended to stay with the company well guess what I didn't stay cause it not worth my time.
bad,you had to constantly be in competition for sales and this caused hardship and mistrust among co-workers who also needed to meet sales goals for the day.
bad,"macy's gives you outrageous sales goals and working on commission is no piece of cake. My coworkers would steal my sales and gossip. it was a very intense environment, especially when it got busy."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Low pay, 27 cent raise after a year, small discount, expects you to make sales goals for them yet you get paid the same either way. At one point they passed around a paper asking how much money I wanted taken out of my paycheck to go to their charity. Not sure why a giant company would want to take from people they're already paying minimum wage."
bad,dont like management not interested in ever working there again
bad,Not good pay but a great place to start. Management needs some worker on valuing there workers.
bad,I was tired of folding clothes and then only to return later to fold them again.
bad,the management was terrible. no room for growth and poor working environment. co-workers were great but managers were untrustworthy and unprofessional
bad,"boring long days, pay is horrible, I ad $29/week at one point, management sucks."
bad,It was terrible working for very little and having management talking about you behind your back.
bad,"terrible hours"
bad,Terrible place no stability no future and the job was way too physical.
bad,you don't get good hours I don't know why people even want to work their in the first place my day was horrible and I really didn't like the fact that I had to pick my hours and try to get shifts cause if I didn't they would all be taken by the end of the day. that I didn't like at all it was a terrible work place and I could of done better
bad,"Ring orders up"
bad,"learning experiance"
bad,Not enough staffing and made it really difficult. I do not want to share my views
bad,"Overall good position, gets challenging because the pay is not to good."
bad,I was hired for seaonal help and they put me in jewelry on my first day on the floor. I had no idea what I was doing so i requested to be put somewhere else. I folded clothes from then on.
bad,They lied about my fair credit report and management was barely ever there worked for poor wage as well.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,The best time to work is around the holiday. A lot of politics on the inside.
bad,"They pay you minimum wage and they expect so much from you. Unprofessional lot especially the office manager, cosmetic manager and the loss prevention team. The loss prevention is out to get you, they are just waiting for you to do something wrong."
bad,"pay was horrible, hours were horrible, would not like to work here again."
bad,"bad management, low pay rate, pure benefits, short vacation time"
bad,"Management needs a complete overhaul. No over time unless you're asked  to work over night. HR threatens  to fire you if you don't agree with the polices. No ones ever on the same page , forced to sign off on documents you're not allowed to read first before signing. Unfair very low pay , extremely low commission rates.Attendance credits, you earn half a credit every 2 weeks  you lose 2 credits on the weekend and 1 credit during the week. It take two whole weeks to earn half a credit, some times you have to fight with them / remind them to give you that half attendance credit! Prior to the employes speaking up you earned half a credit every month!"
bad,"Unload trucks"
bad,"A typical day of work is unjamming conveyors, running a compactor, baling cardboard, and changing batteries. Duties that a operator performs at most companies. I did not learn  much all they have is conveyors. I liked management and co-workers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the boredom. The job keeps you busy but the task are very medial and not challenging. The job is not enjoyable because you do not learn anything new. Unlike most companies they will not reimburse you for schooling. That is no problem because you will not need any. this is a good job for a young kid living at home with there parents. I think it would be hard to move into a regular factory maintenance job from here because you do not learn anything. If you are coming from regular maintenance work you will not find this job rewarding or challenging. You will not gain the skills working here to perform a real maintenance job. They should just promote people internally to this job."
bad,"-delegated work assignments "
bad,i felt like a slave in that job  and i got 4 hours day there no money in that job to me.
bad,Macys is the worst place to work for management is horrible they don't care about you. All they care about is SALES AND OPENING CREDIT CARDS!! And to make matters worst it's ALWAYS HOT In there
bad,typical day at work for me is fast past servicing customers and keeping my merchandise organize and making sure the customer is satisfy with my service
bad,"In charge of quarterly visual projects and Christmas Set ups.  Learned patience above anything else, however, sales management and head management need people skills. Enjoyed working with peers and learn a lot from them."
bad,"Working early in the morning setup display , move things around. Help co-workers if not finish and changing prices on items setting sales."
bad,this was a seasonal job but I did not like it at all. I would have to unload the stock truck  on cold days and unpack items and have them ready for display the next day. co-workers were pretty nice. management did not communicate very well.
bad,Busy everyday with lots of work to do. There is something different to do everyday.
bad,"Poor Management, and i did not like working there nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn"
bad,I quit after a month I did not like it. The pay was horrible! I only worked for a month and did not like it.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Only good for temporary or seasonal jobs. I don't like how they are very judgmental and they expect so much from their workers for so little pay.
bad,Was the worst experience ever. It was like slave labor. Not even paid on commission.
bad,"Greeting customers"
bad,"NEVER AGAIN! Other than learning an extensive amount about men's fashion, I will NEVER work at Macys again. Corrupt management, even lower associates. No one does anything because doing something would interrupt cash flow. Hated it."
bad,"With their seasonal openings, they purposely hire dozens of people and trying to fight over positions to actually work can be tricky."
bad,"Save yourself...never work for Macy's.  They do not care about you, only look at you as a number.  I know when I read reviews like this, I say, well, it will be different for me.  No, believe me.  NEVER work for Macy's."
bad,"it was okay i thought i would be much more fun and exciting. the hours was horrible, the co workers were ok. there were hardly any mangers arund when needed."
bad,a great learning experience but no pay I've been working there for 10 years still I'm not making 10 dollars
bad,"Daily duties included cashiering, assisting customers with purchases and replenishing merchandise."
bad,"Macy's is not the ideal company to work for unless you enjoy ripping people off, ruining people's credit, and by any means make the sale!"
bad,"fun if u like to help people, but managers have a long way to go to learn their responsibilities and ethics first before coaching others!"
bad,When I began working at Macy's I actually started on  the biggest sales day of the year Black Friday.My co workers where very helpful and I manage to get through the day very confident that this job was for me.
bad,There is little respect for the associates but high expectations for associates.
bad,"Worked in prep department. Transferring the vendor boxes to Macys boxes for the pickers to the products for the customers orders. Using a gun to scan bar codes and the count of the products, recording all overages and shortages. The Prep Department was closed down at Thanksgiving and we were sent to the Picking Department and the Packing Department. I worked in both Departments In the Picking Department  using a scanning  gun with customers orders on it would pick the items until complete. Then put them in a box and put the box on the conveyor belt and went on to the next order. Also, put products away, when there were no orders. Was also sent to the Packing Department would take tubs off the conveyor belt with the customers orders in them. Then find the proper size box or bag and pack them, put the address label  on it and put it on the conveyor back."
bad,they expect you to work your butt off and expect nothing back in return horrible raises. your raise is based off sales I do not sell products so I get a small raise.
bad,The company plays games with employees hrs... Very non professional.
bad,"A typical work day was answering phone calls, attending to customer needs, satisfying customers, teamwork and maintaining an organized selling floor."
bad,I do not recommend working here. Everything is political and it is very stressful
bad,"calls were very intense, the management was not personable and did nothing to further confidence of their employees"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I would never work at this get-go ever in my life they were so racist half the staff was white there were only like 3 or 4 blacks myself included but I wouldnt suggest this place to my dying dog!! Do not work here!!!!!
bad,"this is the worst company to work for they dont care about,there employee just themselves and paula was the assistant manger at northpoint mall she,was the worst...... Overall I wouldnt,recomend,this job to anyone"
bad,Worst job I've ever had. Managers aren't nice and aren't well connect with their employees. Managers didn't pay you any mind if you weren't working for the company for over a certain amount of time.
bad,"Here at Macy's I did not enjoy my work history there. That is because, the company was very laid back and unproductive within my job description."
bad,"I have worked for Macys for over 2 years and they fire people left and right. They just recently had a huge lay-off in my building and we lost A LOT of good people. You get lied to about advancement. I was promised a lot of positions and hours and have yet to see any of it. The managers make the lower paid workers do their job. I have been trained to replace one of the managers and ever since I got the training I have been the one doing his job. "
bad,"Macy's is under going many changes.  Their remodeling of the grand old landmark store is beautiful.  They are making changes, in part,  to accommodate the new direction of retail sales: the huge and ever  growing online sales market.  Many of the changes are necessary and Macy's employees are being asked to adjust accordingly.  There are changes, however, that are going to make working at Macy's difficult.  For example, they are taking away our lockers and replacing them with tiny 12""x12"" lockers, barely big enough for a purse. We are going to now have to stand on line to check our coats.  With a store of 5,000 employees, standing on line for an hour or more to check ones coat or retrieve it is going to be a nightmare.  Also, Macy's wages have dropped.  They give millions to charity but apparently charity doesn't begin at home.  Macy's employees can look forward to beautiful displays and departments but lousy pay, and poorly thought out policies for their employees."
bad,"If you enjoy being treated like cheap labor, then this is the job for you. A lot of the managers and fellow co-workers either care way too much or way too little, and there is no balance. Don't work here."
bad,"I would NOT recommend anyone to work for this company."
bad,they make u wear a uniform which was ok and the never had enough hours
bad,need something that has gauranteed hours and better pay. too many workers at one time unescessary mix up's
bad,"Sales associates are a great bunch to work with but management is under so much stress that you dread to see them coming toward your department.  Pay is minimum wage, hours are minimal and management is never happy."
bad,they try but there are worker's that are very unprofessional and some that are very friendly.
bad,"stocked shelves,customer service"
bad,"bad management, low pay, not great hours..not much room for moving up with the company. not a great location..slow mall not many people go there"
bad,"There's nothing out of the ordinary that I can state. "
bad,"Macys sucks, I got hired as holiday help and I don't even get any hours. I was told it should pick up once the holidays hit and clearly that was a lie, I thought Ill be working black Friday. I was looking forward to the madness.  However they did some how schedule me to only work three hours, which sucks after taxes I'm not taking home much. The old dock manager was really rude, pushy, rushing all the time. She didn't train her new hires the right way but expected us to know Macys way of doing things. Then she got hurt on the job so the dock didn't have a manager for weeks, it was so hecky. Finally got a new manager and still no hours, which makes no sense why hire all these people when you don't have the hours, yes its good to be prepared but don't waste someones time scheduling them for only three hours. I would never tell a friend to apply for Macys working on the dock. Macys suck, the only good thing about it is the weekly pay. Min wage what they offer, maybe a little of min wage if you have experience. This could never be a stable job."
bad,"Sorry,  I have nothing positive to say about this company other than I love The brands they carry."
bad,"Terrible place to work, horrible pay, long application process, strict rules"
bad,Work the employee's till they drop or quit Have no value for family macys is the only thing
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Busy all the time and expect alot for min. wage. Management is horrid and always in the office.
bad,"If I could give them no stars, I would. Management does not care about you at all. They don't care if you are happy or sad or upset if there is a problem in your area. All they care about is if you are selling, selling, selling and making money for them and in signing people up for credit cards.I was great at that! I had a  more than a few problems and the Main Manager and President of the company didn't even care to contact me and find out what they could do to fix the issue, after I kept trying to contact them. So I left! There is no communication between management either. Hardest part of the job: Working for minimum wage. Even with commission, pay is terrible. Having to be available to work any hours at any time. Most enjoyable: Pretty much nothing, except for the Discount, but you have to get it on their Macy's card which is pretty ridiculous because it goes on your credit background if you are late with a payment."
bad,Working at Macy's was my first retail job and my experience with the company wasn't so great. The managers are not so great and the supervisors are horrible when running a store. My co-worker's weren't so bad. We helped each other out when we needed the help.
bad,a lot of politics managers playing favorite sometimes i never took breaks..it went unnoticed. The rules they set didn't apply to most customers customers got away with a lot and the manager made you look dumb for doing your job.
bad,"they over work you and under pay you"
bad,"Management treat the workers unfairly, they expect so much from us, but they never reward of with good compliments. All you hear in our morning meeting credit credits credits, not how our department is doing etc."
bad,I did customer service in the men's department for little pay(minimum wage) long hours. Not a good place to work.
bad,"I was in the women's shoe dpt., basically hell on earth. I was a selling associate and my jobs included manning the register, constant recovery, and sucking up to customers and harrassing them in the hopes of making a sale. The managers were breathing down my neck from start to finish to the point where I couldn't even concentrate on selling because I felt I was being watched insessantly, which I was.they were constantly keeping an eye on me like I was some criminal out on parole. Besides the extremely low wages from a company making billions of dollars in sales, the shortage of work hours made it impossible to at least break even. I spent more on gas and insurance than a month's wages at macys. The customers were the worst thing of all, they were the rudest, nastiest, childlike people I had ever met. Long story short I got fed up with rude customers, low pay, a huge workload, rude coworkers and no work hrs, so I decided to quit."
bad,"The management was never around, always working alone with tasks that required more than one person. It was rare that I would see/work with my co-workers."
bad,Supervisors with no ethical methods are typical at Macy'ys
bad,Met with and gathered information about prospective bridal couples.  Training consisted of a 6 hour stint in front of a computer.  Management almost nonexistent when problems arose with customers.  Co-workers complained to each other continually about working conditions.  The hardest part of the job was getting the ambition to go into the store for my shift.  The best part was being able to help a customer amidst the chaos.  Macy's is where retail has gone to die.
bad,very faced paced but fun and friendly. I have learned that customer service is to be done fast friendly and with care. Management at Macy's  was very direct and strict.my co-workers did not always have the best attitudes. which sometimes made the job very difficult. the hardest part of my job is having to always work alone without support from co-workers or management. the best part of my job is helping customers. and providing fast friendly service.
bad,Horrible managers  they are bossy and they over work you. They don't act professional
bad,I worked my butt off for min wage and no benefits. Management was not the best and could have been much better at this store. I worked hard while others stood around and did nothing. After the holiday season was over they thanked me for my hard work by letting me go.
bad,"Macys is a nice place to shop, when they have sales, but not so much to work.  I barely had any hours, and when I would go in it would be only for 1 hr.  Didnt enjoy wasting gas for only 1 hour of work 1 day a week."
bad,"Macys expects too much for such low pay. you have to meet daily goals, credit goals,presale goals daily go backs take heat from the managers all while making sure your customer is taken care of.they treat their employees horriblyand always pass up people who have been working there forever and give the better posistions to new people,dont apply run!!!!"
bad,"good employees,but not good upper management they do not care about you"
bad,"would never work for another macys ever again, store manager is terrible."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Horrible company overworked. Mimi um wage salary. Corporate expectations. 
bad,"This is good first job, but not a career builder. It helps to sharpen customer service skills."
bad,Good for holiday work or as a second job. Management communication needs improvement as well as salaries.
bad,You cannot run a household working for this company. If you are a college student or someone who lives with their parents then this job might work. Management will assume you are lazy and have nothing better to do with your life. The pay is abysmal and the work is tedious and stressful. You can advance but it will be 5 years in when you have no other options and only if your sales numbers merit the recommendation.
bad,Not a good place to work if you are a student in college and try to have a job. Not much flexibility and horrible management. Also no job security. Could end up without a job the next day. 
bad,"I am overworked and under paid. A typical work day as a fitting room attendant. I am responsible to clean the fitting rooms. Recover on the floor. Assist customers with sales. I have learned Macy's in Florida with the commission based store. It breeds negative energy gossip, back stabbing, caddy behavior amongst each other. It has lowered the morale .My co-workers  many of them are not the cream of the crop. Macy's will hire anyone because the turnover rate is out of control. The hardest part of the job is I am responsible to do everything and I get paid peanuts. There is not one enjoyable aspect of the job. It is the bottom of the barrel!  I would never in a million years recommend anyone to apply there. I would tell them to stay unemployed!!"
bad,"The worse Dept. Store for, if you are white."
bad,The money is terrible. The amount of responsibilities for the money is nothing short of insane. They never warn you when your holiday position is ending until it's right about to end. They throw you out like trash. Don't bother.
bad,"Macys was never about its employees"
bad,Seriously the culture is a joke and only displayed around the store for company visits. It isn't applied in the daily operations of the business. Unless you are kissing managements butt everyday there is no way to advance really. The hardest part was going to work. 
bad,"It's an okay job , but i wouldnt refer no one to work there. It's too many people there that want to be the boss. And not enough help our hours to give the coworkers."
bad,would rather be jobless than work here again...overworked and underpaid
bad,Looking for a team based atmosphere? Well look somewhere else. Its everyone for themselves where the sharks thrive. Managers dont care as long as they meet their own goals and constantly harp on you to open credits for a card I wouldnt even sign up for to get an employee discount.
bad,"Helped customers with there selections"
bad,"I honestly didn't learn much here. It is the worst job I have had for multiple reasons. Management is terrible. They will talk poorly about associates in their departments in the associate break room, not caring who hears. They don't formally train. After the computer ""training"" I had I was thrown onto the floor to work by myself (openning). They don't train you on their policies. Managers don't have their associates backs. If you do something a manager tells you is ok and it actually goes against company policy that manager will not back you up. They promote people that don't deserve it and have not put in the work. I didn't enjoy anything about the job."
bad,"This is a.conpany who is gonna fierd you after used your setvices,if u kiss managers butt you stay other wise they make you life miserable.,then nasty treat u like criminal by loss prevention deparment guys,who they really think they are.FBI"
bad,"I work Loss Prevention as a detective. Macys is the most unprofessional place I have ever worked for. The pay is bad and management doesnt care about the employees. My manager told me that Loss Prevention works weekends and that they try to give us one weekend off a month but my manager gave themselves weekends off and a 9-5 shift. While the other detectives worked 6am-2pm and 2-close. I say ""close"" bc there is no actual time to leave. Whenever the last associate is finished...thats when youre finished. If the alarms wont set at night then you cant go home until it does, even if it means you have to stay till 6am when the day shift gets in to relieve you. They dont give you enough people to get the job done and then get on you about not making any cases. The place is terrible The mall security guards make more money. Stay away from macys!!"
bad,"Hired into company as a supervisor, than after the holiday season store management and HR said, "" We will give you high recommendations "". I wanted to stay with the company but move to ANY store in the area that had the same position or better, opened. The store manager and HR than went back on what they told me, and refused to allow me to move to an open position. They demoted me to a cashier/sales position on the sales floor. The drastic reduction in pay forced me to resign from the company after 4 months. I dont recommend working for Macy's if you wish to work for someone for a long period of time."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Lately Macy at the fashion show mall it's not the fun place where u want to work all the new management changes that they did look like just bring caos and unhappiness in the people who work there
bad,"i learned how to apply makeovers, and strengthin my promoting skills. i just found to be very fun and free job i could have ever worked at"
bad,hard work little respect i would not want to work for this macys warehouse ever again.
bad,"Poor training, very haphazard, poor communication, disorganized systems of ""managing"" things, and overall if I were hired on as a consultant I'd improve how the managers communicated with each other and their employees or departments. I'd cut the cost of the huge daily paper waste and streamline how they do their daily operations by treating the Administrative Support Team like real administrative staff not retail employees. While I was working for them I'd have sometimes 3 or 4 days off in a row and return with no supervisor and a list of things to do but no idea how to do them because they had implemented a new report or it was a new project someone else had started and not finished. This was the first position EVER that I have had difficulty improving it's operations and cutting it's cost."
bad,"Too much emphasis on selling credit apps, which turns off the customer. Coupons that Macy's issues are rarely good for what the customer wants, but some sales associates override the system and let the customer have the discount anyway which makes the coupons pointless."
bad,this company has a huge turn over rate an their hours could be better
bad,"had to make rounds and check identification all day. people want to talk to you during your rounds and you end up getting into trouble. pay was low, hours were long. shifts werent good."
bad,this was a summer job for me between semesters while i was attending college
bad,No room for advancement. They did not adhere to their rules and regulations for their sales associates. I would not recommend them for employment.
bad,If you don't have anything nice to say about something don't say anything at all.
bad,working on the docks recieving inventory to be put out on the floor
bad,Low pay not flexible too much work for the amount pay especially for a second a job.
bad,"There is bullying by full-time employees inappropriately targeting seasonal workers. On three occasions, while in the midst of a sale employees would make remarks. Three clients reported the incident to the manager. The manager would speak to the employee but with no consequences. The registers rarely were supplied with pens, note paper, and business cards. The display cases were rarely cleaned and the jewelry was never cleaned. Macy's goal is to sell the customer to open a Macy's account and sell an extended service plan. There is no customer service and many times the Department was not sufficiently staffed and as a result customers were told to wait and many sales were missed."
bad,"The organization is a bit flaud, though i do recommend this job to those being a first timer in the working field."
bad,Truly the death of real customer service. Just walk into a store. Large home repair stores have more service. Management has cut employees for the button line always working harder if one cares to help guest. With poor pay sales associates look terrible in just black only dress code starting out. No family life and no real set schedule. Never drink the kool-aid after 12 years. So much hype not a job to make a living with family.
bad,"terrible management no organization between shifts, get treated very unprofessionally"
bad,"Typical day, very busy from open to close."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Didn't like company I work on a roller pulling boxes off belt
bad,"I worked there for two & a half years & never got a single review or a raise. They treat their employees horribly and with use you any chance that they get. They expect you to do everything while the managers do nothing, & you get paid nothing for all the work you do."
bad,"Unless you enjoy having ZERO control over anything and absolute responsibility for everything, one would be better off at McDonald's. At least McD's pays their employees better."
bad,seasonal job didn't work there long enough to really comment on the company.
bad,Macy's is one of the worst places to work I have ever done!!!! I hated everything about the job and the pay is bad....
bad,they are unorgranzied work you like a slave for 8.25 an hour and the managers are rude
bad,The man who ran the maintenance part of Macy's was very unorganized and didn't schedule effectively.
bad,The hours where horrible and they don't pay you very well for having to arrive there at 5:30am but the good thing about working was that they did give you an employee discount and I also got to work with setiing out the new displays for the store which I really like.
bad,They constantly harass you to open credit cards. You are also faced with unrealistic high sales goals. Even on days with no customers in the store they hound you for sales and credit cards apps.
bad,"Horrible interaction with managers. Store was always disorganized. No consideration for work/life balance. Very little pay, no health benefits, and worked long hours on your feet."
bad,"Wrong environment for myself, and my personality. Its was a terrible, and uncomfortable place of employment. The manager was ill equipped, and uneducated. No proper scheduled breaks. Co-workers increased shrink, and were incredibly lazy."
bad,working for them is like doing your job and other peoples job. the ask you to help with there department and will never finish on time with what they have to do. Slow workers clock riders is what i had to put up with no team work what so ever if your department needs help dont bother asking them but they always need help in theirs so my advice never i mean never apply to macys in galleria hoover al never they give you one set of hours and then change them on the spot they will take your off day from you with out tell you and then will make you come in no please dont apply
bad,"I would not reccommend anyone to work for this company at this time because the management in place now, is not suited to be in those positions. It has not always been this way, however if you're looking for good pay, integrity, and fairness this is not the place to work. If you're looking for great co-workers this is the place for you."
bad,I didn't like working at Macy's because of my co workers were extremely rude. i told the supervisors and they just ignored me and what i had to say about it.
bad,"Macy's was a fine place to work, if you never question management."
bad,the inter office communication is very poor which leads to much confusion and re-doing lots of work.
bad,"Work at Clinique is like a constant race that is nearly impossible to win. Each day when we go in, we are given a sales goal to reach by the end of the shift. However, we are so grossly over-staffed, that it is typical for there to be 7-8 of us working at the counter at a time when there really is only enough room and business for 3-4. It is incredibly stressful on everyone who works there to try to make what seems to be unreachable goals when there are so many people working toward the same goals. Management is non existent most of the time. The counter manager will be gone for a weeks at a time, yet expects us to carry on with very little leadership. Personally, I hate to be so negative about a work place, but I honestly can't think of one positive outcome from working in this position."
bad,Minorities are looked over for advancement and treated like slaves literally. They do not take into consideration any work-life balance or recognition and efforts for doing a fantastic job.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Working for a fashion retailer is what most people would expect, it is very sales and customer oriented. As a manager, I was tasked with ensuring that sales associates provided high levels of service and helping them identify new sales opportunities whether that meant upselling a customer or selling the value of a Star Rewards card to the customer. Everyday is pretty much the very same thing, with the exception of customer traffic that may vary from day to day and season to season."
bad,"a very uneasy place to work , the pay is horrible and they treat you like slaves at macys"
bad,"Macy's usually seems like a fun environment with responsible people. My experience there was awful. I would have no idea where I was supposed to be working, the managers didn't communicate with anyone, and they would be very rude if someone did something wrong."
bad,Would have to answer to rude customer and pretend you like it. Would have to stand for long hours with no consideration of an employee needs a break. The pay is quite poor and really not worth it especially with what one has to go through.
bad,"My workers received very low pay. Understaffed. The building itself is a fire trap with locked doors and rotting infrastructure. Entrenched management that has a ""boys club"" feel to it. The mice run the place at night, i mean DO NOT EAT THERE. It is chaotic, knit picking and exhausting. If you don't produce the sales numbers you're done on the spot. You are disposable. If you work in the tower, you get AC, coffee, lunch and great pay. If you're on the selling floors... consider yourself a scab. the holidays are a nightmare. tourists, complaints, low IQ management, back stabbing culture, inept security, bed bug ridden linen department, rodent infested and no upwards movement."
bad,Started working here around the holidays which later on turned to permement work. I was cashier and sale associate for ladies personals department.
bad,"A typical day is slow but there are still customers to satisfy. I learned how to help customers, how to keep patient and calm through the craziest times. Management isn't very fair but my co-workers made the job so much better. The hardest part of the job was making sure every customer was taken care of during the busiest days. The most enjoyable part was the great customer feed back and putting a smile on my customers face."
bad,All the managers have thier own idea of how to run the store.
bad,"alot of work and little pay. very straight forward retail no really skills learned aside from multitasking. coworkers always changed week to week, high rollover rate."
bad,"Unloading truck ,taking clothes out the boxes and hanging them up ,Also stripping them making sure there nice ."
bad,Macy's is a horrible place to work. They ask so much of you for minimum wage. They set your sales goal so high so you have no chance of making comission.
bad,"I loved the co-workers and management team and the customers. I would take purchases at the cash register, ask customer if they would like to open a Macys charge card. Put clothes back on the proper racks. I learned how to resolve a conflict and customers needs The most hardest part of the job was lunch break was only 30 minutes The most enjoyable part of the job was the great co-workers and management."
bad,"basically we were over worked and under paid,our work schedules to demanding,the job was not fun at all."
bad,"Long hours low pay but a place to earn extra money. Managment keeps pushing for more production and never acknowledge if you did a good job, only lets you know when you do something wrong. Co-workers were superb."
bad,The hours were short I didn't work a full 30 hrs they also pressured people to open Macy's cards everyday.
bad,"Lack of communication though-out whole store and maybe even company. No one cares about you unless you are a top selling sales associate and even then they don't promote you. Keeping you on a low wage and no chance of going any higher. Another co-worker I know has been working way longer than I had, best sales in the store and trying to get a higher position with absolutely no luck at all. I could go on and on about this place but I would rather not waste anymore time with them. If you have any self respect for yourself stay away."
bad,"I didn't have a very positive experience at Macy's. I was hired for what I had been lead to believe would have been a full-time position, but I was lucky to get more than 12-15 hours per week."
bad,"Stood in one spot for hours and even if the clothes were all already folded the manager would come by and ""talk"" to you about refolding them."
bad,"Horrible pay, stressful since you have to open credit and meet your sales."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I love working for Macys! I love cashiering and assisting customers.
bad,"easton macys, very prejudice. management does not like blacks!"
bad,Worst place to work. Upper Management does not care about their coworkers and we are just numbers to them. Are reminded weekly that we are all replacable. Would not reccommend this job to anyone.
bad,By far this was the worse company I've worked for. Workers are not valued as well as self growth. I am a college student and was told by one of the store manager that i had to make a choice of going to school or working at Macy's. I was told that they cannot work with my school schedule so i had to choose even the union ( we were told we had to join at the beginning of working for Macy's) said the exact thing. How is it that I pay union dues every check but yet when I need them to do their job they cannot. It is unclear to me that a company with so much respect are unable to cooperate with something as simple as school schedule. I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy!
bad,"• Meeting and making a connection with customers, asking questions and listening to shoppers' needs, then giving options and advice on meeting those needs"
bad,Macys is Macys....No real management. Not enjoyable. It's a free for all.
bad,"Like many places in Bakersfield, California, the Macy's workplace suffers from an overload of juvenile drama. Every associate is judged purely on numbers: credit card apps and sales goals. If you don't fulfill your goals, you aren't worth anything to the Macy's empire. The managers expect you to have no life-unless you're one of their biggest fans/friends. If you aren't in the Manager's Circle, and if you DO have a life, expect to end up on the chopping block-QUICKLY."
bad,"I hated working at Macy's the management tried to make us do anything to close sales, every co-worked would argue and fight. Leadership there was poor and could not control issues at hand."
bad,"The managers don't do anything to help you in any way. They have this new scheduling that does not benefit the workers in any way. Was hired for Day part time, but since the new schedules i've been giving night shifts."
bad,Enjoyed the clients.
bad,The company is terrible to work for and I don't recommend it to anyone.
bad,"Managers are only concerned about bottom line. Worked at the CT Post Macy's #116 in Milford. My dept. (shoes) was extremely chaotic and overrun. Manager of shoes would often greet me with ""Did you open an account today?"" instead of Hello. And only a 20% discount? Shoes associates are running back and forth to stockroom all day. You would think they would recognize this, and reward associates accordingly. You would be wrong."
bad,bad place to work only hurting your self by working there if you want to be treated like a slave then that is the place to work.
bad,"this company had its issues with understaffing, low wages/benefits, clientele in extreme numbers in a fast paced environment"
bad,Just don't work there. It is a dead end job
bad,Absolutely the worst company... It was not a great environment with all the rats in the building. Compensation was absolutely horrendous and you aren't given the tools necessary to help become successful.
bad,"very poor pay, poor direction from management and no opportunities for advancement."
bad,"Most situations were handled unprofessionally, no cultural values, no respect for one another"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Manager’s like to treat employees unfairly. They’ll want you to do 5 different things at once within a short amount of time. Overall, good company to for."
bad,Work/life balance doesn't exist with the crazy hours during holiday season and one day sales. Most managers are clueless about being effective managers. Store is very messy.
bad,"If there is one thing you will never find here is stability. Your schedule changes constantly every single week. You get to pick one day off but may be asked to change it if the company feels it is an ""important"" day. Be prepared to work very long, late hours, specially around the holidays. Once the holidays come no one can request any days off and they completely take away your set day off. Management changes from store to store but in my situation a lot was asked from with little support. Very low morale due to the way management was. It constantly felt like everyone was being watched at all times. If possible do not apply to Macy's."
bad,"There is no t on team, is very competitive and harsh if you do not make your golds.  management trying  to treat you like a kid or acts tours employee that there stupid. I regret asking for a job. Plus the paid is terrible. Hours worst"
bad,Big joke you do not get paid double time or time in a half on holidays at all poor racist managers there waste of time there they cant keep anyone there because they see how pathetic it is
bad,"This is an ok job to have if you have other responsibilities. However the pay is very low, sales goals are unrealistic, and they do not recognize promoting within. I was going to college on the verge of graduating and I did not have a an opportunity to advance."
bad,Poor management they put all your work for only one week and then the next week you only get one day the hours are poorly managed. The main manager there is really nice and understanding but would not refer you to work there.
bad,Always changing the way they do things.  Poor communication to part-time employees.  Attempt to implement sales quotas that were very unrealistic.  Very long shifts and make you take 1 hour unpaid dinner break.  Full-time employees can be very unhappy if you take a sale from them.  The bathroom tend to be dirty and unkept.
bad,Had to do 3 different jobs that was for 3 ppl and they worked me 7days a week and I was pt than they stop callin me in. I had 1 day 4hrs a month and stop putting me in the schedule. Had so many hrs of vacation and never used one because they denied all my days. So when I quit they were upset. The HR lady was like omg you arent on the schedule and I told her what my managers did. She told my vacation days and put them as my 2wk notice. My managers called me like didnt approve this the hr lady said I did. She worked her butt off for us and you treated her awful
bad,"Even though the position for seasonal hire was technically a flex position, there were not many available shifts for me to pick up. Being a college student at the time, the days/hours I was available werenʻt taken into consideration by management, so I was given little to no hours."
bad,Macy's doesn't really care for their employees. You give them the hours you can work and they'll still schedule you when you can't make it. It's to much stress for the very little they pay.
bad,Pass on this place not a good place to grow in retail upper management plays favoritism to certain races I would stay away from this place as it’s sinking ship
bad,Nice job and great store . Employees in Cosmetics Department are all old and will all team up because they don’t want you to make any sales. They’re Nice at first if they can use you to make them sales .
bad,"Applied for a full time position as Commission Sales Associate at Macy's Arcadia and all I gotta say is this company is a joke. Interviewee was hella unprofessional, questions were dumb, and overall convinced me to not work here and I'm glad I did not. Pay is mediocre along with management. Save yourself your time and dignity. Would not be surprised if Macy's is out of business within the next 5 years."
bad,Beware of this company. Managers treat you terribly in a hostile environment. Virtually NO chance of advancement. Training is minimal. Support is non-existent. Look elsewhere!
bad,"Unless this is your last option, wouldn't recommend this place...Underpaid, poor management. I have no idea til this day how ""management"" were in the position they were in."
bad,"If u have ever scene the movie Get Out, Macy's is the sunken place and some of the employees are Chris. No work-life balance. Cheers to the weekend! What weekend? Lol. Toxic environment. I don't know if all departments are like this but my department was terrible."
bad,Over all was not the best job experience. But co-workers were cool.The manager was also very selfish and rude at times to the workers. I over all would not recommend working at macy's unless its needed for funds.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Poor management is being nice. "
bad,Impulse manager who would shop on the clock outside of store. Young minded and would be unprofessional. Yet she's still there! All she does is walk around all day and does nothing.
bad,They don’t care about there people I worked there for a year alone at night and there hired a guy to help me and paid him double what I was making for the same job I was doing    The director and managers don’t care about you.   They said anyone can be replaced even when you work your hardest for the and they promise you so much but just lie about it and wait for you to quit then just replace you
bad,The store was dirty as f**k. Management had their favorites and never gave raises. This is a sad place to work & they don’t care anything about their products because people are stealing from them all day especially in the men’s department.
bad,"I worked at Macy's for about two years and it has to be the worse work experience for me. They're demanding and will call and text you to get you to come in, they pile on your work load and expect you to complete tasks they don't or haven't trained you for... I worked in the fitting room but have done everything from fulfillment to stick to merchandising. The managers have no respect. It's the only job I have had that the managers will complain about the floor knowing where sorry stated and expect you to complete it while doing your actually job but won't lift a finger to assist... Teamwork and communication is something that you expect but Don't if you're planning on working here... This is what you always see new employees they can't keep any."
bad,"The best parts about working at Macy's were the great friends that I made there and the fantastic clearance sales. Never knowing my work schedule more than 2 weeks in advance, working nights and weekends and holidays, no chance for advancement, and no benefits are why I did not like working there. I also developed plantar fasciitis and metatarsalgia in both feet from standing on hard marble floors during 12-hour work shifts  and working overnight on Thanksgiving into Black Friday."
bad,"If you're looking for a career, this is not the place for you.  Management is very unprofessional; clicked up and if you're not part of the click you become a target."
bad,"At first it seemed a fun place to work.  I started in the intimates department part time.  Because of my track record of customer satisfaction and great sales techniques, I was offered a full time position in women's shoes, and the manager excitedly described the amazingly wonderful, unlimited commissions that I would be making.  "
bad,"At Macy's, it seems the associates let their competitiveness get in the way of their professionalism. Work ethics focus on the customer's experience. No work ethics seem to be enforced, reguarding co-worker relationships. And MACY'S is NOT an EqualOpportunityEmployer."
bad,"If you do not like to suck up to management, it is not a good place to work. If you are not a ""favorite"" of management you do not get any interaction from management. Need more and better training. Expect way too much from some of the employees."
bad,"Working here I felt that they took total advantage of having me there. I was well over qualified, and a student in the field of Esthetics. My starting pay was lower than what I made in high school. It was a lot of standing and moving around depts. stocking, makeup applications, online distribution for clients that made purchases online. Breaks were rarely given. I was over worked for $9 an hour. Also constantly harassed on my time off or during school hours to come into work on my days off and during the times of school ours. Managers call you, staff peers call you and even staff that you have never met will call you to ask you to work for them."
bad,Management don't listen and too much favoritism with departments and the workers are shady and hella catty. The only good thing about working there was the 2people i met that i can call friends other ghan that my experience sucked
bad,"Worst Company I ever worked for.  Poor leadership, lack of communication and direction, poor training of Managers, fear based leadership, lack of recognition."
bad,"I worked for this company for almost 2 years. The managers have absolutely no respect for their employees and create a toxic and stressful environment. I really enjoyed working with the coworkers and the customers, but the managers made the job next to unbearable. I applied to new jobs almost the whole time I was there because the managers were such bullies, they made everyone feel unwelcome. I’ve always worked hard and helped people who needed help, but all the company cares about is opening credit cards and getting sales numbers. They couldn’t care less about how well you treat the customers, as long as you open credits because it benefits the managers. They pressure you into opening credit cards and then try to coach you on how to sell if you don’t meet their ridiculous goals. The whole time I was working there, only one manager would ask personal information about me in a caring manner and treat me with respect. I even had a manager push me one day because she didn’t like where I was standing. Please reconsidering applying for this job if you are. They treat their employees like absolute trash. I’ve never been so disrespected and so dehumanized in my life. If the schedule wasn’t so flexible, I would’ve left a long time ago."
bad,A lot of turnovers. Management treated you like dogs. Its not organized and all te equipment is outdated. They won't you to climb a 20 foot ladder to change light bulbs and it is very dangerous. To cheap to pay someone to come in and change them
bad,Stressful environment I would not refer anyone to work there ..my supervisor was very helpful but the manger was was racist I wouldn’t want anyone to work for him
bad,jon as a starter. you will not have any family life. they only care about getting folks to get credit cards and about faking that its a good environment to work in for corporate
bad,"Macy's started out good but now we have a store manager who is very unprofessional rude and inconsiderate.  He fired a co-worker while he was out of the country.  He will not get behind a register, he will not pick up anything from the floor,he will not fold .  He's always rewards the people who do less work but the ones who are constantly working never get rewarded"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Anything you do above and beyond your job won't be appreciated and will be quickly dismissed when you make a mistake. The job itself is easy but they expect you to be a super human. Fellow coworkers work their tails off and the managers can really care less. They just want it done.
bad,"Very unorganized, over worked, underpaid, and terrible any training ! Managers was okay but they was weird managers they never really had their stuff together and wasn’t really doing their job as managers training new comers!"
bad,Old malfunctioning equipment.  No training. Short shifts. Way to many managers who have no management skills at all. Not enough workers per shift  a day.
bad,"Not Sure why this is ask of me?? would rather not be writing this dont want to Spend Energy on this Review or Company, Was and Is a Stepping stone company with no Benefits Just Access to Clothing and things sold in stores"
bad,"Poor management, toxic work environment, all around terrible place to work. Managers never work with employees. Personal property means little to nothing to management/fellow employees."
bad,Managers pick and choice their favorites. All they talk about is credit applications. They fire employees without counseling them because Fl laws allow it. The Store Manager at my location was not approachable.
bad,"I didn't like this job, manager walk around but don't offer any help, they leave you drowning.  Also teamwork is lacking, I've dealt with a very long line by myself, when my co-worker was a few feet away."
bad,"Awful management nothing is organized a very very stressful environment. "
bad,"All management are ignorant and don't care at all about the employees, all they care about is selling and approaching queen center customers who half the time don't want to be helped! Most customers in that area are so rude!! The only good thing about working there was certain co workers that made work fun!"
bad,"I'm glad I got commission in my department, it was 2% of every sale you got, and was tacked onto each paycheck."
bad,"Very poor pay, very poor to zero training, unorganized, just not a good job to have. The discount you are promised is associated with a Macy's credit card that you must apply for, or a gift card. 20% off of overpriced items doesn't equate to much savings, and you're better off buying the same item elsewhere. Look, this just isn't a good job, but it's a place to get your feet wet if you want to get experience in the workforce. Retail is dead end. Go apply at Target, or Walmart, you'll make more money and have the same abysmal type of job."
bad,I worked here for one month as a seasonal associate. It was so disappointing. Hurting. Management rude not grateful for the help they get in low pay. I will never think of working again with Macy’s. Communication poor n treat you like dog. My bad experience working here.
bad,Very low opinion of Macys in Hilo Hawaii. The manager was very hard to deal with and eventually was demoted to regular asset protection detective until she actually quit.
bad,"Currently work in newly created Customer Service department,  which is an efficient method of handling complaints, problems, returns, order pick-up, bill payment, etc. While this creates a more pleasant environment for sales associates, this forces an unlucky few associates to handle angry, unhappy customers all day for no additional compensation. Low morale and burnout are common in this area."
bad,"If your in sales all Macys cares about is getting MACYS cards. They set really high goals and if you don't make it then your off to management. They expect the sales associates to do everything that's not even listed in the job description. The stressed of getting people to apply for a Macys card was so intense that some associates started making people up so they can get management off your back. I will say that Macys M.A.G.I.C workshop does help improving sells performance. "
bad,"I would not recommend working at Macy's.  The worst example of management applying ""Lead by Example"", that I have experienced in my 30 year work history.  This is NOT a team environment.  They are only interested in advancing themselves and never give credit where credit is due. Lack of respect for the employee's and the employee's are expected to perform ""miracles"" within their job assignment's when the proper tools are not given."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"The whole store needs to be restructured. Stop overlooking good employees for the ""popular"" ones. And most importantly stop using HR for lost and found and security issues. And train managers on actual conflict resolution. Bring HR back because the phone system is horrible! Stop being so cheap!"
bad,Expect to have most of your sales returned because Macy's will return anything for a customer including merchandise from other stores. Goals did not make sense. Constantly being pressured to open credit cards for people even thought they didn't want them.
bad,"I worked in visual merchandising and did not last 2 months, due to poor manager who had issues. It was a poor team to be a part of. Lots of attitude, was not welcomed, was not trained, was not explained about work load, it was all ""do do do"" with no insight as to what you were doing, no direction...if you ask questions, you get summoned. You have to lower yourself in order to be included in the team. Low morale, managers are uneducated and have been in the Macy's system too many years to know any difference. It was depressing to work there. Hated the job, glad its over. The store overall gossips, it's the worst environment I have ever come into contact with. If you are a carpenter or construction worker type, then work in visual. It is not at all what they make it out to be. You cannot use your talents. You are just a do-person, led by small minded managers who don't get it at all."
bad,Working at Macys is your typical retail with bad pay. Forced to meet macy card applications and individual sales goal. Has score card to evaluate employees in which sales and macy card applications are weighted heavily. if don't have a good score card wont get a raise and may get fired because of it.
bad,"The company was not organized and did not have a game plan."
bad,"At the Macy's on Riverside in Sherman Oaks if you are a seasonal employee you will NEVER get ANY hours. They only want you to work Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Christmas and you will never be able to work besides those 3 or 4 days. A total waste of time."
bad,"I used to love Macy's and what they stood for, but that has changed over the years. The management is non-existent. I have yet to have one manager come up and introduce themselves to me. The work environment is very clicky and it is hard to find anyone to trust and confide in about problems such as these. The training is spotty if you are lucky enough to get fully trained. Horrible experience."
bad,the customers can and will be as rude as possible and the management will let them even if its against policy for what the customer is asking. The customer wants the world you better give it to them or they will call and complain against you even if you can not meet their request because its impossible or unrealistic you better move the universe or the management will write you up and then fire you.
bad,"The sales floor was always a mess. No pricing on clothes most of the time.  Customers were always unhappy.  The technology was old and hard to use.  The pay was bad.  Scheduling was never correct,  Processes were not in place.  Break time was not enforced.    Associates were not empowered to help customers appropriately.  I hated every minute of working there."
bad,"They have no idea what they are doing at that place, And the pay is  not worth all the things that you have to do. The trainers don't know what they are doing , the supervisors in some departments are acting as if they are the manager and are in charge. It's not worth the headache . You work as hard as you can and the company feels as if a few cents is a good raise."
bad,Management is horrible. A very biased work place. The managers are very unprofessional. They don’t treat everyone fairly. They will want you to drop everything that you are doing just to accommodate their needs and they call you while you are at home any time of the day.
bad,the store manager will laugh with her colleagues but with others will talk down about cashiers *Cherry Creek store otherwise all other managers were amazing store manager very hostile with those below her
bad,"This company hires for holidays, after holidays cut hours  to around 3 hours per 2 week period so employees cannot afford to work there and just quit due to lack of hours regardless of how hard you work and loyalty."
bad,They don't teach you anything here and they don't care much for there employees. They work you till they need you and take your money with no fair hours
bad,"Strick Macy sales goals, vendor goals, and credit card goals. I felt they pressure you to finailze a sale. And petty retaliation of goals aren't met. Bad management, and cut throat environment"
bad,This was not a a good experience. There is zero support from the store manager or assistant manager. They do not seem like they are on the same page at all and they put unneeded stress on everyone because they do not help out on the floor at all.
bad,"Management never answers the phone and has too high expectations with very little staff and blames the customers’ complaints about not having a place to ring up their merchandise on the staff not being friendly enough. You work alone often and are left with being yelled at and belittled by customers for just trying to do your job and follow the policy, for the managers to come and give them whatever they want, making you look stupid."
bad,I only worked at Macy’s part time season.  The management was really rude and unhelpful and then rather criticize you for what you didn’t do then tell you what you should do .  And the employees were just as bad they were unhelpful because they felt threatened by new people.  Also we had to make a sales goal of $1000 a day which was hard for me to make since I was only there in the morning for four hours .  We worked like we were on commission but weren’t paid like we were on commission.
bad,"The work life balance doesn't exist for many"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I have nothing to add as I was not there long enough for fully understand how things worked around there, I do know that hours were inconsistent and never as many as promised, if there was a change in plans with something at the store they would call you and ask you to come in right away and they did not like the answer of no I can't. the staff members and department manager that I worked with were not too friendly or warm and they didn't tell you the full proper way to do things until you did it wrong."
bad,"very stressful, about people they are about the same, management just was there to receive a pay check the culture demeaning, dealing with the management not consistant, most enjoyable was most of the customers I deal with and my peers most were ok to work around we felt the same about the management inconsistancy"
bad,There is no opportunity to be a creative thinker. There is little to no training and when you do understand something you are made to feel stupid. Hard work is never appreciated and the company as a whole does not understand the modern customer. Upper management belittles and offends their middle management on a day to day basis.
bad,I left Macy's because the same position I held there opened at Nordstrom. I was hired and my pay increased by $4.00 per hour for doing the exact same job.
bad,"Awful work conditions. Underpaid workers. Executives are too chummy, resulting in promoting people who are not deserving, and leaving people with knowledge and experience behind. I've seen that on multiple occasions."
bad,"Macy's took over all May company stores 2005. Benefits were deleted or employee had to pay for benefit.  Our store had always been like a family; staff worked there for 10-20 years. once Macy's took over this was discouraged and  and began weeding out employees who had worked along time in the store."
bad,"I worked in management. While my coworkers were good people I have to say this is the most miserable job I have ever worked. Managers are salaried, overtime exempt, but that doesn't keep them from consistently having you stay for meetings, to MOD, cover closing manager lunches, or complete job tasks many hours past the time you were scheduled to work. They even criticized me for not coming in for a team-building lunch on my day off (which was unpaid), and tried to fire me when I got injured on the job."
bad,"Completed all processing and receiving activities in accordance with productivity standards timelines."
bad,"The management was horrible. Sometimes I'd get schedules to work for 2 hours a day. We were always so short staffed, sometimes I had to work alone for more than 5 hours. They would take money from you if you dont meet the quota. All in all, this place was horrible."
bad,You work your way up to senior management just to get demoted again. The pay at the senior management level was a livable wage but the workload was very stressful.
bad,I didn't care for the management.  They did not care about there employees.  Long hours during holiday. Very focus on upselling in the Jewelry department and developing a client base.
bad,"There is no connection between departments. Everyone blames one another for their own mistakes and no one is held accountable.  Nothing gets done and there's no solid system in place for communication. In addition, operations do a lot to make sure the store runs every day and does a lot of the dirty work, yet are treated the worst. An absolutely awful place to work. "
bad,the pay sucks and commission is really low. management isnt great. during holidays expect to work your butt off. discounts are good though especially during the holidays.
bad,The pay was good. But other than that everything was a complete disaster. They make it seem so high maintenance but in reality it's not. We just tape over holes and tears in boxes when we can just repack them. Not my style.
bad,A typical day at work is doing everything while the other managers are out goofing off. Staff would always call in and staff that would work worked double shifts and without breaks.
bad,Started at 9:45. Opened 4-5 registers.  Learned all I could about the products. Was able to use my creativity in assisting customers. Sales staff wonderful.
bad,"If you have a Family or want a life I would not Advise you to work here. Most of Management does not care about the employees,they will not listen to any of the problems that are going on.There is always some kind of Alternative facts they have for you too. They expect for you to do your job title as well as four others with no extra pay all while cutting hours."
bad,"people who work there was not nice, rude and not trustworthy.  Not a place you want to stay. they were rude to the customers and some just didn't do the work that they were supposed to be doing."
bad,During my time working at macy's i must say that i do not reccomend it to be a future employer for anyone. I receive little to no hours and low pay each week. i also do not enjoy the company of some of the workers i work with.
bad,Terrible company to work for! There is absolutely no job advancement opportunities and the only people they promote are the favorites. Working hard means absolutely nothing there and even though they'll give you speech about how its a family it's not!It's a terrible company where you will waste you're time and intelligence. Run before you even start!
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,they were more concerned with money than employees. They reduced the size of the merchandising and operational tasks and it hindered work to be completed timely.
bad,"Commission draw.  OMG.  You have to work to pay yourself.  If you don't sell enough to cover your ""draw"" (pay), you wind up owing THEM money.  I spent one holiday season working in the women's shoe department.  I was treated like snot by the ""real"" employees. Laughing at you when you got one of ""those"" customers, no assistance whatsoever, and ringing up your sales under their own number when you weren't looking.  Since the commission atmosphere is so vile, you also have to put up with employees from other departments in your face when a customer checks out all at once with you with an item from another commissioned area.  For example, a woman finds a purse she likes, goes over to shoes to find something to match, buys both at the same time.  Now you have the purse salesperson howling that you ""stole"" their commission.  No mention of the hundred times it went the other way, right?  No teamwork whatsoever.  You can't have commissioned employees AND teamwork both, no matter what Macy's pretends.  Small wonder their stores are all closing.  "
bad,"I have never experienced a job so terrible. The level of disrespect i saw MANAGERS, not just associates, but MANAGERS treat customers made my skin crawl. They do not resoect their employees. Everyone is just a barcode to them"
bad,Senior leadership really does not have a plan to stop the bleeding of sales besides cutting costs.  Constantly asked to do more with less.  Not a place to build a future career.
bad,"A store and company that bug you will get lost in the shuffle. No one has time to develop or train you, for me I was literally in my own for a year. The turn over with managers is extremely high so you will always be understaffed meaning they will iverveork those of you that haven't left yet. The assiocate are apart of a union and HR bends over backward to ensure their happiness but as executives you find that there is zero support for your engagement. I had an assiocate curse me out of the selling floor in front of customers and nothing was done about it."
bad,The work/life balance at this company was basically nonexistent.  Employees are often contacted by management/vendors while on their vacations.  All work functions are expected to take precedence  even over planned vacations.  There is no respect for an employees personal time.
bad,"I was a manager for almost 5 years with Macy's, the company doesn't care about the ""store level"" people.  l've had great store mangers and horrible ones. It's always one of the extremes. People don't matter and are completely expendable.  Do not work there."
bad,Hours were good. Management worked with you. Employees where easy to talk to an work with. I didn't have any issues working there. I like that it was fast paced
bad,I loved the Macy's brand and the overall experience i'm getting but the company needs help with a lot. The Executives is very unprofessional and they look down on the associates. The store manager awards and appreciates the managers and customers more than the hard working employees.
bad,The hardest part of this job was that nobody took the time to train me. So i was going into projects and having the learn as I went along. My coworkers all had 15-20 years experience. They could have been a lil more considerate.
bad,"I would not recommend working for this company. Employees are not appreciated. Managers are terrible, environment is terrible, hours are terrible. low wage and no benefits."
bad,"The experience was good. Allowed you to realize not everyone is good and will treat you the same way you treat them. But I'll never recommend someone to work at the location I worked. They are the worst! "
bad,"I did not feel that I received enough training here to do my job effectively, and was frequently pulled to work in areas that I was not trained in at all. It was very stressful and poorly organized."
bad,"The company culture has gone down hill . As a salaried excecutive it was always about helping other managers with a lower skill set. When you brought concerns to the store manager. Her response was you need to talk to that person. The store manager was concerned with individual growth, only herself. Company only cares about money, not the associates."
bad,A failing retailer that didn't want to promote or pay their employees much more than they had to. Left managers with too much on their plate to even handle the people in their department.
bad,"Very friendly people"
bad,"I have been working at Macy's for 4 years and I have seen some good day and bad days. The workplace culture is not for people that want to move up in the business. The most enjoyable part is my coworkers. I like some mangers because they understand what the associates goes though. I have learned that this job is only for young  adults not good for adults that have to pay bills, its only good for adults during the Holiday season for extra."
bad,rude people no job security.. favor people they like and rude to others and they are lazy co workers management is great but who want to complain....just do my job and go home...
bad,"Doesn't pay enough for the harassment you take from customers .Management doesn't back you with customer issues. Crazy shifts, open, close, midnights around holidays, etc."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Way to much work for the amount of pay. District team team suck. Will put you in a position without proper training and when told your advised to either stay or leave because your not going to get an training or development.
bad,"The workers are nice people, however some management are rude and unwilling to work with sales associates. They over stress their credit card and most coupons do not work on name brand items, which is what most customers want the discounts on."
bad,You have the opportunity to learn how to approach a sale and follow through with making a closed sale. constant daily sales goals can be very overwhelming.
bad,I applied for a job interview at Macy's for the first time. Sent me all over the mall for no reason.no one helper me and they were all over the place.
bad,"Everyone is pretty much miserable and for the amount of work you do you still only make about minimum wage. Management looks down on you and act like they're better because they're youre boss. There is a lot of drama as well. We also rarely ever worked a full 20 hours, there was never enough hours to go around."
bad,Macys is a very consumer geared company to work for. New and exciting benefits are created for customers every season! I enjoyed all of the visually appealing orgazagional structure in each of the departments.
bad,"after being an employee for this company for over eight years, i have decided to find something more meaningful outside of retail. my job as a support associate is way to stressful and it has compromised my health and well being. from having to maintain the selling floor to managing the stockroom, i find my life to be unfulfilled and cumbersome."
bad,didn't like working there...mangers would be so stressed out and snap on the workers. They didn't care about the workers at all.
bad,"Under payed for the expectations of daily work. Never had enough coverage and I was usually by myself even on busy days. I was to cash people out, answer the phone, put away cloths, organize the floor, and assist anyone who need help."
bad,"I would never allow someone I know to work in such a degrading place, and it was only after I worked there, that I learned the truth about the company, and how they really felt about their shoppers. The company degrades their workers, and managers stand by and let other staff degrade and belittle other staff members. When you first start, its all fine and dandy, but as time continues, you learn the truth about the company, and how bad it really is."
bad,"I've worked at the company on the digital side for nearly 10 years. A decade ago, it was a fun place to work and had the feeling of a much smaller company. Advancement was fast and it didn't feel like working at a large retailer. As the corporation moved to join the store and digital organizations over the last 10 years, the company has gotten slower, less innovative and much more bureaucratic. Now that the two organizations are fully integrated, we're all so silo'd into our distinct areas of business that people have lost sight of the goal of satisfying customers with a quality product. People have become less cooperative and instead protective of the small kingdoms of which they retain control. I now feel as though I understand what it's like to work for the federal government."
bad,"Do not work the dock the pay is $7.45 and less than 10 hours a week management is a joke, overall hiring takes long the online courses are point less and waste of time I asked to work the sales floor countless times never got a word back overall very depressing and dull. the location is outdated (river town mall)"
bad,"There was a lack of management skills and structure. Like most retail jobs, if you were not one of the managers favorites then it was hard for you to move up in positions. The one thing I did like was the scheduling system because you can pick up or give away your hours."
bad,"Perfect place to get your retail training."
bad,"Most of the management staff seemed to be driven by friendships, favoritism, emotions, and what I mean by that is that if they were friendly with someone they were more likely to get time off as they pleased or work where they prefered. They were unorganized and uninformative most of the time. The staff meetings in the morning were not very informative either, just statistics of sales and sales expectations which did not do much for moral. In my opinion there was not really a great part of the job, maybe it just wasn't for me. It was very simple and very repetitive."
bad,"Macy's is definitely one of the worst places to work. I am a full-time college student who has a very busy schedule, and I often found myself working two jobs. Every week schedules are randomly assigned and they never stay constant. You really have to be on top of your schedule in order to make sure you get the days off that you need. If you're in a small department like I was in Men's Shoes, you're pretty much screwed because there is no one to pick up your hours. You should also be prepared to receive phone calls on your days off to pick up shifts for people who called out. Macy's is almost always understaffed and has a high turnover rate which makes the job that much more stressful. Management could care less about you and your schedule issues, and only talk with you about reaching your sales goals and opening credits. HR is an absolute joke and they do not give you proper guidance. I ended up leaving without receiving the PTO that I earned working the previous year during the holidays. Also, be aware that if you are running late or have to call out of a shift you will lose points, and once you hit 0 points you will be fired. There have been multiple occasions when HR would call up a coworker of mine and fire them in the middle of their shift and asked them to leave immediately. There will also be random weekends where a sale pops up and you are assigned a shift only 2 days in advance (so much for being in charge of your schedule). I worked for Macy's for almost 2 years, and the only thing that kept me there was the need for money and my awesome coworkers. Macy's may be a"
bad,"open the department by doing shoe inventory."
bad,"this is good for a person who has never had a job and wants experience , and even to build up their resume.  I use to work at the Macys at Herald square for 4 years.  I worked on a floor that had  a bunch of lazy co workers and only like 6 people who were hard working.  They would lend a hand, when they saw you struggling with restocking stock rooms. There were times when both of my managers would see people not working but , wouldn't say anything unless their boss was on their case. Management was not always encouraging of growth and moving on to other departments. So I eventually left."
bad,"I was hired on as a seasonal worker a few years back. I thought this would be a decent job to make some extra money during the holidays at a store I have always loved. When I was hired on, I was told by HR that I could fill different roles depending on the daily needs of the store.One of which would be retail salesman which I was the most excited for. The entire experience  was miserable from day one, I was never given the chance to work retail,the majority of the time I was stuck in the freezing cold loading dock area. Other times I was sent out to do tasks of which I received absolutely no training to do. Such as mailing out shipping orders,installing light fixtures,setting up display pieces,changing the lights,shoveling the sidewalks after snow, Management was extremely unhelpful and condescending. I was never given a clear schedule to work each week,it was just  whenever they felt like calling me to come in at any random time of the day. The managers clearly looked down on the ""processors"" and treated us with absolutely no respect. Eventually I was just taken off of the schedule and never called back in,I never received a call/email or anything to tell me I was fired or laid off they simply stopped responding to me. The only positive I took from the job was the employee discount which I frequently used. This however did not make up for everything else that was bad about the position. All in all it  was a good learning experience for me and something I would never recommend to anyone else."
bad,"Macy's was a job that I had taken because I am a single mother with a special needs son."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,minimum wage for maximum effort and performance. the rudest and most snobby customers in retail. Racist and unorganized management. DO NOT WORK HERE. RUN
bad,"Not so great benefits, but very flexible with hours. Had to comepete with full-timers who always wanted the sell, because they got commission."
bad,"Macy's is not a healthy environment for any candidate trying to peruse a long time career goal. Poor Management, no opportunity for worker relations, poor worker involvement, throw away culture, poor pay, exploitative work style"
bad,"Probably one of the worst companies i have personally been employed for. This job really is only for students that are fresh out of high school or for students that want some extra pocket change. They rarely give out hours, but when they do its simply out of the blue without any warning and expect you to show up."
bad,"-Great image during the holidays"
bad,"Very busy environment , under staffed and lazy employees and managers. Be prepared to be the only person doing work if you have a good work ethic and if your a lazy worker than you'd love that place especially if you work in woman's shoes."
bad,"this job is very easy, takes no skill to be employed. a typical day at Macy's Logistics and Operations consists of a morning meeting. After the meeting you go to your assigned area and continue to do the same thing day in and day out. whether its inducting products, picking, packing, or shipping its a very tedious job. Very few of the managers are willing to help in any way. The co-workers are just as bad. Its a bunch of grown adults complaining about how others work. Which in turn becomes the hardest part of the job, dealing with your co-workers. I would not recommend this job to anyone. I have had so many problems with the company and I have worked here for over a year. The main reason I want another job is because they have a hard time with paying you correctly. they always short my checks. It is extremely hard to move up in the company or even get a full time position. "
bad,"I worked with many nice and peppy people, but the AST manager here is moody, unprofessional, overly critical, passive-aggressive and two faced. The job was the worst job I ever had."
bad,I will never work for Macys again. They had very disgusting attitudes and did not treat new workers fairly. some of my co-workers were nice. I learned how to keep my feelings aside and get the job done. Even if I didn't like my work environment I never showed it.
bad,"Full of leaders who belong in the circus, and the people under are brown nosers and clowns. If you dont mind which most dont goahead and apply! Good luck to you!"
bad,"Every day was the same as far as job function, but different because of the customers."
bad,"The management here is all over the place, everyone is gunning for each others jobs and talking poorly about their teams. There is no room for advancement, unless you come in as a VP. Working here allows for no creativity and everything is done as it was for the past 20 years, they discourage any new ways of thinking. The marketing department is a disaster that needs to be restructured and cleaned up ASAP. The office itself is covered in mold, and there is no regard for employee safety or health. Steer clear of the marketing team"
bad,A typical would be I go in a 6:30 am I stock all the products that needs to be restocked then I take the extra stock that we cant use and put it back in the stockroom the management are very professional makes sure you get the job done the job is pretty simple not really any hard part the most enjoyable part is the work
bad,Do not work at this store.  The store manager is absolutely clueless and roams around like a possed monster.  Too many divas and not enough Indians make for uncomfortable environment.  Oh my gosh the operations manager is so bi-polar that I am shocked no one has sat her down to administer medication.  This is their district store too and it runs like Barnum and Bailey Circus.
bad,They abuse their employees by making them work crazy hours.
bad,The worst management Yonkers ny discrimination work saftey issues lo.g hour no advancement.executive office unresponsive poor floor and department management especially in cosmetics uneducated no manners no integrity.
bad,They put you in whatever position they feel not what you applied for. Only look out for their own or whomever flirts with them. My management only looks out for the Puerto Ricans like hisself and the other manager has a thing for spanish women so he lets them sit in the office doing no work and finds a permanent position for them because he finds them good looking. Very inappropriate environment.
bad,"Working for this company started great till audits and unskilled partners with no sense of urgent. Results came and executive were chop. LIFO (last in first out) this seems to work just great.  "
bad,"The only thing I could stand is the co-workers because the managers belittle you and only care if you are making loyalties. One of my friends tried to apply and the manager constantly cut her off not even giving her a chance to speak about her qualifications. For some Macys is their only means of employment take it too seriously and its sad. I dont understand how people can survive off of 8, 9 dollars. Management is two faced. Hardest part of job: Acting like you are busy when there are no customers and the area is spot clean. I need to find something where I am constantly being challenged and I am treated like an equal because I am too overqualified for this place. "
bad,Management very unprofessional. Procedures were not followed. Management not on the same page. Lots of confusion. Enjoyed some of my co-workers. Hardest part was standing for 8 hours everyday.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Macy's is just horrible. If you are part of the flex team, you rarely get hours. I had a nice schedule up til the beginning of 2013. I've not worked since 01/13/2013. They are on their 3rd MTM since I started in June 2011. The first one cheats with other employees, the second one is incompetent and lies about you, the third one pretends you don't exist. I don't even get hours anymore but they won't fire me. Looks like I need to file unemployment. Retail is a thankless job."
bad,I worked for this company for almost one year. I came to work and made sure that I put all merchandise out and made sure that my Levi area stayed clean. I would stay late until my work was completed. I always did what I was ask and never complained. I loved my immediate supervisor that would come in once a week to help me but unfortunately I was let go on a technicality. I enjoyed my co-workers and we all help each other to make sale golas. The hardest part of the job was dealing witht the lack of professionalism by management.
bad,"In the women's shoes department I mostly cleaned up after customers (wow they are messy), rang them up at the register and pretty much ran and searched for shoes the whole day."
bad,all the company cares about is how much money they can make
bad,I worked there for 3 years at Columbus Ohio east land store and no employees are happy there. Management does not care about employees. Not a good place to work. High turn around rate at this location for a reason
bad,Its Macy's..Not good..and not bad there is no room for advancement
bad,"As a support associate, you are expected to do everything, and given little to no training for the tasks you are expected to preform daily. You are expected to be on call on every holiday and weekend, while they often drop your hours on other days, leaving you with small paychecks week after week despite sacrificing your holidays and weekends. Management lies about extra pay for working on holidays and overnight, the only way to get extra pay is by working over 40 hours, which is rare as they only hire people in on-call positions. You are forced to work in poor conditions without proper safety equipment, including bactstocking in dark rooms with little to no lighting and broken ladders and moving heavy fixtures without proper moving equipment. The only upside is it is a difficult job to lose, their lax enforcement of their own rules makes it so that people are rarely fired."
bad,Between all your employees observations and globally taking care of the floors actually having time to check in with your team was challenging. I learned a ton with the off the floor executive training but paid consequences for the time off floor. Upper Management attempt their best to be approachable and manage to get through a uncomfortable hello in a elevator ride down to the floor. Although they pride themselves on what matters most they penalize you for your associates but rarely if ask you personally what you feel. For example I had a family emergency got my shift covered but my workload doubled when I returned. Besides working six day work days the only thing I miss are my vendors that actually brightened my day.
bad,I put out merchandise out in the petite/women suits department. Everything was always changing daily. There wasn't any good communication skills there at all. Hourly pay wasn't good at all.
bad,"low pay, not great management, worked am shift,coworkers were not team players"
bad,Macy's does not care about providing good customer service. They have made too many personnel cuts and have cut many services such as gift wrap and a personal shopper @ the Montgomery store.
bad,"Worked in the jewelry dept too many bosses from dept heads to manage to loss prevention, too many rules concerning the dept , when counts were done not correctly and there was an explanation for ,did not seem to matter"
bad,The store manager was a bully. My leads department always made my team look bad and lie on us soo she can look good. There was no fairness on working there. They show too much favoritism in the Trumbull Connecticut Macy.
bad,"MACYS is a powerful recognizable brand in the industry, however in my market this is the neglected store. This store has zero leadership, direction or accountability. My overall experience in this store was one of yearning for leadership. Several employees in the store who have dedicated their entire lives... I’m talking 40 years of service, to be left unfulfilled! No advancement! No recognition! Noreward. Most of them are living paycheck to paycheck and could have hardly pay their bills or have any work life balance that’s rewarding and can sustain their family lives"
bad,Stonecrest macys is the worst store manager has no personality the security there is a big joke. Macy's doesn't care at all about their employees macys have changed so much over the years it's not a good company to work for anymore
bad,"The work environment is unpredictable. Unpredictable isn't always bad but in this case they'll ask you to do a job, just so that 3 days later they change they're minds. They hired 50 employees to do a job but then train them to do another job without giving existing employees the opportunity to apply and grow within the company. We had a lot of changes happen the last year and renovations in the building without any investments in the actual culture of the company; just to find out that they are closing down the call center."
bad,"Ha, when do I start, this place was the worse job I’ve had in a long time. The job it self was very easy, BUT management didn’t care about the employees well in my department he didn’t. The pay was way too low for me to have the experience I have and the place was soooo dirty. Them restrooms were always nasty, so bad that I went a whole 10 hour shift without using the restroom."
bad,They do not value hard working dependable people!! That place is like being in high school even the managers act part take in the foolishness. Sad environment
bad,"The store manager have her favorite people, she is not fair and she professional."
bad,I disliked I'll treatment since there was no accommodation for short term disability and rather harassment.The associate working with me were good and helpful.
bad,Didnt really like the work there it paid ok but there was never enough work so we stood around alot and didnt do anything and the supervisors never really told us how 2 do things right and the people were not very welcoming to new employees
bad,"Macy's Human Resources seems to have no idea what is ACTUALLY going on in the stores.  "
bad,"It was not a fair work place. So hard work, without holidays, weekends, no sick day, and very low payments. not a nice place to work. not recommended to an educated person."
bad,"I no longer work at Macys, I gave that company 8 years and years without hardly any recognition but they always relied on me to train people including lower managers even when I was just a sales person , raises were horrible. Another Competitive retailer recruited me and offered me a much higher pay rate that Macys could never match. Lets say that I'm much more appreciated for my hard work arecognized and"
bad,"District and regional management were horrible. When they showed up at store they always said they were going to spend  sometime with hourly associates, but never did. The training was a joke in my department, we always had to ask for clarification on some of the policies."
bad,"There is no open door policy, even if you get them to hear you there is no follow through only lip service    management will not help you achieve or support your goals but they expect you to help them achieve theirs   There is no accountability for employees who do nothing  no reprimand only a few actually do their job  but the ones that don’t are treated the same as the ones that are motivated to do the tasks they were hired for  worse place I’ve ever worked"
bad,"Better upper management, that actually care about their employees. Moving up the ladder shouldn’t depend on color, race , religion or background. A good clean cleaning of upper management is very badly needed"
bad,Macy's is a great company and has good values but the managers and supervisors does not elevate themselves to it. There are very few  management's and supervisors that was fair and is able to appreciate an employee. Always playing favorites and not letting the other employees being able to better themselves into other roles. I will never work there again.
bad,"Worked at several Macy’s locations. Each culture is as different as the location and high turn over of managers."
bad,"People have literally died on my shift. There is no accountability for toxic behavior people scream and curse at each other within earshot of supervisors and they do nothing. All that matters is production numbers and theft and on those points, you're treated as guilty until proven so."
bad,Not a good job. No clear instructions. Never knew when I’d work next. Never had on floor training. No one was welcoming or nice to me. Everyone was very entitled.
bad,"Don’t try to be social or fit in, they will eventually eat you up like a bunch of sharks. Just focus on what you were hired to do. Middle management have no technical/engineering experience and should not be in certain Engineering management roles. Get rid Of cocky wanna be management introverted engineers, that call the shots because they are the middle management favorite."
bad,"You can’t run the store from you’re desk & cell phone, a lot of tenure employees but they don’t know how to talk to employees, when you’re on lunch they try and get you to work while you’re off the clock. “It happen to me” I’f you say no retaliation is in their mind. Very immature management  staff. Store manager takes the customer side over you, what ever the customer says about you and if the customer makes up statements that you did not say....store manager will believe the customer...no support from store manager. Looks like he threw the race card to get where he is because he has no idea on running a respectable store. Drama and assumptions in this store environment. Not A Good place to work. No support at all from the #bigoak"
bad,"I am a very accomplished Asset Protection Investigator with over 5 years experience in AP, 6 years experience in Private Security, a Bachelors degree in Criminal Justice, and my ORC Investigators Board Certification. I wanted an A.P. Detective position but they just did a full recruitment and filled all of the positions. As most retail establishments are doing, they terminated the AP Manager and placed an Operations Manager to run the Security program who knew absolutely NOTHING about retail security. I got hired on as a Security Guard. I was supposed to just stand at the front of the mall entrance and communicate suspicious shoppers. Think about that, report SUSPICIOUS shoppers!! 🤔 Only behavioral indicators can deem a person to be ""suspicious,"" NOT how they look!!! You have to FIRST open up an investigation on a shopper by watching their shopping behavior, you observe any alert signals they may give off, THEN deem them as acting SUSPICIOUS. TRUTH #1: Macy's racially profiles shoppers! TRUTH #2: The newly hired Ops/AP manager hired 6 new Detectives, ALL whom had ZERO experience in Asset Protections and Security. The Manager ended up telling ME (a Security Guard w a lower salary than everyone else) to train them all since she, and them, did not know anything about A.P. work. TRUTH #3: Taking into consideration the Manager knew nothing about A.P., she hired a bunch of ghetto rejects as Detectives. Numerous times they came in drunk and/or hungover from a previous night of partying. TRUTH #4: Since these new Detectives had limited skills, I had to teach them how to write a simple"
bad,offered a position supervisor was aware I would need training.  only given 1 half a day on floor training. No support from supervisor or floor manager
bad,"Macy's culture is terrible, it is predicated on using employees instead of empowering them. Their commission system is draw based meaning if you don't sell enough you not only don't receive commission to that week but have a deficit balance on your commission account. That means until that balance is paid off you won't receive the commission you worked for."
bad,"I worked for Macy’s a few years. Unfortunately none of the managers no longer care about your well being. Be prepared to only be answered how many credits you got throughout the whole day. The new store manager is only concerned about credit too. Unfortunately if you do have any issues hr is going to be your only hope. Your not paid much. At one time Macy’s had amazing managers and now it’s going downhill. I’m looking for new work. Most faithful old employees have moved on or planning to move on. Macy’s is going to be screwed during holiday season because all the usual help is gone.the very best managers. No one in the store has received a a raise, FYI most managers there don’t even deserve the position, most don’t know what associate know how to do."
bad,I worked here for ONE day and never returned. I was trained for like an hour left alone I realized I was the only open register in the whole store....... while everyone else was “cleaning” “folding clothes” I had a long line. I was struggling and asked if someone could train me the rude lady told the women in charge she isn’t training. When I told them 2 people wanted to open cards and that I couldn’t do it they got mad. This place is a joke
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Crazy music makes people crazy, with terrible technology and under-staffed."
bad,"What I saw some of my co-workers experience with the racist way the korean population that works at this store treats non-korean employees was despicable.  "
bad,Don’t do it - pay is horrible .   Everybody pays bettter they Macy’s .  If you want a life go applied elsewhere. Fairview hts store is a disaster waiting to happen. The store manager should be replace ASAP . Treats employees like they are her emeries.  Macy’s store manager please remember we are humans and we don’t with a collar that u can Yank anytime you want.
bad,If you want to work for macys ask for a part time and make sure u have a second job .. You tell them the days you cant work (school - transportation - second job) they dont care they will automatically put u on the days you cant work .. Never enough help when ever your on the department floor .. Management really sucks .. Manager and associate comes and go you never really know who is in charge pf the department floor to assit with a custumer. ... I know its business bit manger will always always say a custumer is always right even if the customer is wrong ... The customer will curse at you throw clothes at you will put a tantrum if dicounts dont go through and you with the rules the manager tell you but will make you look bad infront of the customer ... This jobs require alot of patient
bad,I describe the Macy’s enterprise as the Titanic in this day and age! Great for a part-time job for someone who doesn’t need a career or real salary. Manage not professional and has favorites. No place to move up. It took 20 years to make a descent income!
bad,"This place is like high school all over again with all the drama. Managers and supervisors hook up with employees and employees hooking up with other employees. It's nasty. Some supervisors were really kind and appreciative and others have their favorites that could do no wrong. The pay is below where it should be  for the amount of work you have to do, especially during peak."
bad,"Management is terrible. "
bad,When I first started Macy’s in the parks mall in Arlington Texas was good. After a couple of months they started hiring and firing the management so the new ones they hired such as corenza the Oreo was always all over a employee names joe. She was only giving hours to the guys and leaving the ladies with less then 15 hours a week. We were getting new management every other week. I was working in the dock. Sometimes when I would go on the floor to put stuff away and the cashiers were so rude to the customers. I would report it to the head honchos but they didint do anything  about it. Just because they been there more then 20 yrs. so as you can see working at this specific location was not good. That’s my experience.
bad,Well they work you like a dog every day and don’t even get me started about those credit cards you can get 3 in a day and all they care about is the next day they don’t even care if they’re no customers like how am I supposed to get one if there is no one here
bad,"Their pay is minimal for all positions, store manager is volatile in Wellington "
bad,"The stores are dying, there was hardly any business if it wasn’t near Christmas. Because of this, they can’t afford to pay many employees. One person would be in charge of 1/2 of the floor, running 5 or 6 cash registers at a time. There could be two customers in opposite corners, and one employee would be in charge of helping both of them. Pay is awful, and “full time” was 26 hours. Management is terrible."
bad,"This place is not terrible if you need a paycheck, it’s just not a place to stay long term. Watch your back and be aware of your surroundings. Lots of weirdos here and they def don’t do background checks."
bad,"To them people are only numbers, the highest the title the less work and more money they make and they really try hard to show and pretend they are working hard but thruly all the sales people on the floor who are working hard long hours standing up making the difference."
bad,"This is a horrible place to work.  Wages are subpar for Sonoma County and raises are in .50 increments every six-months.  At $11 per hour several employees live in homeless shelters, I know this because I was one of them.  Managers reward employees for bad and lazy behavior."
bad,"Expected to do to much + outside of your field work.They pay low for high risks, expensive benefits, 1 week pto after a year, no advancement. Better catch shoplifters often and never make a mistake or you're fired. Some days are boring, some days fast paced. Management has it's own back and will throw you under the"
bad,"PLEASE don't apply for a job at this location. Most of the management team members are unprofessional, unreliable and rude. Employees are treated with ZERO respect and are expected to do many duties for very little pay and overworking them. Furniture that is brought back into the warehouse is thrown around carelessly, dragged all over the grime, dirt, dust covered floor (There is asbestos in the building as well, very unhealthy). USED furniture is ""reconditioned"" and resold for an expensive price. This location used to be amazing and staff was very kind and humbling. Purchasing furniture was worth it until the new director, owners and managers took over. It's become a hellhole and I wouldn't be surprised if this place was shutdown or investigated. Most of the colleagues I had worked with had MANY countless stories of the managers mistreating and humiliating their employees and ""throwing them under the bus"" and lie to the director just to protect themselves from him and secure their job. I feel terrible for the employees that are still working there as this job is the only source of income they have. This Macy's is ALWAYS HIRING and just as fast as they hire you, they will drop you. I've seen so many new faces and a few days or weeks later they are gone. That's not normal for a company to be doing that and it truly shows that something is not right. I left this place been since mid May and I've never been happier. "
bad,"I was diagnosed with MS  and my MTM treated me very unfairly, disrespected me constantly pressuring to quit telling me to go on disability because I can’t work as hard as I used to. I worked very hard for 7 years I was employed. I went over and beyond every single day of the week . It broke my heart to know the store may and HR manager tolerated her behavior and actions. They were and still remains a disgrace to Macys."
bad,"If you are not in the ""group""  then it doesn't matter how hard or even better than any of them   you won't get hired on!!   It's a lot to learn all at once but really once you have   the night flies by while you steady making them and yourself money's"
bad,"applied for reset support job, received everything but that job. I was a ""flex"" position because it sounded good for school/work life, well i was wrong. I worked 6 days a week, Received 40 hours a week with 0 benefits, was told they couldnt hire me full time but always got 40 hours. my pay was trash, i was paid 9$ an hour but was put mainly on truck. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"The best part of working with Macy's is interacting with customers.  The customers are amazing.  Why they continue to shop there is beyond me.  Macy's doesn't care about the safety of their associates or customers.  When there is a safety issue it literally has to be taken to about 5 managers before something is reluctantly done."
bad,"The place is dirty, covered in dust, rats running around everywhere overall very unsanitary. Managers are quick to snap when you call and ask for help while trying to help a customer. If you work full time it is  extremely frustrating and difficult to try to enjoy your personal life working 35+ hours a week which includes weekends with only one day off barely leaves you time for yourself. Scheduling isn’t thought through, I have many days where I have a closing shift and then an early opening  shift the next day. Unrealistic credit goals for departments is another issue because many days Days the store is dead. There is also no extra recognition or compensation for the hard work we do, assisting difficult customers and doing the most for them is called making Macy’s “magic”. Magic doesn’t convert into money so I couldn’t care less"
bad,"It doesn’t matter how hard you work, you’ll never be anything. Managers are trash. Employees are ghetto. Managers sit in the office all day! They only care about the company when there is a visit from corporate. Don’t ever complain about anything, you will be on the list. The list is for people who don’t accept anything."
bad,Way too much stress and way too little training for executive positions. Poor leadership and little work/life balance for pay grade. Overtime is restricted year round with the exception of holiday season.
bad,"Macy’s is losing money by the second and cuts positions after not even breaking even after the holiday season. Poor management, including upper management. High sales goals are not attainable since there are no customers normally."
bad,"I was hired on as an Merchandise Team Manager and it was literally the worst job I've ever had. There is very little diversity in upper management, so I was an outcast. The other managers acted like Mean Girls and talked about and conspired behind my back. I was so happy when they told me I was getting laid off due to changes in the management structure."
bad,"Unlimited work, limited pay and opportunity to advance. Living wage is not attainable. Was considered general labor / the help. I made 20 cents per hour less in 1985."
bad,"They do not pay you anywhere close to enough for the cost of living! "
bad,"The company is failing.                                                              The company had great potential, but started to sacrifice engagement and safety to hire more people. The company fiercely retaliates against any person who challenges the status quo."
bad,"Management does not recognize any fashion of prior experience unless it is within the organization. "
bad,"Unprofessional, inexperienced Management, messy employees and BS pay. I thought Macy's would be more upscale and professional WRONG! Typical nonsense."
bad,"It was great at first, I really like the people I worked with. I found myself running around the store trying to fill online orders, doing recovery and helping rude customers. The manger would hound you to open credit cards all week. That was pretty much the only time I saw my manager. She would sit in her office and overhead page you. Management really is a joke.  Half the time your lucky if you can even take a 15 min break. If it wasn't for some of the people that worked there I would have been gone. Don't waste your time, I found a better job that pays more and management cares about me."
bad,If this is your first time in the asset protection field Macy's is a horrible place to work because of the inadequate training and structure system they have up there is zero training you're just thrown into the field to try to fend for your own and are held responsible for all productivity or errors that may acquire while out there.
bad,To much to say. You see the star rating. Really dont have much to say about a company who is so big on integrity. that doesn't own their role. Got co workers thinking there the boss. Pay sucks for all you have to do. Pay raises are a range from 1 cent to 45 cent. Annually . people have been there since they have open and still aint making 12 dollars.
bad,Paid very little for the amount of work given. Stressful. Not enough employees for the amount of work. Laid off many employees that had worked there for years and had been loyal.
bad,Did not provide proper training or tools for job. Managers repeatedly answer questions with either its no big deal or don't worry about the long lines. Very unorganized and unprofessional.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,some of the staff was nice others acted like they owned the place or like they didnt have to do anything but boss you around. they watch you alot and if you talk to other workers then that means your not working. they dont believe you can multi task but they can. alot of the managers quit and went else were because of how things are being ran now its totally different than it was and thats for the worse not better.
bad,"Managers don’t cover registers with enough employees to reduce stress and adequately meet needs of customers. Many registers are left vacant causing frustration for customers and overworking sales associates. "
bad,"Practice age discrimmination. Worked for the company for 23 years and worked an adverage of 45 hours a week and it meant nothing."
bad,"Working at Macy's was unfair and depressing. Even though the actual work was easy, management was terrible. Most of the employees never hit production and were never addressed on their poor work ethic."
bad,"I was hired as temporary part time employee, 10-15 hours per week.   Late November I was scheduled for ten 4 hour days in a row, including the day before Thanksgiving, Thankgiving and the 2 days following.  No prior communication was given.  When I told HR rep that I could not work those hours but could continue to work the part time hours I was hired for, there was no further communication from my manager or HR rep.  They just stopped scheduling hours for me (which I found out through their website).  No further written, oral explanation was provided."
bad,"TERRIBLE WORK PLACE! Favoritism was shown , management was terrible, no work/life balance, managers didn’t listen to your concerns, terrible pay. Negative workplace"
bad,"Not much to say, other than the company is strictly concerned with stockholders' profits. They could simply not care less about anything that happens in the stores. Horrible."
bad,Just wasn't for me I wasn't happy not in my field just to many miles you walk and climbing that short latter is nothing I'm use to.Would not tell anyone to work there.
bad,"Not a bad place to work, as long as you don't get sick.  As soon as you do, you have a target on your back and you're on the way out whether you know it or not."
bad,"Racist, hateful, Gossips everywhere, Kniving, bullying, Jealous insecure Bosses and Co workers that are miserable... Admitted to it.. Then try to take your happiness away by firing you for nothing.. Lie about their wrongs... Take no responsibility for their stuff.... Put it all on you.. Because they can.. Pay not enough 4 a one bedroom apt even.. Enslave you.. Attack your self worth/esteem/pride/dignity.. The list goes on. Its obvious Karma will come back to them in a major way."
bad,"Management does not care."
bad,Own a great work place but they sent in a manager to cut costs so he did by getting rid of staff. I would not recommend this company. The drive to make credit card goals makes for a bad work environment especially if you have any morals.
bad,"Disorganized environment. Everyone tells you different things when you ask them questions. Policies are changed, and not everyone is updated. They tell you that if an item is on a rack for a certain price that you have to sell it for that price. But when you do, they try to accuse you of stealing. Their prices on the racks and in the system are often not the same, so you have to guess what you should sell it for, because they don't know. Then blame you if it's wrong. Not enough money for what they take you through. I have never experienced being treated like a criminal from an employer until working for these people. The only positive thing, is that most people are nice, but unfortunately misinformed."
bad,"They are cutting hours. There always a big gap of hours that staffs don't work; when we need staffs to work on those hours. Especially on busy days such as Friday, Saturday and Sunday. They want you to do markdowns, bin audit, cleaning in the stockroom and outside the floor, truck, straight the Last Act selves and so much more to one staff and at the same pay. Which isn't fair to me and to other employees. Last year they paid me $9.10 an hour. This year they bump it up by 20 cents. Now $9.30. After all that hard work; just 0.20 cent raise. They cut clock in or out slips. They say they need to be a green environment. "
bad,"I would just not recommend working here, they treat you unfairly, give you nothing in return. Overall waste of time, I do not enjoy working for this store in this area."
bad,"as a detective, you will learn how to apprehend shoplifters by utilizing a procedures implemented by Macys AP. The job can get frustrating and requires full team work. Dont expect to get paid anything more than $13 starting."
bad,"Macys river oaks is nothing but drama. People will be gunning for your job even though the position has been open before you got there. Managers do not train. They will set you up for failure. Have you complete a task and have you redo it, and redo it, and redo it because they didnt train you to do it correctly the first time. Managers will disrespect you and think everything is suppose to be fine because they are the manager. You will get belittled. Stand up for yourself. You will get yelled at and laughed at for not knowing something. Dont tell them anything about your personal business. They will use it AGAINST you. Stay away. Its not worth your sanity."
bad,Now Macy's did not care bout there work they wanted u do a lot of work less and sign people up for things they did not care bout no one but Macy's they always was thinking someone was steeling
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"The sales associates that I worked with were wonderful. They were really helpful and understanding. The manager that I had was definitely one of the worst. She did not seem enthusiastic about the product we carried or her job. Also, it is important for employees to promote the credit card, and even if the card isn't worth it. One thing that definitely takes a lot of time to get used to is the promotions. There are so many exclusions during promotions that you just have to read the fine print."
bad,"I only received 3 hour shifts by myself at night a few days of the week. I provided great customer service and store cleanliness but it did not matter. I would work so hard within the little hours I received but the problems from earlier that day would fall onto me. I would call to ask for permission to have breaks but usually be turned down because I was the only associate in my department. As cashiers we stand on non carpeted or cushioned flooring all day if busy. The managers were constantly abusing their power, being sexist, and having different company scandals."
bad,"The managers depending on what department you work in are terrible, They talk to you like you can't do the job giving to you  Anything you do it's not good enough if sales or credit is down they lecture you. It could be slow in the store that day it's still your fault. One manager there decrimates you if you have a medical condition or pregnant. I was teased by another manager about my weight. If I was you , do yourself a favor and don't apply , Corporate doesn't do anything for people who get treated like that ."
bad,"I don't have anything to say.  I liked the people I worked with, but it was horrible pay and no benefits.  I felt very under appreciated.  and my skills under utilized."
bad,"Direct Manager was very condescending, had favorites,promises were broken. I felt because I was older, I was negatively targeted by my manager. My hours were cut to part time after I gave a two week notice."
bad,I worked for macys for 12 1/2 years they treat there employees badly management strongly shows that they believe in favortism i suggest try other companys first then go to macys as a last option
bad,didnt like working there never got fulltime just always parting not a fun place to work they over work u with low pay an low hours this place was not for me
bad,They run picking terribly. No rf guns to scan and it's very stressful. I work in replenishment and we have to document and count every single unit ourselves.
bad,The no drug testing and no back ground checks and no HR is really starting to strain the company and it’s very hard to get anything accomplished without an HR. The quality of the people and the whole building has severely diminished in the years I have been there.
bad,Working in a fast paced environment is a good training and prepares you to learn how to do multi tasking. I worked in a commissioned floor so it gives you a good incentive to work hard and sell hard.
bad,I learned no matter how hard you work to sometimes its just not good enough for a company that don't really care about  workers your just a body to them
bad,"On the first day, I started working at Macy's one of their white employees was talking about the theft around the store and she stated that they know what the employees who steal look like meaning black people.  As a black employee working here was very uncomfortable as I was under guard because of my race.  Some staff members kept taking me for granted and throwing a great workload on me.  Surprisingly one of the black managers also treated me like she was ready to catch me doing something wrong because she used to sneak up on me. One day I caught her just standing in front of the register just staring at me while I was counting the daily earnings at the end of my shift."
bad,It was a nice place to work until they laid off people and expected the same customer service to be given. There was never enough associates working to get the job done. Associates were very unhappy and called out on a regular basis which made to working conditions poor.
bad,"not a team player environment "
bad,"Macy's might seem like a great place on the outside but they have no clue what they are doing being closed doors. Most of the people there have been there for many many years and are stuck in their ways. Most people that work there are very slow paced and do not want to change in any sort of manner."
bad,"Do not work here."
bad,"Management that has no clue about how IT works. Sad to see in this day and age, Some good developers, BA's, etc. but idiots in charge. Unfortunate situation."
bad,"Macy's will hire anyone. Drug users, murderers, you name it, especially during peak season. Hard workers get little to no recognition. Management mostly stays in the office and talk about things other than work. Useless stand ups that take time away from production."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Probably would be a more ideal workplace if there was more staffing. Management believed in cutting corners, AKA employees, so the store always felt messy. Customers wanted help and would have to wait to receive it due to high volume of customers and low staffing. No benefits. Cut throat environment."
bad,"I would not recommend working here. Most of the management team can be very sneaky. If you aren’t management, the turnover is very high. The hours are inconsistent."
bad,They worry a lot about the number of cases you get over the welfare to the employee. It's alright as a temporary job but not as a long-term employment. Unless you are prepared to suck up to higher management to move upward and even then it is not guarantee as they like to hire outside the company for senior management instead of looking at someone who was already trained by Macy's and knows protocol.
bad,One would think a Fortune 500 company would be ideal to be.  With low pay and minimal 1% pay increases annually I stayed too long.  I made many wonderful friends and contacts there.
bad,"I hated working at Macy's. You are forced to open a certain amount of Macy's cards per day/week. If you are not able to open as many accounts as they want you to, you can end up losing your job. I ended up being fake to customers, which is something I dislike doing. It was frustrating to deal with my manager too, as he did not treat me as a person, but more as a number. "
bad,"Typical day at work was completing sales"
bad,"Low wages, Overworked ,at my store it seemed to be a problem if someone wanted to move up. The manager I had was not a good manager she liked to talk to other employees about other employees,she liked to text other. Employees about employees."
bad,"The company is going downhill fast and my location at the Quakerbridge Mall in New Jersey has to be the worst store ever. I don't know where they're hiring these people for management from but they have no idea on what they're doing. Customers complain if you don't have a coupon and they talk to you like your less than and your managers don't back you up. The pay sucks for what they want you to do, no one takes responsibility they just play the blame game. Top 5 worst companies ever, I left before finding a new job that's how terrible it is."
bad,The work environment was very tense and cut throat.  The hardest part of working here was having to deal with the people you worked with stealing sales from you. I do not recommend anyone to work here.
bad,The management lies to you about time off and they are cruel to employees they don't like.   The management is also phonies because they talk about being family but won't hesitate to throw you away for aNY reason.  Pay raises are jokes because you have to do extremely well to get a ten cent raise which eliminates 75% of employees who are doing what is required of them.   The job is extremely boring that has to be done ten hours a day.   Sometimes there wasn't enough work to keep you busy which means that you just stand there doing nothing.   Managers are quasi bullies because I have been given looks that if anyone gave me on the street I would have interpreted as extremely yhreatening.
bad,"overall, the position itself was a great crash course on the business of retail on both sales and support perspectives. however, the management were not able to communicate directly with each other across different departments. every plan and priority was changed multiple times and set at the last minute. manager behavior was also an issue towards the associates, including towards myself. it has changed my view of the company for the absolute worse"
bad,"When I first started working for Macy's I was hired as a part time sales associate and then quickly received a full time position. The experience was good at first but as time progressed I didn't care for it anymore, you get moved around to all departments when there's no coverage, and when that happens you probably won't get a lunch break until someone else become available to give you one. My position got cut about 3 times and then was demoted to a part time sales associate are given unreasonable hours. You do way more then what you're getting paid for, there's always a long line and chances are you'll be working by yourself in certain departments, management doesn't help out at all they just walk around talking instead of checking up on associates and making sure every thing is okay with customers. I recently got laid off from the Parkchester location to be a week exact and now there's job postings for fulltime positions? How is that possible why not offer it to the associate that were laid off?"
bad,Its a nice temporary job. Do not plan to stay at this job longer than a year. Terrible management and no room for growth. But there are good benefits such as paid time off and holiday pay
bad,"I worked in Human Resources in the Recruitment Operations Office, Macy's had a layoff of 30 percent of the office.  Recruiting became sending all candidates to the stores or to executive positions, regardless of qualifications.  The management of the Recruitment Operations has no Human Resource or talent acquisitionee experience.  They are now relying solely on the number of candidates that they are pretending to recruit to legitimize the existence of the department.  the layoffs were supposedly based on seniority, but many that had short tenure and were considered dead weight were kept.  The most productive members if the recruiting staff were let go, including senior management with the most talent acquisition experience.  The people that were let go were told that it is nothing personal, it is just business, and we (the VP.s ) were just glad to have their jobs.  That was the most unprofessional way I have ever seen layoffs handled.  Most of the remaining staff is actively looking for new work.  I would never recommend the company to anyone who would like to make a difference or is looking a for long term career."
bad,You would be schedule for a certain time but may go longer or shorter hours inconsistent with scheduling. There was nothing hard about the job very easy and adaptable. The most enjoyable part of the job were the employees very nice and friendly.
bad,It is was working there stay focusing and hard work and kind like fun and enjoying it. good attitude and smiles  other customer.service need to anything help with it. I just like working and no problems for me.I don't  take.wrong way and I don't like nobody to be want to treat employee.
bad,"Low wages, difficult to speak with manager. Hard work with no compensation. Focus on opening up credit application...sometimes you will not get your breaks. Late hours ridiculous.  Lazy back stabbing manager. Spoke to you as if you were a child.."
bad,"All in all the job was fun, co workers were great, hours were not good basically on call type hours with maybe 2 days 4 hour shifts a week,, management seemed disorganized and the pay is  not great. vendors were rude and unwilling to work as a team."
bad,The management team is horrible. They just stand around and point at what needs to get done. They are not hands on at all. They’re is tons of favoritism in the store and the ones that do no work te all the credit. Staff is treated very unfairly. The Human Resources dept is supposed to be there to help you and just brushes off your issues and concerns. The store in general is just a bunch of kids that are lazy and nit pick at everything you do if you don’t do everything for them.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,They expect you to work long stressful hours for minimum wage. holidays are the worst they work you 12 hour shifts or longer. I learned that if you don't overwork yourself they say you're not working hard enough and have reasons to let you go. My manager was awful made my working environment hostile and stressful. Nothing was hard about the job they just put to much work on a few amount of people. I enjoyed the associates that I worked with.
bad,"if you aren't a cutthroat individual who throws your coworkers under the bus, then this is not the company for you."
bad,Worked there a few months and there is no team work. The managers only care about credits n the customers are very very rude at times. There is not stability. Staff is very uncompromising to work with. I hated it!
bad,"If you're a drug addict or criminal willing to settle for $8.00, have lack of leadership, unbalance and uncertainty this is the place for you. Otherwise pick another retail company any is better than this."
bad,"some workers were very mean and rude did not want to help when i didn't understand something, manager was very unorganized so I wasn't aware of being a full time or part worker"
bad,"As a sales Support Associate, my day was often non eventful.  During normal working hours, I could be found in the stockroom, inventorying merchandise.  management wasn't very concerned with the welfare of the workers.  The work place was not overly safe. Lots  of times conditions were hazardous to our health.  E.G. many of the areas we worked in were full of safety hazards.  Since renovations were undergoing in our presence, we exposed to hazardous materials. Asbestos was the most complained about. The most enjoyable part of the job, was during the holidays.  I had a choice of assisting the sales associate at the register, or working the  floors assisting the customers.  Interacting with the customers was  really the highlight of the job.  I also enjoyed the friendships of the people I worked with."
bad,They don't care about their employees and they don't pay their employees fairly.  They expect the employees to take on more and more and not compensate them for it.
bad,Good job to pay your bills. Not a career i would make outta of it. Employees start drama and management sucks big time they never have your back and make you feel dumb in front of customers.
bad,I do not recommend working at Macys. Management is a nightmare to work with. There is no appreciation or loyalty for their employees. Good Benefits...
bad,"Due to budget cuts, one FT employee in my office was let go and the job became the responsibility of one FT employee and two PT employees.  The demands of the position became overwhelming for one person to handle alone and they refused to overlap schedules to accommodate an impossible working environment.  Wages paid were definitely not commensurate with the position."
bad,"There was to many chiefs and no Indians. No one wanted to train the new employees, Favortism exsisted, Rarely gotten hours, Computer was always messing up for your hours. No consistency."
bad,"Clarins is an extremely difficult sell to the Macy's customer, especially in a small city.  Management at Macy's is generally ineffective and demoralizing."
bad,"Management is only focused on bottom line without regard to the employees, vendors, and most importantly, the customers.  I have been in several stores since being laid-off and the quality of the shopping experience has definitely declined"
bad,When I worked there the pay was really low. They expected you to work all holidays. Management didn't take time to get to know you. The pay increases were minimal.
bad,did cctv review and live monitoring.  walked floor looking for shoplifters.  would have been ok if they could keep a lp manager.  district lp manager was very much into himself and arrogant.  store lp manager was under so much stress it funneled down to us.
bad,"hated it they, were over working but under paying their employees, the only good part is they work with school schedules . The flexibility was the only good part about working there"
bad,Was not a positive or fun working environment. There was a culture of hiring externally instead of internally. Also too much cronyism. They need to nurture the talent that works for them instead of hiring externally.
bad,"I would not recommend to anyone with a life, outside of work to work there, theygive their employees set hours with no possibilities to call off even in emergencies, When I told the manager I had an degree in Business Managment he start micro manging me."
bad,"Very inconsistent management, policy and procedures. Company wide doubts for how long the company will be around. Really liked my manager. Very fair and had empathy."
bad,The culture is horrible with individuals that are not open for change or improvement. Slow to react to change and unwilling to listen to individuals that might have a different opinion.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Management has no clue what they are doing, advancement is rare, they hire and promote their friends, no culture at all, no sense of treating people like people unless it its used to promote the fake company beliefs."
bad,"My time at Macy's was stressful and there was no balance. I enjoyed the people I worked with, but management never seemed on our side and communication was extremely poor."
bad,"Position at Macys, was excellent.  Loved what I did throughout the 10 years.  I did an Outstanding Job at Macy's. However it was horrible treatment to Employees who were Christians."
bad,Management is over worked and under paid making their job difficult. That all falls downhill to associates who are expected to work miracles in the amount of hours provided.
bad,"disorganized, horribly scattered management, absolutely horrible communication from management, boring work environment, no events or efforts to create and retain the high energy of associates(i.e. rallies, contests, holiday events etc), overworked underpaid employees, unacceptably low salary, no ability for raises regardless of how you work, no room for advancement, understaffed badly handled company, it seems they …"
bad,The Manager was always in and out of the store and hardly ever doing his part.  I did not get  fully trained. The associates were not team players. They did offer great discount.
bad,"As a seasonal employee i had not worked at the job long enough to form an opinion, except that it gets super busy and communication gets mixed or misconstrued often"
bad,Pay is low. Many associates work harder than the rest without being recognized while others don't work just talk among each other and pretend to work. Management is okay some really focus and pay attention to their own employees others are hardly seen. Incentives are not really incentives. Hours are not great either and the point attendance system is a terrible system. Many employees should really be reviewed so those who actually work get a raise while the others who pretend either remain with low pay or get fired.
bad,I traveled a lot for this job. I am not fond of the way Macy's does their scheduling and it made it hard to coordinate and train my team. I had a boss with Macy's and a boss with Origins. I would not have stayed on long if it had not been for the Origins side.
bad,"Fast, wonderful employees, bad management, good discount, very low pay with little raise. Demanding. The fun part is working with people and giving them a good service."
bad,"while I liked most co workers, there was a few I knew personally that used there positions to bully workers and store management was aware but did nothing."
bad,"The company desire to do more with less made Macys a bad place to work. My day was chaotic and varied from day to day. The task for the day could be floor moves, add sets, inventory counts, fixture disposal, truck unloading. Goods processing."
bad,"Macys treats its employees horribly, they foster a cut throat sale stealing mentality.  I had gone to part time where I could only work monday thru thursday, approved by the management then they fired me ( by voicemail ) when I couldnt work Black Friday as i worked my other job Friday Saturday and Sunday"
bad,"stress stress stress is all I can say not fun company stores drop like flies so theres no job security , wich is the reason im looking for a job now. management at macys is extremely disorganized"
bad,Upper management does not care about their employees.   Their main concern is profit.   The hardest part of the job is listening to the store manager bad mouth employees who work hard and are not appriciated.
bad,"Good co-workers, eager to share information when you have the time.  Changing leadership demands are up and workload is getting out of control.  If looking for BA, PM, or PD position this place might be a good fit.  Developers STAY AWAY."
bad,"I have worked for Macy's for over a year now. When I began working I was told that I could advance in the position I was on. And now that Macy's has gone down hill they have cut MANY positions. They cut all good employees and kept the employees that do not work because of favoritism. In cosmetics they hire girls with no experience and if by the off chance they do hire someone with quite a bit of experience and background in the industry they will treat you like garbage. The company says they focus on ""clientele and service"" but don't believe that; they only focus on numbers even when they're unrealistic."
bad,"It could've be better at the time I was working. More hours better for me but at the time it was not happenning. poor management in my department many favoritism, many more things I wish not to discuss."
bad,"When I started everyone seemed to be ..... however after working for a week or two I was very well liked and was treated very well got to see how  they treated everyone from a different view, managers would include me in a lot and if you wasn't a female or lucky enough to get on the inside they were treated unfairly not only was there to many ""managers""in the same areas but they were all like 18 to 20 years old"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Worked here for a little over a month as a seasonal support associate. Horrible management. Training was computer based and I was only trained for about 20 minutes hands on in the wrong department. As a support associate I picked out products that customers ordered online either to pick up in store or ship to them. My team in the fulfillment department treated me as if they were better than me, very condescending. So much so that when you would smile at them or say good morning they would literally stare at me with a straight face and say nothing back. Their directions were terrible, they would tell me half of what I was supposed to do and then blame me if I did something wrong, when they did not give clear directions. "
bad,I learned that you really need comfortable shoes with lots of memory foam soles to be walking and standing as much as one typically does.   On the other hand all the walking is good exercise.   Co workers are nice.   Most enjoyable part was when i got to go to a department that was actually fun.
bad,"Great part time job to get me back on my feet. People at the position were great. Managers were awesome. the only thing was the pay was low, but other than that it was a great oppertunity for me."
bad,Slackers bosses who don't do squat and make you do all their dirty work  and absolutely will not  help you if your stuck on a task. you're on own in this company. Management do not know their butt from their elbow and co-workers are down right rude.
bad,They claim to give you trying only for an hour. Need more time and hands on don't expect your frontline reps to do the specialist job When they are not getting the pay period.
bad,"Macys is a terrible place to work.  It is high pressure and low pay.  The company does not care about its employees and it is a high-pressure environment.  My boss hated me and Human Resources did nothing about it nor did the Store Manager.  I got really, really sick emotionally from the poor treatment that I got at Macys."
bad,"Macy's claims to have an open door policy but yet when I needed to talk to someone other than in HR all I got was the run around, NO one would even talk to me, or even answer my calls, I was on hold one day for over an hour with no answer or response to ANY of my messages from someone pretty high up in the building! And absolutely no help from corporate HR on the matter either, they told me that ""Macy's has an open door policy"" and in the same sentence said ""I had to talk to the manager of HR in my building before I could talk to them""even though I had received NO response back from the people who could help me in my building for over two weeks. Which was regarding a BIG mistake on their end with my paycheck which lead to me with NO paycheck for almost two weeks! It's a good thing I don't have kids to feed!! But my rent was late and I had to pay the late fee for THEIR mistake!! This place is joke, they don't care about their employees, they only care about how they will get their paychecks, which wouldn't happen without the hard work from their workers, which they chose to neglect:("
bad,"Working for Macy's was the worst job ever.  I highly don't recommend people to work for Macy's unless they are desperate for a job and have no working skills.  The managers are unfair, they only help and promote their favorite employees.  The pay per hour is ridiculously, it's a low pay and only get a $0.25 raise if you deserve it.  Macy's is really cheap in giving holiday festivities for its employees, horrible benefits, and bad scheduling."
bad,"Managers were terrible, they tell you to call them whenever you need help but never answer. Pay was way too low, they hired new people in at higher wages then the people there for years, never apprecated anything you did. Worst place I have ever worked. They tell you the schedule is flexible, they DO NOT work with it whatsoever. I got scheduled during my school classes that they knew about all the time. If they ask you to come in on your day off and you tell them you have plans its the end of the world."
bad,"I worked for Macy's in one of their many operational support roles. I enjoyed my co workers and my direct manager was awesome however there is only so much one in his position can do. My biggest issue with the company was the pay, they took all their full time positions and cut them down to two part time positions so they wouldn't have to offer healthcare. They work their part time employees just a half hour below what would qualify them as fulltime. There was no room for advancement, departmental feuds, and extremely low morale"
bad,I learned a lot about working in Macy's as a sales associate although  was very confused most of the time. Things could have been more orderly as I wasn't even sure of who my floor manager was. The fact that I couldn't schedule any shifts online really turned me off because I had wanted this job for so long.
bad,I hated working here. They gave me false promises which made it difficult to get to where I needed to advance. I was completely unhappy
bad,The culture and engagement is terrible. Managers are told to lie and deceive associates to keep them in the building. HR department is more in love with their titles than their jobs and there is NO system support. Please don't apply or plan on working here.
bad,"Macy's is by far the worst company I have ever had the misfortune to work for. Not only are they greedy, cheap, and manipulative, but they treat their employees like thankless slaves. They are paid little, overly worked, continually taken advantage of, and then thrown under the bus when management or higher ups need to cut corners or find a scapegoat. I have seen blatantly displays of racism from high level executives, and I have seen witch hunts on lower level associates who need their jobs so desperately they will tolerate slavelike treatment just to stay above the poverty line."
bad,"No matter how much you work and or sell, it will never be enough.  They tell you that even though you may have 200% of your sales, you are missing one tiny aspect of what they are looking for and therefore they are going to fire you.  They never actually fire you, they just stress you out until you quit."
bad,"Be prepared to fight others for customers, get yelled at for nothing and deal with attitudes from co workers. Way to many people working at once. No one wants to train new ppl because its commission. So have fun learning on your own and falling on your face and no one caring. Horrible place to work. Don't bother unless your ready to work hard for nothing and stand on your feet for hours and hours and deal with attitudes from snobby girls."
bad,"managers unavailable when needed, breaks were not long enough after extended shifts. Co-workers were not helpful in my learning process"
bad,"No training, management is awful and unwilling to actually manage their team. Not good for someone with kids. They are not as flexible with the scheduling"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Macys is a form of income.  They do not pay well.  They hire desperate people.  Good and bad.  The experienced employees are mostly down on their luck.  Management is terrible.  The only training we get is on videos seen on the computer.  Management does not care if you had a break or not.  Expectations to get new credit card customers is unrealistic.  Pay is bad.  Store is kept hot.  Wouldn't recommend working here at all.
bad,"Everyone can talk and socialize if your the managers pet or family. You can expect to work hard complete your work and assist co workers and step up to have your reputation destroyed if your manager dose not like you or if your peers gossiped & have the managers ear. Low wages, terrible insurance, co workers appear nice but will stab you in the back first chance they get no punishment but don't get mad and show any personality or emotion you will be coached on proper acceptance of feedback which is subjective at best. The hardest part is trying hard to fit in and co workers treat you like you have the plague. Honestly, most enjoyable part of job is clocking out and returning to real life. Don't let anyone feel intimidated or lacking of skills because they will gang up and run you off. It does not matter if you have marketable skills they will twist and turn things until you feel like you have gone crazy. the whole time will laugh behind your back and expect you to tolerate the harassment and denied interviews to sign off to friends that clearly do not possess the skills."
bad,This store has become a joke. There is a sale every other day. My position was a commission based and it made for a very cut throat environment that was not a joy at all to go to work on a daily basis. Management was constantly turning over and not at all a good work place.
bad,"Macy's was my first job. The pay was horrible, the hours were minimum, you had to fight for your hours. The management sucked, they only care  about the numbers you make, then again which company doesnt?"
bad,"Most managers are out for their own, advancement comes to a quick stand still. Atmosphere is a place based on numbers not people, support teams unappreciated and not at all well managed, no guidance or real training"
bad,"If I had a worst enemy, I certainly wouldn't recommend working here. I understand that the company may be different since I worked there and maybe different in other areas, but it was horrible when I was there. 5% of the people did all the work and actually cared...that is not the way to run a retail store."
bad,No communication with Management or HR. The enviromnet is nice. Co workers were friendly. The hours were very limited to one or two days.
bad,"The only true positives about this company are the relationships that you make and some of the people that you encounter along the way. Aside from that, anyone could/should do better."
bad,"The Management at this Macy's is horrible, it's a business not a social club."
bad,It depends on the management. The management has to much control.
bad,"I would open my department, clean the area, and stock receiving while assisting and checking out customers."
bad,"The job title started out as ""Constant Surveillance Officer"", then right before I was laid off, the title changed to ""Security Guard"" and access to the LP office was denied unless you were accompanied by LP personnel. As a Guard, you are NEVER to involve yourself in any arrest, even though I came their with more experience than any of their so called LP agents and I even went through their menial training. As a retired person from years of enforcing the laws, I felt frustrated. I took the position for extra income, but was disillusioned by the treatment received. The only thing I liked about working for Macy's was the employee discounts."
bad,great place to work horrible compensation. Macys definitely takes advantage of their associates by not paying them a decent wage for all the time and energy they put into the company specially sales associates and merchandising support store associates.
bad,"Racially Profiled. Tried to search my car without my knowledge or permission and your mistreated by HR and management. I saw a supervisor choke an employee. Checks come up short every week. The Governor need to be fired bringing this company to Martinsburg. RUN! Watched on toilet, dont complain about anything thats a red flag and they will get rid of you. This is for people who dont mind being mistreated and have no responsibilities, bills and still live at home with mom. This place right now is being investigated, the Mayor will hear about this for sure. Macy's desperate right now for peak season after that your gone. Your put on the schedule and when you show up 6am they tell you they took you off. They cancelled my Health insurance without my knowledge, they owed me over two thousand dollars for two year. Trust Me dont look that way."
bad,"I am able to build relationships with people by conversing on where they were wearing their outfits also maintaining and exceeding sales"
bad,"This was not my favorite company to work for.  I do not wish to review this position."
bad,"This is the perfect job, never a career. The management in Bowie is horrible. The extra 20% for working at Macy's is only available to those who have credit card, so if your eligible and love to shop (as I did) it still isn't worth the hassle management put you through. Tons of expectations and NO TRAINING! Overall, if your young with patience, this is the JOB for you! Most co-workers were manageable, some over stepped their boundaries. The most enjoyable part was getting a discount. Management was unorganized and condescending !!!!! I have learned that I do not enjoy being over worked (8+ hours standing) with little appreciation! Advancement is almost non-existing. You must be at Macy's for about 2 years or work like a dog to be given a job on commission. Work at MAC or Sunglass Hut !"
bad,Business has been slow lately. Our customers are mostly foreigners. It can be boring at times. I have learned to treat customers as my personal clients. Hardest part of this job is cleaning out the fitting rooms. Never know to what to expected. The most enjoyable part of my job is keeping my clients happy. Making sure they leave with exactly what they ask for.
bad,"It's not a hard job. It is physically demanding and stressful. The customers are great, but a lot of the staff do not get along with each other. I thought it would feel like a family setting and that we would help each other, but it was more like high school. There were the bullies and the kids that were picked on."
bad,"Competitive employees, the supervisors are lazy and spend a lot of time in their offices doing nothing. This particular Macy's expects you to make money for their company by being fake and stalking customers, some customers do not like t be hounded when they first enter the shopping area"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Macy's management style does not allow ideas to flourish."
bad,"Dealing with customers, learned about a variety of different quality handbag and aesthetic products, The management was not reliable for help"
bad,"Did not like it, was not paid in time, never received a raise, I was tooken advantage of."
bad,"WORST job ever, requires too much to be done. long hours with low pay."
bad,"Macy's Pros are good discounts and flexible schedule if your a student this is the perfect job for you or if you need a part time job few hundreds a week than i recommend this job to you but it comes with cons the management is horrible they don't care about you at all, All they are focus on is your sales goal and credit if you do good in that, than your there best friend."
bad,I dont understand why macys keeps hiring people when they even can give hours to the people they have. people if you want a stable job this is not the job for you. you can go ahead and accept this job if you dont care to be pay 8 hours a week or zero a week this is not a job for anyone who wants to pay their bills i wish someone would have tell me about this before i came here im currently looking for a job since its like i dont have a job at all in macys no income at all. they lie to you at the beginning telling you they will give you more hours they never do every week they say the same thing next week next week and they never do.
bad,I was a shoe specialist helping people in the shoe department and maintaince stock room
bad,"Although working for Macy's wasn't always the most enjoyable place to work every weekend till sometimes 11 P.M, I still made the most of my experience through loyal customers and a wonderful cosmetic staff. I think the hardest part of my job was not being able to attend certain important events, little time with my loved ones and I was lied to a couple times about a promotion. Although no matter how hard some days were I always went out of my way to make someone else's day."
bad,"Not a good Place to work, the pay is not good the work life balance it not there and the management is not fun to work with.  Not a very good company "
bad,"The initial training makes you feel like you're ready to face anything retail can throw at you, but after that it is entirely sink-or-swim. The benefits are nonexistant for a part-timer, or if they do exist they were never given/discussed with me during my 6 months working there. The pay is low and hours are difficult to work with sometimes, the number you receive varying greatly. It's a good first job, and good for getting some experience with customer service and retail, but it's definitely not somewhere you'll want to stay very long."
bad,I worked seasonal and it was horrible. No matter what you are hired for you instantly become a glorified stocker. You get hired into a certain area but never seem to stay in that area. The managers play favorite even with the temps. The scheduling is okay as long as you're willing to get up super early to try and get days. Everyone is nice to your face but talk behind your back.
bad,"low compensation, poor management/workers relationship"
bad,Macys is an American tradition.....however working for them is far from it.
bad,needs better management
bad,I think macys is a great place to work if you just graduated high school and you need work experience but I wouldn't recommend working here for more than a year here's why. Last year I sold over 200000 dollars but I wasn't at 100 percent to my goal I missed it by about 6000 dollars and was fired because of that. Last year I only made about 10000 dollars so Macy's made about 200000 dollars profit off of me and still fired me. Working at macys is kind of like being pimped because you will sale a whole lot of merchandise but you won't make much money.
bad,"Pseudo-consistent hours if your productivity is high. Fair amount of stress for the lowest pay they can get away with, commission areas more so. Competitive, low rewards. Incentives are more discounts on clothing. Health benefits passable, dental is only good for 2 cleanings a year, not for any major work."
bad,"A typical day at work is anything but at Macys 34th St. They hire anyone, including criminals and drug users. Management is a complete joke. Ex-coworkers enrolled in school did not recieve any consideration when their shifts were decided which forced them to resign. If you work full-time they would have you close then open the next morning just because they are operating in their legal boundaries and don't care about the time it takes for you to travel home."
bad,"A typical day at work is some days are slow were we can catch up from the busy weekend and get ready for new week. Being at Macys realize that that not al companies are bad. Macys has its up and it downs, this company depends to much on the employees then them doing there jobs.. my co-workers have to deal with stress from managers and store manager with score cards with is there daily goals and there are super high ex.. my co-workers goal was 4,300 on a 3 hr shift.. I think that's to high and on a slow night she got in trouble and the management told her if she doesn't improve that there going let her go. that's the hardest part about this job that you might have one or you don't that's to much stress for them to handle worried about job security. But I love my boss from Levis he always helped us on busy days and always buying us lunch coffee or whatever cause he knows how the company is and how they treat there employees."
bad,"I found the company as a whole, good to work for. As far as advancement, not so much. Management was too scared to stand up for their employees, And I gave it everything, and got nothing in return."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,macys is okay to work for but not make a career out of it. the pay is really low no matter how long you may work there. the management is okay but they do not communicate with each other very well and the employee is the one that ends up doing the job twice.
bad,"Too much pressure to sell and open accounts. Managers are usually pretty mean. Co-workers are nice but some are very competitive, even though they are not on commission. The pay is terrible for the amount of work you are expected to do."
bad,"Poor place to work you are generally thrown under the bus from day one. They use a score card system that is not relivent to anything, it is all computer generated. the weekly schedule is totally random by the computer ie you could work 5 hrs today and 7.25 the next, very hard to plan a meal around.Management is running around like chickens with thier heads cutoff afraid of the level above them."
bad,If you are looking for a real job this is not it. They do not care about their employees can think of them as replaceable bodies.
bad,They are all about their profits and could care less about their employees!
bad,"Worked at fullfillment center goodyear, security dept. disfunctional company overall. There was no communication in depts. inept managers who love to micromanage and feel that they are far superior to reg.employees. Backstabbing environment, within own depts, along with favoritism. No credible training given. FEEL like the commercials?"
bad,"working seasonal was ok but no benefits, and you do not work the whole season they may or may not fire you. everything is based off of favoritism."
bad,"i work at macys in bloominton Il and it suck... they dont care about anybody but their self. i talk to a lot of managers and they are over work, and tired of not only the SM but the whole job. Their point system sucks, they take points for being late or not coming in they can take up 2 points or more, but if you are good all month you only get 1 point.. thats all so basically dont get sick, dont let your children get sick and dont have a family emergency because they dont care you get points taken way and your done."
bad,you slave for people who don't have appreciation and most of the positions are commission and the associates are rude and will try to get you fired.
bad,"When I worked at Macy's there was preexisting issues in the department that I got hired into. After working for the company for a year I noticed no changes in the issues, but in contrast with the matters going swept under the rug and put on the back burner the matters and tension only got worse. This made working very uncomfortable and stressful on a daily basis. If presented the opportunity again I would decline working for this company. The pay is horrible along with the hours and benefits."
bad,Worked for the MAY company in St.Louis and Macy's purchased the company to create a national chain of department stores. The MAY company was the better company and should have never been allowed to be purchased by a company who did not have the interest of St. Louisans at heart. Say good bye to aSt.Louis fortune 500 company.
bad,"Working at this particular Macy's was very stressful. Since being bought out by Macy's, when it was still L.S. Ayres, it was an employee's dream to go to work everyday. The managers at that time and associates were fun to work with, accomodating and knowledgable on products and services. When Macy's took over, they fired the existing store manager and brought in one that is nothing short of being a shrew and a tyrant. After three years, she's yet to take the time or put forth the effort to learn anything that the associates do on the selling floor, and the HR Manager, who has absolutely no HR nor management experience, would rather berate the unsuspecting associate on hearsay, rather than be bias and look at all sides before making any decisions. There is no room for advancement, because when the new store manager came onboard, she immediately either fired, forced out or demoted the existing managers and hired new ones who were associated with her at other store locations."
bad,"This is not a company for anyone wanted employment security. I worked there for over 18 months. I worked through 4 wisdom teeth extractions. I had infections in my mouth and stitches b/w every tooth. I did not understand them not accepting my doctors note. They told me it did not excuse my absence. It only told them why I was not there. I turned in my note to them , so I did not have anything to show to prove I did not quit. That is why I could not even get unemployment."
bad,"Worked all the time for very little pay. Was there for 5 years and once minimum wage went up, people just starting were only making 50 cents less than me.  Management was awful"
bad,"If you dont mind long hours for average pay while you stand all day and do meanial tasks that feel unimportant, as well as having to do others jobs on top of your own, this is the place for you."
bad,"Awful. Management has absolutely no clue what they’re doing. "
bad,"My manager was rude from day one, she never explained how to do anything, my coworkers had to teach me everything they know. The manager would pop up every 4-7 hours just to tell us how terrible we are at what we are doing and then disappeared. You could only win her love by constantly snitching on everyone and gossiping. Work was total stress for most of us and I had to leave with 2 other girls because we just couldn’t take it anymore."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Macy's warehouse is a pretty laid-back environment to work if you do your job it does not require so much demand as other warehouse jobs do but the pay is very low. I recall having to work overtime at least 12 hours every week just to get by, it is all click-based and the people who have been with the company since it open AR the only ones who benefit no because they've all been grandfathered in other than that you get horrible shift unless you know someone. I like to offer you a flex schedule so that they can take your hours away at any time and come slow season you got one day of work a week I would not recommend working for Macy's"
bad,They claimed to have monthly sales goals but they never told anyone what those alleged goals were. Never knew where we stood in terms of sales goals achieved.
bad,I worked in the backstage department and my manager was the worst. She made my experience very stressful and annoying. She was difficult to get along with. Backstage is currently under new management but the customers are never easy to please.
bad,Manager very stingy with giving hours . They give so little hours unless they need extra help they’ll expect u to stay . My opinion not worth the drive
bad,"This place is a circus. Management is a joke. Sometimes you'll find yourself doing your managers job because they don't know how to do it. They never have coverage and VERY few people working here which leads to them overworking you. Management indeed does act childish and VERY unprofessional. They compensate you with a full size candy bar if you open a credit application. SERIOUSLY, its a joke. Not to sound ungrateful but I would have rather got nothing only because I took offense to it and so did my colleagues. A CHOCOLATE BAR?! LIKE REALLY. This job really made me feel like a peasant. So many GOOD people leaders and Sales Associates left the company due to the lack of communication and unprofessionalism. For Macy's I expected more and it was way below my expectations. Did I mention how UNORGANIZED they are? I can go on.."
bad,"1.  I'm severely disappointed after having worked for Macy's for only two month's.  After always hearing about how ""great"" Macy's is & how it was a great company to work for....I'm sickened with my experience. "
bad,Upper management truly only cares about your sales & more than anything if you open credit cards. They don't care if you truly made the customer happy
bad,"I was hire as a seasonal associate, and I must say, I only received hours to work through phone calls. Seasonal people like me basically filled in call-out slots. I worked every department without any indication of future advancement to full-time or at the very least a proper switch from seasonal to part-time scheduling. Would not recommend."
bad,"If you can work anywhere else.... DO THAT! Worst employment experience ever. The entire Management team, and a good number of the associates should be fired immediately. This store is the epitome of failure, should be shut down and turned into anything else. I'm thoroughly disgusted by my employment here, but it'll be a heck of a story one day. If it weren't for the plethora of hours available to work, I'd have quit a while ago. Also, they violate labor laws constantly, and Gender pay discrimination is a thing here... #metoo doesn't apply here."
bad,"Management is unprofessional and unskilled in their areas. Scheduling is a major issue. Some days there is too many people and most days not enough. Some days there will be no opener or closer for a particular area leaving the employees scrambling. Pay is minimum wage, which is not a livable wage. I worked in another major department store in a similar position 10 years ago and made $8 more than I make at Macy's."
bad,Macy’s is disrespectful Miss treat employees pay is awful they miss treat there staff and and pay is not work the stress and you have to stand all day
bad,"People leaders do not actually lead or manage. The management style is passive observation. Many non-managers put in long hours, often working through lunch and taking work home. Gossip is also an issue. People go behind your back. There is no team culture."
bad,Its not just macys although that was bad too. Its not hard to look up on google or other search engines to see and know how bad the economy is and has been. 75%+ of working class americans arent even middle class and live paycheck to paycheck at best and cant make ends meet. Im not worried about impressing an employer when what is being offered wages/benefits on the table is less than par and cant live off of. Plenty of previous coworkers even ones i thought wouldnt see it agree with me. Times change and so do policies especially with new and younger generations. Will write more in another secfion im done with this.
bad,"I started at Macy's as a support associate (unloading freight and fulfilling online orders were my two main jobs, with occasionally doing markdowns and signing) and if you are thinking of applying as a support associate, it's a lot of fun but the problem is there's no fulltime positions in support and there's not nearly enough hours. There is tons of hours around christmas and overtime is available, but after that hours are scarce. Expect 10-15 hrs a week. So when I was offered a job as a full-time sales associate I thought it would be fun because I already liked my job at Macy's and more hours right? Working in sales is a completely different environment. It's very competitive as you're expected to open credit cards for customers as a grade of how good you're doing and you're punished if you don't open at least 3 a week (2 for part-time)."
bad,The company was bought out so many times every time it was bought out the standards for the company was lowered and they require much more of the employees they gave us nothing in return
bad,"Lack of ability to succeed with such poor management. Scheduling problems, backstabbing of poorly educated people responsible for decisions. (sales)  There are so many ways to improve the profit of the store from inventory to packaging."
bad,I worked here for a year and was miserable. Management is horrible and you are dragged from department to department with many managers bothering you. too much stress for minimum wage job
bad,Working at Macy's you have to make sure your houts are clocked in after every shift because the time clocks glitch. I had to chase down my first paycheck for orientation had a back and forth runaround and was told by the recruiting department i wasn't supposed to get paid when everyone else in the same orientation received their check. The work is easy but the rates expected are ridiculous i don't even think the managers could male those quotas. There are alot of immature people that work here seasonally made me feel like high school again. The pay is okay if you work overtime to get ot pay. The recruiting department tells you if you get the employee debit card you will get an extra 30% off for discounts but come to find out apparently you will not get the normal 20% without the card. There is alot of one hand not knowing what the other is doing and they are so nonchalant about it like they don't care.
bad,Macy's Logistics is a very unorganized plant that doesnt appreciate its employees. They throw you into extremely stressful situations without the proper training and safety techniques.
bad,"Macy's rewards people that lack a conscious.  It's rough seeing the people that trick customers into opening credits succeed, while you explain to those people that come to you for help how they can get rid of it an start fixing their debt that they got themselves into with this 24.99% interest rate that is never mentioned by the successful associates.  They even taught us to not use the word ""credit card"" but rewards card because the word credit cares was unappealing.  Well it is a credit card and that means that we were taught to lie."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Macy's management is always micromanaging by scolding employees about the wrong things they are doing, and never providing positive feedback. The management never have the backs of associates when receiving customer complaints. Job security is also declining everyday for most associates with the goals increasing on limited staff. We are always understaffed because upper management feels it is necessary to cut hours to reduce costs. The sales goals are completely unrealistic and management can not explain the reasoning for the goals they have set. Upper management is never on the same page with little to no communication at all with each other and with associates. They consistently break employment laws by creating hazardous and hostile working environments and failing to respond to complaints about the working conditions. The have eliminated all in store human recourse departments. It is also practically impossible to get in contact with the new human resources. There is also little room for advancement because management very rarely promote within the store. They marginalize the existing associates and always have an excuse. Their hours are not flexible for students even though they claim to be."
bad,"Computer generated hours"
bad,"Work consisted mostly of selling to people with some merchandising. I did learn a lot from my coworkers. There are some who are very helpful and kind, but it is an extremely catty environment. Management is HORRIBLE. They would only talk to you  to tell you how you are not doing something right and would never recognize when you were doing great work. They also will try and take advantage of you, so you have to put your foot down. Management doesn't see you as a person, but just pawns in their game. The hardest part of the job is definitely management and some other coworkers. Instead of being fair, there is a lot of cheating, and as I mentioned earlier, a lot of cattiness throughout the department. The best part of the job were the coworkers who were awesome and the merchandising aspect of it. I was able to be more creative in this position."
bad,"Almost non existent training very stressful with out of control clients.  Uncertain about policies and procedures, except when you have marked down during a phone audit and put on probation. My lead & manager happens to be good people, but all others are simply awful! Not a lot of loyalty when it comes to new hires. They ask for the moon but provide you with sand for your effort and pay. Allot of those in leadership roles shouldn't be, and I feel because they don't really have many to choose from. They tell you to provide the client with ""signature service"" but lack to give the appropriate training and time to acquire the skills needed."
bad,Due to the poor direction and management Macy's  decided to take I felt it was best for me to leave they company.  In the beginning my mangers created a positive and caring environment. Those managers left and the cruel and coldhearted ones stayed. Work was no longer enjoyable. I knew there was something way better for me and I did not like how poorly I was treated for my years of working at the company.
bad,"If you’re a college student who needs extra cash this is for you, but if you’re looking for a full time job no. Management never knows what’s going on and is always on top of associates about sales, the return policy is a joke. It should only be a short term job."
bad,Macys is a really a great place to shop ad found good things but there mangement is so poor they treat abults like there are kids . They dont set a good example for others.
bad,It was boring to be standing around but I did enjoy fixing up the sales floor and the dressing rooms to make sure that it was up to our standards for the store.
bad,"It's an okay job.paid Not really much to support your family. Not much staff and it's basic. I mean there is no job on this planet that would pay to fulfill a family, unless you're rich I guess"
bad,"Low pay and very minimal raises and promotions.  Every year only brings a 20 cent raise.  Also, my supervisor at Macy's West County in Des Peres, MO always asks me personal questions.  Very unprofessional at the management/lead role.  The only reason I have stayed is to have a flexible schedule."
bad,"This is a terrible company to work for, they don't pay enough for all the stress and sidework that is required. They treat you like a criminal you can't step out of line without managers saying something. It's run like a jail house, It's honestly the worst company I've ever worked for. DO NOT recommend, they act like they care about you and your opinion but they don't."
bad,"The pay was finally raised last year after 10 years to bring the company more in line with industry standards. There is little opportunity for advancement outside of peak and during peak any rules go out the window. The technology is dated and there is little understanding of the current systems in place which leads to a lack of security and confusion among associates & leadership. The leadership of the facility seems flawed in both an organizational and planning stand point. They don't train associates for turn over and often when presented with turn over just end up hiring someone while providing next to no guidance or training and leaving them to figure out the rest. The actual facilities themselves seem to communicate very little as well and Central decisions are often kept private until the last minute leaving only time to react. While competition is important it shouldn't hinder the path of progress.To sum things up, this industry is decades behind in many aspects and how they managed to make it 130 years is beyond my understanding."
bad,you have to kiss  and be a snitch  inorder to be promoted. the management is poor and walk around and expect all the work to be done. So unfair. underpaid.
bad,"No one took their job seriously in my department. Everyone was prepared to throw anyone new or inexperienced under the bus. Despite always making at least 80% of my sales goal each day, I was still treated like I had no clue what I was doing."
bad,As a company they lost sight of what is important . Management  is not trained properly. They treat their employees unfairly daily. Just a miserable environment.
bad,"because of very poor management, simple menial was made much more difficult than it should have been. projects there simply felt like constantly rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic.Favorites are picked and talent is ignored and abused because of the threat it posed to less educated management."
bad,"Truly loved my job and the people I worked with there.  The environment was pleasant enough as long as you were not a contractor.  "
bad,"I was hired on but didn’t start until a month after my hire date. I went through the process of getting another job, and finally received a call to start work. People had attitudes about training and they tell you to check the website to see if you work the next day. The hours were 4-6 hours per day or maybe even the week."
bad,It’s not a job I would like to do again the employees and some employers where terrible. They treated you like you where beneath them and not as an equal
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Did not get enough work hours, low pay, and no benefits. They overpaid me and I had to pay it back just before Christmas. They do not value their workers."
bad,"Perverts in management, especially supervisors. Its just ghetto there. Thry hire drug addicts and the worst type of people imaginable. The people seem like they all just got out of prison."
bad,I would avoid this company as first choice. There is to much politics that control and hinder the purpose that we are there in the first place which is to serve the guest.
bad,"Managers float and are not accessible. Consistency and customer service is not a priority. Poor product controls, inadequate stocking and inventory controls /system. Lack of Professionalism."
bad,"Understaffed most of the time, were not allowed to stay over to finish work, then would be yelled at for not being finished. I switched to the hardest job in the store, that nobody else wanted because the amount of work in the little hours was rough for being paid 7 dollars. Management was thrilled i'd take it on for them, so thrilled they thanked me with 0 hours for 2 months, and let the person training me do 2 jobs at once, instead of letting her do her job, and let me do my new job. My coworkers were the only good thing about the job."
bad,Macy’s could do so much better if the had better management and treated their employees better n with more respect. They don’t help their employees and pay pocket change they are all about magic but are really not good at it.. A happy employee makes a happy work place
bad,"With all the changes I would never work for Macys again, I was overworked, made to do jobs not in my description, Education and support was taken away. No work life balance. Unstable schedule."
bad,"My job as a sales associate/ luggage specialist was enjoyable in the beginning of the time there. As years past, the overall weight of the the job description changed and several areas were lacking. Currently in school to finish my career as a medical assistant and searching for fair compensation for my knowledge as a seasoned associate. I have gained many friendships over the years which I have remained in contact with MANY that have moved on"
bad,I felt un welcome from the start always being watch and judge  doing something good felt like nothing. Mangers do not keep they words or react to situations on time.
bad,The shop itself was located in an inconvenient spot therefore customer through traffic suffered.  The manager I was assigned was rude condescending and had an abrasive personality. She was indeed the reason I left that store. For all those looking to work at macys avoid store #32 at all costs. And if you do wind up working there. Take any position BUT fullfillment and merchandising.
bad,"Sales-based bonus-commission on top of minimum wage paycheck. Company expects for you to make a specific amount of sales each month, or they'll be prepared to make you feel lousy about it. "
bad,The day starts with fulfillment which has to be done while we take care of customers.  I learned a lot about merchandising.  If you want to learn how not to run a business come work for Macy's.
bad,"I loved working with the clients and coworkers, but macy's wages are very low and they amount of work you put in is not worth it. The Asset Protection is also always out to catch employees not following the Policies to a T. It's a job that barely pays the bills."
bad,You will start off getting plenty of hours then they would start dwindling down. And the pay isn't great I was working 40/hr weeks and was barley bringing in $200
bad,do not work here they toss you away faster than you can blink . they expect you to give all your dediciation but as soon as they cant afford you bye !
bad,"Not a job for single parents. Under pay for useless management. Will not work there ever again. This company claims to care for the employees but the company only cares for itself. Open credit, does not comply if the doctor gives restrictions. Does not care if the employee gets a 15 mins break."
bad,"They want us to provide great customer service, but they cut down the number of employees in the store, pay at minimum wage, all while asking us to do several other jobs at the same time, so it makes it extremely hard to connect with customers. Then you get in trouble for not doing your job, when in fact you are technically juggling 5 jobs at once, without help. Employees are constantly bending over backwards and not getting compensated for their hard work."
bad,As an executive at Macy's my compensation was far from where similar employers are. This company is desperately trying to stay afloat and it's employees feel the pressure the most.
bad,"The best thing about working macys is the discount and you get to know what goes on sale first. The management was horrible, the pay was even worse..."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,worked there  when i need a fast job. they don't pay anything and you need to be there for a while to even get health insurance. long days on your feet. no training at all you just have to learn while you are on the job...i think they only people that might make any more is the women shoes department. working so hard for 7 or 8 an hr is very hard
bad,"I didn't like working at Macy's. It was tiring, also, paid very little. For the duration I was there it was no opportunity for advancement and being manipulated by the employees that were there longer than me. Tasks that were meant for others to do, they made the seasonal people do them. There was barely opportunity to obtain the daily sale goal."
bad,"The work schedule is never consistent.  You seldom know how many hours you work each week until the last minute.  Hard to get more than 8 hours a week - even for part time, which is totally unexceptable.  Poor training.  Insufficient tools to perform the assigned duties.  Not worth the gas money!  Management is ineffective in helping personnel.  No incentive to stay or grow with the company.  Administration is unprofessional and completely clueless on how to perform their duties.  Asked for a simple change to my payroll deductions; no one knows how to accomplish this (neither administrative staff nor mangers) and three months later, the problem persists.  Save yourself and get a job at McDonald's - it's not worth it!"
bad,"A typical day includes cleaning, folding, doing go- backs, help customers, do fulfillment, open accounts, get ""coached"" by your manager. Management is usually somewhat okay. Depends on how serious they take their handbook and how much they care about their employees. Store manager did not care about any issues that came up. In all these years she has not talked to me once."
bad,"Their attendance policy treats employees like school children and the people allowed in management are soulless. They don't accept doctors notes at all, there's no such thing as an excused absence."
bad,"the promise commission they always look for a way to put your sales on deficit and since I started  i haven't see a pennie of commision.The promise a full-time and my hours doesn,t even reach a part-time must of the time. You have to be beg manager for hours."
bad,"greet customers, Sale my product, Assist customers on what they looking for, open Macys cards so that I can make my quarter for the week and my sales goals. and also prepare they store for opening and pull and fill fulfillment and also fold and recover tables."
bad,"The worst job ever. They should just say janitor, with having to clean toilets. You have to pick up the trash and clothes people just throw down, once they look at them. All for the huge pay of 10.00 per hour. The training is the worst. I was hired on 10/24 and had 2 days training on a computer, then I had to come in for 2 hours to learn to ring customers up, by watching another employee. Then they give me my first hours on Black Friday. By that time you forget what you learned. Most of the employees don't want you to ring up, so day afer day you are cleaning u the store. And God forbid if you neen to take a asprin, even though you don't leave the area, they count it as a 15 minute break, which you are not allowed.You have too many different bosses that don't know how to deal with people."
bad,Okay for a starter job. Not a reliable source for income. The job is not too difficult. Bad management. No benefits. Profit over emplyee company. Low pay.
bad,easy money if you have no life and like being with people. managers suck a lot and it's rare to see a few of them care for you.
bad,"Macy's claims to have an open door policy but when I needed to talk to someone other than in HR all I got was the run around from EVERYBODY, no one there, or at corporate would even give me the time, not even answer the phone, I was on hold for over an hour with NO answer still! And it was all because of BIG mistakes made with my paycheck which has lead to me to having to go three weeks with NO paycheck. And on top of all that the communication from the big guys, to the manager,s to the supervisors and then to the common warehouse worker is a joke along with this whole building."
bad,"This is a pretty ok place to work, being flex and picking own hours. However, store kind of almost expect this to be your main priority and then always breathing down your neck when someone calls out and expects you to stay late or come in. When you can't work a shift then it is up to you to find someone to cover it even if have things planned well in advance already. Must plan ahead and can only request off almost two months in advance when most jobs are two weeks. You only request three days unavailable for the month and then there are some days you can't request off at all. and you are expected to work every weekend. Sometimes you find that you are the only one scheduled for long periods of time in the department and customers complain when they can't find anyone. Also, note that not everyone gets holiday pay even if they work the holiday. Macy's only Close for Christmas and Easter."
bad,"Macy's is not a fun place to work."
bad,Management doesn't communicate with one another and will not help outside of their assigned departments. Policies are not made available to staff and are made up to fit the needs of the situation. The enjoyable part of the job is customer and sale associate interaction.
bad,"Would recommend this company on a part time basic, upper management need to demonstrate how appreciative they are because the associate really work hard to provide customer service"
bad,"it was not a fun or nice time working for MACYS, i was hurt on the job after working overtime and my paperwork on the accident was lost. lead me and others on believing we head jobs and let us go with only 4/3 days notice"
bad,This is an ok company to work for. Pay is low you have to fight for what you want because they are cheap! Macy's will have you do someone eles job for more that 3 months and when you ask for a raise it's a problem.
bad,The company is going through an identity crisis.  I don't believe it knows what direction it wants to go.  It's current strategy is to throw a bunch of ideas against the wall and see what sticks.
bad,Macys in downtown Boston is the worse job I have ever worked at the hours are ridiculous the very first day they just throw you into the water with other sales associates who act so stuck up because they have been there for longer and are unwilling to help you or they will help you and they are very nasty about it. I can see I Will not be here for long.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I worker at downtown Macy's only for 4 months but respect for minimum wage earners has greatly changed. My experience was that it was just shy of what I presume a modern day sweat shop - it was not for me.
bad,"Working at Macy's for six months was the worst decision of my life. The first two weeks, I went home in tears with blisters on my feet the size of quarters (even though I was wearing Dr Schols flats. You're not allowed to wear tennis shoes.) It was my first job where I had to stand all day. After two months, my feet were a lot tougher and I could start wearing heels and sandals."
bad,"A typical day at work included running around like a crazy person, I did learn a lot about fashion and processing credit card applications.  The hardest part of my job was being on my feet all day with no break.  The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to interact with the customers and offer my opinion."
bad,"Good for just seasonal.  Over worked and no pay. My department had too many immature females.  No one wanted to replace the clothes back on the racks, to many cat fights.  A Point System is in effect for each employee.  You are hired with NINE points. If you are late or No Show points are deducted until you fire yourself."
bad,holidays are so busy. probably the only time i'd work there. after holidays it's slow and boring.
bad,"Not What it seems!  Management slow to change, promotions are inconsistent and too much double talk and they don't even follow their own rules which makes a glass ceiling for others that have the desire and skills to make the company grow."
bad,Managers do not support employees in any capacity! 32 hours average to maintain benefits they schedule 23-28 hours and can not find hours to work. schedule 2 employees is a dept. and can not take breaks or take a meal break for 5-6 hours until another employee comes in. When we call management they don't come!
bad,"Typical day at work is the same as any other retail job, recover the floor and help customers as needed. I learned about merchandising and visual aid techniques, which helped me in the retail industry, but had little purpose or use in the real world. Management was fine, they executed their duties and functions to the best of their ability much of the time. My co-workers all had the same thoughts of the company: low pay, low appreciation and low expectations. Aside from being underpaid and under worked, most of my co-workers put in what I would call acceptable and sometimes exceptional effort. The hardest part of the job is getting people to buy the clothes when a lot of them are super expensive. Before I worked in the administrative office, I was on the floor, hustling for meager wage and trying to accomplish recovery, stocking and merchandising in a short shift. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers and co-workers."
bad,The manager at this job was completely unorganized. The co- managers also were uncooperative when I needed help with a particular task. When I was done with training I tried to get hours but the co-managers would tell me there was no hours available or the business wasn't good at the moment. After 2 weeks without open hours the co-manager laid me off. The associates were not nice either and they didn't act as if we were a team.
bad,The job was easy but when you have a jealous fat manager who is always trying to compete with the young employees and insults you with no care in the world it can be hard. Also you cannot grow from the inside. They hire outside people only.
bad,"Woring for Macy's, you can expect to put in a lot and see VERY little in return. Incentives are never salary bonuses, but often candy they found in a backroom from the previous year's holiday season, or a little card thanking you in a detached way, no matter how much an effort you put in. But don't worry, that coworker next to you who spends the entirety of the day on his phone also got one, and he will probably be the next person they promote (which, by the way, they never advance ANYBODY). As well, your job security here is very limited. If a store isn't doing well, do they cut down on merchandise (considering the store I worked at, where the floors looked like trash heaps and we sent back more than we sold)? No, employees go first. Sorry! Management was so-so. At least at the store I worked at. Half of them were incompetent, and the ones that knew what they were doing also are in on what a joke this place is. No raises. No advancement. "
bad,"I have not enjoyed my work experience here. There is no phone reception in the basement where I work, causing frustration from both coworkers as well as customers. Computers are slow and constantly breaking. The elevator and escalator are also constantly breaking as well, causing upset among customers, driving them away from the floor which I work on, causing me to not meet my incredibly high goals each day. I am thankful that I have a boss who stands up for me and is incredibly understanding. I hate that I am told to pressure customers into bringing down their credit scores each day by applying for a Macy's credit card. As if it's truly meant to help them. I hate that I am told to up-sell merchandise, because it is incredibly off-putting to customers who just want one thing, just to run in and out really quick. I hate that every day is a sale day, attempting to make the illusion that they are saving money when really the prices are always that low. I am incredibly happy with their return policy, which is basically if you can prove you bought it at Macy's you are allowed to bring it back. No matter what. Used and two years old, we'll give you a full refund. It makes my job less stressful that I don't have to turn them away because its one day over a 90 day return policy. However, it also helps them to purchase more at a time because they know they can return it. I feel the company relies partially on the gamble that they'll buy more with the knowledge they can return it, but they won't end up taking the time to return it ever."
bad,I think the whole credit card asking and having that go towards your job review is wrong. I also think they give you way to high of a sales goal on a slow working day.
bad,"Co-workers and most customers are pleasant. "
bad,Is ok. I dont see myself advancing in position at Macys. I dont have too much to say.
bad,"A typical day would be cleaning and trying to attend as much customers as possible. Including the amazing connections with the Co-workers, as well as the diversity of the customers coming in."
bad,Not enough pay for alot of work. Doesnt offer alot of hours. Some employees I've worked with were nice.
bad,"They will use and abuse you, and when you have reached the max of the pay scale...they will fire you. Oh and be careful not to get injured on the job, your really in for it then. These corporate giants think they can treat their employees like cattle without any repercussion. Until more people start speaking up..they will continue the behavior. CEO's...start getting to know the people who are working for you."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,a typical day at work was horrible i had to deal with racsicm favoritism and more. I had 3 managers that were great but the store manager was cocky and arrogant. My co-workers were great and loving. I learned how to control my attitude from dealing with such bs. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping appreciative customers and mingling with co-workers. I would never work at macys on el camino ave in sacramento ca
bad,"Macys as a company is a nice place to work but the Lima, Ohio store is nothing more than a country side road department store that is unfair to african american employees and african american customers. Was not like that 5 years ago but it has taken a turn for the worst having employees and managers looking like they are dressed to do yard work with horrible attitudes that mangers cannot control. Security team is so bad i actually caught one lying on floor in fitting room looking under door at 3 young african american girls undress. Management did nothing about it to security but sure was upset @ me for telling them, guess they wanted that kept a secret also. If you are great at your performance requirements and dress proffessional w/drive for success, get in at macy store that can and will appreciate you for what you bring to the the company in order for both to excell. Lima is not that store, just a small upgrade from wal-mart."
bad,they are not races
bad,"A typical day working at Macys is like being in a sweat shop , you work so hard for a company that doesnt care about their employees. The starting pay for Macys is 8.00 so good luck with people who think a lot of Macys employees get paid well!!!!! Then you have some co workers who act like children instead of their actual age !!!"
bad,"I worked in the biggest most luxurious Macys of all! Macys Herald square is indeed a fast paced work environment. I worked there for several years and want to be honest about my experience to help others. I began working there straight out of college because quite frankly the economy took a huge tumble and i like many other college grads had difficulty finding work in our designated fields. I started out as holiday help in the cosmetics department, the environment was competitive and commission based, the hours were crazy. I did well and was asked to stay on as permanent staff. I got a $2 increase from my original 10 Dollar holiday base pay. That would be the only significant increase in pay for my entire duration there. Over the following years I had to work hard for commission due do the low base pay , with coworkers who didnt give a care ( partly because they where there for many years and felt protected by their union, or by their manager in certain cases) about professionalism or customers. In fact all they cared about was commission, and confrontations would ensue if someone thought you stole their customer quite frequently! Managers on the floor are hard to find when a problem presents itself whether it be a customer transaction or dillemas between the staff. But if your manager likes you they can protect and cover up your faults such as tardiness,absenteeism, low productivity and even customer complaints! Eventhough it breeds resentment between other workers! Macys has an absurd relationship with employees setting unrealistic goals to SELL SELL SELL, and providing very"
bad,I just want my job back!!!!!! I have nothing else to say!!!!!
bad,"Macy's is a fun job, but when you get to working there you will not like it. They change your hours all the time with out asking you. There is always fighting there. I would not concern having anyone work there."
bad,macy is ok i have a job to go back to when i get lay off been there for 21 years
bad,"This is a horrible place to work! I have worked at Macy's for 1.5 years and the only reason I have stayed is I am unable to find another job. The store manager spies on his employees by having his little puppets write down everything you do wrong. The mentality at Macy's is to beat you down and demoralize you. They don't reward you for a job well done either, they only want more out of you. The people giving positive reviews can't be real employees because no one would give them five stars."
bad,"Terrible place to work, constantly being pressured by management to open up credit cards, as well as maintain scorecards. You might work a 6 hour shift and have a $2700 goal for the day, with 5 other people in your area working. Pay is mim wage, managers will embarass, and mock you about not opening up credit and sales goals. Only good thing about this job is your paid every week, & that the schedule is perfect for a college student. If thinking about applying, apply for a flex team positin, less stress! The amount of stress I went through at this job, is about as equal to the stress a doctor might have, at the end of his shift, only difference is, he's being paid to be stressed. I was part time 12-20 hrs, so just imagine wat a full time assoc.,goes through...smh."
bad,The location I worked at was very unorganized. The managers didn’t teach anything . Then they fired me because I did something wrong 3 times. Instead of correcting me the first time. My car was broken into and they didn’t even care
bad,Some of the management were horrible and treated us unfairly and are very sexist I worked here over a year and I loved some of the management but some were that great and let the power get to their head
bad,"This was my first retail job so I wasn't sure what to expect, and at first it was alright- a typical day for me consisted of a mix of working the register and making sure customers were taken care of, while recovering the floor and some merchandising when necessary. The coupon limitations, the details of the Macy's card, and its discounts were never made clear to me by management, which lead to lots of miscommunications between the customer and myself. Lack of clarity from management seemed to be the trend, and I noticed that the managers were somewhat of a boy's club, or whatever the woman's version of that would be. For me, the hardest part was understanding why management acted the way they did, not feeling like they valued me as a member of the team despite the good, solid work I did, and the fact that I couldn't get along well with anyone there. By the end of my employment, I totally hated it and dreaded going every time, so getting fired was kind of a blessing. An annoying one, because I was very good at the job, and I wanted to quit on my own terms, but it was a fitting end."
bad,"Macy's is overall a very inclusive welcoming work environment. However, once you get in here you discover that the MCCS call center marks your every move. You are constantly monitored, cannot really talk even at your desks and there is definitive favoritism. "
bad,"Macys at Fort Myers is great if you like to work with mold, rude co workers, and even worse managers. The job was great at first, don't get me wrong. I still shop for Macy's (nothing against them hiring terrible people). The managers are never to be found, the building is literally falling apart, and there's always something breaking. The compensation is  not up to par with the jobs."
bad,"Management at store level is very bad. they mistreat employee, they disrespect and push them around. management try to bowling employee and use abuse their power to push their employee . employee can't say anything if they did they will be written up . they do not care about employee what is important to them is management to be happy. "
bad,"Lack of training in many cases, Managment having their “favorite employees” hostile work environment, false statements and paperwork. Job clearly was NOT about work performance but based off the manager liking you or not."
bad,"Management shows alot of favortism and discrimination when it comes to salary, position, overtime, scheduling- almost everything. Team supervisors lied about the length of our temporary assignment and salary. We were first told that we would have optional overtime each week, then the option was removed, so, no overtime at all."
bad,"Management sucks, they think they’re too good to help out. only a few managers there that actually helped out and didn’t try to leave you with crazy customers demanding a manager because they were to lazy to come solve a problem. hours are okay, employees when i worked were great, except a few lazy ones. also - don’t get pregnant or they’ll treat you like actual garbage"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,The amount your standard warehouse worker gets paid versus the people that just sit and smile while just answering questions is terrible the bonuses for extra work only helps the company not the employees
bad,This was a very bad experience. Macy's west county des peres os very racist anonymous targets african american people. They will literally follow them throughout the store for no reason at all. The manager of the loss prevention dept.Is the worse case of management I've ever seen and I've seen a lot. They target all black employees
bad,"I enjoyed my coworkers, that’s the only thing I enjoyed, however. If you want to work somewhere and never see a raise this is the place! I had my starting wage of $9 for almost a full year even after asking for a raise multiple times. Then was told if I got one it would be about 10 cents! As I worked for the company I had more and more responsibilities handed to me and was still paid the same. It was also very hard to separate work and home as I would get calls and texts awhile off the clock about work to expect when I return. Also calls and texts asking to come in on my days off to do more work.This was just about an every day thing"
bad,"It's an ok place to work if you're young and trying to start out in life,  however, I wouldn't recommend it. Unless you're up the noses of management, you won't see much of a career advancement.  They don't care if you have family issues nor health issues, all they care about is numbers.  You're just a pawn.  You have a voice to express how you feel on things,  however,  they only pacify you to make you quiet and revert back to the nonsense a few days later.  The hours are terrible and they don't really comply to your availability and if they do, you receive hardly any hours. They don't give you proper training, they expect you to ""get it"" after two days.  They expect you to clean, do this thing called fulfillment, set sales, change signs, badger customers to open credit, make pre sale, make them a client without knowledge which entails personal information once their cards are swiped, and cater to make the customers happy all the while you're technically by yourself until the next shift arrives since management feels they're too good to be at a register to help out, or they're at one of their 2hour meetings or just talking about associates in their offices.  When you're trying to follow the rules of returns and a manager is asked for,  management makes you look dumb by taking the return when clearly the merchandise is not sellable.  I've seen merchandise on floor in which they brush of the dirt and place it back on the floor to sell.   If there was a fire, there are certain areas you can't escape from because some exits are blocked off with merchandise or floor fixtures.  If"
bad,"Was terminated bc I had a car accident and had to take off a week after being injured and had hospital and doctors documentation to show cause for absence  they said doctors notes and hospital records were not applicable. The new computer company system they used for attendance  marked as unreliable even though management was made aware of my  vehicle accident "
bad,"The pay is decent. The employee discount is cool. The people are OK for the most part. My main issue was every single manager was absolutely clueless and in most cases, useless.  Not bad for a seasonal/Christmas time gig."
bad,Poor Air Conditioning in certain part of Macy's. You're just a number. Managers are lazy and work when they feel like. The stockroom is very hot 100  degree plus in summer. Stay away from Macys!
bad,My boss (es) usually had 0 minutes of jewelry experience and there is a new one every 6 months.  It’s not a jewelry job it’s just another dept within the terribly run Macy’s company. Every aspect of this company is terribly managed. Every January they lay off many people just to rehire at lower wages a few months later. Worst company to work for that’s why they are going BK.
bad,"Allowed people with visible tattoos, piercings, colored hair, beards and tons of jewelry and perfume to work. Would not discipline staff that continued to grab, kiss and lear at others after being told numerous times how this was affecting the work environment. The management allowed employees who had been with the company awhile to harrass and bully new hires.  Go somewhere that will appreciate your hard work and dedication. Macys Lakeshore Grill is not it. It's a sinking ship."
bad,"Only stuck around for the raises, after three and half years. No chance for full time. Empty promises and part time isn't worth union dues. I lost about $10,000 in union dues in three and a half years. To many managers and way to high of a turn out. I was a non sales associate at this position."
bad,"This job is okay, if your looking for something to quickly get some money. But It's to much work for little pay. And there isn't any A/C so you will be extremely hot, the best part is the workers."
bad,"I worked for the Macy's at Cherry Creek Mall in Denver, CO. At first I really enjoyed it, especially my department captain and the floor manager was excellent! However, every morning shift required you to listen to constant harrassment about your duty to get customers to sign up for the credit card & later in the day you would be coldly reminded by the store manager and I felt shamed if I didn't. The store is disorganized and the wages are lower than Walmart or Burger King in spite of the high price of the merchandise. A colleague's locker was robbed & management did nothing to increase security. Do yourself a huge favor & work elsewhere!"
bad,I was a worker at macys for 6 months I always wanted to work for this company when I finally got the chance supervisors are disrespectful they play favorites they accuse you of stuff you didnt do to either fired you or you end up quitting because how they treat you .... The lack of respect the lack of responsibility and they discriminate when color people when in to the store they call security
bad,"Love the place when I first started but poor communication, suppose to be one team but we were all divided.. no really own up to there job.. it’s just bad there and no hours..."
bad,"They have high expectations but pay very little, I had put in a lot of work for a small check, pay me what I’m worth! I’ve been there for 6 months and they still never boosted my pay they said I have to wait a year! What a joke! A year for a quarter? Please! I had to re organize that whole dress section of last act, assist customers at the register and clean those fitting rooms! I bet the customer’s maids get paid more than we do!"
bad,during my time here i was scheduled very inconsistently and many times i would come into work and they would not have anywhere for me to work but i would be scheduled anyways and i was not taught how to clock in and out so for the first month i did not clock in or out until i was told how to.
bad,Not bad if you don’t mind working 10 hour shifts. Walking around the entire shift. There are no headphones on the floor while working so be aware of that
bad,"Awful raise. On average, everyone earned about $0.25 for a YEARLY raise. Very hard to move up in the company for the managers and supervisor choose who to move up rather you're more than over qualified or not; it was more of a pulling strings kind of thing. Overall a bad company to work for. Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy."
bad,Very low pay with a 1 percent commission. No chance for advancement as a holiday sales associate. Only an employee discount which I did not utilize. Fun change from healthcare.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I believe I was set-up.  At end of shift one of the co-workers asked me if I could drop of the money box to the depository upstairs. I’m like sure why not. Not thinking....Next day I’m called in by security for taking the money. Very traumatic experience for me. Told them to look at their cameras and see for themselves.  I was there no less than 3 months ...was the employee of the month and received compliments from customers. It seemed like some of my co-workers were jealous. VERY SAD! The pay is also atrocious for the name it carries!
bad,"Management does not care about employees "
bad,I loved working with the customers but the schedule sucked and for the pay definitely not worth the headache or aggravation loved the rallys in the mornings and some good co-workers. But def not for me.
bad,"RUN.....very fast away. They don't care on who they hire or how they treat their help. the pay ishorrible for your hard work and management sucks. Don't even bother going there. You do all the work and management and employees like to get ""high"" ."
bad,"Management has poor people skills and no resolutional skills either,  all paperwork and ""policies"". They get very involved personally,  it depends.  Favoritism. There is no HR they make up the rules as they go. You will also be working in a store where a certain group of people personally like to take the self entitlement of running the entire place. Harassment is rampant, including from certain customers.  This store/company is being sued and has been previously sued for various reasons. "
bad,The supervisors in Martinsburg are terrible. They talk down to you like you’re a child and expect you to do everything within the first 2 days of being hired. They have no idea how to run their departments and talk about everyone like they’re nothing.
bad,"Those who work the hardest, get No recognition. & Those who work the least (few managers & alot of their associates) get the most recognition. You have to be an A** kisser for a promotion."
bad,When i was there i started out as seasonal but was offered a FT position. I enjoyed my work but their was one manager who would always yell at me for talking to the person either in the induction line behind me or the one helping my line during peak. Crazy thing was I was meeting my numbers hense why i was offered a FT position. I just got so fed up with this one manager that I left after discussing this concern with HR and a few weeks later he was demoted and then terminated for harrassment. I went back as a seasonal temp in beauty and ended up missing because of a misscarriage then when I was released to go back the night manager in beauty told me that I couldnt come and go as i pleased and she didnt want me on her team. So i went to HR and they had me break up boxes for 10 hrs... After that I figured management didnt care about their staffs well being and never went back.
bad,"Terrible experience working here, and I always had trouble with my manager. Very unprofessional and they don't care about employees. They only care about credit so they could get they're bonus."
bad,"Disorganized environment. Everyone tells you different things when you ask them questions. Policies are changed, and not everyone is updated.Macy's as a company dumps unrealistic amounts of work onto the workers and then cut the workers that cannot make the cut. No recognition to the people who really work hard and they give us poor raises .  They don't value their workers at all, I been there for so long because of the people there."
bad,Poor work place. I have 2 days Im still needing to be paid for and Ive called everyday no response of status of pay. Ive 2aited 3 weeks for 2 other days worth of pay they did not give me in a 3 week period time span. Horrible company I feel Ive been ripped off.
bad,"Early on I really enjoyed my job until employees and other managers around me gave me the rundown. They told me sales managers never appreciate their efforts and were treated unfairly. Soon I witnessed myself that sales managers work against you not for you. They are very unprofessional and have their favorites. You are constantly pushed to open up credits and looked down upon when not opening enough. They are very strict when it comes to taking days off. I would schedule unavailable days and they would still schedule me and make it nearly impossible for someone to cover the shift. They claimed they couldn't make any exceptions when it came to scheduling, but would do it for their favorites. Didn't feel comfortable bringing up issues to my own manager. I enjoyed what I did there but management there and other negative employees would have me drive home in tears. Not to mention pay was not enough for everything that was demanded of this position."
bad,My experience was not good.  Was hired on put never as part time and was not told I would not be able to be candidate for it or full time. Was not given any benefits and only given a slight increase in pay after 2 1/2 years. Was not also told I would not be able to get a yearly review.  Management was VERY poor and issues were not heard.  Hours were not consistent and there were times I didn't have ANY hours for months!
bad,I have learned that this company does not care about there employees. they have bad communication skills and don't care to train there employees. Managers are bad under stress and take it out on their workers. they work you till you get sick and done treat you with the respect that you disserve.
bad,If you don't have a college degree you won't make more than $14 an hour there. (And that's after 3 years and being promoted as high as I could) they have yearly raises for only some employees and even then it's just $0.10. None of the management really knows what they're doing due to the fact that they've never worked on the floor. They let go of their entire HR department several times due to how dysfunctional the entire plant is. The Macy's distribution center in Owasso Oklahoma has poor growth opportunities and doesn't want to see their employees secede.
bad,I'm sure not all stores are the same but I've had such a bad experience here that it's effected my health and I've only been there a year this month. The other managers can agree which is why we will all be resigning fairly soon.
bad,Macy's the company as a whole is great. Meaning there is opportunity for advancement. However the culture is horrible. LEARN HOW TO TREST YOUR PEOPLE!
bad,This job doesn’t train you for the position you are hired for and expect you to learn on your own. And I had lack of attention from the supervisor. In order for me to get to him I had to ask a friend to call him over the radio.
bad,"This is a typical retail establishment where you are forced to work weekends and all holidays, except for Christmas.  This means you have no work/life balance.  Pay was not terrible, as I worked very hard as a commissioned sales associate.  Mass layoffs in 2009 ended the jobs of a lot of upstanding, customer-oriented, and dedicated employees."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I was a diligent worker that cared about customer service but the managers did not...they only liked employees that were fake-nice. It was so odd to me. They did not value their customers or employees. They did not provide adequate training, and every schedule they put me on was outside of my availability (I am a student.) When I mentioned it to them repeatedly, they did nothing to fix my hours..they made it my responsibility to try to swap shifts. Really depressing job and store. Managers were cold people with poor hygiene and I am so happy to not be working there any more. BTW they did not always pay back what was owed to customers during certain sales. They also mislead customers about which coupons work, and overprice poor quality merchandise. They also do not stick up for trans employees, and do not care if customers are rude to their employees."
bad,I enjoyed what I learned working for the company and I don't feel they paid enough for all the time and work and my supervisor was a dramatic person and very lazy.
bad,"Macy's is a very unorganized company to work for.  If your willing to put in the hours then its really easy to earn good money.  Management there never last longer than three months.  They even took out their human resources department, so if you have an issue you have to call an 800 # in Ohio and be on forever hold to resolve an issue that you may have.  There are lots of drugs in the building.  If you walk into the main front office then you can smell the odor of marijuana very strongly.  The bathrooms always smell like marijuana and security will tell you to ,""just leave the door open and air it out.""  If you want to make quick money and don't mind the environment then Macy's is the place for you.  If you want to work in a safe, drug free, organized environment, stay far, far away from that building."
bad,Great for if you are in college and need a part-time gig. The pay and commission is really low and you can't live off the salary that you get working here even at full time.
bad,I devoted over twenty years st Macy’s. I always received met or exceeded expectations on my annual reviews. I was laid off because I earned more than a restructured department budget permitted. I received no apologies or thank you or even a goodbye from the department head. I’ve heard there are no promotions being offered in the foreseeable future. I may have been lucky to get off a sinking ship.
bad,"Too much commotion and people everywhere. Peak season is insanity. Had my lunch stolen on several occasions. People overdosing in restrooms. If you work in the back, the walk in and out is horrible."
bad,Macy's retail have made many store closures within the past year along with associates getting laid off from work. Macy's makes many broken promises to their employees. I have been employed with Macy's since 2012 and have gained a great sense of knowledge of how a corporate retail works. The management team will not always spend one on one time to continue your growth nor give you the proper training that is needed.
bad,"Managers at Macy's weren't straight forward about telling you how you were doing, the people around you weren't honest as well and if they had commission, even worse because it was like a battle field to get as much clients as possible."
bad,"Very poor health and very expensive benefits. "
bad,Management do not communicate well. The turnover rate is very high. Over half of the equipment does not work. There is a lot of favoritism. I would not recommend to work at this particular Macy's.
bad,"Weak management, does not care about the welfare and the work condition of personnel. Overall, it can be a fair starting point for the fist job, but it can not be your career!"
bad,"My location has poor management throughout the store, which leaves employees and customers alike upset and stressed. Many jobs were eliminated, and there are probably more to come. As with any retail store, sales are somewhat competitive in noncommissioned departments and more competitive in commissioned departments. Schedule can be flexible, pay is above minimum wage, and there are certain benefits of you work a set amount of hours on average (paid time off, insurance). Attendance works on a point system, so punctuality is important."
bad,"The people I work with are wonderful. The discount is great.  The company focuses on taking care of the customer. Customers complain the most about not enough sales representatives, & the company keeps cutting jobs to save money. Extra job tasks have been added to my responsibilities over the past 5 yrs, however my salary increases hasn't exceeded $1."
bad,"this location was unorganized and had no communication within anyone. There was no relationship within colleagues or managers. Managers, allowed customers to take advantage of coupons and discounts. It was a mess. do not recommend."
bad,I did not like macy's and I would not recommend them to anyone. The pay was not good at all. I felt over worked and unhappy. The employees are not bad.
bad,"Macys is honestly one of the worst jobs I've ever had. I worked in the fraud department at the call center and it was ridiculous. you're just a number to them, they don't care about you at all or try and help you improve, there are too many other people that can do your same job and they know it. the turnover rate is over 90 percent for a reason."
bad,"Most of the partners are very kind and make your work less stressful .You can ask any question you have, and they always help you more than a manager."
bad,"The company doesn’t have integrity, works people to death, and poor wages. As much money as Macy’s brings in wages should be comparable, but they’re not."
bad,Macy's at Harford Mall in Bel Air Maryland is a terrible place to work.  If you lack common sense then you would be a good fit for their management team.  Managers are unqualified but they are willing to work for the low pay that Macy's now offers. You spend part of each day undoing something from the day before that a Manager had told you to do.  I would not recommend anyone to work at Macy's in Bel Air.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,it was so bad people did not want to work then when you do work hard they turn around and cut your hours to nothing and give them to lazy people sad..
bad,"When starting a job at Macy's they provide paid training."
bad,"The compensation was very low and did not increase to accommodate cost of living increases. I understand retail is 7 days a week, but they make you feel like you have to choose work over your family on holidays. There is no consideration for the fact that employees are HUMANS first. Granted I was only working there part time for extra income, I feel horrible for the people who HAVE to work their to support themselves."
bad,"Most of the time was spent covering upper managements butt. Hours were horrible for some associate, little to no hours some weeks and the full time people were then expected to pick up all the slack and were generally treated unfairly."
bad,This should not be a requirement on this site. What is the point? I am continuing to type type type so I can get the minimum amount of characters needed.
bad,There is great opportunity at Macy;s if you are willing to relocate but with in the opportunity is very low although there is great commitment  and experience on the Supervisor Level to advance to Management is very low. They would high from externally.
bad,"In order to advance, regardless of your work ethic or excellent reviews, it depends on who likes you. I would like to be rated on my work and ability to engage with other others in a professional way, and not by who didn't like the expression that was on my face at the time. It's not a place that will look at a person work ethic."
bad,nice company to start with as far as an introduction to the retail world but not a company to grow with career wise. there no growth and they do not promote with in
bad,"We would have one managers tell the team to do one thing and 10 minuets later someone else would come and tell us to do something else before we could even finish doing what we were first doing and so on,"
bad,I worked in the home department and I was a sale's associated. I assisted customers and worked at the cash register. I learned how to use the cash register. Management was tough on employees. My coworkers were very fun to work with. I didn't like the late and holiday hours. I enjoyed the discounts for employees
bad,"I have been working here for a couples years now and haven't really had any problems until recently. The management is extremely unprofessional, they are unorganized and let certain employees do what ever they want. With the recent change in executive staffing, minus a few, the store is going completely down hill. I would advise people not to apply here."
bad,I work with Macy's for 7 yrs I really enjoy working here but I didn't like the fact when they started that point system where you can not take off from work and they take points from you when you absent or late if you used up your points up they will write you up and then they terminated you from the company.i would recommend don't work for this company.
bad,cashiering walking around fixing clothes up. learned how to work a cash register. Management sucks really and the hardest part was tolerating customers during holidays.
bad,"The job itself is fine depending on what counter you work for. The management has unrealistic expectations for credit applications and will hover over any associates that don't bring in a new account daily. Management also requires employees to act as though they are in Disney land and will punish associates if not providing a ""Disney Like"" experience for customers."
bad,Negative work environment with lack of management and leadership and a fair training of product knowledge before starting on the floor. No sense of values among associates and managers.
bad,"At first I liked Macys due to the pay and somewhat benefits then I started to see that they don't help with balancing home and work. Meaning my car broke down but they didn't care,  it's not excuses. One day I went to the hospital and that even still was not excused.  Macys don't care about employees they only care about how much service they save with customers"
bad,The work place is very tense and very demanding. The managers were rude and made racist remarks during my time working there. Security watched blacks and minorities first.
bad,Please be aware that retail is an abusive work environment. Working at Macy's is considered to be the worst of retail. Customers are completely awful. Managers are extremely busy and cannot attend to the simplest things. Your workload is wayy too much for the small amount of pay. Macy's in doses is best if you want to keep sane.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Is a place for a person that can't keep a job because there is a union. There is no promotion. They like to hired from the outside. They love corruption by breaking union contact they don't respect.
bad,"Love the job, but with drastic cost cutting for fourth consecutive year, Macy's has hit the tipping point. Too much is being asked of too few for too little incentive."
bad,"This job was terrible. When I first started working there the manager was on my back all the time because I couldn't make a sale for the Macy's cards (no one wanted them). She would keep reminding me that I was on a 90 day probation period and that if I wouldn't sell the cards I would be fired. Also, they would make you compete with other employees on who made the most sales this would cause rivalry on who was who's customer. They did have 401k. You do have to answer phone, maintain clean work area, arrange everything that was displaced, no discounts, and management never had your back. They would always take the customers side. Customers that shop there are mostly people with a good income so they would look down on you. Had very very bad experiences work for Macy's. Other people that I know that have worked for Macy's have bad stories to tell about that company. Horrible job."
bad,"It was a wonderful experience, I'm very grateful for the experience that the company gave me... Its a large & very atmosphere... With a mixture of great, new, fun hard working people.."
bad,"I worked part time for macy's in the cosmetic department while finishing my bachelors degree. "
bad,"Management sucks a lot. They are hiring people all the time so they could care less about replacing you, very disorganized and half the time dont know what they are doing. systems dont show up the current sales of items so customers get really mad when it doesnt show up. Wouldnt recommend working here"
bad,"Too much work, little pay, management sucked, no one owned up to any mess ups whatsoever. Got treated differently by other workers in other positions and higher ups because of my job position. Did not work well with other job schedules. Did not like at all."
bad,"If you want to open up your experience with social in your life, meet different kind and type of people, co-workers and see how terrible people are, then you can work here!"
bad,"Where can I start? High turnover rate because of how bad the pay is. Managers who only care about presales and opening the store credit cards. No real time allotted to making the store look presentable. Not adjusting the schedule to actually meet customer demands. Never having a full supply of shopping bags. Unsafe work conditions that management does not care to correct regardless to how many incidents that occur. So much more, but unfortunately nothing is going to change."
bad,"I learned how to be a successful sales person and be patient with customers. I became responsible and sensible. Management was a mess, they were never aware of what was going on amongst its employees and were hardly ever there to solve a costumer's problem or answer a question. Training was only computer based and awful. They threw me on the floor with no one to shadow or help me out. Half my coworkers were very friendly and nice but the other half not so much. The company didn't really encourage helping each other or building a team atmosphere. I enjoyed running my own shop, being responsible for the majority of it's sales and keeping it up to date and stocked. I also enjoyed talking to customers and pairing them up with the purse of their dreams, or helping someone pick something out for their friend or family."
bad,"This is the most racist company I had ever worked for. Black Associates were treated the worst in this compagny. If you were white, you were getting promoted left and right. I had learned the true meaning of racial discrimination working at Macy's. My co-worker was fired because he refused to follow a black couple who the manager thought was stealing."
bad,"I left a job of several years and accepted my dream job and great position at Macy's. I was let go because of a few minor errors, after two months of employment with no valid reason. This has been the worst experience every. They do not care about their employees at all. I was also told by the head of HR that there are other openings and I will not be place there and did not care about my personal issues. Worst place very high turn over."
bad,Inconsistent with my hours. One week I would work only 1 day the next week 2 days. There's seems to always be no work in area. I got hired as an oder picker yet I never got certified as one. The work there is simply boring and alot of times I was jus walking around sweeping. Also I know it's a warehouse but the inside is so dirty it looks like a dump. At least at the costco warehouse they actually keep the building clean. Overall the experience there sucked and hated it while I was there.
bad,"While working at Macy's as a Seasonal Sales Associate, I faced many problems. There was no good communication at all between the Seasonal employees, and other staff. Some of my shifts would be really hectic and did not correspond at all with my school schedule, and most of the time I would call to schedule myself for shifts but I was rejected or ""not needed at the time"" And that went on for awhile. I would ask to work in other areas of the store, such as ""Can I ring customers up? or can I help with.. ect."" But I was mainly only scheduled for ""recovery"" which is just folding clothes. And lastly, I just felt that $9 per hour wasn't enough money for me. I'm a full time college student, I commute, it  was not doing me any good. A lot of my paycheck went towards educational expenses, and gas so I barely had any left over for myself."
bad,"Good job for college students such as myself because of the flexibility of hours, you can just about make your own schedule"
bad,I loved my job here at first but the managing team at Bay Plaza  changed that. I received numerous awards for my contribution to my team and store. I thought i was on a good path and i seen myself growing. i got injured and was out of work for 3 weeks. I returned to a new managing team and it seemed like all my credits left with the previous mangers...
bad,Lack of pay compared to requirements and responsibilities to the position don't match. The conditions of the job are dangerous and not sanitary.  Receiving associates are responsible for the back bone of the stores operations.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I don't care for Macy's as far as employment or as a customer that's why I quit. At first it was nice but once I was settled in a saw a lot of unethical business choices. the store manager was great but his Loss prevention manager plays  sides and don't train the people properly. a little completion is good but the playing people against each other is not good. I believe that loss prevention should be a team effort.
bad,"When it comes to retail, there is NO SUCH THING as a typical day at work. Everyday is different in many ways. One day may be a slow day, and the next day is a sale day with crowds of people asking for your help."
bad,"A typical day working for Macy's doesn't really start until you have one of the managers breathing down your neck and pressuring you to sign people up for not one, not two, but THREE credits cards for married couples. If you didn't sign people up with enough credit cards, you definitely were not shown the same favoritism as your fellow employees who got hours and worked enough to have more opportunities to impress management. Unfortunately, management isn't the flaw of this company. In this competitive, commission based environment, everyday was a constant battle with coworkers. Fighting to get sales and fighting more when work wasn't dived up fairly. I often found myself pulling twice the work load but getting half the pay because my sales were suffering in picking up the slack for other lazy and greedy people. Overall, horrible place to work."
bad,"No work/life balance, many six-day work weeks expected, even out of the holiday season; many 12+ hour days, and primarily an operationally-based company. Little to no investment in people development. Very disappointed overall, and quite different from the way the role was sold to me during the interview process."
bad,The most enjoyable part of working for macys is the customers that shop in the home department. Their friendly and will come to see you all the time. The hardest part of the job is lifting & moving items on big sale days. The management some times work together but the assume you know the ends & out. A typical day working at macys is hoping every one shows up at work to work their schedule if not your going be short staffed and your going to have to handle a lot of customer complaints. Human Resources show favor to certain employees the have points for coming to work on time & being absent & late. Some people get to zero points and are allowed to stay while most get fired. Chesapeake Square Macys is not on a eye to eye level. The store has great potential to be a great business
bad,I didn't have enough hours. At times I would only work 4 hours a week. It could have been a great job if the hours were more consistent.
bad,While working at Macy's i learned that it is important to communicate  and have a pleasant attitude with the customers and workers. A pleasant attitude and communication  with can allow others to shop at the store.
bad,Ok place to work. good when they need you.  Management needs to learn multiple jobs.  Not good when low employees have to show managers how to do easy jobs. The best part of this particular job is that you are left alone.
bad,"Received great deals on merchandise and love the lunch breaks, and loved the overtime hours, great way for teens to earn extra money."
bad,"the job it self is easy and fun I love my customers"
bad,"A typical day involved dealing with customers, straightening the merchandise and being badgered by managers to make goals when there wasn't enough customer traffic. The hardest part of my job was trying to hold firm to an idea of ethics when being told to disregard it."
bad,Good people low salary no room for growth bad magement poor from top to bottom
bad,"At Macy's, the number one priority is profit. Meeting sales goals, making sure customers are likely to come back, and above all, opening Macy's cards. Macy's credit cards are 100% profit, and the expectation and pressure to open one for every customer, every time is high. Managers often step into transactions to pressure a customer if they feel you're not putting on enough heat, and have absolutely no qualms with encouraging and even pressuring you to open cards for people who speak very little english, are mentally disabled, are older and confused, or otherwise lack the understanding that they are applying for a credit card. Associates are not allowed to tell customers that if they are denied because of their credit, then just applying in the first place hurts their credit even more. Some Cardinal Sins at Macy's are actually taking your scheduled 15 minute breaks, sitting down at any time during your shift, bringing food or water to your station, respecting a customer's wishes concerning purchases or cards, and using the same coupons as customers do. Although the policy in the store is that if a customer throws a fit, they get whatever they want, you better not expect to have your money be treated just as green as theirs. LP is always watching, keeping close tabs on any minor screwups, and the managers are always ready to spring up at the exact moment you stop to take a breather and ask why you aren't racing around the sales floor. If you have no sense of integrity or morals, you'll do well here, as you won't have a problem with harassing customers into spending more money"
bad,With sales goals that were unattainable it was incredibly hard to enjoy. Awful
bad,its a nice place to work. only thing that sucks is the sales goal
bad,12 hour days seemed more the norm than the exception - most people in organization worried about themselves versus the team - tough environment to get teamwork and buy-in from those where individual success is more valued
bad,"Just hard to work at a place, were your treated like a nobody, never eough work done. they don't care if you get a break or not."
bad,it was an experience. im not sure if offered that i'd return there for employment.
bad,short & not fun did not enjoy this job did not get enough hours my manager was rarely involved.
bad,"I worked on and off in the kitchen because I was the fudge maker in my own kitchen "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Cabinets, keys, locks, etc in poor condition and managers say ""Macy's can't afford to fix anything."" Have seen many employees injured, including myself. "
bad,"Hard on your legs and work 8 plus hour for only minimum wage, just needs more younger people to liven up the spirits."
bad,"Management and human resources were terrible, didn't want to help or answer any questions. Never wanted to give feedback.. acted like they didn't know what they were doing. Seemed like they wanted to cause internal confusion and affairs which cause trust problems among co-workers. Huge amounts of confusion when it came to schedules. The whole incentives program is a joke. Management showed favoritism to family and friends. "
bad,"The atmosphere at Macy's is pleasant, however the scheduling is very unorganized."
bad,Management needs improvement however the coworkers are fun to work with besides that not a fun place to work
bad,Comprehensive sales in Men's Shoe Departtment with highlights of exceeding expectations on continuous basis
bad,High turnover. Vicious clienteling. Not worth the time. Look elsewhere.
bad,"Macys had to be one of my worst retail experiences. I didn't mind working for commission but for the hourly wage to be minimum wage was unfair . Fighting with older woman about whose customer was whose was just absolutely ridiculous. I've never experiences such a tense , argumentative work place environment a day in my life. Especially with older people. I'd go back if I really had to but I'd set ground rules and draw the line way before I have in the past with this company. "
bad,"Management is unaware of wait is going on on a daily basis.  Store Manger is poorly trained an is of no help to the department mangers, associates or customers "
bad,"The only positive thing I can say about working at Macy's is the flexibility.  If you enjoy working for minimum wage, constantly selling something (besides clothing) to customers, being rated as a ""low performer"" because you didn't open up enough credit cards, dealing with the ""drama"" of coworkers, then this is the place for you.  A huge disappointment coming from a company that's been in business for over 150 years.  Maybe if they spent less money on commercials they'd be able to pay their employees more.  Turnaround of employees is never-ending."
bad,I worked in Ladies Shoe Department where my co-workers weren't friendly at all. They all was money hungery since majority of them had kid(s) and it was a commission job. Shoes were always everywhere and nobody cleaned up after themselves. NEVER will I work in that department again!
bad,Enjoyable and friendly
bad,"I was a seasonal employee, my co-workers were great, the department manager and some of the ambassadors were awful. I asked 3 managers and ambassadors if I would be retained(I filled out their retention survey)and each told me something different! no I see they are looking for people. 1 ambassador tells you one thing to do, then 2 seconds later another comes by and tells you to do something different."
bad,"Management is two-faced. Managers have very fake motivation towards employee's. Human Resources is very biased and unprofessional. Benifits are ok if full time. But if your a part time associate making 20hrs/wk forget it!!! 85% of employees are part time. 10% are full time 5% are salaried managers. The store managers I have seen are rude, unfriendly, and have no people/personal skills. Managers get very agitated when corporate comes down to visit. Managers bring way too much negative energy and hardly support positive energy. The values of the store are plastered through the store in many of the employee lounges but are never enforced. for example they promote that ""If you give back, results matter, you count"" But when I gave my time to work more hours and results were a success, I didn't count when I asked a day off to attend an important family emergency. I was able to balance my personal life pretty well because I'd be lucky enough to work 20 hours a week. Overall I got treated poorly, and so I am giving them a poor review!!!! AWFUL PLACE TO WORK AT!!!"
bad,I being the only male merchandiser was forced to unload shipments from trucks 2 nights a week. I would have to lift very heavy boxes and give them to the ladies to process the merchandise. I had to work midnights and could not get more then these 2 nights a week of work.
bad,"0 Training, 0 help, 0 teamwork 10+ on dis-organized, 10+ on rudeness."
bad,Things started out well there until we got a new store manager who power trips and feels that everything has to be her way or no way at all. If you speak up for what is right and fair then they will try and get rid of you.
bad,Typical day is managers pushing you to make sales and rude customers
bad,during thanksgiving and christmas time
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I enjoyed working here for the time I did and learned a lot, but not to any thanks of management!"
bad,"Management is a joke, they just say yes to please customers insteading of dealing with the issue."
bad,"I had a decent relationship with my immediate supervisor. However, because I was not the most aggressive associate I actually lost sales to other associates. Our sales performances were tracked and posted in the breakroom. There were two asssociates in particular who were especially vicious and got ahead by stealing sales. One time my manager pulled me aside and told me I could be fired if my sales goal performance did not approve. For several weeks, I made it a point to be as aggressive as possible, I competed with these associates directly, greeted and assisted every customer in sight and aggressively defended my sales from the others so they would not be stolen. My sales performance increased dramatically, but I did not enjoy having to become so aggressive that I made it difficult for my fellow coworkers to make their goals. But they did congratulate me for 'outsharking the sharks,' and were pleased that I was able to do this. I had close working relationsips with several of my coworkers here, including my immedate supervisor. I worked with the company for over five years, and I was still only making cents above minimum wage. Minimum wage went up, and instead of making a dollar above it, I was only making a few cents above it. Potential raises were based on reaching sales goals which were virtually impossible to meet."
bad,"Need to flexible, crazy hours. 30 minute lunch breaks . Best part of job making customers happy. Worst part unsteady hours"
bad,Macys is a great compant tp work for. Macys makes it fun and fresh an a day to day basis. Macys trully cares about the associates in meny differant ways.
bad,While I was there I enjoyed meeting new people. but while I was there I was suppose to work as a part time worker but I worked full time. I did everything I could to be the best as far as even training new people . Then there was a issue with coupons and as soon as i came up and explain my truth I was sent right out ...so hurt
bad,Co.workers.are nice management.does not know what there doing surprised there still open very dirty alot of favoritism going on and alot of stealing which they do nothing about
bad,"When I worked here the hours were terrible,management was severely lacking,and the customer were awful.The 3 months I spent working at Macy's taught me that the manual labor I was doing before was much more preferable.Poor management,terrible training,and ignorant management that knew little more than I did."
bad,"I started as an MMG Support and ended up self-training after learning the basics. The job was okay. For a brief time I enjoyed the work and people. My immediate manager was an amazing person I usually enjoyed my coworkers. I got promoted to the Pricing Lead position. After only 4 months but after the store manager left and was replaced by a young woman and the second MTM came in, Macy's became toxic and they are trying to fire the people who keep the building up."
bad,Macy's did not have my paycheck on payday more than one time. I had worked off and on for this company for 10 years. I was told I had to wait the next week for my pay. I don't want to work for them ever again.
bad,"The job itself was nice and fine, the other workers that were in charge of me were so disrespectful and treated me poorly. They expect so much of you but treat you terribly like you shouldn't be there, it's sad that I had to leave my job because of them."
bad,"The seasonal Fullfillment position sucked and the management made it difficult for me to get my 40 hrs even though we were approved for 60... They also kept moving me around everytime I'd get fast or good at what I was doing. I had a lead who was incompetent, unreliable."
bad,"Very poor management. Training was so poor too. They don't care about people specially if you are seasonal. "
bad,Macys was fun to work because I worked with makeup. Everyday was a different adventure so this made the job place less boring. I loved the associate discounts and helping costumers with their cosmetic needs .
bad,"Bad management overall, they avoided crises when they came, don't side with employees when there is trouble.Most had no idea or training for bad situations."
bad,"The negative experience began with a phone interview, although response to my online application occurred within a week's time."
bad,I’ve had issues with management constantly. The manager destroyed the recruitment operation department it’s sad to see it go down. ONLY good thing came from this company was the benefits
bad,"Worked at the Sarasota FL location for 1 month, I was promised a position in the shoe dept but, ended up in ready to wear with a bunch of ruthless, mean commission based co workers. I asked the mgr. several times as to when I would be transferred to the shoe dept for which I was hired..never received a legit answer"
bad,This is a good starter job. The pay structure in the shoe department sucks. They force you to get push customers  to sigh up for credit cards and punish you when you don't
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,My manager always yelled at me in front of the customers as the customers are always right and never apologized for it. I left the job because they accused me of stealing merchandise that I brought from home and instead of checking the cameras they made me sign a statement which I later found out was admittance to theft. I don’t want to work for a company that would think I would steal the same merchandise that I try to protect daily from those that actually do steal. Horrible experience. They also owe me three hours of work that was never added to my paycheck from working on a holiday which was my day off.
bad,I applied for what I thought was a part time stock position but it turns out it was an “as needed” position.  So I started off working 20-25 hours a week which then dwindled down to 0-4 hours a WEEK! Mind you I was pregnant with my first child at the time and of course needed consistent hours but when I’d try and pick up shifts in other areas of the store they barred me out of the system! so for two months I had no work and was basically forced to quit. This company doesn’t care about its non management employees! Definitely not worth working for!
bad,"The training consists of 2 days by yourself in front a computer before they throw you on the sales floor. Supposed to ""shadow"" someone on the 1st day, but management said they can't accept reponsibility for not having any one that I can shadow on my 1st day and for having no co-workers available for me to ask questions to. The line of customers didn't stop for 5.5 hours before I was able to take lunch, which is illegal btw. There are so many things wrong with women's dept. at Macy's Culver City."
bad,Working in woman shoes is the hardest job in the whole store mangers treat you like dogs. They want certain jobs done in the shortest amount of time. They pay you at a low amount. The only fun thing about Macy’s it lunch. Don’t do it
bad,I did my first day of training at Macy’s and right away I knew they cared way more about their money than their employees. You needed to sign up for a prepaid card or CREDIT CARD just to get a discount! As if the people working at Macy’s for 9.45 an hour could afford a pair of 70 dollar jeans. Management was also quite posh and there were only like four people under the age of 30 there that I ever saw. Overall staunch environment and not welcoming at all. Had very nice corporate videos about inclusion that were the ONLY things keeping me even considering keeping the job.
bad,Simply SMVP was a racist . Simple District and Regional Teams are great and provide opportunity for you to see your store in a different light. However they are detached from what really goes on instore And HR Managers work for the SMVP period.
bad,"In the beginning it seems like a fun place to work, then slowly but surely it gets awful.  You are bullied into open store credit accounts, make extremely low wages in the hope that the commission will save you.  The commission is great, but with the relaxed return policy, customers treat the place like rent a center, don’t depend on commission either"
bad,Few lead/seasonal supervisors were actually instructive and positive.  But overall filled with horrible attitudes and negativity.  I was in exceptions which was a great place to work.  But every time you got sent to another section it was a negative and ill run operation .
bad,"The store I worked in was my worst retail experience thus far. Minimal training provided, no clear direction from upper Management, one INDIVIDUAL is ""over all this"" ( operations and asset protection). No communication among managers. "
bad,"I previously worked in the corporate recruiting dept at Macy's, which i loved.It was very rewarding helping others find employment and properly placing candidates with the correct skills and qualifications for the right position.We reviewed hundreds of resumes on a daily basis due to having to meet hiring quotas within a specific time frame to fill slots needed. Macy's has a strong and consistent nurturing work culture,one of the best.I learned that taking the necessary iniative to be a great team player is always noticed and obtaining the skills to be able to help others.The management is very hands on with their employees and always staying on tops of things to assure things run smoothly for everyone.I would say the hardest part about the job is not being able to hire those candidates that really may be in need of a job. As far as the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that i was helping others get their life back on the right track."
bad,"Something happened when Grandma Dracula lost the election in 2016. Everyone in charge stopped caring, cut everyone's hours dramatically. Now there's no help on the Sales Floor or to clean up after shoppers. Stores are messy, products inferior. Shifting to online but that service sucks too. Should have stuck with Trump. #MAGA #Draintheswamp #WalkAway #AmericaFirst #Trump2020"
bad,"The scheduling sucks here, that and the fact that they want you to get a million and one things done and you get pulled in every direction. And they are supremely understaffed"
bad,"Macy's mission is to provide a Magical shopping experience for the customer.  The experience for employee's, particularly managers, is anything but Magical."
bad,"Risky could be your lifetime gig could be fired in 1 month for no reason, take this job at your own risk. GL HF but I wouldn't give it high marks in anything except top level management.  Until you get up the ranks its dog eat dog daily."
bad,"Management is horrible because they are not monitored on a daily basis. So they do what they want with their employees. They only speak to you nicely when they need you. The store I used to work for had stalker issues which to this day they are not taken care of. I loved my job but I had a horrible manager and because Macy's only cares about their merchandise and not the safety of their co workers. I was not about to risk my life over that company. Bottom line is, they don't care about you."
bad,"Too each their own....The job is what you make of it, what you are willing to tolerate, and who's butt you are willing to kiss.  Never depend on anyone else.  Always make sure any issue is communicated to the correct person, NOT just your supervisor or manager.  Document everything including the days you miss work.  Never expect more than what you are willing to put in and never expect complete honesty."
bad,"I worked during Christmas help, so of course it was very busy. At some point it was so busy some of the employees that were hired wouldn't come in to work and it left those who did a little stressful because we were still learning the job, having to fill in in areas that we were not clear about. So customers did not receive full service at times."
bad,"Received shipments on a weekly basis and was responsible for placing in designated departments"
bad,hours was the biggest problems and gossip people did not like each other and thats including management. would not recommend this job as a full time too crazy.
bad,The girls in the buying department are mean and catty. No team work in this office. Competitive in unnecessary situations. Save yourself the trouble and do not even apply. Spent 6 months here full time and still have PTSD.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,The people you work with can be a lot of fun. It's a shame the company has had some struggles and lost some really good people. commision based environment so you have to hustle.
bad,"Of the course of 3 years, the work environment had become very stressful with little to no time for home balance. Zero opportunity for fair wages or equal advancement. They only good thing to come of Macys Kings Plaza was some of the great people I met along the way."
bad,"I disagree with a lot of Macy's policies, but if you have a good management team then its bearable . I don't like the pay and the lack of advancement in the company. It's all about who you know whether or not you get promoted"
bad,the workplace culture is horrible they don't train people properly or give people the opportunity to learn to step into a higher position they don't believe in the fact that people have lives outside of macys
bad,A typical day at work was receiving merchandise stocking merch . What I learned customer service . Management could be a lot better . Hardest part of the job was the holiday season .
bad,"The company is changing several aspects and not all are good. It is expected that you be available 24/7 to answer phone calls, check e-mails on your phone, and respond to the store whenever needed."
bad,"people are rude and over work you.  Also the bosses don't help they just stay in there office, they don't make schedules correctly so enough works can work in a day making it hard to do your job."
bad,"No ethics. No sense of customer satisfaction or urgency. Security not a concern. Good quality product, not great upper tier management. Falls into many negatives unfortunately."
bad,"I was seasonal so I had little chance to learn the ropes. The skills I did learn were very easily applicable and made it easier to get my job done. However, I would not recommend working retail to even my worst enemy."
bad,I worked around the holidays 40 plus hours a eek no benefits and very few breaks. Management were very nice. Although I enjoyed working with people the compensation was not enough to keep me there.
bad,to advance at macys you have to be with the in crowd and if you are not with the in crowd dont expect to advance. I was there for a while and did my job very well and never was approche for advancement while others who came after me a lag around advanced
bad,"I would never recommend someone to work here, but if you want to learn how to move quickly and customer Macy's is the place to start. Just be prepared to work yourself out, little pay, and doing the work of a team of 6 by yourself."
bad,"A typical day at work is all the work load falls on one person and no help from fellow coworkers. Terrible training. The older women  coworkers in dresses are rude and very unhelpful ,all they do is stand around and never help with go backs and gossip. Im so happy I quit this dump. The only Pro were the very kind supervisors. But beware of these older woman who work in woman dresses department . Maybe in a different department I would have a better experience working."
bad,"This job is not feasible for someone who is looking for something to make a living. I have been working for them as an on-call for a year and the hours are very unstable and apparently you are not guaranteed ANY hours with this position. Basically, you're only called when you are needed. Otherwise you pick up hours and if there are no hours to pick up then you will be out of work. Management is terrible for the fact that they only care about numbers and Macy's cards and less about the well-being of their workers."
bad,Extremely festive and inviting work atmosphere during the holiday season. Very diverse and cultured work setting with the opportunity to connect and engage with people from various backgrounds. Also helps you build excellent social skills.
bad,Sadly MAcy's is not a good place to work as call centres go. the mangement is unconcerned with the hardships they place on employees due to scheduling. There is also a great deal of SPYING.
bad,"All Macy's cares about is credit.  Regardless of your sales or clientel if you don't open Macy's Credit Cards; regardless if it's in the customers best interest or not you will not do well at macys."
bad,"bad upper management, no talent development "
bad,it was only a seasonal job but gained much experience. enjoyed working with staff and customers. staff very polite. offered a lot of hours.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"A nice place to work for. They have great clothes to buy for a decent price. Some things are of course expensive, but i guess you get for what you pay for."
bad,I worked at Macy's for a year. Management at the store was ridiculously terrible. The store manager was highly disrespectful and talked to the associates any way she wanted to. The managers didn't truly care about anyone but themselves. I had asked my particular manager multiple times to adjust my schedule so that I could maintain a full-time day job and be there at night part-time. Management never followed through with anything and the customer was almost always right even when they were completely wrong. The customers were allowed to talk to us however they wanted to and management didn't care because they still brought something. There was also a lot pressure to force customers into signing up for Macy's cards and doing presales. It's not the best place to work and if I could've gave it no stars I would have. Not all Macy's are like the one I worked at. I've been to others where management is always around and they are there to support the associates.
bad,"Open register and assist customers were my favorite things to do. stock and merchandise retrieval was my least favorite. "
bad,"Comfortable work environment. The employer offers many fun things to do like silent auctions, plays and Christmas programs. Dress code is business casual."
bad,A good source of side income. No professional development. No possibility of career advancement. One should use this position as a means to finance other career building activities.
bad,There definitely was room for improvement here. The supervisors were not trained adequately. Not much room for growth passed the Platinum Elite Position.
bad,Macys has a lot of cultural activites for employees.  The work in the call center becomes very repetitive.  Too much political upward mobility regardless of qualifications of candidate
bad,"The company is okay, management was average, co workers were nice. Pay was horrible and customers were usually irate. The point system is a real flaw, but the best part is that everything is computerized and you can access all info from home."
bad,ok place to work the pay was preety low. but the job was ok for the most part
bad,Macy's expects their sales associates to use the magic selling method to meet their ridiculous sales goal. I had a goal of $2000 for a three hour shift.
bad,Great job for those in High School or just starting out but no room for advancement with this company .
bad,"Tacoma mall macy's is not a good to work its full of drama and power crazed manager with the exception of two of them. Macy's  is very money hungry down your throat about opening store credit very unstable hours and 90% of the time a headache to work for. it may be a good place to start but that's it not for life to much drama between associates and managers cant forget that this macy's is one of few who are union so get ready to pay union dues the first two weeks, they take what seems to be half my pay check for those two weeks. they tend to always be under or over staffed everyday its really irritating and gets old. training is a drag but simple most of the things you do you learn on the job nothing fun about the place they've screwed to many people over many times I'm tired of it if u happen to work there try to get the young men's area its the only decent spot to work in the entire store besides all the screw up shadiness the young men's crew are a pretty vibrant crew easy to get along with"
bad,"worst place Ive ever worked at, staff was very nasty attitudes from everyone who worked there"
bad,Too much work not enough hours. Horrible wages. Too much responsibility. very stressful environment to be in  I have encountered a handful of friendly co-workers.
bad,This is one of my least favorite jobs I have ever had. Every time I worked it would be something totally different from the day before. Management was no where to be found and everyone is looking out for themselves. There was nothing enjoyable about this job.
bad,"Poor management,including store manager,disrespectful to women.one star for life balance,ad father became ill suddenly,lost many points for needing to be with them.had it thrown up in my face several months after the fact. By who else but store manager.my family comes first,dad is 82. Not the nicest group of people to work with in cosmetics , disrespectful.dirty counters, brushes, left by girls at counter,including counter mgr.dirty cotton balls and kleenex,qtips, thrown on floor and counter,no knowledge of skin diseases and disorders.obviously,.very hard to work like that,I believe all beauty advisers should be state licensed.macys expects slot and pays poorly, it reminded me of a sweat shop factory,free for all, untrained girls selling to sell,no knowledge,not fair to educated,trained beauty advisors.no organization.a dept mgr.with no skin or cosmetic background. Coordinators with bad attitudes,no respect, ego trips,insulting ,bullying,abuse,to feed there own insecurities. No good role model or leader.not helping other associates to be successful,due to bad attitudes ,again,insecurities ,with the right people,better management,the job would have maybe been different,but macys doesn't care about anyone as a person,which is not good for a company reputation.why good people leave."
bad,While working at Macy's i learned how to provide great customer service. I also learned how to communicate better with people and get a feeling of what they expect when they walk into a store.
bad,competitive atmosphere and near impossible expectations
bad,department was never staffed
bad,"Federal Group are not all the same, some company that are link to this one ! make the whole entire chain look bleak, because I learn alots from this company, but I also miss the other company I;ve worked for in the pass, because I moved my relocation change. I left this company and will never return."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Their training program is almost a complete opposite from the actual practices and procedures they do. The best way to describe is you will be a guinea pig. They are constantly hiring as they weed out people instead of proper training to secure a better work force.
bad,"Was a good place then they got a new asst strore manager,who never even worked retail and let him change policy and people's schedules without asking."
bad,Management is awful . They will tell you something then turn around and do the opposite. Staff is great management is not so much they are very rude and make you feel unwanted
bad,"Not diverse, very cliquey, rude managers. I would never work for this company again. I worked as a flex and they treated me like I didn't even work there."
bad,"After being employed for a year, I decided it was a good time to start a family, after taking maternity leave I had some complications and needed some more time off. I went through all of the correct procedures and was STILL fired. After trying my hardest to contact HR and advise them that I had sent in everything they had requested I was still terminated. Two weeks after having my child I was told that my managers already searching for a new employee to rake my position."
bad,"Most managers at Macys gossip like they're in high school. The jewelry manager was so clueless and made up things in order to save herself from any situation. The job was easy, people were amazing, didn't learn much from the job. I was never sent to any type of training. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people and meeting new people."
bad,"Macy's is one of the worst companies to work for. However, the Boca Raton store brings a whole new level of disgust to me. The ""managers"" are all racist. The company encourages bullying and discrimination by the managers and co-workers. They pretend to have an employee connection office to report issues but it is all a hoax. They pay by commission so it's essentially a ""dog-eat-dog"" situation that basically rewards corrupt workers. Each department has an old rat that has been working there for an eternity that believes every customer that walks in the department is their customer. Since they kiss up to the managers by buying them gifts, the managers encourages them to intimidate the other employees. Do not get fooled with that 20% employee discount, its not worth your sanity. Employees need to open a Macy's card to receive the discount, which is not a lot of savings when you do the math. There is no opportunity to grow, you end up slaving over $9 an hour; plus you get treated like an animal, it's terrible."
bad,"Not all Retail is the same... not really a surprise. I had worked for Macy's when I was in college (in a different store) on the sales floor, so I knew getting an interview yrs later wouldn't be an issue. I was looking because the hours at Best Buy had dropped to basically nothing per week. What I liked about the opportunity was the job posting stated Early Morning Hours, which is perfect for me since I have other jobs that are nights & weekends. However, the times I got scheduled during my 3 weeks there were 1-10 PM's.Now, because I'm not busy every night I could work these shifts. However, there is nothing early morning about a 1-10 PM shift and I knew at some point 1-10's would conflict with my other jobs. For the record it was a Merchandising role, which basically meant during those 1-10's I unloaded the truck that had the new merchandise. The major problem I have was the hours. If someone says 1 thing, and then it's completely different... that does not fly in my book and I left. And, I didn't really get into & won't how bad the environment was in the back of the house. The main reason I am posting this is to make sure people are aware of what happened to me and to hopefully make sure it doesn't happen to them. Will I ever go back to Macy's or any chain that sells clothing? No. As it is I'm trying to get out of Retail all together."
bad,in the beginning its a sink or swim minimal training.nothing difficult to do. expectations are high with little to no reward if you do a good job. might as well do the bare minimal and get the same outcome.very little room to advance.
bad,"Macy's Fairlane Dearborn, MI...worst Macy's. Lowest pay. Unaffordable benefits. Pay so low that no one will stay. Customers are pure trash. Unrealistic expectations."
bad,"Trabaje por 18 meses en el departamento de joyería y cada vez que tenía una queja nadie te escuchaba ni el manager del departamento , ni en HR o el Store Manager !!!  Mala paga , y cuando acaba el año fiscal tus comisiones vuelven al 1% así hayas vendido millones el año anterior!!!! "
bad,"Employees run the store and train each other, managers come to cover your shift, not enough workers, you open a few register in a couple of depts, no one watches the dressing rooms."
bad,"This is a horrible place to work at, actually ruined my life , management sucks , they all seem to know nothing about doing their job. DONT WORK HERE!"
bad,The pay is absolutely horrible. They try to hire everybody as flex so they don’t have to give them benefits. There was probably 10 people at my store in a position that received benefits. Some people on the support team don’t even get out on the schedule because they never have hours to give employees and nobody wants to come to work for 2 hrs at a rate of $9
bad,"Easy work, rude disrespectful management. Getting hours is very difficult. OT not open often at times. Very disorganized. You do get to meet all sorts of people though and still do learn certain skills that could further you in other warehouse or production. I personally wouldn’t recommend this job though, unless you’re in need of a job with decent pay quickly"
bad,"Macys expects the productivity of 75 hours+, within a 40 hour work week and expects you to help the larger :more important"" stores while sacrificing your own stores standards, yet makes no allotments for you to ""catch up"" in your own store."
bad,"Was at macys 6 months and it was awful. Little to no training. You cant ever reach a manager. The co workers i worked with were older and mean. Had 30372629 things to do by YOURSELF most of the time. Answering the phone,online orders,managing 2 dressing rooms,returns were INSANE with massive amounts being returned at a time. It was too much to do for 1 person for 9.00 a hour. Being fulltime was exhausting(youre running around like a chicken with the head chopped off) and hard to find someone to give you a break."
bad,"Macy's used to be a nice place to work, however with the new management things has changed for the worse. Expect lots of intimidation and pressure from the managers, expect a lot of micromanagement and a lack of communication from them. They will ask you to hassle the customers; schedules are awful too. The pay is average. They will also ask you to do multiple tasks (fitting room, recovery, sales, go to the stockrooms, etc), due to the recent numerous terminations of employees."
bad,I think I've said everything I need to about Macys.  I don't believe there is much future there for this company.  It's depressing to work for a company that is sliding downhill.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Not a place to return to  the managers are not there to support the staff if they are individuals and they require the same from everyone without question
bad,"My Review on Macy’s is that they have poor management, do not hear you out or care for your opinion,very Judemental,Unfair and unjust, also the pay was very low.they do not treat you right."
bad,"I worked at Macys for 4 years in Men's fashion and Women's shoes and it was a experience to say the least. Managers are shuffled around unnecessarily, workers are just numbers and the whole culture of big box stores is just dying."
bad,Unrealistic expectations to complete job functions. Upper Management is cut throat in their dealings with store teams and union associates. High turnover.
bad,No shifts alloted properly for almost two weeks.Finished my training and just waiting for the shift.The management is cool training is good they paid for the training but shifts allocation is bad.
bad,"make sure be at work about 20 minutes before to ensure you turn on register and get clocked in on time, once you have 0 point you no longer are employed"
bad,Management is AWFUL! Pay is AWFUL! Hours are what you make them. Store manager push push you to call and bug customers.They want you to collect as much info as you can from your customer so they can bug them to come into the store.
bad,"Working in a diverse environment, learned OSHA rules and regulations and accident process with Workmen Compensation. Most difficult part of the job was being pulled from the office during the holiday season to work the sales floor. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and the employee discount."
bad,I hated this job they would call for everything work life became really difficult pay was good but not worth the hassle and the stores only focuses on money they did not care about employees.
bad,"organzied work department, assisted customers with ordering & purchasing merchandise. helped with display setup/changes. cash drops, i loved how working there fit my schdule"
bad,I learned that customers come first and no matter what you do your best to make them happy. You are empowered to make the customer happy. Management is horrible but you make the best of it. Your coworkers become your best friends.
bad,"team work "
bad,"Was hired as seasonal worker with the hope of getting hired. Manager  needs better people skills. He's rude at times.They lead you to believe if you work hard you'll get hired. Wrong. They choose people based on favoratism not work ability.  The have Supervisors that have ZERO people skills and they do nothing all day but stand around and talk. They obviously don't drug test either. When they cut seasonal help they come and tell you, very rudely to go to the cafeteria with absolutely no shame in how they treat people. I would not recommend anyone trying to get a job there...."
bad,i learned how to  tag and sensor clothes.. i took the bus to work it was great that its on the bus line .. i had great co workers..
bad,"When I first started working at Macy's, I enjoyed coming in. Everyone always told me to ask questions. I got rewarded with cards most times. As a few months went by I would start asking more questions and no one was willing to help. They asked me what jobs I like to do most and least. I told them which ones, but they always gave me the jobs I said least to. It was an on-call position and as they started to hire more people my hours were getting cut drastically. "
bad,"The other sales associates and managers are great."
bad,"I was employed here for the christmas season and it was rough. The only thing I liked about it was the opportunity to earn macy's money (which is like regular money you can use with your discount to purchase items) and that i could pick and choose my schedule online."
bad,"We moved to the area a few months ago.  Both applied, both of us were hired.   During their peak season they offer a lot of OT, which was great.  However; both of us were told we were ""on the list"" to stay and become permanent employees.  Now...here we are looking for work.  Here we are with bills that are past due and getting cut off notices.  He got a letter in the mail a few days after he called and talked to HR and was told he was still employed and still considered an ""active employee!"" Was told they were looking for a position for him.  Went out of town, while we were not scheduled for a court/personal matter.  Low and behold I got put on the schedule after I mentioned to my supervisor that we were going out of town and not currently on the schedule.  Called and talked to HR they transferred me to scheduling. Of course I had to leave a message.  Of course no one contacted me back.   Get back, try to get into website, can't get it.  Call HR and find out I am now ""inactive"" because I didn't respond to the offer of employment.  An offer I never even received!!!!  I went rounds and rounds with HR.  Was told I'd be called back, I wasn't.  When I mentioned that I called on the final day of their so called offer I was told that didn't count because I didn't speak to anyone.  Well....if I had called HR and the person that I spoke to asked for my employee #, don't you think they would have mentioned something to me rather than just transfer me elsewhere???  I was told they verified they called me.  Well, if they had called and if for whatever reason I had not answered, don't you"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I didn't like the robotics of a big box retailer.  Management wasn't very personable. Go to work do your job, run go backs and go home.  Not very much fun"
bad,"management the hardest part of the job"
bad,"Management was always rude and inconsiderate. Insulted me multiple times and pressured me into doing things that were NOT my job (i.e. dressing a certain way, being a swimsuit model for a fashion show that I was very uncomfortable participating in etc). Horrible work atmosphere and for the amount I got paid, the stress and pressure was way too much. Macy's needs to learn how to treat their employees with more respect."
bad,I work with customers in the fitting room.
bad,"typical day is organize, do stock work for 1 hr b4 work starts and go to the selling floor and make your commission.I did learn more about customer experiences and products. Management is not great SOME are understandable while OTHERS are rude and pressure you too much and make you uncomfortable. hardest part is opening Macy's account because plenty of people just do not want one. The enjoyable part can be the customers and sometimes your co-workers depending on your relationship with them. I honestly work there for experiences 6 months after that it would not be there no more due too my experience with management there, SOME did not work well with the employees and did wherever they can 2 make an employee feel horrible."
bad,"I worked at Macy's in the Golden Triangle at Denton, TX and they seemed to not truly care about the workers. The pay was $7.75 an hour which is very close to minimum wage. The company hated unions. I worked in a small team of about five people. We received shipments from trucks and tagged them. We also placed the items at where they belonged in store."
bad,"I worked at the Macys in the Sanford mall and it was very slow. I worked in the juniors, kids, jewelry section. The managers always wanted us to pay attention to our customers so we can find what they're interested in."
bad,"Management direction is relative, contradicting and felt like they always had something to prove. Most employees were far more intelligent and understanding of how things needed to be. Management just made things more difficult and mostly sit in their office all day when they aren’t."
bad,They have you do so much for so little. The pay was not that great when I was working there and the managers were very snotty and rude in the women’s department
bad,No communication between seasonal employees & managers.I felt like they didn't even know I worked there.They threw me on the register on my orientation day after 2 minutes of shadowing with a long line. The employee just walked away and left me. The fitting room lead is cool and I worked closely with her.My last day They called me in the office&said I was a no call no show previously& got mad.When I actually did log in and tell them.She ended up finding out later I did call out sick online like I was supposed to.But no apology was given.
bad,"It was always about your numbers. Lots of favoritism.  Raises sucked. People got away with alot, if your manager liked you. No help.  More Spanish speaking"
bad,"I worked for Macy's for 8 years and they were a waste of my time. I worked my butt off until the last year I worked, I was only getting 1 day a week. My manager at the time lacked communication skills and I eventually was let go because of it. I ended up getting another job because of the lack of hours and days and not knowing when I was scheduled to work. A lot of favoritism goes on too and employees moping around"
bad,"do every task required . the jobs are very easy just open boxes and lift things, take things to other places but it gets boring fast. the people on the sales floors are never nice, could be racist"
bad,"I think Macy's is a fine place to work.  Just not in the store where I worked because the manager micromanages and doesn't understand the standards for the jewelry department.  She does not follow though on her responsibilities to her employees.  I really enjoy my job, co-workers and customers."
bad,"Back breaking work"
bad,"The department I currently work is a commission department, and some of the associates do not respect rules,"
bad,Don't waste your time they do not care about the people on the phones. If you don't do wall they will not tell you until they are walking you out the front door.
bad,"The reason I left was because of the management. I never had such a mean, rude, disrespectful manager as such. This person made the entire environment stressful and meaningless. The type of position I had was suppose to be fun and exciting; instead, it wasn't. She stayed in the office all day, didn't interact with us, gave us negative coaching, did not tell us what we're doing right in the department, blame us for everything, paranoid, made people out to be more than what they really are, etc! Awful business ethics, uncomfortable, and she should not be in the department that she is in. She doesn't represent it well..."
bad,"My position was eliminated and the best shift was eliminated so they kept the Monday -Thursday 6:00pm-4:30am people current and the 6:00pm to 6:30am Friday-Sunday shift was forced to take severance pay or switch . "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I was hired as a merchandising Lead but my manager she calls receit to the new freight we get, and backroom or receiving she says dock. For few weeks I got good hours then after weeksthen she started reducing my hours and when I asked then she said I'm supposed to pick my own hours but when I did that then she called me in the office and said I can't work those hours. I was hired full time but she only gives me one day a week. Whenever I asked about getting more hours she said she doesn't have hours available. Two weeks ago she said she's going to give me a call for my next schedule and I've been sitting home for two weeks with no job. I've started looking for a job and I also had some interviews already. I'm still wondering that what type of management I was working that no one even bothered to give me a call and ask about my schedule. I just wasted few months with Macy's.  Now I know why they always have Job openings coz they don't treat well to their employees. If Macy's won't improve their management then very soon they'll run out of business. Hope good luck to my friends out there."
bad,"Most acquaintances working there at the time aren't there anymore for the same reason."
bad,"they have poor management i worked there for 5 years still kept me a minimum wage and i was in the top 10 performers. they never back you up, is all about favoritism. always made promises they could not keep. then only focus on the things you didn't do, you can do many great things but it will always follow with a but you could've of done more"
bad,"Continuous walking for 7 hours,"
bad,"Management and Loss Prevention is sad. The so called leader of the store only give the lazy managers support. The managers never back up the cashiers. The customers can call the cashier all types of racial names and the customer will get macy's money. Loss prevention only check people they don't want to have relations with you. If you pretty and young you can steal, cuss customers out and get away with everything. There is no enjoyable part of the job. Hard workers don't get recognition."
bad,"Weekly pay is honestly the best thing about this place.  They over work you but under pay you. If youre great at your job, PERFECT! Theyll get you to do other people job too. They constantly hire new employees but dont give them hours for weeks to months at a time."
bad,"Their work schedule is very flexible. You the option on advertising your shift and pick up anybody shift if they put it for advertisement ."
bad,I started at Macy's and really enjoyed the people I worked with and my manager. I disliked the other managers and the way the company treated their employees.  I felt as if I was expendable even though I was in charge of the swing shift.
bad,Worked in the pick dept. Didn't care for the pick manager. Supervisors only have a title. They are rude.Witnessed alot of flirting with seasonal help. One girl did nothing but backstab co workers and she talked all day. She got to stay by lying about co workers. They cut a bunch of the seasonal workers in Dec. after working 4 hrs that day. They chase you down with a clip board and tell you to get your stuff and go to the cafeteria. The whole experience was freaky. Don't work here.
bad,"The hiring process takes forever, they make you think they're a great company to work for. When needing to call out for a family emergency no one is ever there to answer the call and there is no way to leave a voicemail. Half the time answering service says ""this extension does not exist"" when in fact, it does, its written on your folder. You just keep calling and calling hoping to get through to someone and they don't even call to see why you're late. Very unprofessional."
bad,"Most management is rude, and the employees. The store manager was very nice. I didn't understand how so many rude people could work in customer service."
bad,It was great summer job to have as a part time job to keep busy had a lot of fun there was work to be complete I train individuals  as will
bad,"Where do I start? When I think about the time I spent working here, I immediately think about that ""Life is passing you by"" Everest College commercial. I won't even get into that, but...."
bad,"Working for Macy's was like being caught in a tornado. You try your best to right yourself in the ever changing winds while getting the spit kicked out of you on the way down. "
bad,The management sucks and the company how they run it.. They don't look out or help there employees . need different management but other than that great cloths.
bad,"i learned to b more organized with my work and how to manage my time wisely. My experience over all was not good, because the managers are extremely rude to the sales associates making it hard to work with them."
bad,Very bad experience.  While working there I went back to school because I could not survive working full time with 30 hours at minimum wage. They don't take macy money at grocery store. I found full time job in the field I was studying for but want to stay there for couple dimes a week. Provide my new anavalibility to work. They were not honored.  I went to hr management team to discuss the issue but nothing was done so I quit.  I felt like I was left no choice but quit...
bad,"The benefits are okay, and the relationships you develope with your co-workers, and customers is great.  The management does not communicate with there associates, and the management does not treat each one of their associates with complete respect, and equality"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,a typical day at work was helping customers.I learned to scan codes and how to color code the clothes when hanging them on the racks.management was Ok.I enjoyed working with co-workers. Hardest part of the job was closing.The most enjoyable part of the job was the dressing rooms and helping customers.
bad,"Management tells you one thing, but does not mean what they say.  They say you can be honest and not fear retaliation, but that isn't true."
bad,best part of job was management   worst part of job was standing all day in heels on hard flooring   lots of discounts    typical day was opening register  taking phone orders  waiting on customers and selling
bad,"Standing for long hours, Hardest thing of this job was to push opening macys credit cards. I did enjoy working with my co-workers they always made the day fun. Management is not understanding of single parents or family-work balance at all. Learn a lot of new ways to apply make-up. Doing events was fun and most enjoyable."
bad,A typical day at work was typical clock in and get to work as cashier. i learned to deal with unhappy customers and how to answer questions about the products. management was okay. The hardest part of job was trying to find ways to enjoy the job.
bad,"awful place to work, do not work there, is very bad. bad management. everything is bad.."
bad,"This is the worst job I've ever had, and prior to my temp position that Im in right now, I would have said its the only job I have ever hated. The pay is low, the hours suck, the benefits suck, the job itself kinda sucks. I was lucky in that I had a wonderful supervisor who took me with him when he left, we ended up at a different retail store, which was 100x better. Typical day is folding clothes, putting merchandise back to where it belongs,ringing up customers, getting yelled at by customers. Anyone and everyone can get a job there so thats kind of nice, if you just need any sort of job to hold you over, then this is the place ."
bad,"The best thing I can say about Macy's is how the schedule works.You put in your availability and the computer schedules the entire company, to view on Fridays. Full-timers can pick up more shifts on Fridays, and part timers on Saturdays. This is available through a website, so it is viewable at home or work. Through the computer, you can pick up shifts, 'advertise' them for other associates to pick up, or request to have another associate swap or cover shifts you don't want. So easy! "
bad,"the job drained you , so friendly coworkers management didn't attend to employees needs … nobody was cooperative miscommunication , holidays was the hardest part of the job.. did not like nothing"
bad,NIce facility . working there was decent. co-workers were very nice to work with.
bad,I enjoyed working with my co-workers. This was a very fast paced job which I loved. I gained customer service skills while working there.
bad,"On any given day you can have 6 people higher than you yelling at you for things that you did not know because there is absolutely no training. "
bad,"The company is a good work environment, but they pay cheap for hourly associates."
bad,I learned to do your job and enjoy your day. But it's time to move on and make more money..
bad,Company overworked current employees while not telling them that the center was closing. Never hired additional help when transferring over new credit bank.
bad,"very nice co workers, everyone makes you feel welcomed, it sucks when you work with sales, my manager was very greedy and took everyones sales..management didn't do anything about it."
bad,Worst Job Ever. I enjoyed the customers and Co-workers. Management slave you but don't appreciate you. They use you to make the store look good but really don't care about you.
bad,"I feel like while I worked here I learned alot, from alot of different makeup counters all the different type of brands. But through all I didnt like working here. Minimum wage for working full time isnt enough."
bad,"Typical day would be very busy a lot of interaction with customers. Making a lot of drinks. I learned to interact with all different types of customers. My co-works where at some point very hard workers, very good people. The hardest part of the job may have been dealing with customers that think they are right when truly they aren't. The best part of the job was the customers."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Meet and greeting staff and customers throughout the day Ilearn when thday get tough address all concerns immediately. I understand managements job is difficult so I must patient. You should support your co=workers within reason.
bad,recovery on the floor is an all day thing removing and replacing clothing that do not belong in that section. Running rods from fitting room is the most difficult because you have to run back and forth in the entire floor.
bad,"Managers   will   lie   straight   to   your face,   but   other   than that  pay is good you just work like a dog during their busy seasons or peck season"
bad,It's all right place to work. The managers were nice it's quiet. But you don't have a lot of work on some days. They're not good at training.  they pay decent
bad,"The store is extremely small and everything is blamed on the Receiving lead. Every “lead” expects the dock to resolve everything. Without any help. They want everything done a certain way but won’t give extra hours, hire more people. If your full time that means 28 hours not 40. The employees are good people, but management is just horrible. Wouldn’t go back if they paid me 100 an hour"
bad,This isn’t a really good company for and adult to work for the pay rate isn’t suitable . The good thing is the people are friendly and they treat you like family
bad,It is extremely stressful. They work you and work you an there's just no appreciation at all. They need to do better training to all the staff and managers.
bad,"Worst job of my life. Stores are completely organized. Management treats you like a working dog and not a person. All they care about is meeting sales goals but not about the employees who are doing all the work and getting the management their bonuses and helping them meet their goals in the company. Communication is horrible throughout management and among sales associates. They fake like they have everything together and like macys is run well, but I bet a monkey could do their jobs better.Days are long and tiring, customers are rude at the mall and in retail in general, and there were millions of clothes and items to clean up everyday because of how unorganized and messy the store was. I was hired as a sales associate, not to clean up after rude people or as a janitor."
bad,Hated itit was not a job for me I worked hard and still they told me I couldn't work but it's fine I can work anywhere that has anything to do with labor or work they just had their reasons I guess
bad,"I worked overtime, holidays, gave my best effort, wasn’t truly rewarded and my paycheck never reached 400 dollars a week. Really hard work that would last a day with no good compensation."
bad,"Its not worth it to work here. You wont get any hours. You need doing more beyond your job role and they don't want to pay you for it. They wont allow you to keep your store raise, they will round it up with the Cook County Minimum Wage $1. For example; you make $12.00 and you get a store raise of 35 cents. But since the wage is going up a dollar. They will round it to 13 not $13.35."
bad,As you can imagine the retail apocalypse is here and Macy's just can't keep up. Management is very poor. Morale is low. Everyone is very entitled to progress without actually working for it.
bad,"Bad pay, bad management, hated this job  ... your hard work goes unnoticed and they always expect more from you no matter how hard you work. Literally the worst job I’ve ever had"
bad,Replenishing shelves as well as helping customers. management was ok. the hardest part was dealing with disrespectful customers. the most enjoyable was going home.
bad,"Don't ever reach out for help while working there. "
bad,Was not a good work environment low pay for too much work didn’t like the management and felt like I was being over worked for low salary wasn’t a good experience
bad,"They hire you an train you like your going to be working right away, but instead i have t wait a month and a half until the next shift is available and by then i wont even remember my training i had to do. Its so hard to talk to a manager about a shift because its all on the HR website. Especially awful for  those who came off unemployment but theyre still out of work for a month. Very dissapointing very misleading"
bad,"I work at Macy's and honestly I've never been spoken down to, berated, and underestimated more than I have here. They treat me like a dunce, and will over-explain and tell me over and over again how to do the simplest tasks. Before you say, ""Oh! They're just making sure you know what you're doing!"" understand that I have four years of retail management under my belt, and have run stores by myself before. I took this entry-level job as a way of making some extra cash on the side. "
bad,Some management always try to make you do their job.  Something that's not in your job description.  Ex: Making all of the leads take a key to open the store so that they ( certain management) don't Have to work on weekends when it's their turn to open the store.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"They try to bring you in as a flex associate and say you basically choose all of your hours and can have up to thirty hours a week. THAT IS A LIE. I just recently tried to pick up four shifts, totaling 21 hours, and when I checked my schedule the next day they had taken me off of the schedule and had instead given me only four hours. Some weeks I’m no even scheduled AT ALL. I once went a whole two weeks without a schedule because they went over the certain amount of hours they can give employees."
bad,I will never want to work at Macy's warehouse again because we tried talking to staff they ignore you they say call HR when is there a problem they got to fix
bad,"The staff is very clique-y, and many of them seemed stuck-up. Management was never satisfied unless we were overworking ourselves. I was told to quit when I confessed I had social anxiety, because my manager was asking why I didn't smile while I worked or talked to customers."
bad,"I didn’t really like Macy that much , they was making me do work that wasn’t in my job description and wouldn’t pay me for it . I worked mostly by my self with no help ."
bad,It was okay to work there. I worked for Macys in several states but they didn't allow me to when I came to this state. Not sure why but okay. That's all I care to say about it
bad,"If you are able to deal with constant moving around a 3 floor departments store and have enough product knowledge to be able to find anything in the store within a short period of time then I say go for it otherwise steer clear they said they treat their employees equally but, they clearly play favorites it doesn't matter how hard you work if you have a relative there or some other relationship with a manager or another co worker you will get special treatment"
bad,"Love working with people.learning new skills. Making new friends. I'm great friends with my former managers  customers, school teachers, I love shopping at my store. I've been shopping there since I was 15 with my aunt . when it was rich's"
bad,"macys was one of the worst experiences i have every worked for. management was horrible. no room for growth or improvement. no benefits ."
bad,"Macys is trash, women's shoe department is not ran good, manager there sucks, fired me because he was being petty, i had to call and ask, didn't even let me know when i was scheduled to work. i was hired on full time only got 30 hours for the whole month of June. its not worth it, can find something way better."
bad,"No comments, I will not seek employment at Macy’s. Macy’s as a Company is good, but their management needs GREAT improvement. I enjoyed my customers, they are the ones that are encouraging & made me want to go back into the Customer Service world. I miss the interaction."
bad,Women’s shoes was the busiest department in the store. It required a lot of hard work. But the pay wasn’t really worth it. I spent 4 years there and never got promoted.
bad,"My location was terrible. Lack of staff showed when customers tried to check out their purchases. They often had to look for a cashier resulting to asking the merchandising/pricing team for help which is not their function. The last minute notice that they need you to work the day they are calling does not allow you to plan for appointments. Or even updating your schedule the night before that you work the next day is terrible. Lack of consideration for its employees, retaliation scheduling by management by providing you NO hours so that you do not even get a check on payday is High School behavior, which unfortunately was the actions of one manager."
bad,"Macy's is a  excellent place to work, but the mangers there  is not professional in there daily activities.They don't care about there workers they talk down to you let you feel  small.They will cover There self instead of you. The head  person of Macy need to talk to there workers more or send in  a undercover Boss to see how they treat there employees."
bad,"I’ve worked in  different Macy’s stores and they were  all very different management style. The last store was my last straw.  Unappreciated, over worked underpaid while we trained people to get paid more than we did. I had paid days off but How dare you ask to use them. How dare you work your butt off and ask for vacation. "
bad,"Lack of direction from management. No acknowledgement from management, very hostile work environment. Unsafe working conditions for employees, especially the support staff."
bad,Hired and aware that my position was seasonal but I would be working min until Feb. Toward the unknown end of my employment I was advised by shift leader to walk around and look busy computers or something was wrong. I had already done 9 hours of walking and counting inventory. I complied so I did as I was told. The next shift I worked was 1 week later. The manager saw me and said u r not on my list go to the office. There was a mtg about to start so I joined the mtg as advised. 30min mtg. Next I was told to go to the office and I was told the season was over u are free to go home. I slept all day unable to work overnight without the sleep only to be told I was being let go. All the other seasonal workers were advised the wed prior. No one called me to tell me a week in advance to not show up. So thank you for consideration. I will never recommend nor work for Macy's ever again. I also did not get paid for the meeting they made me attend.
bad,A typical day at Macy's it's always fun you work with people from everywhere. there is always something to do you would have meetings then exercise. I have learned that working in a warehouse to wear comfortable clothing . The hardest part of the job would have to be standing on concreate for 10 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be meeting new people everyday.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I emjoyed Working here. It’s a good mixed crowd and a good pace for working. Sometimes speeds up sometimes slowed down. The discount is good. People are mice.
bad,"Macy’s does not take action against sexual harassment , and  does not protect its associates from sexual harassment, Associate in Macy’s are not treated with respect . Macy’s pushes associates so hard for opening account that sometimes some associates open account without letting customer know they are playing for Macy’s card. On line customer service is so bad that most of customer do not want to deal with on line customer service. The worst thing at Macy’s is they never take action about sexual harassment .and most of the managers don’t know how deal with the subject.and if someone report the sexual harassment they  retaliate against person who reported the  incident ."
bad,"I do not recommend this place, the culture was terrible and the leadership stinks. Brick and mortar companies are going the way of the dinosaur anyhow."
bad,"After applying, I received an email about an hour later stating, ""You're invited to interview with Macy's/Bloomingdale's!"" and to use the link provided to schedule an interview. After scheduling my interview, I received another email a few moments after stating, ""Appointment Confirmed - Macy's Logistics - Distribution Center Houston"". Two days prior to my scheduled interview, I received another email with, ""Appointment Soon - Macy's Logistics - Distribution Center Houston"" confirming the appt. I thought it was a great process because of how convenient the scheduling was and the constant automatic communication. The day of my interview- I arrived 15 minutes early and had to figure out by asking an employee in the parking lot how I was supposed to enter the building. There aren't any signs of where to park so I had to go around the block a few times to figure it out. HR should have provided that information in the email, honestly. After locating the security office, I should have immediately left out. The man advised that they were not doing any interviews and I asked to speak with HR as I had confirmation. He sighed and closed the window. I thought to myself if this is how a person is greeted than I don't want any involvement. I have a full-time position and this was for a part-time supervisor position on the weekend so I sucked it up and waited as I was looking for extra cash. I wait until 9:45 am which was past my appt time of 9:30 am. 3 more people came in and waited behind me. Finally, an HR rep came and asked if we were there for interviews in which we all clearly answered,"
bad,Macys is a good company to work for they have nice benefits and things. I dont really have anything else to say about the company it was a nice 2nd job.
bad,The place was not a good place to work u had to push credit cards on people to open new accounts and I was not one to ask people so I did not get a rise due to that
bad,"it was very dusty. every other compartment would have spiders and many associates would get bitten. also, if you were to move the boxes from a spot, the dust piled up would get everywhere near you"
bad,"The people who work hard and show up every day are treated poorly and constantly held back from advancing in the company. If the store manager doesnt like you for X reason; you will be denied any promotions that you try for. They treat the bad employee's very well. If you steal hours and spread rumors then you are more likely to move up in this store. I would never recommend anyone work for this store here in the valley. "
bad,Compensation was not worth the work. Found out that the deterring officer was making more than the prevention officer who did most of the work. Good start job but not career worthy If you plan on being in this line of work.
bad,"Honestly one of the most stressful work experiences I've ever had. The management was horrible, a lot of going behind peoples backs and making false statements about them."
bad,"When I started at Macy's, I knew I was not getting paid for what I am worth, but I was receiving commission...so that helped. I really enjoyed my co-workers. We had a lot of great laughs. Management needs to take management courses. I worked in cosmetics and it is very cut-throat. You need to make your daily, weekly and monthly goals. Don't get me wrong, having sales goals increases productivity. However, Macy's managers go overboard. They will counsel you every time you miss a goal. It gets to be ridiculous. We, as sales associates, cannot make people come to the store and buy our products, especially, if we are not competitive like other large retail stores."
bad,Macys  will  snatch you from your  job and  stick you  in another.  This  is  why the  are  not doing well  and  will  probably  be  ran out of  business
bad,I do not recommend this place to anyone one of my friends or enemies because of the way they are with there employees. They work you extremely hard and do not paid well.
bad,"There was no typical day at work, everyday were different. We basically learned everything by ourselves everyday,  Macy's only give you the basic things about sales and cash register. Management wasn't really good, a lot of the managers playing favor, and most of them doesn't have a special training for to be a manager. Work place culture in the men's departments was better than the women's departments, just like the managers, most people who work at Macy's playing favor base on their ethnicity, so there was gap by each group such as the philippine's only help or during lunch time or break get together on their own people same with the Persian group, or the Mexican group, and they also talked with their own language at work, so make you feel didn't belongs there. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers even when they were wrong, and you tried your best to accommodate them, in the end the low salary, no benefit, bad management, unwelcome group of ethnicity, and bad treatment from customers were not worth of a job."
bad,"this place was terrible, pay was bad, expectation was high, there was a point system for when you were late, but took them from you even when you were sick, and if you ran out of points you got fired. NOT OK"
bad,its an ok company to work for. Lots of room for growth within. Benefits could be a little better as their packages are not too great. Some store managers fail to follow guidelines.
bad,learned how to move through different departments I learned how to read customers and help them more on their decisions with shopping helped me understand customers needs more
bad,"After working for Macy's, I would not recommend a friend to work there. The pay scale was very confusing and it was hard to determine if I had been paid properly. The management also needs some work. The company just seemed very disorganized and frantic most of the time I was employed there."
bad,not at all engaging or positive work environment. keep it moving in the other direction. quickly. especially not herald square. why must I type thist ?????
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I worked in the warehouse on 2nd shift. After doing a walk through or 2 there really wasn't much to do. Other than watch cameras. I was promised a role also that I never received.
bad,"Hourly paid associates are extremely underpaid. Very poor management and not understanding at all, they won't even respect school schedules for student employees. Too much work is given for such little pay."
bad,I was considered a floater. Most of the people i worked with did not care and walked off which was extremely rude. It was times where I had to open and close all by myself with only one 15 minute break. They treat people wrong and ugly.
bad,The call center is cut throat. The expectations of low paid employees is astronomical. How long an employee takes on a phone call and average calls taken per hour are more important to management than resolution and proper customer service... and any raise depends on these factors. Terrible environment and upper management.
bad,"typical day: boring "
bad,"Not the job for someone who wants a ""Career"" and real job. This place won't get you nowhere unless you know someone, everyone here who moved up knew someone or was a best friend of someone or relative, not my kind of work environment, boss's pick on you and use their position to boss you around and nit pick on everything you are doing and aren't doing.  Horrible company and horrible place to work for, never again!"
bad,If you are looking for part-time work this might be ok. I was hired full-time; however it took two weeks to get a full-time schedule. By then I was offered a better job with another company.
bad,"The manager  are horrible . They treat u like crappie especially  if you are a seasonal worker. When I was a seasonal work at macys,  the manager would slave you and tell you to stay overtime while they pack up their bags and head gome"
bad,they have a lot of drama within the company especially during the Christmas season. They are not very organized in the way they put you to work. Everyone there wants to be a boss
bad,"Process is long because you have to go through airport security stuff. Process took about 3 weeks to a month. Got interviewed, interview was easy. Then you have to get fingerprinted, get a badge (take an easy computer test about security that you watched a video for), then go to training. Training was a week long, 8am-4pm at the airport"
bad,i like working there. i love the people i work with and the people i work for. it is a nice experience to work at macys. i love everything about that place
bad,"I like Macys because they treat me like family. The work positions are well defined, but they always expect you to do more than is required. You are not doing just one task, but you get to work in different positions."
bad,typical retail store. goal based environment management acts as if you have complete control over shoppers opening credit accounts and making large purchases. unrealistic at times.
bad,"terrible overall. the people that have been working there a long time will find things about you they don't like. very clique-ey"
bad,they work you like a dog and expect no complaint they cut hours so you never reach forty. Customers treat you better than management and that is a lot working in retail.
bad,"They will tell you your full one week then the next you will work 40 hours. You get Friday, Saturday, Sunday off. They have a very high turnover rate."
bad,It's good if you need an entry level job but don't expect to move up or get a raise . A typical day included running around the store cover shifts for other departments. Your job is to do everyone else's jobs because the old managers got fired under false pretenses.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Macy was a fun work place and i was able to shop any time, i always like looking at the home decor. items and women apparel. The work place was very friendly."
bad,"sinking ship! every year in January for the past 9 years 100's to 1000's of executives were terminated. the standing joke is if you still are working on super bowl sunday? then you get to keep your job, with added responsibility, with no compensation increase. the sales and the discounts were awesome! major vacation days and comp days!"
bad,"This was my first job, and after working there i realized its not that great of a place. Very little hours only working one day a week at times and very little pay."
bad,"Does not think about employees. Does not care about employees. Can go weeks without being put on a schedule. Will send you home before shift is over if they are ""over hours"""
bad,Nice cool awesome hey itll be nice itll be cool nice nice well it can be okay at times I really dont want to write a review but oh well looks like I havw to
bad,"Very low pay to work for money-hungry, two-faced, managers that do not give a flying flammingo about you or your advancement. I brought up my concerns to many managers at different times, yet I was still ignored. I don't wish employment by large corporations like Macy's on anyone."
bad,"Informing customers of products."
bad,Felt very disrespected by the way I was spoken too. Constantly made complaints about the issue but nothing was done. My co-workers were very fun and exciting. I learned how to deal with the public and also my first stepping stone in customer service.
bad,Macy's is a bad place to work. I worked there and I got injured and they wanted nothing to do with the accident. They will tell you they have a lot of work and few weeks later they have nothing
bad,retail is never enjoyable coworkers were nice best thing about doing retail at macys is we never stayed past 10:30pm if we were closing
bad,"The Management wasn't good, they never worked around my school schedule. They would only give me three hour shifts from six pm to nine pm, which always never made sense to me. I learned how to deal with customers in a professional manner. I learned to become a cashier. My co workers were good people they helped me out since I never got the proper training or help from management."
bad,"I only worked at Macy's for little over a month in a seasonal position. But after that experience, it is not something I wish to do again. I do not enjoy working in Retail with its hectic pace and often menial labor, often being mistreated by customers and even coworkers. I prefer to find employment in something different."
bad,management is not reliabe and your work days will change without notice people were very stuck up they do not care about the days you can and cannot work even after you talk to them about it in the interview and they hire you
bad,"The position was great at first. Until they decided to cut my hours, and my income. So if you have rent or anything else to pay look else where. "
bad,macys was very fun and i enjoyed the discount i was given by the company i do not agree with the hourly pay and the work they ask to be done
bad,"Assisted customers with various issues in person and through telephone."
bad,"long days, long hours, unrewarding for hard work"
bad,fast pace and always something to do. the managers are on your back watching your every move. but overall you work hard for 9.00 hr
bad,A typical workday included selling shoes and accessories. assisting the customer. Also working as a cashier.The hardest part of the job was putting back all the clothes.
bad,"Your there to help customers but you might often find yourself competing with other sales associates because you have to reach your target goal in sales for the day."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I came in during the holidays and it was very busy. I learned that you have to have patience working with the public. I have really learned, I have a lot of it. The management was helpful when needed. Co-workers was nice. The hardest part was standing on my feet but so enjoy my time there. I love seeing those customers happy buying and shopping and getting those deals lit their face up."
bad,My paycheck was never late.  High turnover rate.  Hard to get hours.   Communication issues on every level.  Confusing stacked sales structures.
bad,This was the worst job ever! If I ever had to go back there and work I wouldn't do it. Most of the managers that work there don't care about the workers. All the managers and other workers cared about was just keeping the floor clean they didn't care about helping the customers the way they should. The fitting rooms were always nasty and even had people using the fitting rooms as the restrooms. This is definitely the WORST JOB EVER!
bad,"its a nice start for a while until you find much bigger and better"
bad,More focus on making sales or getting customers to apply for credit card. The other employees were easy to work with. Management didn't really care bout the employees
bad,"I enjoyed the customer service part of the job, but I did not care for some of their employees who were lazy and incompetent and made my work much harder."
bad,"this is not a good place to work they treat there employees like trash. All they care about is the customer and thats it, management needs to replaced and corporate officials need to work as sales associates and team members behind the scene to see what we all go through"
bad,There is no training.  They put you on the sales floor without any guidelines or guidance.  They push to sell credits even though the store is empty without customers.  They deduct for breaks whether you get to take one or not.  The other employees are walking around miserable because of the management.  Everyone is dissatisfied.  People leave working there as soon as they can.
bad,Do not care about any of their employees. It is almost impossible to get a raise at this company. They only care about money they do not care about employees at all.
bad,could do better wiith people having to call ou mangers seems like they dont care if you have perosnal things to do and could do better with availibity
bad,"Typical day at work would be on the register until I make my sales goal otherwise  on the floor replenishing for the next business day. I honestly learn that retail as in Macy's and Jcpenney is not for me. Management does not work but always tell you to do something your already doing otherwise they are on the sales floor talking. co-workers also talk on the sales floor. the hardest part of the job are the sale days when the store is very busy and crowed, best solution is to stay calm and continue in a timely manner. The best part of the job is honestly clocking out to go home.."
bad,"Typical day at work consisted of meeting quotas and opening rewards cards. Much was not learned, management was not persistent. Hardest part was having to work in a non ventilated area."
bad,"the company has gone under now, to my knowledge. wonderful company"
bad,"I am in the packing department, for the time being. The season is almost over. I have been told numerous times by my managers and supervisors that I have no problem and will definitely get a permanent position. Well guess what, I am on this site looking for a job. They lie to your face just to keep you busy and working your hardest. Empty promises for future employment. It would be a great place if they would keep the hard workers and get rid of the slackers. Do not trust this companies lies!!!"
bad,great job offered lots of incentive flexable with schedule great coworkers and supervisors
bad,"try to do my best and sell a lot so I can complete my 4 goals , deal with people from different cultures and always be equal with everybody ."
bad,"Retail merchandise, is hard work but not good pay, very demanding work place had to unload merchandise from trailer and disrtibute merchandise to departments."
bad,I was on-call for fine watches and fine jewelry. We had so many slow days that all we did was stand around. Since I was on call they felt they could just move me from department to department whenever they felt like it. I had no training within any other department that I was switched to.
bad,while i worked their it was way more women than men about a 1 : 7 ratio
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Not promises any decent hours."
bad,working as an on call only receiving calls for 10 to 20 hours a week the shift you are working is 10 hours so you are only working one day a week and there swill be weeks that you aren't getting called in. management says they care but they don't
bad,I worked the registers and folded clothes. The most enjoyable part of this job was the people I would meet and all the loyal customers who came and spent there money faithfully
bad,"The managers don't know what their doing. I was hired because the company needed extra hands for the holiday season, but there was not work for me to do. I basically had to find remedial tasks just to pass the time, which wasn't that much. I worked maybe 4 - 8 hours a week."
bad,"Not worth the time you spend there."
bad,Terrible experience. No breaks. No benefits for part time. Management nowhere to be found. Horrible working conditions. No recognition for hard workers. An all around bad place to work in my opinion.
bad,Overall a very hostel and pushy work environment. Many co-workers would disrespect and take sales away from each other because of the constant competition to make a sale.
bad,"Managers Are Lazy"
bad,this spring macy's fired almost all of thier full time emplyee's. from the 2 months from retirement to the guy who was handed a job offer  a week earlier. one woman was hired 25 years ago when the building first opened and she was laid off to save the company  the expense of benifits
bad,"Terrible place to work. They treat their employees horribly, the pay is terrible, and the goals are outrageous."
bad,Not the place to work. You work like a slave. Managers are lazy. This is like a thrift store. you can buy (borro) something and return at anytime and they will put it back on a hanger to sell.
bad,"This was an exciting job because people came to me when they wanted to develop a bridal registry! They were mostly always happy and this in turn, made me happy!"
bad,"I enjoyed working with the customers, and being assistant to them with their purchases."
bad,they dont treat employees good no benefits didnt learn anything mangement stinks
bad,I started to work in Macy's as transition. Unrealistic goals and tough management made it hard to move on with company.
bad,"Macy's is a good place to work if you can take management and some of your coworkers talking about you behind your back. You have to have thick skin to work at this Macy's. A typical day here was working the cash register, greeting customers and helping them find clothing. I also put clothes away and kept the area clean. The hardest part of the job was management giving me ""evil eyes"" and making me feel like I wasn't doing my job when I clearly was. The most enjoyable part of my job was the great customers that I helped and told me that I had great customer service skills."
bad,typical day a work in to cash out the customer and help them with whatever they need
bad,Employer only cares about how many credits are opened. Does not care about employee at all.
bad,"It was great experience for me because every body there was very professional... I was asigned a metor that I work with, which improves my performance as I was consistently getting feedback that also reflect my learning. This obviously makes it very enjoyable and fun artmosphere to work..."
bad,"Working at macy's was a real joy for me. I was extremely sad to go. Every day we put out tons of merchandise on the sales floor. The team i got to work with were all amazing. Probably the most fun i have ever had at any job. My managers and other co workers were all the most amazing. Kind, fun, loving, motivated people i have ever had the pleasure working for and with. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Would not work for them again because of the lack of organization and pay is really low
bad,"It wasn't very professional at all. No real structure. The location was horrible for business as well."
bad,"•	Performed other duties as assigned by the manager"
bad,"Clean up and ringing in customers are the basics of this job, and a lot of customer service. Definitely have to be very friendly."
bad,"Pay was terrible, not good team players. Hostile working environment"
bad,the management was ok the hours were bad the co workers weren't bad 
bad,handled cash transactions and returns
bad,Worked there as a sales associate for three months and left to return to college when school started.
bad,I worked with customers and helped them shop for what they needed.
bad,The only thing I really enjoyed about this job was catching the bad guys. Everything else had to be taken with a grain of salt. Co-workers and management had no sense of team loyalty and only looked out for themselves. They never gave anyone a full 40 hour work week and the pay was lacking.
bad,"working in differents departments, meeting and greeting customers, handing money & working cashier,answer calls handing returns nd etc"
bad,As a new employee i was not taught how to do anything while working at Macys.. i had to teach myself how to do what what expected of me. Anyway it was a good learning experience. My coworkers were not very nice and my manager barely came to work. The most enjoyable part about working here was assisting customers. It seemed like they were the only nice people in the store.
bad,No personal challenge/growth opportunities
bad,Customers and Employees were very rude. I just did not like anything about the job. Employees are allowed to argue in front of customers. No one wants to take the time to train new employees.
bad,Other managers have not been so nice to work with considering I'm a flex employee and move around at times. The store is filthy and for what little they pay an hour they want you to clean inbetween pushing sales and opening accounts.
bad,"I worked with exceptionally important individuals learning so many new things in different areas of the store. I received several awards for meeting quotas for the buying offices as well as appreciation awards for being recognizes as an associates for the downtown Macy's store. I worked in the Merchandise Information Systems dept for several years keying in stores that were opening/closing info. I worked in the payroll dept for a couple months as per VP request, while working in Merchandise Service Center dept handling incoming store calls disputes and problems. My final positions with Macy's Downtown was working in several buying offices keypunching orders and checking with vendors on all corrections that need to be made. Their wasn't any hard jobs to do I like staying busy so I asked the buyer of my dept if I could help out other buyers that need my help in getting orders out and communicating with their vendors. I enjoyed having a great appreciation for all of the vendors I came in contact with while working in the buying office."
bad,"Exelente, yo llevo 1año y 2 meses  y el servicio es el mismo por los clientes y el desempeño"
bad,"I had worked at Macy's for 26 years and enjoyed working at fine jewelry. I was also assigned to other departments when help was needed there."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Macy's is not a welcoming environment, rude coworkers and minimal training resulting in angry customers. System errors with registers all the time and not enough hours for all hires. Some weeks I'd get no hours!"
bad,"Management is terrible in candy department, they show favoritism to certain coworkers, they don't work and literally make u help a customer when they saw them first, they lie to their associates and terribly micromanages!!!!"
bad,"A typical day in work consisted of contacting clients in order to fulfill their needs with clothing. Transaction processing and work environment maintenance were also included."
bad,"i was a dishwaser,the food was free,my coworkers was great,the mgr was good.the waswasing getting the job done.fellowship with my coworkers"
bad,I started on the 9th right. So they pay weekly. Well a week went by my first check was one hundred seventy and something. And im think too myself ok a week in a whole right. And then my check was three hundred
bad,"Macy's, like many Department Stores, is suffering due to sales primarily on the internet. Day after day without any customers walking into the store. There was a large sales staff because it was a draw against commission. They needed to drastically cut down on staff."
bad,"Macys gave good hours and good pay, and it was good shifts that worked well with my school and work schedule. it was a decent job, although 12 hour shifts walking around can be bland."
bad,"The only good thing about this position was having employment.  The compensation and benefits were poor, and the management was too demanding, overbearing, and not understanding or patient."
bad,"I am a focused and driven kind of person . I like to be very productive , if my day is not productive and nothing gets accomplished well then it's not a good day for me ."
bad,"Typical days at work are okay , helping customers never gets boring unless there is no one to help"
bad,"great place, great folks and other staff is awesome. freindly customers, good break room and above all else the manager was on the top of any issues that any one may have had"
bad,"Great place all around managers and trainers are polite easy and helpful and you're rewarded quickly when doing a good job, you can become a trainer within weeks!"
bad,"Its an easy job. 8 hours a day. The managers are friendly, but the work is mundane. The pay is horrible. Its a job suited for people who still live with their parents basically."
bad,"Listen, I initially applied for a full time position, and I am a college student. With that being said my schedule allowed me to be able to work a full time positioned. I interviewed over the phone-- my interviewer loved me! And even before the follow up call, the interviewer informed me I would be a great addition to the macys team. Anyways, I got a call back and was told, that they company does not offer  full time position because if an applicant is in college, which sucked but I got it. Instead I was offered a FLEX time position. Had no idea what it meant, because I did not apply to that position; the interviewer sold the position and told me since I am in college it works because you make your own schedule, meaning I CAN take as much or as less hours as I want every week. The concept is great-- make your own hours, take on as less or as much as you like. I took the position and was intrigued by the whole making your own hours thing. Because I know in the end it would benefit my life style as a college student. This is where the unhappiness comes in. You make your own schedule because the hours you get to choose from are from the part/ full time member you do not want a specific schedule that week. Only thing, there are no hours to get. I got hired since JULY. I have work in totally 0 hours (it's also September). The worst thing is the only ""pay"" I got was from orientation. I check for available shifts everyday-- and there's nothing!! Not sure if it's like this because of the store I got hired in (Flushing, NY), or if all flex members experience this nation wide. But it's"
bad,it is a good payig job with amazing co-workers but the managment aren't as amazing as i'd thik a manager would be. i learned alot of how to multy task here. The most enjoyable part was when some of my co-workers and i would go est linch together as well as working together
bad,"I was wrongfully terminated due to not having a schedule which was on their fault. They locked me out of insite so I can not find and select hours and when I called to see why this was happening, they got rude and told me on the phone that ""Oh we assumed that you're busy with school"". The thing that really sent me to the edge was that they fired me through via e-mail instead of in my face."
bad,When I Started to working at Macy's i was going to school at the time some time i be work late and being come home late knowing that i have school and study but my work experienced with Macy's was great
bad,Macys was a great place to work prior to the merger with the retail organization.  Management was fair to all employees and challenged all team members when necessary.
bad,"Prep and shipping, prep I had to put thing on elevators and organize the work station so that the loafers can put the boxes in the area where I put the boxes in the elevator  shipping I had to put boxes in the trucks"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,the hardest part of my job was folding all the jean on the wall
bad,"You must work hard to succeed if you do not work hard you will get fired ,My opinion is that wat about the people that do not have any work experience then you are in big trouble ."
bad,Loved the lights and the cameras. The many talented people that I worked with. Sorry I got recruited by another company. I still have loyal friends that I worked with many years ago. Nothing but good things to say.
bad,I  enjoyed working at Macys and  getting  to mingle with other  customers and associates. Meeting   new  people learning new thing from managers and associate.
bad,"Receiving furniture,finding out what go out or come in.Whats bad or good.Management was great never bother you .Great team work ,don't like returns,like when everything went well"
bad,Working as third shift is the worst I wouldn't do it again. They thought I was not working as fast but how could i when there was not enough packages for me to put in the box. Good thing i don't work there anymore.
bad,Pretty chill job lots of cool and friendly professional people. The perks of working there is the discounts you get and the sales. Overall flexibility was great most of the time got as I asked.
bad,"This is not a great place to work under any circumstance. This particular location is full of drama, chaos and severe unorganization. It is much better to shop at Macy’s rather than work at Macy’s. Seasonals are treated like disposables and quit left and right because of the harsh working conditions. You often get scheduled last minute by incompetent management that could not careless about you. Also, customers are very rude and sometimes ridiculous. The store manager is very phony, unauthentic and only cares about what filters the lining of her pockets. Training is a farce as most associates haven’t a clue as to what they are doing when they hit the floor. You are a cashier, go back return person and scapegoat as a seasonal all for twelve measly dollars. Save your time and sanity."
bad,I liked working for the company. With my coworker and dealing with the customers. I had my day to day challenges. It was an overall good experience. It was hard work but I have to say I did like going to work everyday.
bad,"Managers act like they don’t want to help you when you have an issue, when clearly that’s what their there for. A lot of them have attitudes. They have a very high turnover right."
bad,"Waste of time for any person alive with any type of ambition. Horrible management, no opportunity for advancement. The true definition of nepotism. Employees treated like cattle"
bad,"Not worth your time "
bad,"unorganized, no delegation, if you are a hard worker and end up here, you would be the only one. management expects unrealistic standards, consistently pushing for new credit accounts."
bad,"Never enough staff to help. If you do not make your credit goal, you are looked over for promotions or any kind of growth opportunity. "
bad,The juniors department such a bad experience. I work their for 6 years we would never get breaks on time or none at times. We only have one person for six hours and the fitting rooms so messy to the point racks on top off racks are on the floor.
bad,I wasn't trained beyond a few safety videos. I would be scheduled for 9 hours each week. They REALLY want their employees to bring in credit card applications which can be difficult. I was told I wasn't pressuring the customers enough.
bad,"No friendly co-workers,not trained, no one willing to help you when asking questions, never saw supervisor"
bad,"The customers are beyond entitled, management (George) was poor and showed favoritism. If you were new just know you will constantly get taken advantage of and they’ll work you to death if you allow them to . 0 work balance and the pay wasn’t good! Only pro is you get paid weekly and you receive 1 hour break and a 15 ."
bad,"Minimum wage and work, work, work. Unless you are desperate DONOT work here.  If you are one minute late they count it against you. They don.t care about you as a person and they fire people for no reason, They are a horrible company to work for. They want you to work like a dog and then on your year anniversary they give you a 10 cent raise !!!! The cheapest company I ever known. Terrible work place, NOTHING ELSE TO SAY I CANNOT think of anything positive to say about this company. They do not care about their employees at all. Fire and hire. BIG turnover, That should be a indication of how they are, Cannot keep GOOD employees..."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,We can not socialize/interact with each other on the sales floor unless it is with or about a customer.  Management feels that we are not paying attention to the customers if we do.  At times this causes stress among the merchandisers and sales associates.
bad,Job was ok mainly sales and folding clothes and fulfillment for online sales. New manager the worst we ever had over the years I worked there. I enjoyed meeting the people who came in and out on a weekly basis. The hardest part of the job is making sure you keep account of your points and hours.
bad,"It was a good experience. And friendly atmosphere foremost   Some areas could be more positive. Most employees were friendly "
bad,This is the absolute worst Macy's to work at. I have no idea if other Macy's were the same but the system for getting hours they made you change your password just about every 2 weeks but then the system wouldn't register your new password so you had to get on he phone with a service rep and make another new one. Also I am pretty sure my manager changed about 3 times in the couple months I was there so I never really learned who my manager was.
bad,"Poor working environment."
bad,"Macy's brought in too many people for seasonal positions and promised to keep on a lot of us after the season. Apparently that wasn't the case, they waited until a week before the season was over to inform us, only a handful out of the 30? seasonal people were going to be staying on. AND if you were previously told you were staying on, that was a mistake and to ignore that. Management was distant and unhelpful while this existing employees were competitive and generally made work awful."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend it. It is a very fast paced, yet unstructured environment. The managers are rude and they treat the seasonal employees as if they were items."
bad,it was an ok job but the manager at the time didn’t really see me as a good employee.  I work hard every time I came in. The company second branch isn’t as great as the regular store
bad,Working at Macys was not a pleasant experience at all.  Low pay and extended hours.  Management was not team oriented and the environment that they provided was not a positive place to work in.
bad,"There were so many great people to work with at Macy’s! The position I was in, it was VERY long hours with absolutely NO appreciation for how long and hard you worked. Having to be there before store hours and sometimes not getting to leave until almost closing time. There were other salary employees that would come in after you and leave before you. You were expected get all work done with little to No one to help you do it. The only way to be valued at this company was to be hourly."
bad,A very unpleasant filthy building should have been the first clue as to this company's treatment of employees and customers. Will spend time in Purgatory for working for these people.
bad,the job they over work you they cute down on your breaks if their is alot of work if someone left due to the stress is a unfair environment and you cannot move up in this company unless you are friends with one of the managers
bad,I work for the Macy's at Streets of Southpoint. Our store was always a mess and short staff due to the poor management. You don't get paid holiday pay unless you been working there more than 6 months.
bad,Very bad experience working here id recommend staying away if possible. Low pay Long hours and no Career advancement. any other job would be better than here
bad,"This job is not for an adult who is not retired.  it is retail, that means awful hours and low wages.  Standing and walking all day, understaffed most of the time."
bad,"The Management is a complete nightmare, however the employees are generally nice. Other's are lazy and do nothing besides ring customers purchases. And do no other work.  Managers will instruct other seasonal employees to the work of other people."
bad,The worse place I've ever worked. No cares about anything but getting hours. People take there time doing everything just so they get paid. Mostly people who hate the managers and union employees.
bad,This was a temporary job.  I received a good overview of the company.  My position was fulfillment.  I was also a floater for the company.  I learned the merchandise from the various departments.
bad,would not want to retire working at macys. will not recommend nobody to work there. lack of comunnication is bad. managers are never found when need it
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Days without a sale were slow and theft would happen often. Security did little to make me feel safe. Although some employees and customers are nice, there are many that are not kind at all."
bad,"I was new to the state and needed a job so I entered during the holiday season and was retained. I hoped to move upward into management and was asked to join the ""engagement committee."" We discussed issues of training and competency as well as other topics which seemed to go no further than the committee room. Occasionally they'd institute a suggestion but management took credit for any positives with no recognition of who made the suggestion or initiative.They continuously moved people around trying to find the right 'fit' but generally was always sideways with little or no remunerations or improvement in guidance, expectations or sales. Pushed hard for consumer credit cards."
bad,The management and overall company prove time and time again that they do not care about their employees. Not compensated or recognized for hard work and dedication. I have repeatedly ask for more hours so I can keep up with bills and they gave me less and less.
bad,It was always hot in the work place. Never cared about the employees as much in the back on the doc.Employees on the floor get most credit for there work unlike the people on the doc.
bad,"no job security,had to check work schedule week to week to week.Never new what department you was going to be from day to day.Did not care about there emplpyee"
bad,A lot of work with no room for advancement you work hard with no appreciation. The raises were no more than 25 cents. Its a great job for parttime with no expectations.
bad,you bend over backwards for management and they stab you in the back the cosmetics department is a joke they like to hire and fire and dont care if they mess with your job stability
bad,"I was not paid much in this job, but I learned about ticketing items and restocking.  This is a great job for those who are just learning about sales in a quiet atmosphere."
bad,"Standing on my feet for hours as a cashier. When business is slow I cleaned behind the register, which was usually taking returns back to their department if the department was on my level. Take an hour lunch and finish the rest of my shift closing."
bad,"Macys was ok but they don't train you ,they just out you in the floor to work that it .I don't have nothing else to say ..It was work .I have a job but that it/"
bad,"If you are a single parent, it will be hard to live off this job. You can advance only if there is an open position in your field. You will be able to reach sales goals but commission check is based on how motivated you are"
bad,This is only a good seasonal job or if your looking for a little extra money. You never see the managers. They dont care if you take a break and they dont work with you and your scheduling
bad,"Not the greatest place to work (Oakland Mall Store), teamwork is very limited. Management needs improvement not fair to everyone. But Macy's do offer great employee discounts."
bad,"I will start out with the positives. In the years I worked there I was promoted 3x won awards, and had a story written about me on the company portal. However the location I worked at was horribly ran and the store manager couldn't care less about you or if your team was struggling. We were horribly understaffed at all times and yet management couldn't understand why customers and employees were frustrated. The turnover rate was through the roof and so your work load would triple and you would get in trouble for not completing it. Macy's can be a fantastic place to work if the right people are running the show."
bad,"At first, I was a holiday sales associate it was quite fun though hectic I enjoyed my time during the holidays but when they ended so did the fun. I was pushed by my manager to pursue( much to the customers often annoyance )to get credit and high sales. Even after I fully complied with my manager nothing was ever good enough and more was always required at the same rate every day. So thinking I needed a change of duties I moved to sales support or recovery team, which started out just fine and something I seemed to be very good at. It did not last very long the team was cut from 10 workers down to 5 and we were still responsible for the whole store. Hours were long and I often barely made a dent in the mess and was pressured by management to work harder and faster. Which was and impossibility finally I gave up and left a company that does not care about their employees."
bad,"Handling objections professionally "
bad,"i was cashier on the sales floor helping the costumers"
bad,"Working for this particular Macys was difficult due to serious understaffing and the over supply in the store. Part time associates were not trained we if at all to better assist us full time associates. "
bad,Pay was low and they did not want to change my position in which i wanted to move higher and excel. Job had a lot of favoritism.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"The ""forced"" training is a joke, especially when not everyone is held to the same standards.  Some co-workers are great, some are the manager's ""Pet"" and get away with murder. They can talk and treat you like dirt and nothing is ever done about it. These same co-workers take MUCH LONGER breaks, NEVER do the same amount of work as the other workers and the manager just turns a blind eye to it. So moral is very low. "
bad,"it is a good place to shop but would not recommend people to work there if you have family, school, or another job. i learned a lot about retail and how management varies between position and people. they have favoritism, if you have a lot of family issues and need to leave early a lot or call out it is not a place for you to work. management has changed over the years. i enjoyed and loved my job with my previous manager but when we got a new manager work became boring and had issues. benefit requirements apply to certain people or positions. employee discount only apple to macys card not if you use cash or bank cards."
bad,"One of the worst retail jobs possible. Doesn't matter what location you work at, Macy's is unorganized and treats their employers poorly."
bad,"A typical day at work is stressful you have tons of workload and not to many hours to complete the tasks mostly  due to cuts on staff and hours,,,,,,,"
bad,"The management in cosmetics is very rude and unprofessional. I wouldn't recommend working there also there is too much drama involved and sneakinesss"
bad,When I started working there they did not tell me about the benefits until I was there 2 weeks.. so disappointing they did not offer great medical benefits
bad,"-Spend your days on your feet and busy work"
bad,"came in clocked in sold purses. i didn't grow working here the managers and co-workers were not friendly, nice, helpful, nothing. t"
bad,"A typical day at work would be, coming in, and getting straight to the sales. We worked off of commission, so we had to grab every customer that walked in, in order to see a good pay check. Sometimes we even stayed later with a customer to make sales. I didn't really learn much at Macy's except patience. My manager (the entire management team at Macy's) was the most unprofessional manager I've ever had. The hardest part of the job was encouraging a customer to spend money on expensive shoes so we had to bribe them with coupons and discounts."
bad,Did not treat their employees well. Made you feel like a number. Not willing to work with you. Didn't pay well for the amount of experience you have.
bad,MY job was to prioritize mails. I put everything in order so that the job was easier for everyone. The core workers would help each other .
bad,"I enjoyed interacting with the sales associates than with my office co-workers. The training that was given to me SUCKED. They need to find another Supervisor that has more of a personality, not an introverted person."
bad,I decided to go back to school so I asked them if they can put me in part time hours and they said that they cannot help me with that. I was in the company for 5 years and 4 months.  I loved my job but the management is just unfair when it comes on treating their employees.
bad,It is a place full of belittling and disrespect. No help from management. Little balance between work and home. Unhelpfull coworkers.
bad,Management showed favoritism with certain employees. Pay is okay if you do not have to depend on it for day today living. It was fun to work with customers.
bad,I worked for Macys for over two years and it was two years too long. I started as a tem. during the holidays then moved my way to part-time then eventuall to full-time. But now mostly all full-time positions are no longer avaiable. Its a good job for someone who needs experiance but would recommend working there as a career. The best part of the job are the coworkers.
bad,this job was boring and slow the only customers you had were either poor people always looking for a hook up or rich people buying everything cheap.
bad,The work schedule is flexible only in the times you are given.  The work schedule does not allow for a balanced work and life schedule.  The relationships formed with co-workers were enjoyable and that's why you continued to come to work.  It was a dark place to work and could use some light.
bad,Working at Macy's means you will not have much of a personal life. Benefits are not great for part timers. There is not much room for growth with this company. Hardest part of working for Macy's is that you don't have time to be with the family during the holidays. Management is not all that great. Feeling like the majority of management does not care but there are a few that do.
bad,"You're assigned to a big area by yourself and they expect for you to keep it neat while providing outstanding customer service and never taking no for an answer from a customer, even when most of the time the customer drags you out of your area and you have to attend to them which takes up to 45 minutes. If you're in the area you were assigned and its neat and no customers in it, you basically got coached if you spend more than one minute just standing idly. Always insanely crowded and the compensation doesn't make it worth it, theres no benefits nor ways of advancement."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"long hours (work days off, surrender vacation), never enough staff, never successful enough and plan without the information."
bad,"They make you take all kinds of calls from mattresses to international with little training and terrible software applications."
bad,"Macy's Water Tower Place has a irresponsible management team. They don't take into consideration of the workers needs, their scheduling system is dependent on a computer to give out hours and the hours are not even sufficient for part - time workers. Also their healthcare plan is not affordable for minimum wage workers. To advance further in Macy's is slow or non-existent."
bad,"My review is based on my own personnel experience, this location and job lacks structure and good management skills. Not only does the training lack structure but it does not exists. They have the tools in place but do not support the policies of thereof. Also no action in place for safe workplace. I would not refer anyone to this employer because of the inconsistency and lack of respect for the employee."
bad,"Working for Macy's is Limited no chance to Excel,the Pay is Horrible,You are Overworked and Underpaid and Unappreciated...You Schedule yourself which is Odd for a Big Company/Brand,so getting Hours can be trying,to say the least.....Working at Macy's I felt like an Intern Literally,I learned a lot,about Point Of Sales system and helping a High Volume of Customers daily...Also you are paid Weekly,but once again the Pay is Horrible/and Management Does Not care about it's Employees.....I would Not Recommend Macy's...Sorry Macy's."
bad,not a good place to work   I got hired and went for training and I never started working because I was told they didn't need me anymore after training
bad,A typical day at work consisted of either stock work or cashier work. I learned the products and procedures it took to deliver the best possible customer service . Management was never on the same page and constantly disagreed about where their staff were best suited. The hardest part of the job was working in multiple departments in the same day. The most enjoyable part of the job was being rewarded for the number of credit establishments I was able to acquire.
bad,"worked hard paid is very low"
bad,There were no typical days at this job because customer bases change on a day to day. I learned a lot about to handle a retail environment and this job provided me with even more customer service skills.
bad,Fun when your supervisor is not around you. I hate micromanagement.
bad,"I started out holiday and i loved it, then they kept me on, other employees would tell me how horrible it was and i would just not pay any attention to it, then i started noticing multiple employees quit because of management, hours, pay etc. They promised to promote within and they did not, they hired numerous managers with no experience, I was supposed to be moved to full time and it didnt happen, there was just no room for growth within the company. I am looking for a career and Macys was just not the company you can grow with."
bad,"The macys I worked at did not have much foot traffic and so it was much harder to make commission,but I never got my commission checks."
bad,"My co-workers were awesome, Management however sucked! They were never available when needed, and constantly yelled about scheduling--even changing your schedule without permission. "
bad,"fast paced work environment."
bad,Having to cover to large an area and not being able to assist the customers the way they should be assisted.
bad,did not care for the sales goal. hard to get commission. sharks.
bad,"The customers were enjoyable. It was an okay workplace, co-workers were the best. Scheduling would be really weird."
bad,"not enough hours, didnt like the communication, i didnt like the job period"
bad,they hired me for the holyday only.
bad,"When you think of Macy's, you think of a fun, professional place to work. I don't want to make this place look bad, cause it is an ok place to work and shop, just my experience and few other old coworkers weren't as good."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,They do not treat all employees equally . Employee that are friends get livable hours others do not. when presenting an issue they deni there is an issue. They used me to complete the issuing of vaccation for their leads and to get through a District Review by the big wigs of the company. Declaired by my unempolyment worker I was wrongfully terminated prom my job. Durring the fact finding interview performed by unemployment they we caught making false claims on me. They create unnecessary stress for thier employees by staying under staffed .
bad,When i worked at Macy's i started off as sales associate and within 6 months i became a Calvin Klein specialists. When i worked at Macy's i knew i could become a manager but with school and working another job it was a little challenging so i decided to stick to one job and school.
bad,Worst job ever!!! It's only good if you need spending money as a part time gig. Not expect to make a living off this unless you're management
bad,"I am looking for a happier place to work. I enjoy most of my coworkers, and I work extra-hard to take care of my area of the store. I do the majority of training for new hires and flex associates (who don't typically know what to do in our department)."
bad,overworked and underpaid employees. Work culture isn't constant throughout management nor well defined.
bad,"Bad job, bad management, customers very unfriendly. You must be available for whatever shift they want you for. The pay is just above minimum wage."
bad,"I dont recommend to any peer.hectic,not organized,not polite, not professional"
bad,"Very Hard work, lots of heavy lifting, not very organized"
bad,Managers even HR allow different kinds of abuse from other workers go. Associates are aloud to treat customers like dirt
bad,"This is a company that you would expect more from, their managers are not as involved as they should be. The hours are not guaranteed in the area you were trained in. The idea of daily sales goal isn't great in certain departments. The pay rate seems to be closer to minimum wage and they're pay raise is not reasonable. They do not choose managers very well, they don't follow protocol for a manager position."
bad,"This company will make a profit from its employees."
bad,"Many fellow employees and lower managers were nice, efficient and good to work with, however higher company management did little to address any concerns, inducing facility maintenance."
bad,"When I started to work at Macy's there was a lot of training, they would have you to sit at a computer and watch 6 hours worth of videos for three days straight. "
bad,If you want to work with little rewards go work for MACYS. Management is not truthful and undermines those who try to advance their departments. Promises tenure but does follow thru.
bad,It was a gloomy place to work. People had a dog eat dog mentality and I felt very uncomfortable. Macy’s wasn’t a place I saw myself working at very long.
bad,"I loved working for this company, I had a wonderful experience working with customers and fellow colleagues. Management needs to focus on training to provide success in the prevention of stealing product."
bad,Over job was ok  I enjoyed being  busy and on your feet . Lack of support from mgmnt being told one thing one day then the complete opposite the next day . Very understaffed & lack of supplies to complete jobs . Coworkers were fantastic. Was told there would be permanent job then 2 days later other employees are told that it ‘came from cooperate ‘ that there are no permanent jobs .
bad,"After working there for a year you learn that everyday is busy and everyday you do go backs. I learned to better my customer service and I also learned to be faster and handle two things at a time, but the sucky part about this job is that the managers are rude and have favorites and they also don't care at all."
bad,"Great company to start with but not a company to build a career in unless you are part of the right “click”. They will push you until they get what they want from you but the minute you start giving your ideas, they don’t like it."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I worked in department where I was subjected to blatant racial (anti-white) bias allowed because my racist coworker was an older black woman who'd worked there forever. Management, also black, looked after their own. I was laidoff ONE day before my 6-mo benefits were to kick in. Coincidence? Nope."
bad,"Segregation, and unfair treatment. Working here was like working in a oil factory with no windows throughout. It was a constant madhouse, people calling out, making others run one, two or even 3 floors to get shoes they ""believed"" they sent back through the order pad. It was terrible and the schedule was worse."
bad,"Most of management sucks, if you ask for help they just tell you to handle it.   No room to grow, they hold you back on purpose & say “your too valuable.” Offer no raise, pay only minimum even if you have years of experience. Don’t value good workers, and don’t discipline the bad. Worst part is that they never have coverage, so no breaks/ lunch within first hour & extra work."
bad,"Over the last year the organization has shifted in a negative direction.  There’s no flexibility for working from home, employees were currently offered a bad benefits package (double in cost), and the moral is low"
bad,"The company doesn't stand behind their own core values. Macy's is focused on being a top competitor, and has forgotten the basics of retail. The culture in several stores is toxic, Management only interacts with the team before or during Hughes visits to keep up an appearance. Managers have little to no development and lack of integrity runs rampant within the stores."
bad,"very fast paced job paying minimum wage in retail. no chances of being promoted and very difficult and bitter people working will make your job harder, watch out for racist manager arlene in the yonkers location"
bad,"Terrible Management"
bad,"Unless, you like to work God awful hours do not work here. Th best possible jobs are part time and that is only because of the discounts. The hours they expect you to work are crazy."
bad,Co-workers made it hard to settle in and work properly. There was a lot of moments where it felt like a one man show at critical moments. I was continuously talked down to by one of the managers and regarded in a rather cold way by fellow employees.
bad,"Coworkers are amazing, the only reason I love coming to work. Management solely relies on lower colleges to get everything done. Rare advancement opportunities. VERY unorganized schedule."
bad,"I worked for Macy's over 20 years ago.  I'm sure much has changed from the time that I worked there.  As a department manager, I had no work/life balance and put in over 60 hours a week for very little compensation."
bad,"Managers did not seem to care much about employees and often spent time gossiping and could be rude to other employees. A few of them did care about your career advancement, but many just seemed miserable."
bad,Don't have a life to work there! They do not value your time. I was part time and they never hired a full timer so would get on to me for not taking the hours. I love the makeup and learning but was given no education while there!
bad,"The manager lamia sucked, no communication nor compensation for seasonal employees. Favoritism is an issue as is employees almost killing each other just to commission a sale."
bad,"I've worked in the retail environment for a few years now. Macy's doesn't value its employees. The best thing about Macy's I can say is the coaching aspects, I learned how I didn't want to be coached.  Favoritism is rampant. There is no recognition for employees that go above and beyond their required job. It's not a place where I'd want to invest a lot of time into. I'm in it for the experience and I am out. If you are looking for a good place to put as work experience on your resume go for it, but for longterm stay clear away from here for any support from upper management."
bad,"The managers weren't on the same page with each other.  "
bad,The management is more concerned with opening Macy's credit cards than the actual amount of products sold. Very competitive and not much teamwork. Everyone is out for themselves.
bad,"This company wanted a lot out of me and when I was unable to work, they did not hesitate to terminate me. They were not willing to accommodate me once I was done with therapy and limitations were placed on how much weight I could lift."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Was deeply sadden to see many customers turned away by commission earning employees profiling customers who appeared to be broke or not high end enough. Just weren't treated fair not to get the same service.
bad,"Would not recommend this position to anyone unless you are looking for a side job. No flexiblity with schedule, pay is low of course it’s retail. And you will be working weekends and holidays"
bad,"Results will get you fired or will get promoted. This is the only job that you can get fired for doing your job. Depending on the manager, your hours will vary. Some managers over hire and make the detectives compete for hours by giving the most hours to the most productive detective. Your hours are not guaranteed and the schedules have no work- life balance."
bad,Nothing but drama and poor mangement skills awful hours and not enough pay. The company does not care about you all they think about is money. Middle aged woman start drama and are very rude.
bad,"I hated Macs at herald square, the put an immense amount of pressure on staff to get people to sign up for macy's cards by any means necessary, even if that means you have to lie"
bad,"I do not have many kind words to say for my time at Macy's. I was poorly trained and after my training was thrown to the wolves and expected to fail. They placed me in intimates before even being fit trained. Their security team was lazy and there was a violent incident between two customers in front of me and they did little to nothing. They continually scheduled me during my classes; I even had to miss a presentation for mandatory training. My first manager was combative, angry, and dismissive of me. My second manager was sweet but incapable as being a manager. What upset me the most was that they promoted me to Wacoal Specialist then behind my back, gave it to another employee and did not tell me. When I complained about my grievances they gave me a two week notice with a bunch of made up marks against me. They cared more about credit card applications opened more than anything else as well as expecting me to be in five places at once or being able to do it all. Recovery was a joke. Returns were often thrown in an empty box and the entire store was ran in a very disorganized manner. I felt like no one there cared about me as an employee. There were a couple of good managers but only a couple."
bad,There are no hours at the Macy's Edgewood distribution plant. They are hiring more people and cutting hours for the part time employees Whatever department you choose don't go to packing..
bad,"I worked at the Pompano Beach Store. The Store Manager and her side kick assistant were juvenile.I was post retirement from a good career in a place with an empowered workforce. Macy's treated people like children. Suspicious, u trusting and simply not a creative bone or dynamic muscle in their bodies."
bad,"This place was cool at first but after 2 months of working there, the management was replaced and switched around constantly. It was very competitive with other stores in the mall and very stressful."
bad,"The company overall was okay, but managers played favorites. It was an okay job for a college student, but not something I would recommend to friends."
bad,"Maybe it was the location but all of my managers came to work with a nasty attitude. They treated me (and other part-time employees) unfair and like we did not matter to the company. I get it was seasonal and things was stressful, but that doesn't mean me and fellow coworkers should be belittled everyday coming into work. Would NEVER work here again!"
bad,"Never helps you figure out on how to lead, instead just try to work away from your issues within the store. Compensation can't ever be discussed or reviewed for change"
bad,You are left alone on your first day at work with no management in sight. They expect you to stay late and ask 5 minutes before you are to clock out as they are always understaffed. They dont deal with people who are constantly call out or are late and the training is just a video you watch and they expect you to know everything first day. The pay was below minimum wage and they expected you to meet quota but at the same time pull you away from the register to clean up the store.
bad,You do not have a life outside the company. You do not have set hours they are all over the place. Never enough workers at any given time. Never enough hours so you have to have a second job just to make ends meet. Managers always agree with the customer even if they are rude and obnoxious to the employees. Not a good place to work
bad,"not enough associates at macs to complete work   the management doesn't seem to care how much work they pile on you.  You will not get any other assistance from any other department.  The work will just go undone, but then you are held accountable for it.  It is not possible to complete the work without enough associates to do so."
bad,A typical day at work is extremely busy
bad,"The job its self was fairly easy, until they stack on ten more things that needed to be done, and no compensation for your added work. Very stressful making ends meet with there low wages. Also they would rather have an associate whom comes to work everyday (even when they are sick) and does nothing, than a hard working associate whom doesn't come to work when they are sick."
bad,"It's a fun place to work, but my only problem is there is no flexibility with the schedule. I've learned to familiarize to different culture, race, religions."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I worked in Macy's for one year and 6months, and they laid me off, because they prioritized the employees with more seniority, I have worked during the holidays, upto 60hours a week, thinking that I am needed because some of the employees prefer to take a day off, I always chose to stay late until closing thinking that i didnt want to leave my area with newbies/holiday hire, it not just because of getting more hours of overtime, it was my option to stay and take care of my area, but what did I get? nothing, Macys do not appreciate the hardworking employees, they opted to keep the employees with more seniority, while base in my experience, those with more seniority tends to take more off or vacation time, they usually work atleast 20hrs a week."
bad,"A typical day at Macy's would be walking into your shift not knowing whats really going or whats going to happen other than entitled customers yelling at you with absolutely no manager intervention or help.  It seemed like most managers were scared to do their job at all and would hide in the back as much as possible.  They knowingly employ very creepy predators and then the company tries to defend those employees even after allegations continue to come out against them.  The managers definitely have favorites, being let in on the background operations, that they treat very differently and let them get away with all kinds of wrong-doings around the store."
bad,"Unfortunately Macy's dissolved their HR department, creating a lack of support for the employees.  Management does not receive the training needed to lead people or organize their processes."
bad,"It used to be amazing working at Macy's, but since management has changed in my department I no longer enjoy my job. Along with my coworkers being rude and disrespectful, a few even being given the option for promotion over someone who is respectful, does their job, and is honest."
bad,You are extremely expendable. They don't value employees at all. Very impersonal. Extremely low pay. Very physical labor. Low hours with demanding production rate
bad,Not a good place to work too much work too little pay .manager  are very rude.low pay lazy coworker.you got to do it all check fitting room .process  return .
bad,"managers attitudes are very disgusting been working here for over 3 years i had to quit ,7 others quit as well as me during the same time"
bad,"Managers care more about the number and sales instead of the employees. Attendance point system is horrible,even for co workers who have medical issues. It isn't fair for them to lose points and not get them back over a condition that they can't control. Pay is horrible. People who have been there for years including myself make basically nothing. The ""raise"" is a joke if you even get one. Employees are treated horribly. Managers only care about sales and not employees or their well being. Hours are too inconsistent even with full time. Its ridiculous."
bad,"The management was ridiculously unprofessional. I was let go of my job, which I understand was seasonal, but they didn't even provide a day that would be the end day. Just, getting ready, rushing to work, only to be told I'm not working their anymore."
bad,"They're just struggling to keep their heads above water, the company is failing and doesn't try to hide it.  Management has no idea how to communicate to associates.  Blatant disrespectful attitudes from executives."
bad,they treat their employees s if they have no life outside of the company. The communication between all areas is minimal and often leads to employee dismay. Many employees concerns were never addressed.
bad,The management does not do anything treats you like a slave. Very hard to move up. If you want the hours they wont give them to you. but a job is a job
bad,The typical work day is driven by the GVP's over reaction to the the business's needs that caused a chain reaction of unnecessary  stress and confusion.  The management is disconnected from the employees and provides no support or strategy to improve processes or remove road blocks.  The lack of professionalism and leadership is obvious as it is a continuous revolving door of new team members.  Management does not communicate effectively which leads to unclear expectations and unrealistic workloads.  The micromanaged approach leaves the team feeling hopeless and not trusted and the opportunity for advancement is not existent. Not to mention there is no flexibility in your day and it is frowned upon when you request to work from home even though the company policy says it is permitted. The most enjoyable part of the job is the 20% employee discount.
bad,I would work at Macy’s again the only thing I wasn’t really a fan of was haveing to work based on sales sometimes the managers would make the comtion from the thing we were selling
bad,"A total epic fail is how I rate my time at Macy's. Being told that they can guarantee ONLY 16 hours a week was very laughable. One could get extra hours IF they searched online for someone willing to trade hours, so you could pick up their hours."
bad,Depending on what department you work in you don't report to your manager. I learned that some managers are not supportive of employees only themselves.  Was sick and sometimes didn't get a break to go to the bathroom!
bad,I worked the holiday season only! All of management was terrible to work for! It was run like a sweat shop without regard for any of the working staff!
bad,"They picked a bad time to have janitors come in. We were there in the day time, but never allowed to clean with customers around. They didn't let us clean at night because no one wanted to give us the security code. Then they always complained that it was filthy. But we only had two safe hours per day to clean. Pointless"
bad,It was not the job i wanted but situation demanded. I was there only for 3 months and that too in Christmas time. I worked on temporary position anyway. No benefits.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"A typical day at work was ok. Although, I think a lot was required for an insignificant amount of pay with little to no benefits at all. A typical work day required getting the things I needed from the package area in order to walk to the floor to find all of the online orders. I would add the items to my cart, take them back to the package area, log them in the ""gun"", then proceed to package them in boxes and have them ready to go out for shipment. The difficult part of the job was having to search the store in the dark (until a certain time when someone would turn the lights on) and reading from a printed out list, trying to find all the online ordered items. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my co-workers. They made my work days better."
bad,"Politics and management made it very hard to do your job fairly."
bad,"Worked in polo it was dog eat dog envieroment , peers would take your customer and wouldn't think twice about it. It was crazy"
bad,"Little to no acknowledgement for high performers, won’t hold low performers accountable."
bad,I enjoyed Macy's and serving the customers. There were not enough hours after Christmas. I would not want to work there again.
bad,"The best part of the job is meeting new and interesting people. Also, the discounts are good. I trained a lot of employees once they were on the sales floor, plus was expected to do my own job, but yet was paid the same as those I was training."
bad,"Manager's were rude and disrespectful. Co-workers had their little cliques and talked about everyone else. Didn't care which days you didn't want to work, scheduled you anyway. Had a stupid point system for absences like you are in kindergarten."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of picking up all clothes off the floor whenever customers throw items on the floor. In addition, you have to monitor and meet your daily sales goal. Management only cares about their employees when the associate opens a Macy's Star Rewards account for the customer. Other than that the co-workers as well as management will not be friendly or acknowledge you. What I have learned during my time spent working for Macy's is that I can not please everyone because it is impossible."
bad,it was my first job and i had no prior experience i did 2 days of training on a fake cash register and was told i would have to shadow someone for the other 2 days. i wasnt given a schedule i had to make one and when i came to work the lady was leaving she quickly went through the process of what to do in like 5 minutes and i had to ask a woman from the matress sales department to help me multiple times
bad,"This position is extremely demanding. You must be a very experienced Administrative Assistant to meet the expectations of this position. They down play your responsibilities in the interview. A day in this position is; cash office duties, for one. You must come in at 6am or 7am. In order to clock in on-time, you must come in 15 min early before your shift to turn on a register. It takes a register approx. 5-15 to boot up for you to be able to clock in. Time you are not getting paid for. Disarm the cash office. Sign log sheet to take the cash office key out. Punch in code to employees rack area and put your purse or personal belongings away. Open register that change drawer is located in. Go to executive office to make sure enough paper is in the copier. Pick up mail. Pick up all media from all registers and deposit register log. Open drop safe and pick up all deposit wallets and change drawer money left over from day before(key is in the bag). Take everything into the vault. Sign in time you came into the vault. Log into the computer and turn on cash counter. Preset cash counter to proper settings. Print cash drop report. Print five different daily report for both multiple buildings. Put all deposit wallets in numerical order to be checked off on register log and cash drop report. You have to make sure all deposits are accounted for. You also have to count how many registers were not opened and the ones that were used but have no deposit. Count the total of deposits and tie them in groups of 10. All these final counts must be printed on the cash drop report. Write down the reg."
bad,"Macy's is an excellent place to supplement income, career minded individuals might not find the hours to be desirable."
bad,The shopper is always right no matter what.They work you extra hard during the holiday season .  Then they cut your hours down eal low and hire more people .Then after that you have to do over night shift for inventory .
bad,There have been people that have been working there for years and they see a new person and boss them around or try to get them in trouble. Just be careful who you work with on your first week. You can never trust anyone.
bad,"If you're interested in not having a work-life balance this is the job for you.  Schedules are changed constantly, you find out your schedule for the following week 2 days ahead of time which gives you no notice to plan anything, and you're expected to stay late basically every shift."
bad,"I learned a lot about cell phones,and technology.The hardest part of the job was meeting expectations.The most enjoyable part of the job was learning so much about different devices"
bad,"This was a seasonal job as a sales associate, I enjoyed working with my co-workers and helping the public. Didn't feel like management cared too much about their employees. I enjoyed working there and shopping there but did not feel valued."
bad,"I've worked at Macy's for 2 years. At first, it was wonderful. What I didn't realize was that the managers that were hiring me were just telling me what I wanted to hear. They put a sugar coating on everything and then give you a nightmare of a time once you're employed. Terrible."
bad,"Alright right out of high school but struggled to actually enjoy working with customers that knew they could do whatever they want because management would let them. "
bad,"Macy's was an ok place to work. I enjoyed the discount program. The training is not very well, it is on the computer and you are by yourself, no instructor, so you cannot ask questions."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"one of the worst jobs I've had. There's tons of favoritism. No promoting within , Pay is horrible , management does NOT HAVE YOUR BACK. Has an internal quota to meet so they harass associates"
bad,They literally give you 10-15 hours a week how are you supp to live off of that that doesn't even pay my car payment and they change shifts and hours everyday and I have two sons and have to find babysitters and the staff is new every couple of months and I had to leave no hours and not good pay!!
bad,"Macy's is not very employee friendly. They are much more concerned with how much work they can get out of you versus making an even trade off as in, you bring your skill set to them to enhance the business and in return, you receive additional skills & enhancement on current ones. Unfortunately, that is not the case."
bad,"Great work place at first, it's now cutting more and more hours and giving more tasks without raising pay. The day starts with collecting items to ship, and then opening register, doors and taking care of everything while trying to give great customers service while there is no coverage on the floor. Pay is terrible for the amount of work put, rewarding is non existent. Managers have so many projects themselves they have no time to help associates. The hardest part of this job is trying to get everything management wants from you, while still selling with a great attitude. The best part of this job is getting to know some pretty good people and working with them."
bad,"Would not work at a macys company every again. Did not learned nothing, had to figure out tasks alone. Management never around when needed. Training session does not teach first time workers anything that will help us on the floor."
bad,"I enjoyed the people, I worked with. Not flexible/management is all about money and not people/I have seen management be really means to customers (older/younger)/they demand much of your time even part timers"
bad,"I think it is a good place to work, but the benefits are not the greatest. A person is able to work their pace, and not being told to rush, for safety reasons. If you get hurt on the job, you are taken care of fast. I didn't mind being there, but I felt out of place. "
bad,"Get in and once store opens go to my shared office with boss and unlock it seeing that I was scheduled to be there first. Sort what clothes go to what customers and what needs to be ordered from where and in what size. Also check e-mails,voice mails, also appointments for clients coming in. I learned even more office skills, how to read people and take what they say they want and make them look wonderful and love the outfits I choose for them. I learned to please all different types of people with different taste. I had no co-workers it was just my boss and I. I did however intereact with people in different departments in Macy's seeing I had to be in different departments finding items for my clients. Most enjoyable part was being able to style people and being able to have my own office, desk and a personalized dressing room."
bad,Not my dream job. An office administrative position is the dream job that i'm looking for
bad,"benifits are very poor., salaries are not very good either but most of the people are excdellent to work with ."
bad,"customer service"
bad,Very demanding environment with poor communication skills
bad,"my experience with macy's is management need more improvement for interacting with workers,treating workers fairly...coworkers are very nice to work with..hardest part of job is heavy volume during holiday's"
bad,disrespectful they were not organized and the department manager is very rude and disrespectful
bad,It was a not so busy Location & I didn't like the management There where very Structured.
bad,I felt alone at this job with limited opportunities for job advancement.
bad,The management only moves the people THEY want to a better position. no matter how many credits or time you give to the store.. They do not appreciate their employees. The store is like a warehouse nothing is organized..
bad,macy's at willow grove do not have management skills it needs to start off with managers first
bad,"Very political.  Always need to watch your back. All you need is one person with power against you, and they will force you out."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"As a sales associate at Macy's I would operate the cash register, clean and organize the sales floor, and engage with customers to help them find items to purchase. I learned a lot about customer service and my style of selling. I find that honesty in sales is the best policy. The better you meet your customer's needs, the happier they will be, and the more likely they are to purchase more and come back to buy from you again. I also learned that having positive relationships with your co-workers can make all the difference when it comes to teamwork on the job. Management was generally unpleasant. They did not treat sales employees with respect and took every opportunity to decrease their costs, to the detriment of the sales employees. The hardest part of the job was the physically demanding nature of the job and staying positive, despite unpleasant managers. The most enjoyable part of this job was developing working friendships with my coworkers and really satisfying customers. There is no better feeling than having a customer thank you, genuinely, for giving them what they wanted and for brightening their day with your service."
bad,"pay is nothing, managers are nowhere to be found, expect high sales goals, never complimented of good service but always told what your lacking.  nothing is worth working ever again.  commision is a joke unless you've been there at least 5 years.  no-one i worked with ever received commision even when sales were extremely high.  High returns and all returns were approved even if damaged, worn and from years ago."
bad,At Macy's there is a family environment. We are encouraged to be helpful to customers and co-workers.
bad,I learned Customer service and how to handle cash registers. Hardest part of the job is that there is no sitting down for long periods of time.
bad,"It is a fun work environment, however there isn't room for advancement."
bad,trust me.....if you cant find anything else....macys should be considered a last result. Just sayin that dont pay enough for the demeaning things you gotta deal with from managers so THEY can get a bonus.
bad,"Very busy , you learn how to be patient with customers and how to deal with different characters. The hardest is dealing with a by-weekly schedule . I enjoy the clients. "
bad,Schedule changed constantly made it difficult to plan anything suc as Dr.appointment  
bad,the /employee perks are just about the only good thing about working at Macys.
bad,"my days at macy's consisted of sell, sell, sell"
bad,The staff is fun and makes the time go by fast . Hard to move up in the organization. Have to open charge cards or you do not meet their standards ...Low pay
bad,"Great training program. All else isn't very positive. Very political, management tends to play favorites. Growth opportunity is very limited."
bad,"A typical day at work can be hectic especially around holiday time, when shoplifting is at its highest. I have learned to not judge a book by its cover. Assume every customer has good intentions unless otherwise."
bad,I greatly enjoyed helping customers pick out a total wardrobe that would work for them for all the seasons. The hardest part of the job was being deducted for points as a group or individually. We were penalized and points were taken away due to accidents or road closures on freeways and highways if we were more than eight minutes late.
bad,"my co-workers are great. everybody gets along with one another for the most part. now for the mangers most of they not all they do not know how to speak to the employees. they talk down to you as if they are on a high pedestal. it makes you feel horrible, and it also is upsetting. i look forward to going to work because of my co-workers that it. we do so much, but for little pay. the mangers don't appreciate what we do. we are the ones who are greeting, the customer not them."
bad,"Folded merchandise and building displays, ran and balanced cash drawer, and assisted"
bad,"The management does not care about the employees at all. Each new employee is supposed to meet with their manager within the first month of starting work to have the scoring system explained. I worked there for 3 months and never had it. I was told 3 different people were my manager. I gave 6 weeks notice that I needed a day off, told 4 different people, 3 managers, 1 customer service rep, and they still managed to schedule me on that day. They scheduled during my class time at least once a week every week, even though I made everyone aware during my interview and on my application that I could not work those hours. I was promised 15-20 hours each week and I was usually assigned 5 if any and had to pick up the rest. The management was horribly organized."
bad,"None of the upper management actually care about the employee, or even the customer for that matter."
bad,I am responsible for all visual displays in the rtw and juniors departments. Macy's has very poor health benefits and no vision insurance. Management staff has continuos turnover and not much care or concern for the maintaining and neatness of the store.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Not a fair and consistent place to work. It is definitely not what you know it is about who you know.
bad,"Shop there but don't work there ! They treat their employees like garbage. Overworked and wayyy under paid. On your feet, cleaning like a slave for minimum wage. If you are in a dept that has commission, forget about it. It takes an act of congress to get that commission. They act like they are doing you a big favor. Hours stink, pay stinks and work stinks. Coworkers are brutal in commissioned depts. They will kill you for a sale. Rude and ignorant."
bad,"As a older Sales Assoc. I never felt appreciated, a ON-CALL sales associate has no right either you work or don't work."
bad,"Although management was hard to understand life's tragedies , I enjoyed the people I worked with."
bad,"They start you with minimum wage. No promotions. No job security. Lazy management. They do not even provide free coffee or anything free to their minimum wage employees. If once in a while they provide food for you they ask for ""donations"". A lot of favoritism from management. If they like you they will offer you something if not, do not bother showing them your skills"
bad,This job is primarily supervised by Hispanics...so delegates are of same race speaking Spanish that no one hardly understands. If you are of a particular race you will have no problem advancing in certain departments at this job!
bad,This was my first retail job. The management at my location wasn’t very good. One manager in particular was awful she watched like a hawk for no reason. She gave unwanted advice about how I was just doing my job wrong. They also apparently have a strict business casual/business dress code. Even though in the employee handbook or whatever it literally says shoes like vans and converse are okay. Along with jeans being okay depending on department. They don’t have an effective way of training new employees either.
bad,"I worked only part time during the holiday season and having never worked in retail before, I had quite a bit of learning to do."
bad,"The company/management only care for the customers. There is some flexibility in shift hours, constant rude customers, but barely any help for staff when it comes to recovery, breaks etc."
bad,Worst management in the world. Glad that I got out when I did employees very nice and friendly. Pay didn’t match work. Management was not helpful at all
bad,"Pay is very low, pure management, but job is not hard. Only 1 plus it's  store discount that doubles couple times a year. Would not recommend to work there."
bad,"Loved my co-workers(became family-like). Poor management, poor recognition, poor leadership, ineffective grooming for growth in company unless personally picked by management team. Poor communication between sales and management team.  Favoritism towards particular sales reps."
bad,"while in training your wage is $7.25 an hour, This lasts until you pass all of your training on line. Then its anywhere from $9-10 an hour. The air conditioner has been broken for 2 years and it is very hot in the store depending what department you are in. I felt sorry for older employees it just wasn't fair to any of them."
bad,Managers would be too busy gossiping with each other to correctly address customer concerns. Favoritism played a vital role in who advanced within the company or received a 15 cent raise for the quarter. Always understaffed and chaotic with no proper structure.
bad,There are a lot of benefits to this company but only if you are a certain pay grade and level. They treat you like you are less than human and then blame you for their bad communication. Don't work here.
bad,"Poor management"
bad,"Macy's expectations are unrealistic to begin with. There are quite a few employees that make millions for them and are still terminated for a kiosk. Many older employees that have served Macy's for years seemed to be no longer useful."
bad,"The security is relatively good I suppose, but the environment is unpleasant, the pay is abysmal, and the management is careless at best.  I would look for work elsewhere."
bad,Experienced many issues with communication with managers and work-life balance. I was hired as a part time employee but was expected to work full time without benefits.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I was able to achieve all the requirements that a counter manager could accomplish.staying focus And being alert is important. Always made sure the area was presentable

bad,"Loved the customers.  The overall company didn't care about their employees as much as the next sale. I did like being busy, but not the stress of always feeling like we were understaffed."
bad,"When i started i LOVED work there, but as time and struggling to get a better and more secure position it as TERRIBLE!!!"
bad,i learned to interact with customers each and every time I worked my shift. I learned to build hoe to figure out the customers needs and wants of a certain jewelry.
bad,"Enjoyed my position. Found middle management inconsistent.  Sales associates were often unhappy and Company continued to cut support position jobs, referred to sales associates as ""warm bodies.""  Lack of communication and company directives."
bad,"It’s like a revolving door. You are just a number. As long as your getting credit apps they leave you alone. If you don’t produce your out of there. It’s easier for them to just fire you than to work on the area of opportunity. Managers hang on forever,that’s why it doesn’t get better."
bad,"you are the worst, my wife has worked for you for over 18 years, the people running your store in Walla Walla Washington are idiots! she has worked Mon-Fri the whole time, we have family and we have a life. but now the folks that run the place decided to make them work on weekends. we are a family and have family activities during the weekend that we have established a quality of life over the years."
bad,"They took are commission away cut our paychecks in half very upsetting. "
bad,"Very vindictive management , especially to older employees who were on the verge of retirement. The GM would either give them very long weekly hours or very few hours and then find an excuse to fire them so they could not collect their pensions. "
bad,This job sucked. Management exhibited poor communication amongst each other and that poor communication spilled onto the ppl working the floor. One manager would tell you to do XYZ and then another would come and get all mad asking why you were doing XYZ instead of ABC so now you’re in an awkward situation and being yelled at for something that isn’t your fault. Mangers and supervisors definitely participated in favoritism. Whomever they liked or clique with is who would greatly benefit when it came to hours and shifts. It’s mostly older women mid 40s and up and they aren’t very friendly nor helpful. It’s a very every man for themselves kind of vibe. The pay is laughable so if you are looking for a job to pay real bills then this isn’t for you.
bad,Your apm supposed be someone you go two for career advancement and get feedback on your performance my apm was horrible did not let me finish training could not sign me off make apprehension after passing all my computer testing they completely wasted my time and my talents
bad,"Typical day at work is hard yet make the best of it by concentrating on leading a team and getting our work done for the day. The hardest part is consistancy, not having enough staff to help keep store clean. Down falls on the team because of lack of staff, enjoyable part is meeting new people."
bad,"It always could be worse but I feel like I am on a sinking ship.  Every day there are fewer and fewer customers and management is scrambling to try and get more foot traffic in the door. Sadly, these dated cold call/courtesy texts no longer work in today’s market.  As expected there is immense pressure to get people to sign up for the store credit card. Bleak."
bad,"Macy’s does have great merchandise,it tries hard to train.Menagers don’t follow up with employee.I was stuck with a lots of changing  room and my menager  would never offer help. Store had too many big egos and these peoples leaders and supervisors,than leads. Employees that were there a long time would make only .50 c more than those that came 2 yrs ago.Store would favor slackers .Menagers would pass job to employees  and never help, than go sit in they “office”.Timekeeping violation up and down.People would clock back in and than sit back on they breaks .Security lets customers steal ."
bad,"No matter who you are as a individual, Macy's management won't care if you become a Doctor. They will still ask you to come it earlier that your scheduled shift or stay later that your shift. I committed to the gig & they let me go for way less than most of the things I saw. I was committed to the goals in which i met or exceeded weekly."
bad,Found it stifling because of a high revolving door and age discrimination. Very clique environment !  Customers were few... it was a hours working without staff assistance.  Older staff would know more about staff changes than management.
bad,Work was fun for the most part. It required hard work and perseverance. I learned that management won't promote hard working employees and instead hire from outside. The management team won't train employees effectively and use time to chat with friends instead. It's not as supportive work of a environment as one might expect.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Unless you enjoy having the longevity of your job hinging on something as arbitrary as how many store credit cards you open, don't waste too much time here. "
bad,"Welcome back to high school. You’re either in with the cool kids club, or you’re nothing. Cheap, entitled customers are never happy and complain about everything from coupon restrictions to the why the sky is blue instead of pink or purple."
bad,It is a good experience if you want to be a manager because nobody gets trained. You will always have a good paycheck because they are very understaffed. Management is lazy.
bad,"Not the grestest. Its not terrible, but not recommedned if you want career growth. If you are lookign for growth, look elsewhere, they promise but never fulfil thos epromises, unless you are in with the right leaders.Performance means nothing, it is all personality."
bad,Very flexible work hours for students. Was able to pick up hours just about every week/weekend. Fast-paced work environment during the holidays and sales goal driven.
bad,"Having worked in cosmetics at Macy's, I can assure you that if you think you are making good money - you can make much more as a car salesperson or any other product that requires cold calling. The Client system is not a problem, it is the Outdated Presale system that causes a significant amount of stress and problem. It seemed to be Presale time every two months. You end up tapping out employees (if you can manage to get them to buy) and customers. As a new salesperson, not having had a chance to build a clientele base, a 15K Presale goal for your first three months there is UNREALISTIC. Appointments of upwards to 15 on a Friday and Saturday? UNREALISTIC. The Management at our Mall Store were unavailable, ineffective and petty. The only enjoyable parts about this job were the commision and quitting."
bad,a typical day at macys is always busy the hardest part about the job is the customers because some are rude some are racists some are loud and the very hard thing about it is you have to deal with it no matter what but what I enjoyed most about it was it was quiet the store never had any traffic I did my job very well one thing I learned at macys was even if you feel like giving up try your best even if it takes all you got
bad,"A typical day for Macy's was to go into your office and see everything out of place because some went in there and messed everything up. You tell someone, only for them to not really care. Then you have to clean up some else's mess before you start working. Then you do your job only to have a hard time because merchandise has been placed anywhere so long as the ""color story"" looked nice. Meaning you had 2 or 3 price points on a single rack and you have to rearrange it so that you can sign it properly. "
bad,"Every time someone of color walked in, and I mean of any background, loss prevention was on them. Like they were automatic thieves and were gonna take merchandise. The workers are extremely unprofessional with it and talk about it amongst others, sometimes even customers!! We have had complaints in the past about racism that was told to all of us in a morning rally! Nothing was done, they said they refused to name anyone and said we need to just call loss provention first."
bad,"Even if you are top in sales etc..It's never enough. The recognition is a candy bar if you make your goal for the week  Very competitive atmosphere, pitting people against each other"
bad,"My time at Macy's went pretty well at first. But then, as the season went on, it went downhill from there. My manager would always go over the budget, giving the store leads 50+ hours a week while leaving other works high and dry. Projects were never completed due to system slowness and outdated equipment or equipment in general getti g stolen by overnight workers, and the manager was also very wishy-washy, expected all tasks to be done in an hour or less, and would often blow up your phone if you decide to take a break."
bad,Management made it a terrible place to work. Managers chose favorites and pushed everybody else to the side. Training was a day long and all we did was tour the warehouse 3-4 times briefly learned how to use the gun.
bad,After very questionable illegal activity was happening in my department which was women shoes at Macy's Washington Square there were times salesman weren't getting there commission on weekends due to improper checking. As well as expeditors not getting their proper hours or getting proper notice for scheduling.
bad,"Lots of small talk and misdirection, seemed like each day was a new challenge which is good but also with misdirection and not much guidance.  The manager was very kind."
bad,You have to kiss but suck up and stay bent over to get hours they can block you from picking up hours they yell at you for doing certain things but not their friends who do the same thing.  Yes be in a click the point system is a joke don't believe it you can do what you want if you are cool with certain people.  Open door policy is a joke and so is the outside investigator.
bad,Does not equip associates with tools to better service to the consumer. flexible hours depending on availability denoted by the system. Unrealistic work goals.
bad,"I worked there ten years ago so hopefully theres been an overhaul of management. You never could find management if you needed assistance, scheduling was crazy, and it was a stressful place to work."
bad,"A typical day would be helping customers find certain items in different departments as well as cleaning the dressing room, stocking the clothes rack with the right clothes, and handling the register."
bad,The management isn't the best here. There were never any time where i really spoke to my manager and there was no communication throughout the department. It was like you were all on your own and I had to adapt to it without proper training right from the start of the job. I don't know how I stayed at this job.
bad,"The best part of working for Macy's were your coworkers. There is no work life balance. Hours are horrible, especially if you have a family. If you are single I think the hours should be ok. Management if ok but they are controlled by the their higher ranks and can not step outside the box, they are very constricted and are not paid enough for all the time they put in."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,It's retail so all the bad things that come with that are present. Management is chasing its tail and doesnt pass on information well and does not listen when that information is incorrect. low pay and not a good work/home life balance.
bad,"No employee acknowledgement  for great attendance, great job performance . Pay is really low for the job duties and responsibilities done day to day.."
bad,"Would not go back."
bad,I love how they treated me and how organized they are. but I do think they need to work on training the new comers more. other than that they are a great company.
bad,"Minimal hours, constant folding of thrown around clothes. Stressed out managers. Forced new credit cards on unsuspecting customers. A good job for a teen just starting out"
bad,I left because a competitor offered me five more dollars an hour for the exact same position. The scheduling system allows you to choose one unavailable day per week but there is little control for management if they want to staff for a particular event.
bad,"Job security and management is very flawed. Professionalism is decent. However career and development paths are disappointing, not enough hours to compensate for the pay scale for the employees, always feel overworked, and underappreciated for the services I've provided over the recent year."
bad,"It was very enjoyable, And good for extra cash for Holiday spending."
bad,"It's very disappointing that I've been working there for over four years and they laid me the week of my last day. Though the position I did have was valid no more, I didn't get a solid heads up that I was getting terminated. Poor management and horrible with communication-- very depressing."
bad,Terrible work environment bad place to work. Needs better pay along with benefits for workers. Scheduling was very flexible allowing to choose days to work.
bad,"A typical day at work: Good"
bad,"company doesn't value hard working associates, but if you take the Gene Simmons book of power advice you'll do great here. To summarize what I mean is slack off but make sure to be on the managers good side and all will be well. Work hard and prove to be reliable,dependable and produce results get no recognition."
bad,"My work days started out with retrieving online orders and making sure my section was clean , organized and ready for customers! Each day had a new task , either you were on the floor assisting with displays or stocking new merchandise , or at the register assisting customers and finalizing purchases. The environment is fast paced , have to stay on your feet , and alert at all times! I always enjoyed styling and assisting customers with finding their perfect match! Sadly, because of poor management and a lack of hours , I could no longer work at Macy's."
bad,"In my particular location, career advancement was slim as there was a lot of favoritism. Associates were given positions that they were not qualified for because they were liked by a manager over ones that were qualified. There was also a lot of manager-associate relationships which clouded judgements when it came to proper decision making. A typical day for me was filled with customers being upset because we were understaffed and barely had needed tools to do our jobs. The dept. I was in, there was a lot of cut throat behavior going on although we were not commissioned. The management as aforementioned did not do good jobs because their integrity was compromised and they were quite egotistical."
bad,"Macy's laid off over 20 thousand people since 2009 and continues to layoff top talent."
bad,"Overall, working at Macy's has been okay for what I needed-a simple, part-time job to earn extra money. However, working here long-term is not my goal"
bad,I liked this job. I was in the merchandising department/stock personnel. We went in early and got off accordingly. I would've stayed at this job but they didn't like the fact that my husband and I conceived and let me go instead of switching me to a different department.
bad,Apprehend shoplifters
bad,If you love coming to work and being trashed talked by customers with little to no support from management then Macy's is a great place for you! Management does not stand behind their employees and customers are allowed to say and do anything they want.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"customers are rude and lavish, they do not follow their 6 garment per person rule in the fitting room which leaves it messy. the managers are really biased and play favorites."
bad,Seemed on a daily basis I was doing more of the leads work then the lead herself and everyone including other managers saw that. The team I worked alongside with was a great team to work with.
bad,"Over worked and under paid. Typical retail. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. I meet a lot of kind, funny and interesting people everyday."
bad,"This job requires long hours on your feet with demanding management for credit card applications. Not to mention employees eager to make their sales goals and willing to do anything for it. Management was a headache everyone thought they were the boss. And the customer always being right gets old really fast, Macy's will return ANYTHING just to make the customer happy. SMH"
bad,"low morale, inefficient management, extremely low pay.they don't value honest hard working employees. pay increase is  10 to 25 cents after 3 months of service and even then you may not get anything. one employee got a 5 cent raise after a year of service"
bad,"The communication between management and employees were poor, the store was way too hot to even shop in and I consistently was too exhausted to even work because of all of the stress and pain I was in."
bad,"A typical day was long and draining. The customers were rude. The y micro manage you like your a kid. I learned how to work a cash register.I learned how to interact with customers. Management was OK.They were not much help to the employees. The culture pretty diverse. The hardest part of the job was having to harass the customers. The best part was working.,"
bad,"The new management has made working here a complete nightmare. We have lost so many great employees because the store manager feels that sales associates are less than human. I used to be very motivated and supported but the new management has their own agenda and only supports their ""friends"". Awful."
bad,i think that if you are part of the right circle you will be okay. it was fun while it lasted but it became really political and there is favoritism to an extent
bad,not too many hours bad paying for a lot of work.  Bad management. not safety too work here. work somewhere else because it is wasting time. not good team member very lazy people.
bad,"This job isn't meant to be a long term plan for career advancement. Hours are not negotiable, even when school is in the way. Wages are low and what you do make is encouraged to be spent at Macy's. Your signed up for a pre-paid card, your given the option to have your paycheck put onto it. It's all meant to just take back what little money you do make. Even as a seasonal position it's not a very pleasant experience to work there."
bad,"It was a good customer service position but not one that I would recommend making a career out of it. Unless you are interning at the corporate headquarters in Cincinatti or New York, it is not a place that you can move up with easily."
bad,"This a great first job to get started in the workplace, but that's just it. Paid minimum wage and the management didn't really do their job. I was getting paid for sales associate, but doing multiple jobs under that one title, when I should have been paid more for the amount of work I was doing."
bad,"Most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. "
bad,I have work there almost five years. And I am a little burn out with retail at the moment.  For most part I enjoy my co workers.  Some customers are okay others are not.  But that is too be expected dealing with the public.
bad,"Upper management does not give support just expects alot with little "
bad,I didnt really have the best time working at macys. You dont get an average weekly schedule you have to go online and try to pick up shifts before others get the best ones. You can be working in textiles today and childrens tomorrow it was very confusing. Also i had to maintain the whole floor and do cash register at the same time.
bad,"Typical day at work was dealing with customers"
bad,They will have you working in the department by yourself when its packed while the other associates are calling off or leaving early. so therefore u wont be able to take a lunch or break because there is nobody to cover you
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"There is a complete disconnect from what happens at the top and what is delivered in store. There is never enough resources and you are constantly set up to fail. The company protects the associates over the managers and doesn't care if the manager works 70+ hours a week to get everything done, because whatever they choose is not right and you never did enough."
bad,"Worked mostly during Christmas so it was constantly busy."
bad,Management was of almost no help. When Macy's bought out Robinson's May they also moved some of their employee's to our store. We were asked to train associates and management. Once management was fully trained on our systems and practices they slowly started to take hours away from us and give them to associates from the old store. I left after receiving a write up not having my name tag on while shopping in store on my day off. It was not company policy to wear name tags once off shift.
bad,"Unfortunately there is a big miscommunication between support and merchandising.  We lose time and effect if the other team doesnt do their job, then we cant do our until we fix what was left undone.  Unfortunately instead of management correcting the issue they seem content to leave us floundering."
bad,"Working for Macy's for 13 years has taught me a lot however, they need to invest more time in their  employees & management.  As a Senior Manager you have a hard time convincing upper mgmt  on what is needed to improve."
bad,"The management generally lacked writing, oral, communication along with people skills when interacting with employees. The benefits and compensation was poor.The facilities were in bad shape. Management usually believed the customer's side of the issue, not sales associate"
bad,"Slow paced, not much to do, perfect for busy people that are just simply searching for an easy part time job. not much room for advancement so don't count on it."
bad,"its is terrible. the pay is bad, they never have hours they work you like an animal. I would NOT recommend this place at all. just plain terrible seriously"
bad,The managers are all over the place. They dont pay attention to when you request off or when you tell them about your schedule. They are never around when youre trying to get loss prevention for shoplifters and its not a very clean work environment.
bad,"Busy environment with minimal sales associates. Too many managers to keep track. Co-workers were very unfriendly and reserved and had clichés. Cross trained in different departments, however very difficult to perform at maximum levels when you just get thrown in. The pay was minimum wage with few opportunities to advance. Security was too aggressive and invasive by checking your personal items when not on the clock, including every break, meal, after shifts and on days off when shopping. The breaks were constantly being interrupted and not supervised enough, so many employees took advantage and were on 10 minute breaks up to an hour"
bad,Co workers were great but the inconsistent change in weekly hours were not that great. One week you're working 30 hours and the next 10 hours. Favoritism was definitely noticeable
bad,"Macy's was not bad when I started out for a seasonal temp job. They saw how hard I worked, how good I was with customers, and asked me to join full-time after holiday season. I was given a different job in another department, far more strenuous, repetitive, and grueling, and for less pay than when I started! After a few months I moved on to a far better job, back to a managerial title again."
bad,Management was useless and didn't know what they were doing. Make your credit and sales goals. Attendance was the biggest thing. Good opportunities to pick up hours. Pay wasn't horrible. $13.75 plus commission.
bad,"If you are looking to enter the work force and learn customer service skills, Macy's could be a good place to work if you are an outgoing individual. At the time of my employment it was great at first, but as the economy started to suffer, Macy's changed many policies that made it difficult on many employees. It is hard to get out of work even for family emergencies. The sales goals in some departments can be unrealistic, especially at the time when the economy was doing poorly. Many of the full-time people ended up being pushed to leave, then those positions were chopped up into smaller positions paid minimum wage with no benefits due to so few hours. Management changes seemed to filled by people from other stores, and not within the same store. The most enjoyable part was the nice people you get to meet while working there, and the customers you develop long-term relationships with. The hardest part would be feeling like you are pressured to force products on customers, even when they clearly are not interested, and taking advantage of them to the point many of them are in huge amounts of debt."
bad,one of the worst jobs i had they fired me because my sister was in the hospital and i had to call out and the store manager told me not to come back until i had a note from the doctor saying i was there and so i missed work and they let me go
bad,"not a great place to work especially the training, it was pretty much trial by fire and very little support from floor managers"
bad,Good job but no work there is no communication what so ever it could be more butter  more managers   I think managers need more work experience.
bad,"Store did not provide adequate training."
bad,"if you want to have to work 12 hour just for a decent check then work here other than that don't. Annoying customers, you dont get stay in one department unless your full time"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I loved working for Macy's I j Wisconsin but not on chandler az I have hard time coming with positive things to say."
bad,They hire a lot of seasonal workers who do not seem to be around when we have high traffic volume. Managers tend to not care about the associates.
bad,"I did not enjoy my time with macys, it ended up not having much room for advancement, and the people i worked with were not very nice people. so after a short time i ended up leaving."
bad,"manager was rude and unnecessarily demanding. i was promised a definite position at a specific counter and she had me hopping around to every single one. when i had to resign due to a back injury, she wasn't very understanding."
bad,"benefits arent good management is horrible too much office politics, no opportunities to advance in any mangement opportunities."
bad,"it would be an ideal part-time job, but no place for growth at all. Also Management gossips about their employees out in the open, VERY unprofessional in my opinion."
bad,"good customer service, not the best work environment. Long hard hours with minimum wage pay. Good associates and workers"
bad,"A typical day at work is very stressful from being harrased by security, yelled at over coupons, and constantly being short staffed and given no assistance or recognition ever for all that you do. The co-workers can be the best party of the job in my experience we are like a family."
bad,The worst retailer for work-life balance.  The managers are more interested in cya than being teamplayers. Everyone is more worried about keeping their jobs than doing their jobs.
bad,"I applied for a seasonal position where I entered my available hours, they were specific to day hours because I'm a full-time college student taking classes at night. I had a phone interview where the interviewer verified the times I was available and I was offered the job. I went in for my first day of training, it was split into two days, I finished the first day easily. During the second day of training I was presented with a request to submit days and times I was able to work. I entered the same hours I had on the initial application. I couldn't proceed with the training with the hours and days I'd inputted. I explained this to the training proxy to which she informed me that I wasn't allowed to not work on certain days at certain hours. Let the record show that I wasn't requesting a weekend. The proxy prompted me to ""Just say you can work and hopefully you won't get scheduled on the days or the times you can't be here."" I obliged as I was confident I wouldn't be scheduled when I wasn't available. I tracked the website for my schedule for 3 weeks. I finally assumed I had lost the job and began searching for something else. 2 weeks after I'd given up I received a call asking where I was because I was supposed to have been there an hour earlier and that I'd also missed my shift the day before. I explained to the woman that I practically stalked the website for my schedule for those 3 weeks. Her response was, ""Well you're on the schedule now."" I ended the call with respectfully resigning from the position. I suppose for some the job works, but this was EXTREMELY unprofessional"
bad,"Management approach to building the business focused on cost control, rather than quality of services offered. Manager and stylists were expected to cruise through the mall handing out cards to attract clientele. There was no advertising budget, not even a website. Management systems were all pencil and paper, no automation of appointments or money management. Promotional offers were limited to community events such as ""spa week""."
bad,Its okay for seasonal employment however if you're looking for full time employment don't hold your breath. There's a lot of favoritism among co-workers and supervisors.  The most enjoyable part about this job is discounts and sales.
bad,"Low moral from every associate I came in contact with. "
bad,"I have been at Macy's for 3 year and have seen a lot of changes. Some for the good, some that still needed improvement. In the past year, however, the changes have been for the worse. Senior leadership have been interfering with how operations managers are running their departments. Some of these managers have been in place for years. They're coming between managers and supervisors, as well as between supervisors and associates. This has been creating a lack of trust and morale is at an all-time low. Productivity and employee satisfaction have dropped. The supervisors are being blamed without any investigation being done."
bad,nice place always shopped there fun employes but not alot of hours to much call ins so not good for me im looking for more hours and to be here for long time
bad,"Very poor, inexperienced upper management. The worst company for a work life balance career and the numerous schedule changes will force you to double think about the quality and purpose of your job.  The lack of genuine work experience with management is a joke, they preach about top coaching & setting expectations, but management lacks the ability to deliver results and fails to follow through on commitments. Pay does not match education and experience, promises are made about career growth but they just layoff over 800 employees. If you challenge management, they turn on you and HR doesn't help."
bad,Working there was very difficult.  The compensation was not good and management did not treat their workers as they should.
bad,"I cannot describe in 20 words how working at Clinique with Macy's was for my personal experience. Macy's always did a great job of providing fun for everyone in the work place but the management had high turnover, bringing in inexperienced people to manage. Clinique's side was worse. Without a manager for month myself and 4 other ran our counter to the best of our abilities."
bad,macys is a low paying work place with poor management and very little security and upward mobility.   A majority of the sales associates I admire their work ethic and enjoyed working alongside them.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Most unorganized company I've ever worked for!!!!! Doesn't care about employees. Oh but you get the occasional ""snack day"""
bad,Typical retail environment. No advancement opportunities and company takes advantage of it's employees. Poor hours and pay.
bad,It was fine for me at the time and helped me to learn skills that I would need for the future such as Dealing with coworkers and what is expected in the workplace.
bad,"Worst place ever to work. Management is horrible, they work you to death at a minimum wage pay. And only get a 30 minute lunch break"
bad,Not a good place to work for if your not a favorite. The cometic dept manager is very unfair. He is not like by any of his staff.
bad,Macys cares about your work ethic rather then care about the people that work for them. They base everything on a point system.
bad,"Good: The discount on clothes."
bad,"I currently work at the Macy's in Orland Park, IL. It's so poorly managed and disorganized. This is a good job if you already have a good paying job and you're just looking to make some extra money. The hours aren't stable, you work really hard but the pay is super low, and management is never on the same page."
bad,I did not like Macy's.  It was only there as a backup job.  Hard work with terrible pay.  Too much stress and not worth the compensation.  Learn to be a wait staff employee.  You'll make more money. Always has to work holidays and weekends with terrible hours. HATED IT.
bad,"Building conversations with clients and catering to their needs."
bad,"This job was alright, I had to work early in the mornings which was something I eventually got used to. I was required to move boxes, usually of candy, all about the store. It was a physical job which I enjoyed but it was mind numbing at times as i, again, was not required to think or be creative in any way. My manager was a great lady and was very understanding. She scheduled me appropriately and I can only say good things about her. My co workers were nice and energetic, even at 5 in the morning. The job was hard physically at times but that is also what I enjoyed about the job."
bad,it was great working at Macy's i loved it there the only problem i had was around the fall semester of classes. i told my manager that i wouldn't be able to work as much as i did because i was going back to school and she told me to pick.so of course i chose my education over anything. if they had a more flexible way of dealing with associates who were in school and working i would probably still be employed with them.
bad,"I would check daily sales and goals "
bad,"same thing everyday, meet goals everyday, purely commission so always in deficit, no room for advancement i've met associates who have been working over 20 years with the company and havent had any growth."
bad,"I was a Flex Associate, which worked very well with being in college but the good things about this place stopped there.  I would clock in, attend the morning meeting if I had a shift, and open the registers.  I would spend my day attending to the register, folding and zoning, and clearing out the fitting rooms.  Once in a while I would need to Damage Out items or mark things down as stolen.  When it was busy and there were a lot of clothes to put away, this was not so bad.  But on slow days when everything was zoned, clothes were put away, and the fitting rooms were clean, it was hard to stay busy.  I also experienced several forms of discrimination including racism, sexism, homophobia, and xenophobia from many of the people who worked there, including management. (But this, I meant I was told to watch certain people for certain reasons, and I saw as certain employees denied to serve others on the basis of these things).  This was my first job so there were many things I did not know yet, and it just in general taught me a lot about how retail jobs are structured.  Management was unhelpful and fairly judgement.  Some of my coworkers were nice, but I never found myself comfortable enough to really get to know any of them and many had formed cliques.  The hardest part of the job was trying to please management.  The most enjoyable part was the Flexibility."
bad,How can you put on the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade and then require that your associates work on Thanksgiving so the people who make the money to pay for the parade are unable to watch it or even celebrate the holiday with their friends and family?  The same goes for the Fourth of July Fireworks Spectacular.
bad,The management team seems to know what their doing however they seem to fail to realize the world we live in. Constant pressure and unpleasant treatment of its employees and they fail to recognize hard work when it is done.
bad,"Along with working in the receiving dock, assisted in renovating the entire sales floor for six months (and working a register on black Friday), which then also included assisting the salesmen and women by selling and folding clothes. Also often worked in the “store sell” department which gathered internet purchases, packed and shipped items to customers. My dock manager was good he listened and helped me but the upper management was selfish, cruel and unappreciative. Half of my coworkers were nice and thoughtful while the other half were weird and segregated."
bad,Working at Macy's was a lot of work. The customers are always rude. You rarely have any type on 15 minute break.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,No room for advancement the customers are very rude and management doesn't help to give a great work experience or support.
bad,"Many of the coworkers are great to work with while others will plot behind your back and steal your sales due to the competitive commission environment."
bad,"Macy's is a great company to work for. i work in a commission based dept. Women's Shoes. I've learned so much in customer service. Management in the store is not great. My coworkers are not team players. The only reason why i love my job is because my clients, and to learn more about customer service."
bad,"Macy's seems like it would be a good place to work, but the pay is extremely low?  Could you live on $9 - $10 per day? "
bad,I only got about 3-4 hours a week and management did nothing when I tried to get more hours.
bad,"When I first started working for Macy's it was a great experience. Great managers, great work environment, when they needed me I would always report in."
bad,"I achieved my goals had the highest pre sale goal in all the Macy's in the US ~ lead a strong team ~ Hired my team ~ "
bad,"Loved the fast paced environment management good, but not enough hours."
bad,"Pay sucks and the management over all sucked."
bad,"During my time with Macy's I was performing the workload of five people. Whenever someone was out sick or simply did not show up for work, that left the few of us with experience to ensure that the work was finished. The managers were very negative whenever the work was not completed in a timely manner, regardless of how few people were there to assist. When a manager requested something from you that meant to drop everything you were doing at that moment to assist them. This request could be anything from a fixture being signed wrong to a box of sales ads being delivered to their office. There was no training for the new employees, they were given instructions and expected to do it right the first time without any information."
bad,When I started working at Macy's I believed that management would be something that would not be a problem for such a large company. Instead everyday consisted of having to call the office to see if you had to work the next day. This meant that you cannot make personal plans in advance. Also the time the schedules were posted seemed to change so it consists of calling the office multiple times in one day.
bad,"•	Established and maintained client relationships."
bad,they are always putting you down and never building you up its hard to work like that
bad,Their were mnany wants but the communication was not vital; they stress macys cards rather than customer service.
bad,Extremely un organized company. Promised 40 hrs and only got between 10-30. Still employed but havn't been put on the schedule for 3 weeks.
bad,"Everything was completely disorganized from the beginning. Management does not know what they are doing, and they do not care at all about the employed staff working to make sales. There are strict sales rules that if are not met, lead to employment termination such as amount of sales per day. Would not recommend at all."
bad,"Lots of work, little pay. Must push credit card applications"
bad,The hardest part of the job is dealing with managers. They tend to pressure you alot. You have associates who will try and take over and boss you around because you are new. They will try and steal you credits and sales if you are not careful.
bad,No Advancement at macy's you are stuck in ur position. do not get paid enough for the work that u do.
bad,"The job was alright, coworkers were very nice. I learned to always keep a copy of your schedule with me. Remember to always remember the manager of the day's name."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"fellow employees not doing their job, tools needed to have a functional workplace not available."
bad,"Horrible company. All senior managers care about is numbers and they don't care what sacrifices have to be made to get them. There is poor synergy and no team work. If you care about a good bonus check then you will love it, if you value how you get your work done and seek to produce results, you will hate it."
bad,"Management never kept in touch. Most managers didn't know who you were and never bothered to remember your name. I'm glad that I only worked during the holiday season, because I don't think I could have worked there much longer than that. When they asked me if I wanted to continue working there, I kindly declined. The only thing I liked about the job were the co-workers. I would only recommend that someone apply there if they have absolutely no experience (high school students), or if no where else hires them."
bad,"I was at macys for over a year and it was byfar one of the worst jobs i had. A typically day for me was doing makeup and dealing with managers who were all best friends so if you had a problem you couldnt talk to no one because your problems wenrt in one ear and out the other. There also was problems with racism they company says they focus on diversity and they dont thats just another way for them to make more money , they talked about people from other cultures when they walk by . I loved my co workers well some of them i can count on one hand how many good people i worked with. The most enjoyable part about my job was making the customer happy and feel beautiful. Theres so much more i would say about this place but i would be writting for days."
bad,"Everyday is never the same in retail. One day is slow other days fast."
bad,"Early morning hours, weekly hours varied from 10-15 hours, management could have been more receptive to more on hands coaching to tasks at hand."
bad,"This is a job for a high school kids who needs money to pay for their cell phone bills. The pay is so low, and it gets worst when there are no hrs you will be asked to clock out and go home."
bad,Macys sucks!!! The only thing good about this place is the discounts. Choose to be an on-call so you wont have to deal with the nonsense all the time. A few managers are nice and interested to see how your doing. There are others who are rude and could care less to see how your doing. The customers are half rude half nice but eventually you just dont pay the rude ones no mind. The pay goes up extremely slow if any. You might quit before you get a raise. It pays to be an on-call and have a better job or full-time job on the side. Lots of cleaning up on busy days but thats to be expected. Its boring and you tend to to wander elsewhere on the slow days.
bad,Work can be 8 hours or no work for 1 week. It is the most unreliable job when it comes to income and insufficient experience.
bad,"The most beneficial aspect of the job is that it greatly improves your critical thinking, multitasking and problem solving skills."
bad,"Guests are rude, co-workers are disrespectful, management is a joke"
bad,Overall the company is not very optimistic on their outlook.
bad,"morning meeting to start,the manager would let us know how the company stood for sales for the previous day etc..and what are goal for the current day should be made.The employees for the most part all worked together nicely and the customers almost always made our day."
bad,I have worked for Macy Valley Fair for almost five years. My day at work is making sure that the sales associates get the right merchandise to their customers. The management is horrible because they do not communicate towards one another and sometimes I get in trouble by one manager for doing something another manager told me to do. A few selected co-workers are what help me get my job done and feel productive. The tough part of the job is dealing with the sales associates blaming my department for their errors. I enjoy being around my stockroom co-workers.
bad,"I took the job because I needed a job at the time. I walked in with at least 7 years of retail experience and figured I deserved more than minimum wage, but they wouldn't give me more than minimum wage because my retail experience wasn't similar enough to their store... RETAIL IS RETAIL... Then I find out later on that a girl who only worked for Kaufman's before they became macy's was given $10.00 an hour.... no other retail experience."
bad,I go to work and assist men in find shoes and suits. The hardest part of the job is I go to school and they are not really willing to work with my school schedule. They give me hours while I'm suppose to be in class and then I have to give the hours away then try to get different hours and sometimes it is impossible to achieve. My most enjoyable part is the interaction with different customers and employees thoughout the day.
bad,the attendance policy was horrible . management was cool and reliable most of the time .
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"It was okay, I was an oncall associate. Didnt get much work unless someone called out. I used the extra money for school supplies."
bad,"Bringing in stocked-price accuracy-team-part-time position. I learned to use a scanner which printed out labels for the merchanise on sale, set up displayed the merchandise. Management and co-workers were enjoyable to work with. Left this position to take care of sick grandchild."
bad,"A typical day working at Macy's involved working at the beauty counters. Each day we were required to open credit accounts and meet a set sales goal and maintain certain number of items per transaction (IPT). The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. On multiple occasions wether it was a group meeting or a one on one with the managers they would scrutinize every detail of our sales goals. I was never treated like an adult, which is apart of how they are told to manage employees. It was a disappointment because I enjoyed working for the cosmetic companies such as Estee Lauder and Shiseido, but the Macy's part took away from the amazing companies they work with."
bad,its ok. its good for seasonal job. its retail can't really except much
bad,Work was easy
bad,"There was a lack of leadership and no accountability.Each day was the same ,go to office and then go to route and back to office. The only fun time was during the holidays, because yo coud give gifts to store managers for more business."
bad,I didn't enjoy working at this job the most enjoyable part was the customers and working with them. Management was disrespectful to employees and unprofessional. Way too much pressure was put on employees and co workers weren't that plesant.
bad,I didn't like working for this company because there wasn't much to do if you didn't have a busy day.
bad,Management was horrible
bad,They had a lack of leadership and training.The supervisors didn't introduce themselves.I work for 3 weeks and I didn't know who to report to.You had to another employee what to do because nobody explained anything .
bad,"they only pay 7.67/hr and its just filled with catty women because its a commission based job. if u have a family to raise, this is not the place for you."
bad,"Macy's Has a socialist view in the managing of there employee's coming from the management of there Macy's in Lee Summit Mo., that I viewed personality myself when I worked there, that I was instructed in how to conduct one's self by giving up my sales to others that they would profit from my efforts.( this is socialistic ) Macy's also mimics there display's of President Obama, and this shows that they stand on his beliefs and polices by the portrayal of these's displays of art work thou out the store. Keeping this in mind, this does not make for a enjoyable shopping experience, nor will it have me ever refer Macy's as a place to shop...only to remind others of this experience ............. !"
bad,face to face customer interactions
bad,"Forget working for this company if you have a second job, they will not work with you and your schedule, they make promises they can't keep and never take the word of a Manager, or anyone in charge, get it in writing. If you work for salary/commission watch out for your sales, usually the manager and employee/pet have something worked out. And this company wants you to sell credit cards all the time its more important to the company then the sale is. Beware Macy's is going into the banking business"
bad,Overall a good place to work if you like retail. The company has some communication issues.
bad,My specific store isn't the greatest place to work. I am on the support crew and the sales associates get special treatment by management and recognition but the support crews get nothing.
bad,"I loved what I did here. Was a beauty advisor for Chanel and Lancome. I originally applied for a full time position, and wasn't told until orientation that I was hired as an on call associate. From there I was basically given the task of filling in at different counters and given a sales goal. Sounds easy...but certain counters don't want you to sell because you aren't a ""real"" employee to a lot of them. I was cursed out by people who worked there who felt I was over stepping invisible boudaries by helping customers. I had other associates return things I had just rang up for customers so they could then ring up under their numbers (commisioned based area). All of this was reported to HR, managers and nothing was done. I had to work Thanksgiving night and was told we would recieve holiday pay and shift differential...I believe I made an extra $9.00 for working an exhausting 14 hrs that day. I was paid approx. 30 minutes of holiday pay and 43 of shift differential. I did quickly work my way up to a full time position thanks to the floor manager that saw and appreciated my work skills. While working at this new counter I had to deal with excessive jealousy, people stealing sales and being told that I couldn't sell certain things because a deal was made between the counter manager and fragrance. At the end of it all I worked hard had dedicated clients always made and exceeded my sales goal but that wasn't enough to keep my job. If you are looking to work for Macy's avoid the one at KP."
bad,the ones that work the most they expect them to do more than the ones that have been there for a long time that do nothing they let him continue to do nothing in Nashville all upper management has been let go they did not even get close to meeting the numbers a production that were expecting
bad,There arent enough employees and so you're left with so many task and work. Most managers just boss you around instead of putting their part to get goals met for the day. Lots of gossip goes on at the work place.
bad,Not very satisfied with the warehouse portion of work though the first time i was hired for seasonal i was hired. The dept i enjoyed but couldve been better pay
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Horrible horrible horribleNot worth it I will work the older ladies is there a favoritism well if you’re new you really don’tThey are very horrible company to work for the pay is nothing the work is overworked they never answer the phone for a person to call and say hey I’m at I won’t be able to come in and the callout phone number does not work there very rude and
bad,"Overall the management, from in store to district team to headquarters, seems like they have no idea to run a business.  You are often left scratching your head in wonder at the high level of stupidity that knows no bounds with this company.   They are cutting jobs left and right, so much that there are hardly any people to be found to help customers, yet staff are held to the fire when customers complain about no staff available to help them.  Store hours fall outside of mall hours so staff are often standing around with no customers for hours.  Especially during holiday hours.  Let's pay 30 people to be at work to service two customers that might come in at late hours.  Also, extended sale hours that are not advertised.  If they just mirrored the mall hours they would stop losing money."
bad,They need to pay people that works hard better And they need to treat people with more respect in certain department and listen to what their problem is and try and solve it
bad,Good job for a young person or someone seeking part time work. Scheduling unreliable and very little additional work perks. Work culture feels as if only management needs are most important.
bad,very poor management. the company means well but unfortunately people can make an environment not the best place to work. But you would think the head bosses would help and not favor and make things worse and they did. I heard she is no longer there but also the store is even worse. also faced very racial situations that were not handled properly. its not a nice place to have a peace of mind because these women are still there and have been for many years. but if you are needing a jump start than by all means do so.
bad,"It wasn't bad. The pay was low for all the work involved and people would talk about others behind their back then smile in their faces but other than that...it wasn't bad. "
bad,"It took over a month between an interview process in any actual real hours. People who are supposed to be training are downright vicious, and vindictive. None of this are the employees fault, in my view it's Macy's fault because their whole system is screwed up. They actually expect somebody come in and get virtually no training and know where everything is in the entire store. Only accept this job if you have zero respect for yourself, and don't like making $$$$."
bad,Its a job when you need a job. You are under paid. Not appreciated and have to kill in order to get a full time position or work your way up in the company.
bad,"The pay is not well, sometimes fast paced and sometimes too slow, good coworkers, The managers are usually helpful but sometimes too demanding. Make you sell their credit cards."
bad,Everyday was dull and monotonous broken only by being berated about making impossible sales goals. The management was petty and unhelpful. Consistently pitted against friends and colleagues for the sake of scraping a dollar.
bad,"Dont count on living off the paycheck unless you are FT. One week you work 30 hours, next 4 hours. Not very dependable. Discounts are ok, nothing major."
bad,"Store management (specifically the store manager) is absolutely awful. This created a culture of negativity and unhappiness amongst staff. Hours were cut for full time employees with not explanation until months later. I was never supported in my role and was expected to be successful without any tools. My coworkers, however, were absolutely fantastic. Mid level management (sales leads) were the only managers who truly cared and did their jobs."
bad,This job is not for people who have real Bill's the pay sucks the hours are given through favoritism . There are some racist workers there and it's not as flex as they say it is.
bad,"Extremely slow paced, at least where I worked. Training was a snooze fest. They would tell me to go recover clothing.... I could disappear for hours and literally no one would notice. Terrible pay and hours."
bad,"Macy's is fine for seasonal employment if you don't mind working with employees who have been there for decades and act as if their word is gospel, even if they're not management. Don't, however, expect any kind of professional advancement, no matter how hard you work; they hate promoting employees when they can readily hire seasonal or temp employees at minimal hourly wages and skimp on the hours."
bad,"Department managers were more concerned with making their daily plan than the happiness of their employees and can be rude when speaking to an employee. Some act as though you are beneath them. In addition when I was contacted by Macy's for part time holiday work I was promise $9.00 an hour a joke PLUS commission. When I received my first pay check I owed the Macy's money. It tuned out to be you had to sell a certain percentage against your hours in order to see any commission.  I still do not understand why they lie to future part time or full time employees. Also the HS department was a joke. They never had an answer for anything and you had to call the cooperate office and wait on hold forever. Not a good company to work for. When I contacted a employee representative the answer I receive was to quote ""I guess we better do a better job of training our phone representatives""."
bad,"There’s rarely ever enough coverage, so there for a lot of angry customers. No ac on the bottom floor so on hot days it’s extremely uncomfortable. They make associates do other tasks that are not under their job description. And problems such as co-worker problems and broken case lines drawers never get resolved. This job always requires more than what your responsibility are."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Macys makes deep staff reductions annually  sometimes through job consolidations which means more work with the same pay. The company targets management reductions based on age. If you are over 50 years old you have to be very concerned that you will be “packaged out” to make room for a millennial. People best suited in their current position are frowned upon and forced putmoved out again for a millennial. If you are not Store Manager material, you have no place in their plan."
bad,"Love the people.  Too much work without enough employees on the floor to assist customers well.  Macy's needs to stop worrying about paying for fireworks, etc. and put their money into their employees."
bad,"No training, they threw me out on the floor knowing nothing. It’s definitely sink or swim. The management only cares about opening credit cards. I enjoyed the job but I could have used more support. It was nice to choose my own schedule."
bad,I worked at this location for almost four years as a seasonal worker. Never had any problems with management or coworkers until they switched to management. Some of the new management has problems with proper communication and leading by example. The amount of work that Macy's wants  you to do versus what they are willing to pay you is ridiculous.
bad,"This is a high stress, low paying job. Employees are treated very poorly. They are expected to open many credit cards every day even for customers that may have 2 or more other Macy’s cards. Managers treat their Human Resources very poorly as there are not enough hours available for management to use to fill all the stores needs. Employees are expected to be on the floor 100% of the time, fill in product and clean and stock 100% of the time and man 3 different areas at the same time. The CEO and every other level of manager do not carry the stress that the little guys do in this company for the $9 or $10 an hour."
bad,As management Macys expects you to bust you but day in and day out for not recognition.  No matter what you do its never enough.  The only positive is there are a lot of good people who work there on the lower levels.
bad,Not a bad job if you work under the right people. If you strive for creativity and showing off your work great job for you. Long hours OK pay. Hardwork
bad,"Ok, decent place to work,  production quotes do not make any difference to advance or pay increase.  Weak management,  no need to follow rules .Pay is weak,"
bad,"Macy's is partial to advancement of youngsters/post-teens and Hispanics.  These two groups know nothing about customer service and the customer is always right.  I saw alot of cell phones and sitting on the floor in an upscale place like Macy's.  Managers cater to groups that don't even shop there.  What happened to respecting all cultures and advancement of all American's wanting the dream?  Macy's will promise you the sky but the award always goes to bi-lingual associates.  hummm"
bad,It’s cool for college kids but not grown adults with grown bills..... other then that I guess it’s ok! And you can’t get the discount if your not approved for one of there Macy’s debit cards!
bad,"Worked here for about 3 years in the women's shoe department, the pay was good until they took away the commission and cut hours. The managers never help with anything and the workload is overwhelming because they're always short staffed. On Thanksgiving they make you come in as early as 4 pm - 6am Friday morning and it is mandatory everyone work Thanksgiving!"
bad,For the hourly rate it is not enough for The amount of work expected. management is overworked and quit as much and often as sales associates.  While I understand satisfying customer but it’s clear they care little about associates safety and well being.  I would never consider  working full time.
bad,Terrible management.  Terrible pay.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone other than student.  Not more than 34 hours and I was full time.  Needed better pay and hours
bad,Recent senior management changes have resulted in poor work culture. They're outsourcing all open positions to India which presents serious challenges.
bad,"A very hostile energy. You have some good managers, some bad . Same for the supervisors but a lot is covered up . So much lack in communication as well ."
bad,"If you want to have a temporary job, it's not super bad. However, management at this location is horrible. They have no consideration for employees and they have poor management style or leadership. Overall bad experience."
bad,If you like being disrespected by management and customers alike then this is the job for you and doing the work over and over again because of bad planning. Whenever the district team would come in they were nothing but rude and treated everyone like they were better than you. They forced out some of my favorite managers. Things got worse when the new district guys took over.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I was thrilled to start working in the world of beauty. I thought it would be fun and rewarding. The only positive comment I can share is my experience with the clients and some of the employees. Management does not care  and they pick and choose who will be placed to a hire level or different counter. I went to management on a few occasions before I gave my two weeks notice and they did nothing.
bad,It's like any other job management is made up of people who just don't care and a few good ones but overall they expect way too much for minimum wage. Hours are hard to come by I was able to work in two different depts that's how I've been able to last this long (8 months). Please don't bother with this company unless you're ok with being treated nicely until you are no longer willing or able to be available whenever they want.
bad,"I left because I was accused of a theft of a total of  $3 . Not knowing if my register was short or something,  I offered to pay the money immediately. When I attempted to dismiss me, I decided to leave. Within 3-6 months the store was closed. Leaving me to speculate that they were simply liquidating staff. I am sure others from this store will have a similar story"
bad,I enjoyed co-workers. retail work. not enough pay. only benefit to working was the ability to utilize work related discounts to use of purchases. Too much micro managing and focus based on numbers
bad,"Lack of quality control, poor management, unreasonable expectations, and limits on the work that can be done. Overall just a place that needs to be more observed from the ground up, as there is no room to grow, nor is there cause to want to grow coming from a salesman. The way the job is run, and those who run it are two sides of a coin that will never meet. On top of shady and scummy business practices that are in full view of everyone, but made in a way to put the blame on the bottom. Furthermore it's crafted to also decisive both customers and naive employees. "
bad,"Come in at 4 am (Holidays is 10pm). Have a meeting about sales and what major areas need tidying up. Put stuff out on the floor, scan everything, sign what needs to be changed all before the store opens. The hours were rough and very inconsistent, and would have liked it to be more consistent."
bad,"Macy's credit and customer service located in Bridgeton, MO was not the most professional place to work. The environment was not client focused which is what I believed lead to the mass lay-off that I was unfortunately a part of."
bad,You end up absolutely exhausted by  the end of day.  I couldn’t get out of my car right away when I got home because I was so sore. I was Recovery.  I had to report to many people and it wasn’t always clear which task I should do first.
bad,"It was ok as a flex associate. But people got really catty. Some of the employees were unhappy with a few gossiping about you. Mgmt gave everyone an ultimatum even the veteran workers to reapply which theyd keep their package. Or leave which theyd lose their package. That was for full timers. If you were part time, there wasnt any point staying. Youd be suffering for nothing. Early morning markdowns and sales were annoying BUT that was the best time to work. MD and signage also was the best job to do there. A lot less supervision and time to yourself or with a coworker you like. What was strange was certain people wanted us to be on register which we didnt sign up for. So i guess management forced the ""new position"" for everyone to do everything. But if customers were first, the work didnt get done and employees were at fault. Merchandising was good until i worked with a veteran who complained about EVERYONE including me."
bad,I guess you could just say poor training =. Poor performance. No hours unless you kiss up. No benefits.  No raises for those who deserve it.  No one gives a whoot.
bad,"Paid weekly was the ONLY pro here. No chance for advancement, favoritism, frequently scheduled outside of my availability & then told YOU must find someone to cover your shift. Even after it was their mistake."
bad,"The store i worked at was so mismanaged. They are for sure a profit above people company. Example. They would rather let trash build up in the receiving area where the stench soaks into clothing waiting to be processed than to call the waste company and pay for an extra pick-up. Attention Macy's shoppers: Always check your clothing out before purchase, especially the cuffs or sleeves as they are allowed to drag on the ground during processing."
bad,Macy's HR does not work well with employees who have disabilities. Managers and schedules are very inconsistent. The store is very slow during the weekdays which can make the day drag on.
bad,"Overworked for very little pay. Minimum wage no matter your level experience. A typical day at work consisted of breaking down the boxes of merchandise and putting them in their respective areas, operating the baler, taking care of FedEx and UPS deliveries, sometimes performing order fulfillment duties. I learned how to manage my time and prioritize tasks as this was a very fast paced environment. My manager started off as a nice person but when the holiday rush hit she completely changed. Hours started being given based on favoritism and not job performance, plus she began to take job stress out on us. The hardest part of the job was working in such a dusty environment that was also hard to maneuver in because there were so many things being worked on at once within the limited space. I really enjoyed working with my co workers and that's the main reason i stayed as long as i did. But given the lack of hours and my manager's behavior, along with a very unprofessional HR, no opportunities for benefits, I decided to search for another opportunity. "
bad,"Was initially employed by Seattle-based Bon Marche chain retailer with local management and a good place to work. Was there though merger with national chain Macy's, which proved to be a poor employer. Store now slated for permanent closure in 2020."
bad,"The job is beyond full time—it often takes over your life. Very stressful for minimal pay and little gratitude for very long days. The pace is quick, which means days can be very fun but it makes it difficult to have any kind of outside life."
bad,"a lot of the employees had disgusting attitudes. Working at macy's is very boring and draining. Although I did meet a few lovely people. Overall, I honestly don't think I could ever recommend this to anyone."
bad,"Motivation comes from fear of losing your job and always having to prove your worth.  Back biting, gossipy, very negative work environment.   The region's priorities do not align with stated company culture.  No integrity, no honesty."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"personally, i hated it. At the time I was having some health issues, and I was on my feet for 5 to 7 hours at a time. I got a lunch break when I worked 8 hours, but that was rare. The managers were good, but the other people i had to put up with sucked. They were negative, complaining, and didn't take the job seriously - and it seemed the managers really didn't do much about it. Honestly, it wasn't worth my time, and I am glad it was seasonal. I would have become part - time if I didn't hate it so much."
bad,"I started at Macys Logistics as a seasonal employee. You start with 2 10hr days a week with the ""chance"" to pick up someone else's shift if no one else has picked it up yet. Then Thanksgiving week it bumps up to 4 10hr days. My main complaint with Macy's was the lack of oversight and training. I was briefly shown things on my first 2 days and then thrown by myself to figure it out. As far as management goes I couldn't even tell you who was in charge of my area. I would walk to my area they would scan my badge and tell me where to go. I would not see any managers or supervisors the rest of the 10 hours. Unless it was to send me to another area. I've also never seen a company waste so much money on hours. There we're days I was so bored because I literally had nothing to do. There was about 20 people in my area with about 5 people's amount of work to do. I requested to help another area that was busy and was told I was to be in the area that had nothing to do. Just a very disorganized company."
bad,Starting my career at Macy's was great. Enjoyed the people I worked with and learning new things straight out of college. What I learned quickly was that advancement happened for people upper management favored versus those who put hard work in every day. The culture has gotten worse over time and there is no room for growth within this company. Most people are very unhappy and don't look forward to work everyday
bad,"Hired as part time.  Expected to work whenever the management decides you should work, no set hours, hours always changing according to their whim which doesn't adhere to their online scheduling system which sets up wrong hours anyway, no local HR department at any of their stores which should concern any person working for this company, higher management provides no viable email contact.  Absolutely terrible customer service from an employee stand point - how can that translate to customer service to their patrons.  Employee breaks are not consistent which violates labor laws."
bad,real you in with bate then never acknowledge your worth things should be adjusted as far as better pay or raises for those that work hard shouldn't have to ask for what they deserve it should be paid attention to an given and not based on credits or customer sign ins
bad,"The company is largely focused on profit and that is clear to even the seasonal employee. In morning meetings that are daily for everyone working at that hour, the company discusses profit for each week and the month and what to do that day to meet sales.  This information is not passed on to the later shift employees who are expected to just know it or see it sometimes updated on a marker board. The management shows that quality as well and employees are treated as a piece of grass in a field. It is clear that it streams down from corporate and the management is required to behave this way, but most of them do it extremely rudely, largely based on the GM of the store.  HR is okay.  Shifts for even the regular employees are random and week by week.  You may close one night and be expected to open the next morning.  There is zero solidarity in schedule because the store cannot keep enough employees on board. "
bad,"No one is in charge, no one knows what others doing. Employees regularly take 3 hour lunch breaks and no one cares.  New employees are bot given any training."
bad,A typical day started off with me in one and switching through out the day.  I learned how to be versatile and flexible.  The workplace culture was hostile and competitive.
bad,"-A typical day at Macys is both fun and challenging"
bad,First off you DO NOT make commission at macys unless you've worked there for over 10 years. So if you think you will get that out of your head asap. Big Box stores are doing more and more to get rid of the sales person and do everything online. Look elsewhere. High Turnover rate as well.
bad,"At Macy’s, you were constantly pressured to open credit cards or sell competitively. Slow day? They don’t care, they would rather have you harrass the customers and lie to them to open up accounts. Have a family? Go to school? They don’t care either. They disrespect your schedule and add more hours to what is convenient for them even if you had a unavailable day in your schedule. Managers expected everything to look spotless and perfect but would just stand and watch you as you have a line of customers but still complain at the end of the day why the floors was such a mess. I quit after 4 years, it was the only job I could have that I could go to school in the day and work a mid shift. When I left and came back to see old coworkers they all told me how happy I looked and saw the difference in my face leaving Macy’s impacted me."
bad,There's often only one employee working in an area at a time due to severe understaffing. Management is often late or out of the building which poses a lot of problems because employees have less than zero overrides. Employees will get pulled out of their areas to help other areas when theirs is slow which said employee often gets in trouble for when they have no control over it. Not a healthy work environment.
bad,"Very low pay for the amount of work they expect you to do. Poor management. Absolutely no work/life balance, It's all work and no life. They have you working literally 8 days in a row, while asking you to stay late, come in early and to come in on your one off day a week. "
bad,"The sales people I worked with constantly got credit for the work I did.  The management made me feel unappreciated and worthless. If a sales associate hit their daily goal, the next day they were entered into a drawing for different types of goodies. I was only aloud to be entered if the week ended with every sales associate hitting their goal each day. I was extremely over worked. There was no way to advance in the store unless management was fired. My schedule never showed up in the system or would change my off days to working days after I was already supposed to be in and count me as a no call no show."
bad,"I did not enjoy working at Macys, couldn't connect with most coworkers and my store closed its doors in 2016 because lack of cash flow. not a lot of people walking through the door meant too much down time for me."
bad,"If it wasn’t for the lack of hours and terrible management, I would’ve stayed at the parkchester location. The management made me want to resign before the season was even over."
bad,"From the moment this new manager arrived, there has been one problem after another. They come up with a new ridiculous rule or policy every week. We used to pursue every shoplifting case no matter how small the amount as long as it was within the guidelines which was how we met our goals. For example, instead of apprehending someone who concealed a pack of underwear on the sales floor we instead choose to conduct a burn to scare them into dumping the merchandise. Recoveries alone will not cut it. To make matters worse their own incompetence is blamed on the associates. Employee turnnover had never been so high until this manager arrived in feburary. Until a change in management is brought about, I would strongly advise everyone to steer clear of Asset Protection at River Oaks Macy's."
bad,Macy's is a good company to work for until management loses focus of what their employee's mean to the company.  If they would set some rules on dressing rooms it would make it easier on employee's and shortage of merchandise
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,nothing to say. i enjoyed working at Macy's however supervisors micromanaging and preference to certain individuals got tiresome and stressful over time
bad,"Working there was fine, but the managers dont really appreciate what you do. All they care for is the sales you make and to make sure they get a great “magic score” meaning good reviews from customers. You get  a minimum of 30mins lunch break without pay, because you have to meal out, the longer your hours is paused, the longer you dont get paid, so 45mins to 1hr break our of 8hours schedule is only paid about 7hrs or so. Customers of Macy’s are most of “entitled” too, it’s hard for them to realize that Macy’s is not the same as the “high-end compared to JCpenny or Ross” anymore, it’s a kind of hard to explain to them that what they’re buying is already 80% off and cheap and they dont need to give you the attitude of someone buying an LV Merch. And it’s also one job, fits it all, as a sales associate, you do the dusting, restocking, Fullfilments, and general customers services such as calling the Macys credit Card hotline because the customer dont want to talk to agents across the globe. Speaking of credit card, you have to persuade atleast one client to sign up for a macys creditcard atleast once a week or else your manager wont let you hear the end of it. And also, you have to sell whatever charity they support too.. like almost literally beg your client to buy a pin from you so that your manager will be happy.."
bad,When I started at Macy's it was a little hard at first. But once I got the hang of the lay of the land and how things ran it was good. I did not appreciate losing my job over Macy money. They revised the policy after my termination. they don't appreciate their employees the way they should. that's my opinion
bad,you receive an order to you pick and give it to the packers who will package it for shipping. I also did the packing and had to be creative when doing it.
bad,"Would not work for Macy's again unless I become desperate for employment. My Macy's experience would have been much more pleasant if our store was amply staffed. The work environment became way too stressful, especially during holiday season."
bad,This was ok job but the customers were the worst.   Employees really couldn't do anything about their rudeness.  There wasn't any support for the team against bad customers.
bad,"Too much pression at work they require many things to do and constantly approaching and pushing every day every time and they don’t have profesional treatment with the associates "
bad,"I didn't like the at Macy's "
bad,I was subjected to be fired because of a supervisor in Macy’s it was supposedly because I was being insubordinate but I felt I was getting told to do things not in my job description
bad,Macy's was a fun company to work for. Offered discounts and coupons for the store during peak sale times. Had to work mandatory holidays and overtime during holidays. Macy's gave monthly bonuses.
bad,"Most coworkers don't do anything. Pretty lazy."
bad,"i was on call but they never called until i got a new job. when i did work there , i never knew who my manager was , i was just thrown in a department and had to learn what to do from others. i really has no guidance or was ever supervised. i shadowed people from the day i came until the day i left."
bad,"The management was poor, they don’t back their employees. Basically their motto in regards to customer cupons is “Tell them no until they ask for a supervisor, then call the Sup. Line so they can tell them yes!” Basically make us hourly employees(who do all the work) look bad, make supervisors look good. "
bad,"There Is only one thing your managers will care about. And that is sales.  Who sales the most and who fills out the most credit applications.  They don't care how or why if there is any conflict of interest or how this kind of work makes you stressed in any way. They have an open door policy which literally goes out the window because yes, they listen,  but that's all they do.  I've never seen any action being taken by them at all."
bad,Days off and shift hours change daily - not a misprint - daily. You get  two weeks of schedule at a time. You go in at 9:15 one day and 1:15 the next day. Weekends - Sunday - usually. It changes daily. Little hope for advancement. Very little training opportunities.
bad,"unloading items from freights, loading items to freights"
bad,It definitely is a good first job but there is a lot of drama in the retail space so be-careful of who you trust. Also don't let them suck you in with the whole we are family skit it is a joke.
bad,at my job at macys i was a shift supervisor meaning that i watched employees and helped them if they needed it and i also rang customers up and returned their items
bad,very disorganized and managers always changed and employees had little information given on hours or schedules for work week . vacation hours are lost due to management
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,with all these Macy's sales you can never hit your sales goal. you can never hit your sales goal unless you steal other people's sales which is terrible and it happens a  lot in Macy's.
bad,management sucked! they need to learn how to communicate better and not talk down to their employees. The managers are so focused on making sure that associates arent standing aroound talking while they're just standing around doing nothing.
bad,"Great people to work with in a very collaborative environment. Not much work-life balance / flexible work schedule, unless you're a VP or above. Not much job security unless you're working in the dotcom area."
bad,"Mostly great co-workers, mostly poor management. Overall managers not qualified to lead or manage people. .70 cent pay raise in 3+ years, health insurance offered not affordable for most employees, no sick leave! You earn attendance points( 2 per month), which they then deduct from the balance if you get sick. When you run out of points, you get fired!! Recommend as Temp. job only, not long term."
bad,"Work harder than regular employees. And lack of respect from older employees."
bad,"Terrible management, service, and discrimination against certain employees. No advancement career at this retailer. No wonder it's going out of business."
bad,Working with this company you would do a lot of volunteer and programs. The benefits are  okay and working with the associates are whats make coming into work everyday.
bad,Macy's is a negative place that lacks communication big time. Management isn't helpful and never has your back with customers. Customers can be very rude and you cannot stand your ground whatsoever. You're expected to make every customer leave happy even if they completely take advantage of every policy that stands in place. Macys has taught me that retail is a terrible job that is going downhill very quickly and I hope to never return.
bad,Working on the dock was exhausting work and was not compensated very well. There were no medical benefits and the only benefit was the employee discount
bad,"I was a full time sales associate at Macys for seven years. Throughout that seven years , many management shakeups took place on all levels of the pyramid. "
bad,"Harsh boss that cared very little about your personal life and problems, i.e., health issues. Very unfriendly work environment that made you feel uncomfortable"
bad,"Constant management turnover, poor compensation package(low wages,high insurance premiums!),insufficient staffing,poor store security(assault by disgruntled / drug addicted customers).The silver lining is,flexibility in the part-time schedule."
bad,"Working at Macy's was difficult, they hire all employees at ""limited part-time"". You get scheduled about 5-10 hours a week in your main department. Once the schedule is released you then have to sign in online and try to grab any open hours in any department that are available. You are required to be moving at all times, including when there are no customers, cleaning is complete and all shelve are stocked. This is not a job for someone who cannot be on their feet for extended periods at a time. The culture is very cut-throat with sales. If you turn your back on a customer that you were working with then be prepared for someone else to walk up and take over (even if they customer has requested that you let them look around). There is no bonus/incentive to sell but you must reach your daily sales goals. You are also required to wear all black. There are designated days that you can where a shirt that is not black, however you have to pay money to do so."
bad,"Management is extremely chaotic and disorganized"
bad,"Management treats everyone below them like garbage, at least where i worked. If you have a closing shift, expect to stay past your scheduled time fixing your department if it's a busy day."
bad,"Managers in Macy's backstage in fort worth are the reason why several employees quit and that includes Macy's too.  Managers will not help you on the registers even if there is a long line of customers, you have to call for them. They pretend to work but actually they're not doing anything. They will put ever task on you and your co-workers to do."
bad,Not a place to grow at management is horrible moral is down they want you to fail so they can fire you. I thought going into this job it would carry me into something better but I'm looking to leave more than ever
bad,"Even though it seems like a dream job don""t fall for it. Not only do they over work you but the pay you receive doesn't match your work load. They suspect you to be in five different place at once."
bad,"Macy's is not a good place to work, especially the Ballston location. Too much backstabbing and sneakiness among management staff who love to sit around and gossip about staff as well as set people up to me fired. I was miserable there but the bright side is that I learned how to survive in a hostile work environment and that is a valuable lesson that made that mess worth it."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Great for Career Experience...but it ends there. I was hired based on my Styling and Merchandising experience...and was dumb enough to take a pay cut under the guise that the Pay was competitive and would be adjusted after a year. Granted...its very possible to move up fast, but that doesnt necessarily mean your peers have the same Business Acumen as you. Expect to be around very lazy and unprofessional staff. So...its fairly easy to shine with minimal effort. The hardest part of my job was to say nothing as people with over decades of Experience...still treat this flagship store as their first Highschool Job. They just cant seem to get it right at all. They are beyond Retail 101...this lot needs to be let go altogether to make way for Newer and Fresher Blood. "
bad,"After being promoted to a particular location, I was harassed by my store manager and bullied by my peer team. They refused to grant my time off and rarely helped when I needed man power to change a floor set or stock room. I mostly worked 12 hour + days and would be called in on my days off. I also repeatedly asked to be transferred to a closer location since I commuted 2 hours each day. I was finally granted a transfer closer to home after a year and a half."
bad,"Typical day: Merchandise an substantial amount of clothing among other tasks with little assistance "
bad,"This company doesn't care about you as a person, they only care about theirselves and if they're going to get sued. "
bad,This is by far the worst place to work in retail. Crazy place that is always filled with some of the craziest people which makes yours days just as crazy
bad,"I worked at Macy's for almost a year. In the beginning it might seem glamorous and exciting but over time the thrill fades when you start getting irritated with how things are run. The schedules can be annoying and hellacious, especially if you are part time. You might have a shift where you go in at 8:30, just to work 4 hours, and maybe only 2 or 3 times a week. Getting a break can also be hard, especially if you haven't eaten all day."
bad,wasted 9 years of my life....lip service for career advancement. Dirty Politics based on last in first out.wasted 9 years of my life...retail has suffered and so will your career.
bad,As a software engineer you don't have much room for growth in this company. I would recommend this company for someone coming out of college but if you want to advance your career after a few years look somewhere else. This company offers no training on new technologies and they are slow to catch up on current trends in the software industry.
bad,"Although I loved just chilling around work nd helping customers it got very very boring , it was fun sometimes when stocking and putting outfits on the dolls , but it wasn't something I wanted to do forever"
bad,Unfair review process. Not enough resources to be able to do your job in a normal work day. One manager not enough to over the area they are assigned not enough staff support.
bad,The most enjoyable part about this job is that I was able to deal with customer and also do the customer make up with it. The place was very busy but then it suddenly got very slow..
bad,Unfair management. If you don't do what they ask your job is in jeopardy. Business closing and they had no companionship for the employees that were losing their jobs
bad,"I hate this place period, its not organized the managers don't know anything or don't do anything they are to concerned with saving their own job to even care about your job and whats going on just stay away from this overly priced place"
bad,"A typical day at work, would include assisting customers, answering"
bad,"as someone constantly looking to move forward within my company, macy's was a major disappointment. promotions are not given based on merit, rather in my experience, based on favoritism."
bad,Management at Macy's is definitely not the nicest especially to employees. I was never really happy working at Macy's. Macy's customer service was good but they need to learn how to treat their employees better!
bad,This is overall a fine company but not if you want to earn real money and at the same time not get involved with all the politics that is going on in their system.
bad,Need part time hours for part time job. They also should provide small breaks for restroom. I got a thirty minute lunch and that was it. I don't mind working full time job if I am getting full time position.
bad,"Typical Day - Helping costumers with checkout , keeping dressing rooms clean, keeping floor items in order, being sure to do register counts at the end of each day "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Macy's is a cool place to work I enjoyed my time there , but they wasn't paying enough for me so I had to move on , the people and customers where great"
bad,I have 8 years experience in retail and only make 9.00 an hour plus commission which its hard to stay out of deficeit which you have to in order to receive your commission and if you don't make your sales goal each week commission defiecit climbs and you will never make it down to 0 on the defiecit to get your money
bad,Macys doesn't care about their employees! Sorry!! They tell you that they're a team copy but you barely know who you supervisor is on your shift. They are not far when it comes to a lot of promotions. And their scheduling system doesn't meet the stands that of a professional company.
bad,I learned how to do inventory. Even after giving them my school schedule I would still have to work on days I had class and during the time I had class.
bad,"I worked in the clothes department and so my day was spent between the register ringing up guests, and trying to keep the dressing rooms cleaned up. I would say the hardest part about the job was the amount of clothing that needed to be folded or hung, the most enjoyable part about the job was the people I love interacting with people."
bad,its a diverse environment... I always made it fun for my department... I learned a lot about credit and how to balance. however the credit card is crazy how so many people get ripped off the the interest. what makes it great are the coworkers .... management is not that great needs improvements one or two are good but the rest everyone trying  to get to the next level... if you try to grow as a supervisor from a rep management judges them by look not work ethics... However i enjoyed working there is my team and always pushing my team to the best... I would recommend this to work but not make a career out of it
bad,the company only cares about them selfs and the customers which is great the care they have for customers but for the employes working hours and hours its not so much because there have been people working there for years and they still don't have any health or any other benefits
bad,Store didn't even have my records when I went back for a w-2 form I believe they didn't even have me in the system . Never again will I apply there . Just horrible
bad,"don't work in retail.  it sucks and you will die."
bad,"No room for advancement, preferred individuals whom sucked up to the managers versus this who were qualified on doing good job."
bad,"The inconsistency of scheduling, and working on Holidays and weekends, were the worst. I did not enjoy spending more time at work than at home at times. I made the best of it, as I do at any job i have ever worked. My co-workers were a delight to work with,and i met a lot of interesting people on a day to day basis. Enjoyed showing my fashion skills, customers really appreciated my input, so that made my days more pleasant."
bad,"I worked for Macy's in Columbus, Ohio as an LP Detective for a year. Within that year my manager just stopped coming to work, we had to take on his responsibilities, and upper management never reached out one time to help. We only had three associates at my store so we weren't able to take any paid time off. You always have to work weekends. Soon after finding out that my manager stop coming to work our district managers fired me and another one of my co workers for making an apprehension off of the curb. No one was hurt or anything but we were still let go. Do not work for this company everyone is out to get you to get ahead."
bad,"What I've learned, continue being a rampaging beast at work, never settle what management suggests where you should work in. Must have the passion for classic cars, it wins management over. Emotional manipulation is a painkiller, it's a side effect of pain meds. If you use FMLA it will be used against you among other co-workers. If you enjoy degrading women, other than your own wife, this is the atmosphere you'll have fun with click/buddies in plowing thru the day. If you're a female bartender by night/worker by day here, beware. Role playing is commonly used here thru scenarios by others via cell phones/texts."
bad,"Was a rutinary job. the hardest part when we receive a lot merchandise in christmas and we dont have space where to put and have to remember where was some merchandise request for any department, the enjoyable was when we go home."
bad,"Macy's is known for their parades and other iconic themed celebrations to the public which can be sort of glamorous but that glitters is not gold. Macy's is a nightmare to minorities that are looking for a fair chance to make a living. Never gives hours to people who deserve them but will work you like a dog, there are more managers then employees which cause friction between mangers and employees in different department, they would make it extremely difficult for you to get a raise you rightfully deserve. With the lack of employees, many workers have to take responsibility of jobs out of their jurisdiction because mangers would ""blackmail"" the employees that was not unionized in order to get something done. the only thing good about Macy's is the people you would meet along the way"
bad,"I was making $8 and hour here,work schedule is the same as any other retail store place to work at, never got out of work on time,Holidays was the worst to work. I worked 6 days a week"
bad,the job is easy it is a job it pays the bills like every job the people you work with can make it bearable I worked with collage g kids who were more concerned about the last/next party than getting the job done
bad,Was forced to transfer departments because of needs. Was not trained well for new department. Wouldn't let me or fellow co-workers go to part-time due to stress or carpooling issues. Was not a good experience.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"After working here, I could see why they had a high turn-over rate.The job got harder the longer I was there.The pay is not what it should be; should be higher rate. I stayed here longer than most. There is only so much someone can take."
bad,"Rough on the first day, had no idea who was my manager till they kept switching me around. very confused. not a place I would work again"
bad,"Macy's is alright in the summer, but I continued to work weekends when college started. I believed I work in a friendly environment, but now I feel like I'm a burden on the managers. My manager frequently forgets to fix my schedule so I lose attendance credits for not coming in while I'm at school. Managers approach from behind as if they're trying to catch the associate doing something wrong. Macy's uses attendance credits to force people to not get sick (even though that's impossible) and if you run out, you get fired. The other associates are great, but they're suffering because of the managers too."
bad,"Salary near minimum wage and no benefits. They make people fight for hours among themselves and if you log onto the shift picking website too late most hours are already taken and you can not eat for that week. Can fire loyal employees that have been with the company for years to replace them with incompetent new employees that they can pay much less at any time. "
bad,"A typical day is standing on your feet all day, no sort of compensation or benefits. Retail is not something that I enjoy doing it can be very stressful at times and also very time consuming."
bad,"Working for this company as a sale associate was not an easy task, management was very disorganized in my specific store and would go against each other for what they wanted their associates to do. Hours were sporadic and awful, the newer employees got more hours than the longstanding ones, (and it appeared that the associates who did not work very hard got the most hours). "
bad,"My experience was horrible working there. The employee you work with talk about each others behind their back about personal experience and argue with other about their outside life. Employee think they are your boss and tell you the supervisor states you to this and that, once there is a mistake you are the one being blame."
bad,"long story short, ive been lied to about advancement opportunities, been there over a year and just found out my position isn't eligible for a raise, and I cant change positions"
bad,"Macy's provides flexible hours which is a plus if you are currently going through school. You are able to pick up and swap shifts at any time through a website that you can use to conveniently check your schedule. That's pretty much the only good thing I have to say about working here. "
bad,"It was an okay job. The pay was horrible. Very low and you could get fired if you didn't persuade enough people to sign up for a Macy's card. The management was nice enough but breaks were short and it was boring. Overall, I wouldn't work anywhere like this again but it was a decent enough job if you're in high school."
bad,"The hours are short to save the company money but still expected to do full time responsibilities."
bad,"Overall experience was not pleasant.  The management team was ""out of sync"" due to restructuring.  Departments were not functioning up to par because of lack of experience and lack of training."
bad,great coworkers and discounts. Pushy sales and stress on the job. Great job if you are looking for something throughout the holidays.
bad,"Expected to sign up every customer for a credit card. Super untrustworthy credit company. Management is just as unhappy as sales, but not allowed to show it. 100% about the customer, 0% about the employee. You get to dress well, though."
bad,"Macy's has a great philosophy of 'team work' .  The pace is good/busy.  The management is deficient, very reactive.  This creates an environment of chaos.  I am ready to move forward."
bad,horrible place to work. very unprofessional. not satisfied with the treatment given to employees. unfair treatment. a little bit of favortism
bad,I enjoyed the opportunity of getting to meet new people. I enjoy being able to assist guest/customer with everyday needs. I loved working with my co-workers!
bad,never know what you are doing rules changes every day hours of work is odd and they want you to work all the time you work all holidays even on Christmas eve
bad,hour are not so great and the pay not great either but other than that its an ok enviorment and some managers work with you. you learn a lot and great coworkers nice part time job.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Everything is all about getting people to sign up for the credit card. NO SERVICE JUST THE CARD. FUN FAR AWAY FROM MACYS. This job is better for the younger people who are just starting out.
bad,"Overall I liked working with the customer's, associates and my peers. I observe my associate on their customer service and selling skill in order to give fast feed back and redirecting to the correct behaviors. what I've learned is to be a lot more patience's, most of my co-worker had make it enjoyable going to work and some was good at what we did but the most enjoyable part of the job was indeed analyses and resolving any customer issue to making sure they had a wonderful experience."
bad,overall i love the company but the hours and the pay they give is not worth it they work you like a slave and still expect more of you and the the pay is just not worth working your butt off for
bad,"Your day would start by opening your area registers, organizing and straightening the area, have morning meeting with entire store as managers go over the previous days sales, declines, customer feed back, ways to improve or better productivity for the days sales."
bad,"i'd open the register in my assigned department. "
bad,No work / life balance. Management in every store is incompetent.
bad,"N Goodenvironment, not so good coworkers, I enjoyed working there and they have good quality food and amazing chefs"
bad,"Macy's is a great place to shop at but worst place to work. They start with a minimum pay and new employess are over burdened with closing shifts, cleaning and maintaining the sales floor. "
bad,"Maintenance of the appearance of the Clinique counter. "
bad,"Management only cared about sales never the employees, employees fought for sales , being ferocious to the newer employees."
bad,The management team to start off with was never around to assist associate or customers. Favoritism is definitely a big problem in that store. Associate did get along because of that sometimes. Some associates didn't wear proper uniform and nothing was said to them and the pay isn't worth it
bad,Management issues. They would offer very few hours and then would take the hours you were scheduled for and give them to a full time position
bad,"Sales associates took on role of manager. Under paid, horrible teamwork and no motivation."
bad,"Selling to customers and opening credit cards"
bad,"The ""executive team"" is TERRIBLE! One particular manager takes her job ENTIRELY too seriously. They treat their employees pretty bad and in addition they do not believe in ""family"" or ""work life"" balance as they pretend. "
bad,"it can solve immediate financial problems, but it will consume your free time.  advancements are unpredictable and not always by merit.  expectations are unreasonable and additional responsibilities are not rewarded financially.  Management disconnected from those they manage, the higher the management, the more disconnected."
bad,"Really didn't enjoy working for Macy's. Managers were not so great, overall environment was okay, but I wouldn't want to work there again unless I really had to."
bad,"long hrs of walking, late lunches its unfortunate you must know someone of high ranking to be promoted, close knit family of employess must earn your right or else they find a way to terminate yoy"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Working to get cloths ready to buy.Time management co-workers have the same goals to meet stander good service.  How to prepared your work orders.  They are goal orientated. able to shop in your own store where you work at.
bad,"Macy's is a great to work because the scheduling is very flexible. And they hire anybody. I really liked most of my co-workers, though. The best part of the job were the customers who were truly appreciative of the service you gave them. That's the only good thing i have to say about that place. I didn't learn/know what I didn't already know or what it couldn't take a chimpanzee to learn. Your training is just on how to use the register, and its only the basics. So if you make a mistake (small or big) its your fault even though they didn't teach you what you made a mistake on. You get worked like a slave. You're expected to do your job, plus everybody else's, with no thank you's, no recognition, no pat on the back, nothing. They fire people for any little thing. Management leaves a lot to be desired of a person of authority. They play favorites with associates, they look the other way when those associates do something wrong, and if you're not one of the favorites, you're pretty much on the s**t lists of those managers. The particular store I worked at, you CANNOT join a union, because if you do you'll be fired. So they can pretty much make you do anything in the store, work long hours, not let you take breaks, anything. (Which actually happens there on a daily basis.) I don't want to get long-winded, so i'll just leave it at that."
bad,"Workload is to high for what they pay. "
bad,"Macys is horrible place to work. oo many changes that i HAD to adjust to that were only to the benefit of MACYS, never in my favor"
bad,"The facility has seen 3 different Facility Vice Presidents in 5 years.  The turnover in directors has been more dynamic.  The unusual turnover in executive could account for the number of managers that demonstrate unprofessional behavior.  The best part of the Portland TN Macys Logistic Fulfillment Center, is the training that can be documented for job hunting for more quality companies, and the employee discounts for the Macys stores."
bad,during this time i was senior in college and I made sure the HR knew that. she couldn't help but read off a script on how the company only allowed a maximum to pay me.
bad,worked in retail enviroment. worked polo mens section of store.
bad,"long days, refused days requested off, ridiculous hours for being open, no job advancement, management plays favorites. Being forced to sell credit and be pushy about it"
bad,"This department of the Macy's store is responsible for protecting the assets of the company and minimizing the dollar amount of losses from thieves who prey on all stores throughout the country. A typical day at work for me will be to stand at an exit door and observe people who enter and exit that may be exhibiting any suspicious behavior leading me to suspect them of being shoplifters. Another important reason for me being at the exit door is to remove electronic devices that may have been left on merchandise by the cashiers. My job title is Visual Surveillance Officer and that is exactly what I do. If I observe any suspicious behavior, I immediately report it to our team in the CCTV room and they will continue the surveillance of the subject/s in question. I learned to pick up on the behavior of potential shoplifters who will be looking around, up, and down, for surveillance cameras, They usually have fast, darting eyes and are not particularly paying attention to the merchandise they are handling. My co-workers were all on point with the same tasks as well. The hardest part of the job is when you are watching somebody you think is acting suspiciously and they go behind a sign or column and you lose visibility of their movements and actions. I would say the most enjoyable part of my job is when there are no shoplifters arrested because that lets me know that the entire Loss Prevention Team was on top of their game and we protected Macys assets."
bad,"The dress code was drab and boring: black pants with a black top and black shoes. Felt like I was going to work in a funeral home not a department store. "
bad,"Employees work on commission and growth, positive reviews and pay raises are based on how many charge accounts you open, not sales, not attendance, not anything that really matters."
bad,"You are expected to be on the phone from the moment you arrive until it is time to leave. Breaks are planned for you, so you better not have a toilet need that doesn't coincide with your break.  Metrics are hard to reach and keep reaching. Morale is low and the company doesn't care if you are stressed. Worked in 3 different departments over a 7 1/2 year span but never really advanced.  High turnover. Pay was steady."
bad,"Have no comment at all."
bad,Macy's is by far the worst place i have worked they refuse to accommodate for school my manager was really unprofessional the hours were bad and i worked my butt off to receive a paycheck that was barely 200 dollars at times.
bad,"I worked at Macys for 15 months and i never really felt like the company really appreciated not just my work but the work of all of the people that ran the building. They bragged that it was a ""100 Million dollar store"" but its employees never would have known that. A typical day of work was 6am to 2pm, I learned how life in retail is (price points, mark down, merchandising, floor moves) but by far the best part was when i would get lucky enough for a customer to ask me help them bring something to their vehicles, the fresh air and conversation is always enjoyable."
bad,"One's experience with Macy's will be dependent on the store and its management. It's a mediocre culture with very mediocre sales managers---mostly very young and inexperienced in managing.  The MAJOR focused of management is for employees to open Macy credit cards, called ""Loyalty"" --you will be pushed everyday to open accounts and it is the primary measurement of an employee, plus making daily sales quotas (which can be hard to achieve depending customer traffic and where you work).  Customers, especially during holidays, are 80% horrible --tossing merchandise, unfolding clothes and dropping them on racks or the floor--leaving fitting rooms a mess.  Your job is to pick-up after them like a maid.  Most employees cannot work enough hours to get benefits; pay sucks; don't expect much if any positive recognition. I'm sorry for people who really need a job like this. Macy's could do better, they just don't seem to want to do so. Macy's will NEVER be a high quality store without a change in attitude re its people and setting a culture of caring."
bad,"Not very friendly work environment, poor management, no room to grow, didn't allow much job/life balance."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Lunch room always consist of friendly employees. Goals are some what reasonable but always lack on floor managers
bad,"I  worked at macys for almost a year as a full time commission sales associate and the pay is 8 times out of 10 minimum no matter how much you sell because of their return and ""price adjustment policy"".. The management shows favoritism to older employees and let them boss you around and mistreat you. Their also very gossipy about the associates during their meetings instead of focusing on resolving issues. The benefits are like riding a roller coaster, one minute you qualify and then the next two weeks you dont. They claim to be flexible but really they aren't because the ""computer"" makes the schedule, but you do get to advertise your shifts(give them to other associates) the only bad thing is if you get a shift that is too early or too late no one picks them up. Then you lose these attendance points they give you and if you have zero they'll fire you no matter how long you've been with the company or how well your doing. Also if you call out because your sick, you lose points too."
bad,Worked in the men's shoes helped customers and worked the register.
bad,Too much time spent setting up and taking down sale events that turned out to be the same events each week.  Micromanagement.
bad,not going to get into any details but i've learned a good deal from this company and will take that with me onto my next venture
bad,"Macy's Macon location is an excellent example of what's wrong with our country's largest retailers: credit solicitation is the almighty god above all, and everything else suffers. It is a small market location, so corporate gives little support. The incompetent managers are thus free to abuse associates as they choose - as long as they solicit credit apps (approved or not), any bad behavior is tolerated."
bad,Working for Macy's was an okay experience. I learned how to work with coworkers that don't do their part of the job or people that have bad attitudes(both coworkers and customers).  My favorite part of the job was helping customers find what they needed or just talking to them and learning about why they came in.
bad,"Like any other retail place, it's about customer services. However, for this Macy's location it's about sells, sells and more sells. Everyone has a goal to make and not a lot of people comes to Macy's unless it's something there that is not at another Macy's. The store needs major work done to it."
bad,"Sales Associate-As my title says, its a job and i got a paycheck every week. What is expected of you for near minimum wage is ridiculous, impossible sales goals, having to sign up customers for credit cards. "
bad,"I didnt find all of the emlpoyees to be nice, in my department they were okay but only a few. Managment wasnt too great either, I had a good department management but he went back to the east coast store, then are new manager wasnt really around too much. The job wasnt too hard, selling shoes were okay there were good customers and bad customers as in any retail job but its all how you deal with it. The enjoyable part about working for macys was it only being seasonal, and the weekly pay check. "
bad,A typical day at work for me I pick the batch that I want and I start picking or sometimes I had to put items on the shelves clean the warehouse. I learned how to pick and train people in a fast pace the management was great they work with  u. The people I worked with was friendly and the hardest part of the was my first day The most enjoyable part was lunch.
bad,I only took this job cause I needed a job and the money. Recently I have had my hours cut for no reason told to me. Management needs alot of help and possible training. Co-workers are lazy and are just looking to finish the job and go home. Hardest part of the job would be the constant heavy lifting but the good thing is the customers. Love meeting new people and conversating with all customers.
bad,"loved the store and my peers, can expect to work hard, but don't expect to get paid a lot or get your hard work recognized, have to have sales manager experience with Macy's to move ahead, despite bringing tons of experience and hard work to the job."
bad,"I worked at Macy's during Christmas time only for few months. In general, I got chance to deal with customers. That was the best thing in this job."
bad,"When I first started to work there they didn't do a very good job at training. In fact you had to learn on the job and it's the worst thing when you have to learn on an important day (like a Wednesday with one day sales or Black Friday, etc.)"
bad,It was a non-organized work environment. The managers were never available for assistance.
bad,I would come into work and set up things to be moved out to the floors. If needed I would jump on a register and ring people out
bad,"If you want an awful retail job where over-aged dregs, with GED's stay with a company long enough to become management and then toss their authority around like they're big shots, going places, then this is the place for you to work. Between the scandals, love affairs and death threats over competing to keep sales goals, I've never been more offended to work anywhere in my life. I see no reason for this level of unprofessional behaviour. What kind of person brings a deer hunting knife with them to work in shoes? Their commission system is tricky to figure out. I hope this stores gets shut down."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Macy's doesnt think anyone has a life outside of the job. They want you to give your all and put your all into the store. Even if you get sick, death in the family, etc they will still deduct attendance points from you no matter what. Management is terrible."
bad,"Loved my job, but lack of communication made working hard. loved what i did and was sad to have to go"
bad,it was a fun place to work but the managment was not the greatest. i did learn a lot about how to help customers and make there experances with what i did for them great
bad,"had terrible management, terrible work environment. The people there were not friendly, they did not acknowledge you as often as should. tiny voice in a huge crowd of constantly moving people."
bad,"I did not enjoy working for Macy's. You are paid minimum wage unless you're a manager (which was difficult to become) and all your superiors cared about were your numbers. You had to sign customers up for credit cards and if you didn't do at least 2 per week you got yelled at. They encouraged lying to customers to close sales and if your resister numbers weren't high enough you got yelled at again. There is a high employee turnover rate there as a sales associate and for good reason. Its just not a great place to work. The only redeeming quality about working there is you get a 20% employee discount, however, you can't share it with your family or friends because they consider it stealing and you will get fired if they catch you...which they will because security monitors all employee purchases."
bad,"Very driven for numbers, in doing so , the company has left the customer at the door. Instead on building relationships with new customers, and expanding client base, it seemed as if the only thing that was important was getting people to use the macys credit card. the co workers are fine, although the disciplinary actions are backwards, by far the most unjust. staffing was usually always short in areas needed most, and too many in areas not needed. a typical day consisted of battling with the managers every half hour or so about how many credit applications we had. swamped by clothes that were overflowing out of the fitting rooms because we had no one to keep on top of them. overall, i believe that this company has qualities that could make or brake how long they stay in the game."
bad,The hardest part of the job was working in one of the busiest departments by myself most of the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.
bad,company is ok to work for but the management treats you poorly and when you come with a problem they do nothing about it or tell you to just deal with it
bad,"I worked at Macy's in order to pay off some of my school loans. The Macy's I worked at was in Houston, Texas and I really enjoyed working with such a diverse comunity. I learned how to controll out of controll circumstances and peacfully establish order. I also learned proper customer relation etiquite."
bad,One of the biggest issue is (they will never give you a schedule that will help you to take classes) they don't care about you school nor your personal life.
bad,"The only thing I like about this place is the diversity about the customers.. I got to meet and serve people from different countries which was fun. You cant see yourself building a future career with 20 cents raise every 6 months.. I laughed when i saw my 20c raise!! You have to deal with the point system if you are 10 mn late you loose 1 point from fri-sun.. You cant get sick which is crazy... I was one of the top sellers and i was diagnosed with kidney disorder which put me to bed for 2 days and that made me loose 4 points since I was absent. the 3th day I was standing up on painkillers and my manager has no sympathy at all so she terminated me for having 0 point. I would have fought it in court but i thought that wasnt worth it. you do so much for a little money, Stocking, cleaning, keeping an eye on shoplifters, booking people everymonth cos of events, organizing stock room, and Have to open credit card and ask every customer and the reward was unbelievable lol after opening 3 credit cards that day I was rewarded with 99c cup cake!!! manager was an ignorant unprofessional individual, talking negative about my coworker to another coworker.. if she favorizes you, your points will get fixed, you ll get vacation with no problems and instead of a cup cake i got, you ll get a macys money or a perfume of ur choice from the goody bag!! I wasnt helped when i asked for a transfer to another counter, I wasnt apreciated when my score card was never below 92 percent if not 100 percent.. I m glad I was terminated cos they dont deserve hard workers like me to put up with all that."
bad,"They didn't take the time to get to know me at all! I never met my manager, even though I insisted upon it. Everything was done via internet."
bad,"Typical day would consist of coming in bright and early making sure the floor is clean, chairs are in place, stock is stocked and overall floor is organized. customers zoom in and out with my assistance with shoes and directions to other floors. Providing customers with great customer service allowing them to experience the magic of Macy's. I've learned a lot about retail and top management."
bad,Poor training and poor management. Some days I was the only
bad,"A typical day is to come in early (4 hours before the store opens) and sign and set the sale, sometimes you work by yourself or you have someone to help you with your section, some days its boring and some days it gets really stressful when theres a sale."
bad,"This company does not value older employees, nor is there compassion for the employee a person. In addition, hourly employees are considered expendable and are not valued. As a manager I was pressured to let go many of my older employees because they were not what Macy's saw as what they wanted as a representative."
bad,"I worked in the Macy's Starbucks and the first thing you need to know is that is not at the same as working for Starbucks. Although you do have to follow Starbucks recipes and standards, you are working for Macy's and must follow their employee policies. You do not get the same benefits as a Starbucks employee and you often do not have the same team work that you see in a Starbucks. If you work the opening or closing shift you are most often alone so it's hard to take a break. When Macy's has sales it gets extremely busy. There is a high level of employee turnover so you are often working with new people and that does make it a bit difficult to build a ""team"". It's minimum wage and small raise given only after a year. Most employees don't stay that long. It's a paycheck though, and depending on the season, you can get as little as 10 or as many as 39 hours. They rarely go over 40 hours because then they have to pay overtime. In the Starbucks you do get tips. Sometimes they're good and sometimes you will make about $2 in a 6 hour shift. If you go in not expecting much, you won't be disappointed."
bad,Slow days fast weekends. Pay is minimum wage.Co-workers are friendly and helpful. Management doesn't bother you and will help when needed. I've leaner cash handling.
bad,"Someone with great ambition will find it difficult to work here. Although I am one of the few who has moved up through the ranks, the corporate advancement opportunities from store level seem almost non-existent. The tasks can be tedious and the workload impossible without having adequate staffing, but co-workers become family. Ultimately, you might have to choose between pursuing your ambitions elsewhere or staying in your ""comfort zone""."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Unreachable sales goals. It hard to sale with today's economy and can not force a customer to purchase items they do not wish to buy. Also, with todays economy people do not want to open new credit cards. Management is unknowledgeable and unwilling to help when needed. This is only knowledge I have at the River Oaks Store. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers."
bad,"Though they have a new GM, the Kailua-Kona, HI Macy's is very ""shoot from the hip"" when it comes to management and following Policy & Procedure. The HR Department is run with priority on nepotism and not qualifications or merit of any kind. Any accusation made against a favored employee or made against a manager is met by hostile treatment and unkept promises to look into matter. My personal experience after being interviewed in the Spring and a manager asking a inappropriate question, resulted in me filing a complaint with Macy's HQ. The response was 5 managers had negative assessments of me from my work during holiday season. The thing is, there were not even 4 managers in the whole store to ask, so 5 managers did not exist. I had received positive review of my work when I completed it Christmas Eve, yet they circled their wagons and said the opposite when I made an accusation against a then manager, who now works as an Associate in Housewares. They allow a few people to dictate how store is run and also wait until GM is away from store to run it their way."
bad,it sucks i get no hours ..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
bad,"the supervisor was always ordering us around while she texted on her cell phone in the fitting room, the scheduals were all the place, i could not have a day of work without them changing my time. i had a second supervisor who told me to go home because they only wanted two people working in the department, i was upset because i really needed my hours since they were always cutting me off."
bad,"I found my time there to be frustrating due to a lack of manager availability  and involvement. There was also a gross lack of comprehensive training and continuity. For example, while we were instructed to do a task a very specific way, the tools or training required to do so were not made available or were so delayed in delivery that it was rendered useless and pointless. The direct managers, while caring and friendly, were stretched so thin by upper management, we were lucky to have 5 uninterrupted minutes with them per week. This made training and goal assessment near impossible."
bad,"Vacation is very nice as a manager with Macy’s, starts off with 4 weeks and a comp week for all the time we work for the holidays, however now that’s about the only great thing about Macy’s. You will make more money coming from an outside company vs rising through the ranks (as I did) and come every January/ February you have to worry about what cuts will be made and what stores will be shutting their doors. Unfortunately the training is very inadequate and pay is not competitive at the sales associate level. Communication is confusing, feeling as though the overall direction the company is going changes constantly. Senior managers (store and assistant store managers) are sometimes great! And often times not great, and that tends to drive more people away than the company as a whole. There is no work life balance and as a manager you are expected to answer and respond to phone calls, text, and emails while off, or on vacation, little to no respect for personal life. Ive learned several things with my career at macys and value that experience, however at this point there does not seem to be much longevity left within the company."
bad,"Transparency: I was a full time sales associate that has been recognized for reaching my daily sales goal as well as the amount of credit cards I open weekly. There was an incident in the summer when my grandpa passed away (outside of the US). My grandpa raised me so he is a father figure to me. I talked to HR that I couldn't work for a month as I will have to travel out of country to be with my family at this time. HR could've easily have said that I wouldn't be able to leave for a whole month and I would've understood but instead, they had me fill out a leave of absence which means I will still have employee status while on leave. Once I came back from my leave, I received a mail stating that I was terminated because I didn't work for a number of days. Why didn't HR just tell me that I would be terminated for leaving for x amount of days? It's not like I am going on vacation. I wished they would've been more transparent with their employees."
bad,"Four ten hr shifts three days off. Overtime available during holidays. I loved the people I worked with, but unfortunately managment wasn't doing their jobs like they should."
bad,"I was subject to race discrimination. "
bad,Upper management great. Mid management require more inclusion training. Level employees    are expenable at cost per mid management merely securing there position.
bad,"Macy's is just like any other retailer where they can't really keep up with general shift of the job market. They're losing customers to online shoppers. The customer service is okay, but the store is so understaffed that it's difficult for customers to enjoy their shopping experience because of the look of the store. "
bad,"This was another seasonal job. I did appreciate hearing back from someone in a timely manner, but I was disappointed in the pay. Macy’s is an expensive place, so to be paid 11.50/hour was not the best. Having to be trained via a computer didn’t help much as I was placed in areas I knew nothing about, but I did get some help. Flexibility was okay"
bad,Poor communication between management. Minimum wage for part-time positions is not enough to support oneself even with a weekly paycheck. Store manager has a poor attitude as well so there it's not possible to feel comfortable in that environment.
bad,"Discounts are just 20% for employees must use your Amex card,lots of bad attitude from coworkers very uncomfortable environment since nobody trust anybody, no organized at all! "
bad,"It’s a good place to work but they have enough opportunities for growth."
bad,"It was a holiday position that turned into a permanent position. However after the holiday season my hours were cut back to maybe 3 hours a week. Inconsistent hours, have to come in on short notice, & working 4 hours on the weekends."
bad,"Powerful company that knows there is always someone available to replace you. So rewards, benefits, reassurance, pride and compensation aren't that obtainable. It's an amazing job if you do it for a while and move up or find something better."
bad,"If you need a job and are just starting out its a great place to be in you don't support yourself. Pay is minimum wage but in certain departments commission is available. Management is usually very poor in multiple locations. But you do learn a lot about retail, cash handling, recovery, point of sale systems, and communication skills with approaching people about credit cards."
bad,I enjoyed my DMI and other district leaders. Store level Assistant AP manager and AP manager of ops were both giving different orders to APDs. They constantly barked orders at you. You would do them and get yelled at by the other manager. AAPM would come to work smelling like weed. I can deal with difficult co workers however it's not worth the 12.50.  An hour
bad,"Macy's warehouse management needs improvement, but it's already a sinking ship.  Stay away from this company."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Management is lacking in many departments and in many ways. Can be very unprofessional even with ""experienced"" managers which is disheartening even if this is retail. The hardest part would be the favoritism between managers and certain colleagues to the point where it seemed we were as dramatic as high schoolers. The best way to navigate was to clock in and clock out quietly, do not make any friendly acquaintances within coworkers, do your work and don't ""steal customers."""
bad,"Sometimes the job can be demanding. We process a lot of merchandise. A lot of the time we work over our shift's end to complete the processing. It's an overnight shift which is not for everybody. The relationships between managers and employees needs improvement. That's the biggest flaw. It's an okay place to work for the most part, but not the best. On the plus side you learn a lot about clothes, and how processing keeps the store functioning. I feel we should be paid more based on the support we give the store. Our role is important, and needs to be recognized as such."
bad,You will be given way more than you can accomplish.They will micromanage you to death! My new managers DID NOT support me at all !!! Benefits are good but they try to talk you out of taking your PTO and then refuse you the next try.
bad,"Whoever is in charge of the budget isn’t  delegating funds fairly, at all. Break room doesn’t even have basic necessities. Managers get food at every meeting. The managers are rewarded with outings to fun events and nice restaurants whereas the associates, who work the holidays, might get chips and a soda (if it’s in the budget). The managers undercut the hire on pay so they can receive a bonus. Something is screwy here."
bad,"Expectation high vs ability to succeed"
bad,"Being a sale's associate for Macy's was my first job, and there isn't really much to say about it. You're pretty much behind a register most of the time checking out customer's or helping them make payments on their Macy's credit card. (Something they want their employees to push heavily). It's exactly what you would think. When you're not at the register, you're doing go-backs or refolding clothing displays that were rummaged through by shoppers. There's really nothing special about it. You can practically feel the monotonous ooze of corporate retail seeping through the walls. There is a large structure of management, but no way I could tell you how it works, I barely knew who my supervisor was half the time. You just kind of feel like a robot here. You walk in, dressed in casual business attire, clock-in at a register, and hope no one important notices the hopeless look of boredom in your dreary eyes. I'm sure there are some positions at Macy's that are more rewarding or involved, but I wouldn't wish sales associate on anyone."
bad,"It was fun dealing with all of the different products and clothing companies. You learn a lot about fashion, and retail in general. They are skills that I will never forget, and working retail is something everyone should do at least once. The culture was good, people were nice, and easy going. The hardest part of the job was not ever being told that you are doing well at your job from the managers, and being unappreciated. Also, dealing with rude customers was also not fun. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to dress nice, and put in hard work dealing with clothes and shoes (Very fun), also being independent in the job was nice."
bad,"All Macy’s cared about was their credit cards, Always low staffed. Managers were lazy, or abusive, call outs ridiculous, district team was rude and abusive"
bad,Very judgemental about everything you do.  Co- workers were great.  Management half assed everything and blame for everything.  Jump conclusions to everything
bad,"Favorites employee,  preferences over groups and always pushing you to reach time crunches.  Feeling unwanted and that I could be easily replaced.  But the other employees are great"
bad,Its was ok place to work you could work around your schedule you could always advertise a shift if you weren't able to work it.It had great deals and discounts Just make sure you are available for nights and weekends.
bad,"They start you with not even the minimum wage, they dont teach you enough , but they would demand you so much . Credit is a most ..meaning you need to open credit cards for the store daily if you dont you are in trouble and it would affect your review and your salary for an ""increase your wage ""for a few cents. Paramus is the worst after the new manager treat people like slaves"
bad,You start work at 6am. You have to sign your whole department. Example: Change all the price signs in the mens department and then add show prices on 30 different pairs of men shoes. All by 10am.
bad,"Your everyday employment experience will depend heavily on how compent the most senior local manager is.... if they are able to defect and fully comunicate the often misguided operational plans are, the better for you. But even if you luck out there. Dont expect to be paid well or rewarded for going the extra mile other than a handclap during the morning startup meetings."
bad,"A typical day would be greeting customers, showcasing jewelry, and maintaining a log of the diamonds. I learned how to be fast on my feet in busy situations. Management was awful with constant turnover. The workplace culture was demoralizing. The hardest part of the job was being the only person working the fine jewelry section at most times."
bad,Some of the supervisors are sneaky and do not do their job effectively. Some of the supervisors even get upset and will try to sabatoge you if your work is satisfactory making them have to work harder. Some of the supervisors become highly upset when they feel their seats are being jeopardized due to the supervisors not supervising the store properly .
bad,"They would schedule me a day or two each week. The shifts were only 6 hours so I didn’t make much. It was more of a second job not a primary job. Overall, it was an ok experience but I would have preferred not to experience it had I known I would not profit from this job."
bad,"There's always something to do,  you must open credits every week if you don't they get on you. My boss complain to me about my attendance , I don't recommend no one work there it sucks the hours suck to."
bad,If you're looking for a place to advance based of work ethic and speed/skills look elsewhere. Its not what you know but who you know at Macys. My fingrers hurt every day as they work the heck out of you. Decrease people from layoffs and increase your workload.
bad,At first is was fun and easy and work with everyone because everyone communicated. But once you work there for long periods of time the communication dies between workers and manager. They don’t work with you on anything and they over work you for little pay.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Working in the back of the house, you're pretty much a no one. The sales associates don't respect you. Management doesn't respect you or people who work on different floors.  Someone stole from me and I had proof who did it. I told management and was told ""well look into it"". Let's just say the employee still works there. I also caught a severe allergic reaction while at work one time and instead of calling 911 they called security, which took 15 minutes to get there and then had them call 911. As I was struggling to catch my breath the security guard keep asking me questions and offered me a ice pack to help with my anaphylaxis. Let's just say I had a horrible experience working here and would never recommend it to anyone else."
bad,"Depending of your job title you can be ringing customer up on the register, offering Macy's cards or in the fitting room sorting clothes, running them to the sales floor assisting customers with sizes and helping them find merchandise. I learned how to run rods, offer and open up Macy's credit cards, and how to professionally interact with customers. Management was terrible, they are constantly stressing and pushing for you to bring down the amount of rods which some times range from 20-30 with one person in the fitting room sorting and one person actually bringing the merchandise back to the floor. They set unrealistic daily goals and when those goals are not being reached people are penalized. Managers here do not work, they walk the floor all shift long expecting and complaining. When goals need to be reached and we are short in staff everyone should be working together to reach those goals including management."
bad,"There are so many reasons I would say not to work here. The biggest one? Their BOPS (Buy Online Pickup in Store) is a daily recipe for disaster. The tracking in-store is horrendous...nothing is centralized...they do a poor job of managing customer expectations and an even worse job at supporting their employees."
bad,"Levelism, and bias issues. Too often your training depends on who likes you. Immature behavior from hiring a lot of early 20s workers who like to exclude others and believe it is cool to be rude and have a bad temper."
bad,Needs to be less hostility towards one another. Would be much better if there was much more communication being done amongst each other. More accountability and responsibility would be nice.
bad,"I was asset protection for this company. I researched this company well before I interviewed for it, I read that the AP's were paid 29,000 yearly. They barely paid me 12.00 an hour which was 4 dollars less than what I was making at another big box store I worked for (I had a proven track record of saving my last company over 80,000 yearly). The management (both the store as well as AP) were more of micro managers than the real deal. The store manger is known for putting her associates down in front of both fellow employees as well as customers. During my 3 months+ I did not put 100% effort because of the danger that is involved and the fact that they did not have a well organized plan in action for stopping shoplifters, my life is worth more than 12.00 an hour with a measly .15 raise here and there. They wanted high statistics but were paying a minimal amount (you get what you pay for). I verbally gave my manager a heads up after about a month that I was going to persue other employment opportunities elsewhere. He clearly stated that even he did not like the job (Im not sure if he even works there any longer). I use to love giving macys my money, however, I have not shopped there for the past 8+ months because of how the employees are treated and the new outlook I have on this company:( I could have managed this company with my eyes closed better than the store manager does. Macys needs to go in and clean house with this store!"
bad,"A typical day of work included greeting customers and helping them decide on a purchase, answering calls, gathering fulfillment for online purchases, organizing merchandise, working at the register"
bad,This is probably the first big company I ever worked for. Dipping your toes here will gaurentee you getting bit by a shark. I have been disrespected and reprimanded in front of customers by my manager. Manager refuses to be hands on and is unwilling to help assist lines or be helpful with costumer grievances. I have reported to HR they swept it under the rug just like all the other employees that complained. Easy job to get. Direct deposit every week is great too. But not worth the amount of stress. Look further into other companies if you can.
bad,I did not have a good experience working at Macy's. I was hired as a part-time sales associate. Our department lacked staff (I was one of 3 permanent employees...for a whole department). Constantly being called in because there was always a shortage of employees. Not paid well for the work you're doing. We were basically running a whole floor with no help from management. The employees I worked with were dramatic and catty.
bad,"Great fellow employees at the local level."
bad,"Macy's is a fast paced and competitive place to work. If you like working in the mall environment, this is the job for you. Retailed jobs are great for a first time job."
bad,Just try something different.. they should be out of business in a year or so.. I counted the days until my service was completed......................
bad,The location that I worked at was understaffed and was never maintained properly. Every single z-rod (60 plus) in the store is filled with recovery of which is not handled properly on a daily basis. This in turn makes it impossible to process trailers as new merchandise arrives. This chaos has been going on for over a year now.
bad,"Company is poorly run and has little regard for individuals. Minimum wage with highly paid expectations. Employees are treated not as adults-but talked down to. Equipment is poorly maintained and hazardous. Storerooms are overcrowded and dangerous. A serious accident is a threat in the workplace. Emergency exits are frequently blocked or obstructed. "
bad,Manager's play favorites. Extremely stressful to constantly ask for credit card applications. Ridiculous to have quotas on everything. No room for advancement.  They can drop you from full time to part time at anytime due to lack of customer traffic.
bad,"All about sales, credit apps being opened, customer service, and being the best store out of all the Macy’s. Always trying to improve their ratings and reviews."
bad,"I  enjoy it was fun and help me to pay the bill I learn to do new thing the hardest part it was to wake up early in the morning. workplace culture was ok, the most enjoyable part of the job was to buy clothing."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,It was Bering awkward and boring there at the time I enjoyed it a few times made a few friends I’m going to grow because I know I can do so much better
bad,"No hours unless seasonal work or if you're full time. Full time staff have to work 6 days, just to get 40 hrs - still may come up short. Other than that, sometimes only have 10 hrs or less in a week. Pay is really low for all the work you do."
bad,Employees work together as a team and always willing to assist one another whenever needed.  No transparency.  Management is most concerned about saving themselves.  Not a teams win environment as portrayed.
bad,"Most of the time this job was enjoyable. I met new people, lots of customers, The most enjoyable part was working with other people instead of by myself."
bad,"Working at Macy's is ok if you are desperate for money. The starting pay is around $11.25/hr. Each position you are on your feet the entire 10 hour shift except for a measly 30 minutes when you are on your lunch break. In ICQA, its first come first serve on their small rolling chairs. Most management would prefer for you to not communicate with other people and just do the work. Because of the long hours, you don't really get a lot of down time at home, unless you work part time. Work, get home, eat shower, sleep and repeat."
bad,"I worked at Macy’s for 4 years or so. The environment changed over the years with new management. It was a very positive, carefree environment when I started, but changed when new management stepped in my last year of employment there. Nepotism became quite common and there was a lot of unprofessionalism in the department (i.e. unnecessary gossip and rumors being spread). In the end, they decided for me that the part-time job I was working became too much of a “conflict” for them and I had to resign. No skin off my back, I work in a very pleasant environment that’s very work-focused now, rather than fueled by gossip and negativity. It was a relief to be done working at Macy’s finally. I’m sure this differs from store to store, but the overall toxicity was a direct reflection of poor management and your average, often entry-level employees being taken advantage of and constantly put down for trying to improve work morale, fighting for better pay, and trying to hold management accountable. Amazing, wonderful employees who went above and beyond were always treated as subordinates and never recognized, but always punished instead by upper management. When layoff season came around, often times, people who were already financially struggling were given the boot. No compassion whatsoever."
bad,"Do not work at Macy's! At least not in the Receiving department. I have worked at two different stores and have been harassed by the men both times. The first store in 2017, one of the men on the receiving dock began harassing me the first week i was there. The second store I started in 2018, they play vulgar rap music during the shift. Only r&b music is played if the vulgar stuff isnt. It is a racially intimidating environment if you are white. I dont know if the front if the store work is better, but stay away from receiving. LOW CLASS environment!"
bad,"It was a basic experience but I like working retail and I enjoyed working there for the most part  the  head of hr was really rude and unpleasant and managers arent very helpful only when they want you to work more hours for them will they seem nice the job it self was pretty easy ring customers, recover the floor clean fitting"
bad,None at all I just would recommend the cottman ave location for security but other than that the sales associates and management of the store are all chill
bad,"- you don’t get paid much, even working overtime constantly doesn’t help your paycheck "
bad,"You work 10 hours shifts, no benefits and they expect you to know everything within 2 days working there, horrible management and favoritism is pretty obvious."
bad,"I was hired for a Seasonal Cash Register Clerk.  I ended up doing mostly sales working under a full time employees number so they got the credit for the sales."
bad,"Was not my favorite place to work.  Unfulfilled promises, unstable position (restructuring and job eliminations), cut throat store management, district leadership was promoted based on tenure as opposed to abilities and qualifications"
bad,Macy’s didn’t give me the chance to grow. I wanted to continue and show them what I can offer however they didn’t give me the chance. They promote within their circle of people
bad,"A typical day involves hitting the ground running. One must know how to deal with people with addictions in the work place.Slowness and lack of support are common among management along with gross preferential treatment of employees based upon race, gender, or creed. However, the most enjoyable part of the job are the people you directly work with: Diversity is encouraged in the workplace."
bad,Management changed a lot but so did the position I was in there were good managers and some only okay managers the pay is really low for all the expensive things you sell the only commission departments are luggage and shoes and some of the cosmetic companies do commission through the company and not through macys
bad,"Hours are long 12 a day, and don't work with my college schedule very i asked for one day off because the 12 hours 3 day and maybe once a month i will only work the days a week when  school is in that means i have to make sure when i come in from work on the weekends that i have no test or papers do on Sunday or Monday or i am up all night studying. Well breaks are 15 minutes X 2 and a 30 minute lunch  but am glad I have a job."
bad,"Great company to work for and i would recommend it to anyone that loves, sales/retail/business development. the pay is great and with some great benefits."
bad,"I really liked the store and most of my co workers. I was in a support role, so I wasn't on the sales floor. From what I could tell there was so much pressure to sign people up for credits associates often pressure customers into opening a credit card at a ridiculous interest rate. In my department I am not the ""favorite"".  I am part time and guaranteed a meager 12 hours a week, and some Flex or On call associates get more hours than I do and then call out. I am regularly corrected in front of other associates and even customers.  The hardest part of the job is the Attendance policies. It is a point system which is great for a 20 year old single person. for instance, if you or your child get sick you loose points no matter what. Unless you take a week off for a leave of absence. I know I can't afford to take a week because my son has the flu. The motto seems to be ""that's not my job"". There is no team work and the managers regularly berate you if you can't stay late or need to take a lunch break. I wanted so bad for this to work. But it just didn't."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Its been almost been a year since I've worked there and in that time I have had my position faded (they switched me to full-time when I applied for flex/part-time), my commision got cut (I was working draw commision mens suits and shoes I believe I got 6 or 7% of what I sold. When my commission got cut my collegues thought that was better than working off commission because when you work commission and do not sell enough you get into deficit, meaning you dont see your commission money coming though, but little did they know that my commission being cut did not mean a raise in my hourly pay so now I am making less than my previos job.) And lastly the entire mens floor is now just one dingular department and at one time theres only about 3 to 6 employees working at a time (on the entire mens floor) when there used to triple the amount. I've had a horrible experience at Macy's and they've made it clear that they don't care so long as you preform your job duties."
bad,Positions are being cut leaving more and more responsibility on the management team.  This is leading to the team having to pick up additional responsibilities and working more hours.
bad,"Brick and mortar is a dying breed, while Macys does a good job to stay above water the pressure is definitely on. Hours are long, the work never stops, and the expectation is to be complete in an ever changing workplace."
bad,"Business was always slow; however we were expected to sell credit cards to every client. "
bad,Though I enjoyed working the docks and working with the other employees. The big issues was the pay for what the job entailed and that they would not work around my college schedule
bad,Terrible management at the Macys I worked for. They promoted me quickly since I was one of the only people who did more than the bare minimum. I worked for the store manager who didn’t show any guidance once I was promoted. I was expected to preform right out of the gate when I was promoted and had no training. I had ridiculous sales goals every day that I could never meet no matter how hard I worked. My coworkers were very cut through and felt threatened by the newer people. No one could get along. Managers always pointed fingers and never took responsibility. They would push credit and it’s uncomfortable trying to persuade people to open a credit card. Overall hated the experience. The customers were the only pro
bad,"Retail stores are quickly becoming a feature of the past, and the remaining giants are under significant pressure to maintain profitability against the looming specter of online juggernauts such as Amazon."
bad,"The work is easy but never ends. Macys expects you to put clothes away, clean fitting rooms, help customers on the floor, fulfill online orders, and cash people out. The fitting room cleaning/go backs is too much for us to handle. Macys is always understaffed and with little help the job becomes overwhelming. The new people that get hired just end up quitting or stealing. No one is happy at this place, everyone complains and is miserable. Management doesn't listen to employees as they got rid of any managers that actually cared about staff. The store gets rearranged constantly because they can't figure out where to put anything. Macys is just fine with letting their employees be a walking mat for customers as well. Most managers will not stick up for you if a customer treats you badly over something that is out of your control (coupons, discounts, etc). For a ""high quality department store"" they're fine with paying associates less than Wal-Mart will."
bad,"As a newer employee I was looking forward to moving up in the company. My goal was to get hired into a permanent makeup counter, learn what it takes to be a counter manager, and take it from there. Counter managers see you more as competition than as team mates. Not to mention HR is only there a few times a week, and they do NOTHING to solve issues of bribery and verbal harassment from the counter manager."
bad,they put a lot of pressure on emplyees to make sales goals and credit goals it was really hard sometimes because we did not get a whole lot of business in our location
bad,Macy's is your typical retail job. Not the best experience you will have but you gain good insight and a lot of skills. It teaches you to be an overall better being.
bad,Enjoyed working with people. I mainly worked in the junior department so that was fun. I did not like the fact that it got so crazy during Christmas. I did like the hours...every third weekend I had off.
bad,"If you are looking for cattiness from "
bad,"Working! at Macy's was not a joy. Management is awful! From the start, this company does not support their teammates. You do not get the proper training."
bad,"It is an awful place to work. Employees are forced to meet insane deadlines. The conditions inside the warehouse are sweltering. People sometimes get taken away on medical carts that drive around."
bad,I was with Macys for almost 6 years. All they cared about was getting star rewards (credit cards) . It was to the point of harassment for associates and customers. You couldn't enjoy your job because managers will hound you every second about credit card applications.
bad,"Management was not the best. You were talked down to. It was like being in middle school. "
bad,"I stayed longer than most and I shouldn't have.  The work got harder and management didn't care, only about the numbers.  The full-time employees weren't very friendly; even gave new employees a hard time.  Very dirty place to work in.  I would not recommend this job to anyone."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"learned a lot working at macys, the workplace felt like high school. managers and employees weren't professional. most enjoyable was just talking and greeting new customers"
bad,I just loved working with the customers and my co workers. I loved being involved in my department which was young mens/active.to be able to dress the customers was the best part of the day
bad,"The work was hard not enough paid, if you didn't get schedule full time hours you couldn't get their insurance. The management keeps changing. I am no longer there."
bad,"You  just have to be careful of the store you decide to work for. Not alot of room for advancement, raises 1/per year, & management all over the place."
bad,I don't want to give a review of the Macy's company. They are restructuring their Human Resource department to be centralized and are continuously making changes.
bad,Macys was down sizing and consolidating regional offices into New York.  I saw the writing on the wall and left prior to loosing my position.  Just another retail move to save expense.  I get it.  I left Macys prior to the dissolve of the divisions.  I left on good terms and have no bad feelings.  I did what I needed to do to feed my family in the long term.
bad,"Working for Macy's made having a life and participating in my families life nearly impossible. Our schedules are made by a computer and we are not allowed to request off days that there are certain sales or events. You end up working nearly all weekends and holidays. That wasn't the worst part though. They pay is minimal, and when you live a city like San Diego, CA. You can't make ends meat on this money. "
bad,It was an okay work place but there was a lot of work for very little pay. You have to work nine hour shifts with an hour lunch. You have to make sure  you are working with a good team in LP or you will be all alone trying to arrest someone.
bad,Great opportunity to learn sales and meeting tourists. The appearance of the store was of high importance as well as sales. Management was able to execute tasks at hand
bad,"You can work as hard as you want to and Macy's will not recognize it in the form of raises.  At the start of a new year, after inventory is done, it does not matter your seniority. You can be laid off."
bad,"I was hired to be a Health and Wellness expert expecting to ""plan in store wellness events, conduct community outreach, as well as train and educate sales associates on  wellness products and services throughout the store"" as the job description states."
bad,"My days typically consisted of getting shoes from the stockroom and bringing them to the front for sales associates to bring to their customers. I was also responsible for bringing shoes back to their shelves in the back. This was done through scanning."
bad,Company is unstable - stores closing.  Stores are dingy.  Employees are not well paid.  Management is stressed.  I wouldn't run towards an offer from Macy's.
bad,"Great managers"
bad,"They offered me a job then put me Behind a register with only two days of some training BY MYSELF, after they told me I would NEVER be alone,PLUS,the job I applied for was not to be behind a register and when I asked they said it was only for me to learn how to use a register,after that I would be working on the floor organizing  merchandise and making the place look clean.Do not bother to apply if you want a job where you are going to enjoy,very stressful for minimum  wage."
bad,"Management makes whimsical decisions based upon personalities. Department managers are often ""in a meeting"" far away from the sales floor. It is often impossible to reach a manager for a decision when needed in reference to serving a waiting customer."
bad,"Pay is bad as a cosmetics flex ($9/hr) though I should have negotiated for higher pay when I started. Your experience is largely based on your manager and coworkers, so it is luck of the draw. I made some good friends here and had a nice manager when I started, however she was transferred and the manager who replaced her was the absolute worst person I've ever met. Like I said, its just luck who you end up with. All in all, find a better paying job.  The only pro is a nice discount in the store."
bad,"Managers were constantly moving around, so even when you had a good one they were moved to a different department or store very quickly and then often stuck with a newbie who didn't know what they were doing"
bad,Management is always full of drama and are like the mean girls in high school. They gossip about you and try to make you seem so small. They really need to work on separating their personal issues from work.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"assist customers and answer there questions on selections, put stock back on sales floor handle register, assist in training new associated by letting them shadow you."
bad,Macys is a good place to start a sale job at and has training.but has little to none room to move up due to the fact that they feel that you can be replace
bad,"your manager can make life great or absolutely awful, usually depending on their mood alone. it’s a dying store so everything is very disorganized-especially during the holidays."
bad,Macys can be a great a place to work but often favoritism becomes a huge roll and people who work hard are looked over because they are not a manager favorite.
bad,"Very poor management/leadership. Sales associates were often not informed of meetings nor given explicit instructions on their role for the day, then berated for not being active enough."
bad,I received little to no training. I had to learn everything on my own. The pay was terrible. I only met my supervisor once and that was just on my first day of work. There is no supervision at the location.
bad,"The coworkers are pleasant but executives who have been there for a while make the new ones feel stupid when your trying to learn "
bad,"Besides lack of hours, distance in travelling to work, Macy was a pretty okay place to work. However the pay did not equal to the job worked, especially around holiday seasons."
bad,You always have to work one step harder to prove that you are ready for promotion while making less money. Ones you become salary there’s no set time you spend at work.
bad,"Working at Macy's I didn't get to know any of my coworkers or the managers because the working environment was very robotic, mechanical, and impersonal. You clocked in by yourself, went to your department by yourself, prioritized menial tasks and did them by yourself, problem solved with customers by yourself. I'm independent and I enjoy working alone but this place made me feel like a corporate pawn and not a person. Also I worked seasonal so I could only pick up shifts if someone called out so I barely ever got a chance to work at all. The training was on a computer, scheduling yourself is on a computer, I don't understand how the work environment is supposed to support and foster a welcoming and comfortable environment for customers because it doesn't."
bad,Job is fun but communication with management is aweful. Visual manager often takes credit fgor your work and rarerly are you recognized for your work. Very little training and high turnover. Stressful environment and this is a physical job. Reviews are given but advancement is not usually given to current employees. If you want to be a manager I suggest going through the executive training program because that is the only way you will get into a Visual Manager role
bad,Extremely understaffed stores make for a difficult work environment.     They hire a lot of great talent only to lay most of them off at the beginning of each year. Lots of unrealistic expectations put on sales associates. You will be expected to do far more than your fair share of work and will not be appreciated for it. Store Manager is non-existent not supportive of their management team & sales associates. Employee discount was a nice perk but other stores offer them as well
bad,"This was a horrible job for me , management was overly rude and made me not want to come into work at all. I was questioned about taking 1 bathroom break in 4 hours as if it was abnormal would never work for macys again."
bad,"flexible schedule, poor management, little opportunity for advancement and growth, no job security, poor pay. Good benefits and paid time off. Poor communication"
bad,"Poor sales during the weekdays and busy during the weekends and holidays . "
bad,Competitive work environment with unsteady hours. The management team I worked with was heavily biased and associates would often steal commission and sales from other employees.
bad,"You stand around for hours bored out of your mind because customer s rarely come in. Your legs hurt, you are stressed. Management is rude to you. You have to do fulfillment and other physical labor work activities while wearing a suit. Bonus: they do not turn on the air until ten minutes prior to opening the store."
bad,Too many competing priorities. Lack of support to the stores environment.  Consistent yearly reduction of staffing. On call for issues all store hours.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Bridal was a bust. There was 0 direction provided and I was told that if I did not sign 20 new brides I would be fired. The manager ""acted"" supportive and apologetic for the statement but I found out that was her way to push because she actually received annual bonuses based on the success of the bridal department. They ended up eliminating the position but offered me a part time position."
bad,"No place for advancement, lack of communications, only good are the benefits, pay and raises are horrible, management was horrible, hire just about anybody just for the numbers"
bad,"The job was decent and pay was alright. The only complaint I have is for the management. "
bad,"Good seasonal job for the holiday season. Other than that I wouldn’t stay there full time, maybe part time but definitely not for very long. Great first job for young adults."
bad,"The company is going through many changes including minimal staffing. "
bad,In the position that I was in I had a ball except for when I was transferred to Virginia Beach. The company is downsizing so fast that I would not recommend this company if it is your only means of work.
bad,"Dramatic work environment. Many individuals cut throat and talk behind each others backs. Pressure to stay longer hours, skip days off without any appreciation."
bad,"Working here has been the least gratifying of any  job I've ever held. Most of the managers don't approach associates with proper respect and warmth. The company doesn't properly train to optimally help customers, which only stifles the greaating-to-transaction process."
bad,Company needs to reestablish the past uniform code and do stronger updated training for their managers. Becoming more informal and not having up to date leadership training for managers has had a negative effect on the company.
bad,"I suggest not working here. I was over worked and under paid i was threatened by one of my coworkers and they practice favoritism. No employee appreciation, i did have a good manager but its so little he can do when you have a crazy boss."
bad,loved the macys in flushing. most coworkers were really friendly and helpful. mangers were HORRIBLE. all they did was complained when they actually went on the floor. I was getting paid to sit around talk to coworkers. since the mangers were horrible no one really cared to do anything unless we would hear that they were walking around.
bad,I worked at Macys for few years. Loved it at first. Until they changed my hours to nights..Hated working nights. Because of this crazy world I didn't feel safe working at night.And also had to work 10 hours on truck day. Standing for 10 hours was very bad.
bad,"I have met some wonderful people at Macy's. The job was challenging and I looked forward to going in every day."
bad,"There is a lot of racial profiling, limitations on what you can do for yourself and for your customers. False promises about career advancement and integrity. Management plays favorites with associates . Very pushy on macys credit cards.  They always blame the associates for customer complaints when the associate was not in the wrong. Not supportive during natural disasters."
bad,It was a demanding job and always changing. Had to adapt to the change. Always learning new things. Had to always be very customer friendly. Customer was always first. Management always changed so u=you had to adopt to new culture. Technology was always upgrading so you had to learn. Went to training classes to keep up with the new systems.
bad,Management expects you to pester customers multiples times about selling product and each of our 3 different loyalty programs. It's an aggressive sales culture and you are punished for each customer opportunity that can not be met.
bad,Working for Macy's for over 5 years was challenging and overwhelmed. Manager tried to avoid your requests and basically putting you on your own to solve hard situation. Basically you end up to be a manager and customer service to assist customer and it was taking a salesperson off the floor to solve the situations so the customer will come back again to buy more.
bad,"This job is really the type of job if your looking to get a resume started and gain job experience.  Very small advancement, along with minimum wage.  Very long work days"
bad,Stressful work environment due to multiple organizational restructuring and employee layoffs in the last year. Lack of organizational clarity and direction.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"When I started, I loved my job, but there have been so many  changes and none of them are for the good.  I have lost 3/4 of my staff in the last 9 months due to downsizing, but none of the work."
bad,"Extremely busy and always loads of work.  Learned retail is so busy"
bad,"Although I have not been employed with this company for many years, I do remember enjoying the benefits of receiving the latest products behind the scenes before the general public had them. It was a fun and vibrant department to work for, however our department manager at the time was very selective on her ""favorite coworkers"" and would allow those people to get away with responsibilities pertaining to their job. This company taught me how to have a thick skin within the retail world. There is room for growth, but it has to be on their terms."
bad,opening the store doing daily audits dealing with  multiple  customers at the same time keeping your isles clean and organized cleaning sales floor setting up sale signs
bad,"Low pay. .70 cents pay-increase over the course of 3 years. Health benefits not affordable. No consistency in quality of management, some managers really good, some very bad. Managers get moved around every 6 months, you never know who you will end up with. 98% of co-workers kind and helpful. No sick leave at all, instead you get attendance points each month and when you have a doctor's appointment or are sick, they deduct points. Don't get really sick (flu, etc.) once all your points are gone, you get fired. Good entry-level, nothing else."
bad,"When I was hired on at Macys, I was told that the hours would be from 5am until about 10 am four to five days a week and I was told that I should have 2 weekends off a month.  However this was not the case.  I very rarely had a weekend off.  The hours varied, and while I did work from 5am to 10am often, there were times when I was required to come in at 1am, 2am, and 3am."
bad,"uncomfortable work environment, sales supervisor likes to micromanage everything, unorganized, events materials went missing, lack of communication through entire management team, almost no traffic in store, push opening credit accounts, events all month with no direction or materials"
bad,"A typical day at work consists of ringing up customers, running back and fourth to check the fitting room, doing recovery on the floor (if its not too busy), and doing go back. Not the best experience, managers don't care about you, you're often running a busy department on your own, no one covers you not even for a bathroom break. The costumers are rude, even fellow coworkers are sometimes rude."
bad,"This company was very disorganized at the time I worked there. It seemed that the corporate headquarters would change policies many times and the policies were very poorly thought out. Many times the policies required more busy work (mark downs, re-ticketing, and movement of garments, etc.) with less and less time available. The manager  micromanaged  employees to the point where, at the time, the manager's duties were not fulfilled. There was not a team work environment and if there was a large project that needed to be completed, the management would not let the team work together to complete the large project on time.The company would not an employee that was not a sales person help a customer even when a sales person was not in the area and the customer needed to have help with a specific problem. Many times this would cause the customer to leave angry. With all of the said, there were some positives, the hours for the support staff was not too bad. Many times the support staff would arrive to work and finish the shifts before the store would open. This could be very beneficial for students."
bad,If you work so hard but don't open credit then your work won't be appreciated at all and you are always under pressure. Opening credits and my client is what they want.
bad,"Taking orders order the phone for the Wedding Gift Registry."
bad,"There is nothing good to say about this place. They lost 10 long term employees within just a few months of poor management. That's obviously not including the employees who was hired on for a week or so then left because they couldn't handle it. The management around there is ran horribly all the way around! They don't treat you fair at all! The only thing they care about it sales and that's it. You get hurt or groped at work they brush it off. They pick and choose who the rules apply to, and so much more."
bad,"toughest part is the retail industry is very fast paced and cutthroat. salaries and wages are low, when it's busy there is not enough workers to help, no room for growth high turnover in employees they are always hiring"
bad,"Macy's is a good place to start if you are interested in a fashion career. However, I would not recommend this company for a permanent position. The best thing is that you will be trained to work in all areas of the store but full-time positions are very limited. For part-time positions, some weeks you might only work 5 or 10 hours. The company complains about not having hours but consistently hires new people to work there."
bad,"Unaccommodating management, low salaries and very few benefits. Uncooperative and challenging team; lots of personal conflict during work hours. Low work morale."
bad,"While I enjoyed working for the Lancome brand, I was frustrated with the lack of cleanliness.  There was mouse feces on the makeup in the drawers, as well as the bathrooms would usually be a mess (i.e., toilet paper everywhere, toilets that were not flushed with feminine products in them, hand dryers that did not work).  I also was cut from Full time to part-time without being told that this was something that frequently happens.  I did like who I worked with and I did appreciate the discounts offered to employees."
bad,Its easy work but the managers are just annoying. The things you do is common sense. You can never get stuff done because the managers are always taking you away from the things you do.
bad,You spend 10-14 hours unloading trucking in what could only be described as a glorified oven. You're on call which means you could work between 10 hours a week or 30 hours and in the summer all work dries up.
bad,No consistency with anything! commission sales should go away and pay us more hourly. Company does not do what they tell us to do.Example we were told only can take back a return if we can resale item. But when we call store manager she takes back anything!
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"This position has terrible hours, pay, management and advancement. Very rarely do some of the best employees get promoted. When someone does get promoted it barely gives an increase in pay. Don't work here unless you have to."
bad,"Very touch and go. The company is so concerned with not being sued that they allow underperforming team members to stay employed, making the performing associates job double if not triple the work. The company does not value their associates in a sense of providing better financial compensation. Very focused on the wrong business indicators that are tailored to each specific store. So many directions, views and concepts that there is never set clear expectations."
bad,Was getting to work by about 4:30 am and not getting out till bout 3:00 pm almost every day. My main task was restocking shelves and re arranging out of place inventory
bad,"Typical Day:"
bad,"Perfect if you have no children and is fresh from graduating high school; or in college for some extra cash, but not trying to make a major career or long term job it's not enough pay for the work you have to do."
bad,"Macy's has a habit of putting a lot of pressure on its employees, but doesn't always look to compensate these employees properly. It is very hard to get hours in most departments. So for reduced hours they pressure you to work harder. I have trouble getting more than 20 hours on a regular basis, but I am often told I am doing a great job by  some. The company as a whole seems to maintain unrealistic expectations from employees and seem to prioritize certain departments and neglect others. They also seem to lean towards hiring people who already have jobs or are in school and not people looking for growth."
bad,"Macys has been on a slow decline for five years and can not hire quality managers.  The stores are closing, there is no room for personal growth, and the best people have already left the company."
bad,"Good as a Part time job while in school to gain experience but the pay is horrible along with the high priced health insurance that doesnt  "
bad,Management was aweful.  No one in management is ever on the same page. The Supervisors of each of the counters never get the recognition they deserve and leave because of that.
bad,"not a good place to work and bad work schedule"
bad,It was typically fun but very busy. They lead a lot of people to believe they will have jobs and then let go a bunch of us at once. The hardest part of the job was standing all day.
bad,"i did the 3x12 hour shifts on the weekend. breaks were nonexistent as i only got an unpaid 30 min lunch break and 2 paid 20 min breaks for a 12 hour day. it was hardly enough time for my feet and legs to stop throbbing from the pain of standing for so long. break rooms in the back of the warehouse were tiny and cramped which made it feel like a prison yard when they hired seasonal employees for peak season. the job wasnt so bad minus a few habitually toxic employees, lack of real breaks, lack of training in some regards to being moved to other departments.  if i could come in and have enough work for me to stay in my department  and do my job it was okay, but they should pay more for what they expect."
bad,"The holidays is great time for side jobs, and this one wasn't too bad. Honestly I can't say bad things nor good things. It was a simple retail job; help and ring out costumers."
bad,"You begin training on a computer in a back room, but there is no on the floor training. You have to pretty much figure things out on your own. Its is good you can pick up shifts, instead of having a set schedule."
bad,"Slow paced work environment and non sale days."
bad,"This job is okay for people who don't really go to school, as the scheduling is random. Management isn't the best, coverage isn't the best, the pay is just average, maybe below. They told me I'd move up in 6 months, well, come a year later, I still hadn't as they promised."
bad,"It was a great opportunity to gain leadership and managerial skills, requiring high levels of problem solving and team work. But most levels of employment are severally underpaid for the amount of hours the employees are expected to work."
bad,I worked as a beauty advisor for fashion fair cosmetics inside of macys willow grove. The management for the cosmetics department was very unorganized.
bad,"With all the stores closing, I have not had the luxury of having job stability. I would like to work a job that is stable, has a good culture, good benefits and a good work/life balance."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,There is a lack of unison at every level of management. The disconnect often leaves associates lost or underdeveloped. It is also very rare to get promoted within the company. You have to work there more than a year before you move up. Management is often hired from outside the store.
bad,the job good for a new worker coming out of military service. It was a nice place work in my younger years. The people had very good energy and hard working.
bad,This company is sinking faster than the titanic. Avoid at all costs because they wont be around for much longer. It's not worth the pressure they put on you when they'll lay you off in a heartbeat.
bad,Human Resources is the most needed environment that needs to be reconstructed. Protocol in how employees meet resources has established a form of failure that causes malfunctioning system in a corporation.
bad,"The management at Macy's absolutely horrifying. This include upper management as well. Macy's does a lot of shady business which is unethical and leads an unprofessional work environment. Your work hours do not allow you to see any in between hours. You are there from open to close on most days. Benefits are very limited as there is a 20% discount for employees that you can only receive on a pre-paid employee card or credit card (which has horrible customer service). Few times a year you will get an additional 20% off. The turn over rate is very high, Macys will continue to lose valuable workers and determined employees if they continue to have the lacking management skills and persons there of."
bad,"not beneficial to employees. "
bad,"A typical day at work consists of ringing up customers, running back and fourth to check the fitting room, doing recovery on the floor (if its not too busy), and doing go back. Not the best experience, managers don't care about you, you're often running a busy department on your own, no one covers you not even for a bathroom break. The costumers are rude, even fellow coworkers are sometimes rude."
bad,"Support team members worked VERY part time at my location, sometimes as little as 4 hours a week. The pay was minimum wage with almost no improvement. The hours were all early morning, mostly in dimly lit conditions with no A/C or heating before store opening. Also the location I was at had a rat problem in the stockrooms."
bad,"Not very willing to work schedule around a heavier work load in primary day job when working for them as a night job. Most associates are nice to work with, management spent more time not on sales floor and mostly interested in being in the office."
bad,Macy's is an ok job for what is is worth. I personally would not ever work there again! They do not treat their customers with much respect as well as their employees. I worked in the collection department and it was the worst department I have ever worked for. They're leads are managers are all stuck up and rather reprimand associates  then trying to help out their associates
bad,I didnt like this job but im thankful for the training I recieved. it was boring and the store doesnt provide fulltime on holikdays.
bad,"Selling women's and men's gift sets in fragrance's department. "
bad,"Although the manager's weren't the best in all honesty, the co-workers were a joy to work with with such positive vibes. Pretty easy going and easy to learn the steps on how to work at the register."
bad,"I applied to here for flexibility because I am a full time student, but on numerous occasions when I have advertised my shifts and others have picked them up my manager would put another on my schedule and schedule me during my off days when I have class."
bad,"Not a good work life balance, HR and management are not in touch with employees. Not willing to be flexible although told when hired that they will be flexible."
bad,"Poor management, unprofessional environment, and poor communication are the top 3 things this company lacks. Their is a lot of open racism going on in the company as well. The older employees who are mostly white walk around with sour faces all day long when black employees are around. Then they go to upper management and discuss black employees. I am constantly told by my manager who is white that I, as well as the fulfillment dept. that I work in is being watched. This company does not pay well at all to constantly be watched because I am black. The culture here is poor. Managers need to learn how to manage up instead of down."
bad,"Don't expect much from working retail, you will work long and horrible hours with weekends and holidays thrown in. Advancement doesn't happen quickly and it's all political, it's about if they like you and who you know. Pay is at minimum wage or slightly above. the only upside to working at Macy's is it's a good job if you're going to school since you can pretty much select the two days off you need every week and if your sales it's even more flexible with the ability to drop shifts and pick up shifts."
bad,The job was tedious and the management waffled between ambivalent and rude. The majority of customers were rude. If you hadn't worked there for more than a year you weren't eligible for over time or holiday pay even though you were almost required to work those hours.
bad,"HR does not respond to concerns or policy questions."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Friendly people , Very busy place and fast paced. Customers are nice has it days where's it's busy and some days when it's not busy"
bad,Managers and supervisors have no idea what's happening HR is overbearing on way too many matters when it comes to production.
bad,Overall the management is a huge problem in this company including the HR. You have to go through hoop in order for HR to accomplish something for you. The management never advances whoever has more time working in the building and give the opportunity to people from the outside to take the position. They would also have you doing multiple things during your four hour shift if you don't get it done you would get in trouble. I worked hard but they had me doing multiple things per day which unfair.
bad,"I have started working with Macy's as a part time seasonal associate and was hired as a part time permanent associate."
bad,"I have never had such demanding customers in all my time in retail. Some of the managers would be willing to help out while some would take upwards of 15 minutes just to respond to a call for help. co-workers would vanish for around an hour and leave you as the only one in the area. If people called in basically everyone was up a creek and whoever called in would be scorned for it, Don't even get me started about selling the Macy's card. It was beyond ridiculous how management expected you to piddle credit cards to every single customer."
bad,"Very boring and repetitive, bad pay. Same miserable work every day and towards Christmas, there was almost no work. Better part time jobs out there."
bad,"I loved working there because of the things I learned. I got to travel departments, and I was welcomed by each person I worked with. However, when paychecks started coming, management tried to make employers in departments work off of gratuity. No one tips people to help check them out."
bad,"Great co-workers, good location to work in. Good company benefits, helping the customers and solving problems they might have."
bad,I've worked for Macy's for almost a year now and my experience with this company is somewhat ok. The people are fun to work with and some of the customers are too. Half of the customers want to use coupons on top of coupons on top of coupons and it get frustrating. The managers want you to get every customer to get a Macy's credit card and in return they'll give you a lotto ticket for every credit you open or just a candybar. I would recommend this job to anybody who's has retired and has nothing else to do with their life.
bad,"Greeted customers upon arrival, folded clothes, cleaned dressing rooms and cashier. Honestly didn't learn anything from the job. management was never informative usually learned about the sales from other employees or on the day of the sale. Co-workers were great met many great people that worked hard and helped keep the flow of customers moving. I didn't find anything hard about the job. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different people from other parts of the world. which happen to be most of the employees and they were real herd workers."
bad,This is a fun environment when people are not concerned with each individual when they need to be concerned about the customers not who and when someone is helping the customers. Management is not what it is cracked up to be.
bad,"The hardest part of the job was helping customers that were frustrated especially if they were upset because a Macy's employee was rude and purposefully didn't assist them. The best part of the job was conversing with costumers and instilling customer loyalty, making sure they would return to the store again."
bad,"came forward about issues including safety issues for both customers and employees as well as other issues, instead of dealing with the issues, H.R. seemed to wish to punish me for coming forward instead."
bad,Got me going with temp job while seeking full-time regular job. Worked lots of my breaks though i got good discounts on bought items.
bad,Days are filled with internal and external investigations and audits. Some of the upper management team are not open to talk over issues.  Do not find this company to be open to the open door policy for its employees.
bad,"Work load kept you very busy."
bad,"Horrible company bad management, do not care about employees, dont pay you enough for all the work that you have to do by yourself"
bad,"Macy's is a nice place to work at, sometimes. The management is not the greatest and needs major improvement. Some of the staff members are nice but, not all of them. The management expects the staff to do things that are not in the job description."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Pay is not good.  Little to no benefits.  Management only cares about employees that work in the store.  Don't really care for those in the warehouse.
bad,"When I first started working for Macy's logistics, I was happy at first because I was getting paid a lot hour. But when I suddenly realized that I was doing two to three different job descriptions one day, I knew from the start that I walked into trouble. The Tukwila Logistic center that is Macy's is a terrible place to work for. I've seen many racist people that work there and I don't tolerate that. When I went to upper management  to let them know what was going on. They simply ignored my situation and gave me low hours after telling him that. What I hate about this job is when you start at 5 a.m. you get off at 1:30 p.m. or is 6 a.m. all the way to 2:30 p.m. by time you get home you get a few hours off. your feet is sore swollen ! My manager was cool at first but then she ended up being unprofessional and rude. The other manager that gives you hours wanted you to do Saturdays and if you tell them you couldn't do that day then you'll end of shorting hours to we only get four hours. You do with the managers want you to do if you don't do it you don't get paid simple as that. I was told that I did a wonderful job at what I did I was making $400 checks but to the point where I didn't want to do what they want to do they burned me people are lazy you got to do their work and there's no time for sitting around so if I can let you know how Macy's really is is a bunch of lazy people who do not know how to do their job and everybody else's counting on you to do it the pressure is up you gotta empty trailers you gotta do chairs you gotta do couches."
bad,"Work is very reactionary with little structure in place.  Due to the type of work this department performs, new trends come out frequently which leads to frustration among the associate staff who have quite a bit of difficulty reacting to constant change.  A typical day usually revolves around handling systemic issues which are very frequent."
bad,Macys is a growing and evolving company. It is an ok place to work however compensation is not that great. Not a very good work life balance
bad,"They barely give you any hours but expect you to get your job done in the time that they do have you on the schedule. Upper management is barely say anything to you unless they need something from you. I had a good manager but because they didn't like her for some reason, they got rid of her. She did her job very well. We got stuff done. My co workers were great. We became almost like family. The pay is not good and they barely give you raises."
bad,No room for growth. Every year a different department is leaving and there is not one to replace the one that left. Pay and appreciation for employees could be better.
bad,Relatively decent workplace. Macy's treats their employees well with food and prizes. Not a very hard job.You even get a good discount.
bad,"Fast pace, constant change in employees, (causing no coverage in departments) management at times seem to put to much work on you! (On top of your daily to do) pay doesn't match the work load, work conditions doesn't meet expectations! (Cold in the building during the winter and hot in the summer, esp for those employees who work on the dock/fulfillment area, even customers have made comments about it being to hot while they try to shop!)  "
bad,I liked working for Macys.  They worked with my schedule being a single mom.  I enjoyed my job but I didn't have a good experience trying to change positions in the company.  Having to wait 3 months for 2 different positions and promotions was absurd.
bad,"It was to long ago for me to rate it. But overall okay they are flexible with school hour, so as a student it is very good but long run not the best job"
bad,"Days at work were good, lots to do. Mostly good customers."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of helping customers with any product questions, foundation matching, color correcting and eyeshadows. I would sit down with booked appointments to do ""The Chanel Experience"". I learned more about the history behind Chanel & About the Founder CoCo Chanel. Management was non-reliable most of the time. The Hardest part of my job was Managers never giving me direct orders or updates on future events. The most enjoyable part of my job is working one on one with customers to help them learn how to apply the makeup they are purchasing, teaching them techniques they can use on a daily basis. Most if not all of my clients have had amazing experiences working with me."
bad,"A typical day at Macy's varied, because if there is no sale, it is slow, but if there is a sale it is busy.  I didn't really learn anything while working at Macy's.  Management was very encouraging when they wanted the associates to get customers to open up a Macy's credit card.  My co-workers were great people to work with.  Some of them became good friends and we would hang out outside of work.  The hardest part of the job was getting customers to sign up for the Macy's credit card.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing all the new fashion coming out."
bad,"Low paying job, very low hours per week. Too many people in management and no one really leading anyone. This may only be at the local store i work at."
bad,"No one is ever happy here its just a place people come to make money. A lot of people use the position as a second job. Most people are unhappy so moral is low. Seasonal time they do not do background checks and hire anyone. Make sure you are permanent in whatever position because they are ready to get rid of you whenever they can. Management has no common sense but you can usually find one person before they quit that knows what to do in their position. My advice, work somewhere else."
bad,"As I enjoy the people I work with, my company is not competitive with total compensation and benefits for it's executive team.   My career path is limited due to my department downsizing."
bad,"A typical day at Macy's is long and strenuous"
bad,"Hate this company, it sucked that under all the smile was sneaky selfish attitudes and no team work.The focus mainly on sell and even announces the associates sales and credit goal over the PA system. Its a fancy name to carry around when people ask where you work but other then that do no not waste your time there"
bad,"Worked there as seasonal employee. Pretty much learned about my responsibilities from my colleagues because management really didn't offer much. Hardest part of the job? Figuring out the goofy automated scheduling system. Easiest part? Dealing with the customers. Macy's has a loyal customer base and they expect deals and discounts, but you can make people happy with all the various offers. Don't expect any positive communication from management at any level. Their focus is shoving the cheap discounted merchandise out the door, but hey, this is the 21st century, and concern for the employees went away long ago."
bad,It was hectic only on sales day . Other than that it was okay. Nothing really special about. I work recovery which is no longer a department.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,A day at Macy's included basically selling to every customer who walks int he door no matter if you think they are not going to buy anything. I've learned that working in retails you need to have a lot of patients. The management was not so good in my opinion because there was to many managers in my department. My co workers were okay. Some more offensive than others. The hardest part of the job was keeping a straight face with difficult customers. But I've learned over the years how to deal with those very few customers with a simple smile and compliment. The most enjoyable part of the job was to end a sales and the customer thanking me for all the hard work that i did to make sure there sale was complete and they got everything that they needed.
bad,"The company is great, the pay is just low. For the amount of work and effort that the employees put forth, the pay definitely does not match."
bad,"So much potential, but in the position I was, they had unrealistic expectations without giving the employee the means to accomplish them. "
bad,I didn't like working there at all. The management push you to open credit cards when people really didn't want to open them. There was unrealistic goals to meet when the store was empty.
bad,"always stocking shelves, making sure I provide the right service to the customer, demonstrating makeup on customers. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with sales quota, most enjoyable is playing with makeup."
bad,"It is a job of very minimal supervision and hard work. All be it fun at times, there can unreasonable goals for the day atop of above average workloads. Time management as well as having strong costumer focus is important. The co-workers are nice but they can be too competitive instead of team players. The hardest part of the job is balancing position duties and adhering to the company's high standard of customer service while keeping the customers happy and contant on department appearance. Aside from having different work hours and very hard to change work hour options, overall the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with a large amount of different people."
bad,"""Be Everywhere, Do Everything"" is one of the mottos of Macy's, and they mean it literally.  You'll start the day setting up sales, opening the registers, and cleaning up what the previous day didn't get done.  Then you'll be working with customers, while selling them on the credit card, and cleaning up after them.  You are also expected to contact other customers via phone, do stockroom projects, and keep the tables tidy.  Then when the store closes, you'll be shutting down the registers, cleaning the floor, and taking damaged goods to the dock."
bad,Good amount of paid days off. Typical day is routine. A Lot of waking and standing. Most co workers are enjoyable to work with
bad,I was only there for 50 internship hours but a gained knowledge of how to do payroll and everyday basic clerical work.
bad,"I was hired to go into the makeup department, but Macys decided otherwise, and put me in fragrances. I wasn't allowed to pick up any shifts within the makeup departments, which was a bummer since I am trying to be a make up artist. The manager smelt like cigarettes and she looked like a mean person. Everyone acted as if they were too good for anyone. Which was a turn off. When you go to work, you are suppose to enjoy what you are doing and the coworkers you are surrounded with. I did not get that vibe from working the short period that I worked at Macy's."
bad,"Typical work day 9 to 10 hrs rotating shifts"
bad,"No Comment At This time. I do appreciate having a job and working for a great store manager, but the compensation is not even close to what I was told when Hired."
bad,"Opening Macy's accounts, no area manager, unscheduled work days, good co-workers, unstable schedule."
bad,Do work at Herald Square Macy's. They are not trying to help you advance your career. The fire people with kids all the time. Not a good company. Shoes department is the most disorganize section.
bad,"Most of the people are amazing to work with, but the schedule and amount of hours are unreasonable. Benefits are almost nonexistence."
bad,"When I first started, no one thoroughly explained how things worked or where we should report in the mornings. My name never showed up on their paper schedule posted on the wall, which I said something about and was never fixed. They also have crazy expectations about how many boxes/hour someone should be able to pack."
bad,This place had a bad problem with management and scheduling. It also frequently messed up the wages.
bad,Should not be a long term career option unless a part time job. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work with other employees and helping out customers
bad,It's extra busy and there is always something to do. The management team seemed to have a power trip but it was good experience.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,enjoyed the regular customers and meeting and talking to different people.  outstanding customer service is  what matters. management need to be more professional and helpful. some co-workers were like family. the hardest part of the job is working the late schedules then assigned to work the very early schedule the next day. a typical day at work is helping the customer and making sure the customer is happy and satisfied and will return and look for you personally. that is what made my experience  worthwhile at macys.
bad,"not very enjoyable "
bad,"I think that Macys being such a big company can do a lot better with its Management department, 401k plans, and generally caring more for their workers. We work really hard for them, and we dont feel appreciated. I would not reccomend working here, however, I like my team."
bad,"Every day that I worked at Macy's, though it was just a short time, I met new people and made more friends with my coworkers.  The employees are very friendly and welcoming.  It tough me the importance of being on a friendly basis with everyone that you work with, it makes the time there more enjoyable and productive as we could all help each other.  The management team here was very good, but they did lack communication because there were so many of them.  The hardest part of the job was the commute;  I was driving 45 minutes to work each day.  The best part of the job was  the people I worked with."
bad,Being a Macy's employee can be fun when placed with the right manager. Co-workers are very nice and helpful. But really the job is about opening as many Macy's credit cards as possible full-time should open 5 or more a day and Part-time should open 3 or more a day.
bad,I found working there to be very competitive. They care a lot about you meeting your sales goals and credits for the day then they care about the person working for them.
bad,"Didn't listen to me, especially when I needed to change my summer work schedule back to a school schedule."
bad,As a Hostess  I would greet the guest and seat them at a proper table. I would also bring menus and silverware. I learned how to have greet customer service in this career field and I met a lot of wonderful people.
bad,Good place for art directors just starting in the business to get experience in high production art directing
bad,"Typical day starts with a managers meeting. Going over walk sheet. Going over list of call outs and making calls to fill those spots."
bad,"must be a people person"
bad,Working retail is not my ideal career job because it is not financially gainful and does not allow much time to spend with your family. The hardest part of my job is not getting home some nights until 11pm and working every weekend while my family is at home. The most Enjoyable part of my job is that I get to talk to many different people on a regular basis.
bad,"Sales and stocking on the selling room floor"
bad,"Everything was to disorganized in stockrooms."
bad," I was responsible for getting the merchandise on the floor, back-stocking unused merchandise, labeling new mark downs with their correct price, and assisting customers."
bad,"not a bad place to work. the hardest part of my job was pulling plastic, not because it was hard to do, but because it was slow work"
bad,As a sales associate I would greet customers and find out what products they were interested in in my department I was working while trying to offer some additional ideas based off of what they were interested in. Working in the mall during holidays was the best part of this job other than the discounts we were able to get. I enjoyed the everyday interactions with people and that I was able to dress the way I choose was also a bonus! I rarely had interactions with the managers unless I really needed their assistance. I met coworkers who I am still friends with to this day from this job.
bad,"the job was ok. management was all over the place, didn't work with your schedule but was fun to be at sometimes"
bad,"The people on the second floor of this Macy's are great to work with. However, management is very worried about meeting credit card applications each day and will tell associates to give customers the 20% off just for applying - even if they don't get approved. Very unethical behavior. Manager would come up behind employees while with a customer and say ""you need 2 credits today"". ""New"" idea they are implementing at this store (which should have been implemented some time ago) is My Client. You are pressured to get 2 clients per hour to add to the data base. This is where Macy's can track their purchases and you as the worker can call the client to set up ""appointments"" with them and create a good relationship with them. Unfortunately, this Macy's location is not large and the clients not so hot about signing up on a list. Employees are driven to just add names and numbers to the database so they meet the requirement, not really caring about who they add. The customers at this location are great! They were the most enjoyable part of the job! Working for peanuts just wasn't worth the hassle."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Certain members of the Management team where a delight to work with. i enjoyed assisting staff and Customer, the interaction was great from customer to customer."
bad,"Store is completely disorganized, workers very unfriendly lots of tension"
bad,"Able to hand past pace, great communitication skills, strong relationship skills. Awareness of HR laws and company standards. I enjoyed training and developing employees. A great partnership with staff, and co-workers. Ability to help managers, employees, scheduling, HR, hiring, customers on a daily bases."
bad,"There was too much rushing, and too stressful. The scheduling was an issue, and every month we had a new supervisor."
bad,"the good part of the job is they train you well. After that you are on your own with no clue who is your manager, etc. For training they scare you by taking you to loss prevention's room where the cameras are all over the store and telling you they are watching you so don't try to steal. very interesting insight on what kind of employees macys might have had to deal with in the past."
bad,"A typical day at work would be to unload the dock, build placements and racks for the new clothes to be stored on the floor, stock the stock room. Price changes in all departments. My co-workers were great we all worked together as a team. The hardest part of my job was that it was only a seasonal position. The most enjoyable part about my job was the discount we got."
bad,I will never look back to work for this company. Expect way too much with no support but expect you to give your life away.
bad,Enjoyed working with and serving the customers. Very dissappointed with the way managment ran this particular location.
bad,"Management doesn't have a clue how to communicate with employees. Minimal pay, no chance for advancement."
bad,"Lack of respect for employee, by supervisors and management"
bad,working at macys has its ups and downs... you meet different people interact with people from different cultures... great discounts... downs macys doesn't pay enough for the work employees do.. the mangers are not grateful..
bad,I loved working at Macy's but if you dont get hired on as fulltime they will only work you a max of 16 hrs a week and its hard to get a fulltime position unless a holiday is near.
bad,"Not very flexible with hours, low pay and awful commission system."
bad,"I worked here as a seasonal employee and after I was put on the floor I hardly got any help when I needed it. The management made a somewhat unprofessional impression on me since they ate cookies at their desks all the time. Most of the employees just walked around talking to each other. I was told to do the selling for a different associate while she got my sales goal and commission.. I didn't think that was very fair. The scheduling system was fair though as I got to pick the times I wanted to work, and was able to put up my days online for others to pick up if they wanted the hours. I wasn't called or notified that I wasn't supposed to come into work anymore/that I was no longer needed. I was put on the schedule for another week, showed up to work early in the morning, tried to log in to the system and it wouldn't take my information. That was how I was told I was no longer needed. No one said a word to me. I found that very unprofessional."
bad,like any other retail position little pay hectic pace. no benefits.
bad,"Notoriously incompetent management promotion schedules. Do not expect any problems solved or any paperwork to be filed correctly - even when the store level management knows what paperwork to file, which is rare."
bad,The managers only care about credit card openings even if they constantly have to push the issue while the costumer is oblivious uncomfortable.
bad,i liked it other then the management
bad,"Employee discounts are great, everyone is nice with a few exceptions (the big dogs who only say good morning when they are expecting a visit from corporate and need you to have the place looking spotless). Nice place to work for if you need a little extra cash. I got paid minimum wage even after working there for a year and receiving compliments of what a great employee I am from the high ups. I am in merchandising and we come in at 6:30 am to minimal visibility inside the store (you can't tell black from blue) and no a/c, talk about saving energy! On top of that, you basically have to pray for some measly hours. VERY stingy with hours. The scheduling and shift picking is also ridiculous. People who stand around and do nothing get more hours than the ones who bust their rears."
bad,Good for students or people who need a second job. Seniority with the company is not always reason for promotion. Too much to do for little pay. Benefits were okay. Good way to become cross-trained to prepare for other retail positions. Macy's credit card goals and sales goals are main focus.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"If they restructure then they could be unstoppable. Macys is a good company for a first or part time job. I wouldnt make a career out of working there. They have too many tricks of the trade and loop holes. You are always bound to get caught on something, right or wrong."
bad,Results matter in this company. Work life balance is good most of the year except holiday time. Executives are micromanaged.
bad,"They play with your hours an use them as punishment. If your not a favorite don't look foward to advancement. Plan on having supervisors using personal feelings on choosing who does what job despite if the next person is a better fit. Attitudes from management make many employees not give a darn about the job. Instead of seeing a future career, they use them until they find something better. Even if that means less pay."
bad,"Management does not know how to work schedules or schedule anyone. They expect you to get one thousand things done by the end of your shift, when most nights you close by yourself. Customers are rude so you have to have a lot of patience, no matter how the customers act or what they say, the customer is always right. If you defend yourself then you end up getting in trouble for disrespecting the customer."
bad,"It's just a job in retail, nothing special. I was seasonal from summer to the holiday season. I folded clothing and helped in stock and assisted customers on the floor, but never was assigned at the register (support associate). Management was average, so no real qualms there. Coworkers got along well. The hardest part of the job was assisting customers (that's a me thing because I'm shy around strangers). The most enjoyable part of the job was organizing and putting away clothing (I just happen to like organizing)."
bad,"Every day was exhausting, you always end up with significantly less staffing than needed, and each associate has to take on a huge amount of work in order to keep the sales floor even passable looking, while also manning registers, and attending to customers on the sales floor. Pay wasn't good either, I got just over minimum wage, even though the work was like I should've been paid at least a few dollars over."
bad,"I didn’t enjoy working here, pay was great but the management was very poor. They didn’t care about my health or how I was feeling, they only cared about getting production rates up."
bad,"It is ran like a slave plantation, management does not appreciate the you do. Store manager is not the best, she has let the store to down. Most of the. Help has left"
bad,"Unless your chinese or hispanic your not going to get far applying for Macys in flushing. The managers ""Stick to their own"" and ""help them gain""  I've never felt more left out of anything, especially in a more Supervisory role. The hours were slim since most were given first to older Associates(which I understand) then ti the favorites. While the rest of us fought to hit the minimum requirements for our job type."
bad,They need to treat the employees as good as they treat the customers and the pay is  ridiculously low compared to other stores and what they ask you to do they won’t total loyalty but the pay does not reflect the job
bad,Cold management. After shooting alarm no counseling.
bad,None to review.  Work at mac6at your own risk.  People are getting away with different things than others do and they're favoritism over thise who work there butts off than those who barely produce as much and complain all the time.
bad,"Well respected and offered an open door policy should I decide to return to Macy's. I began with Macy's in Human Resources. I wanted to make Stylist position however, Macy's did not partner with me to make that happen. Hence, my brief return to Cosmetics."
bad,the pay is less than desirable and you really don't have much of a social life. My fellow coworkers and I always joked about how Macys takes you away from your family because the ridiculous hours they provide. But you gotta make money somehow
bad,"I work AP at Macys and was denied a raise after a year and a half of service. Corporate Management is absolutely atrocious and there is very little possibility for advancement unless you know somebody. Nobody knows what they are doing and it definitely shows. The hours were good, the people I worked with were awesome but management is the absolute worst."
bad,this company can be great shopping at but for some people working here can be a drag management act like bullies in a school all they do is gossip and tell storys
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I worked for Macy’s for 3 weeks and only worked 2x at the store and 5 days in a different store and they treated me like I w as one of there owe. I feel like my manager doesn’t like me but like the other girl I work with. Just by the way she talks to us it’s a different tone so with that being said I think they could do a little better with people skills.
bad,Weekly pay was good but the mangers weren’t nice nor understanding  . NO FLEXIBILITY WHAT SO EVER . Highly unfair that people quit and cannot return because of attendance WHICH was also control by management ! Some people did their jobs and others made it hard . Only place I know where you get in trouble for giving customer service! Only good part was my customers and co workers ! They need to do better 🤷🏾‍♀️
bad,"I returned for a second seasonal temporary position with Macys and was placed in a small closed area that was hard for me to work. I requested a change in positions. The lead manager was very nice, the manager on the other hand seemed to like patting me on my shoulder, several times. I told him not to touch me, he seemed to get irritable and from then on got upset whenever I made mistakes.  So, I called Macy's  I was told to reapply for another position. . I did, was interviewed and was fired."
bad,"Management needs to change, stop favoritism. Stop punishing associates for calling in sick by cutting hours. Treat all employees right. Stop making employees feel unappreciated"
bad,"Managers come and go, even on a weekly basis so leadership is often missing. When is there is too strict and not realistic. People rarely stay. I think it's a great place to start and get some experience with customer facing, but that is it. Pay is salary + commission, so there is no team work, even though it should be to get things done more effectively."
bad,"They seem to always try to find a way to let go of people. Instead of paying attention to the big picture. But overall the job is easy, but you have to work hard with the low staff."
bad,They advertise this flexible schedule but the manager would force you to take certain hours. The management was terrible and they treat people badly. They pay you terribly and during the holidays they give you full time hours without the benefits without asking. I worked in the back opening boxes which they only revealed the first day. after four hours of working your supposed to get a break but the manager would look down at people who dared to take a break so I had to just use the bathroom as an excuse for a break. They would change the rules constantly and not even tell you. There are alot of women who have worked there for years and are bitter and rude. Then if the manager was behind she would expect you to stay after a long 8 hour shift.
bad,The money the company pays you is not enough to live off of. this company pays you as if you just came out of high school. I have over 10+ years of customer service skills and retail experience and yet the hour pay the company offers is offensive. $10.49 an hour. youve got to be kidding me. They want you to go above and beyond for a slave salary. I feel like this is not fare at all. I am a seasonal worker here and I'm trying to look for another job.
bad,"The team treated me horrible. Other counter managers were constantly trying to get me in trouble. As well as a co-worker at my counter continuously reported false information about my work performance to my counter manager. I was always being scolded for actions I never did. The same co-worker would do nothing but play when the manager was away, and kept asking me to pick up shifts she didn't want to do, for no reason. I was just constantly being picked on, and given wrong information purposefully so that I would look like a fool in front of customers. I would hear different instructions from different people. That's when I realized I was given wrong information on purpose. There was a lot of pettiness and backstabbing for no reason. I feel bad for the new girls trying to prove themselves. You have to be very tough and competitive and take no nonsense in order to remain in that position."
bad,"No support from management to department lead. Changes to schedule without consulting employees, overwhelming work load, extremely under paid. Overall feel is that employees throughout the store feel underpaid and under appreciated."
bad,The management at Macys is the worst at the Square One Mall in Saugus and the store looks horrible and unkept. Nobody checks on you through out the day and they leave one person in every department to suffer by themselves and they never let you go on break on time.
bad,the only good things about this job was the tips. other than that carrying heavy sofa beds or dressers or just delivering heavy furniture is just real tiring period.
bad,You basically train yourself with a computer and a register and only shadow your coworkers for a day or two. It's very competitive with other employees or to even get shifts.
bad,"The culture and management structure has changed since I first started. Positive aspects is that there are less layers. However, now there isn’t a lot of room for advancement unless you’re an Assistant. At that point you can only move up. A lot of senior management who had experience were given packages so most of management are new which poses some problems with correct procedures. The physical Human Resources department was eliminated so there are issues with trying to maneuver around HR questions. Now everything is routed to a main Hub I. Which you have to either call in or open a case to get answers. Work life balance really depends on which dept you work in.  Some are better than others."
bad,"If you enjoy working by yourself for long periods of time without being allowed a 15 minute break, being berated by customers who think they know everything and have management breathing down your neck about opening up “loyalty” or in other words Macy’s credit card then come on down! After working here for almost a year, I understand why turnover is so high. Pay is mediocre at best, coworkers are cliquey customers treat associates like garbage and management does not back up their associates."
bad,"In my 25 years of customer service experience in retail Macy's has been the worst work experience ever, terrible merchandise managers, they have favoritism, if you were not hired directly from merchandise managers they will treat us not so nice, they will give us the least hours possible, and gave more hours to people that didn't work at all, they would be hiding in stockrooms.  The manager I had messed several times on my days of work that she messed up and I didn't get paid 2 weeks."
bad,"Pay was decent. No positives other than that. Macy's is chronically understaffed by design, everyone is overworked and management is critical without anything constructive to offer. Expect to do everything in your area and to clean up messes that others leave behind(they don't always have a choice) Also the attendance policy is incredibly unforgiving, try not to get sick and don't bother planning any vacations in case you do."
bad,A typical day at work is never typical which can be a good thing if you don't like repetition. It can be very challenging at times. Management can be inconsistent at this is retail and there is high turnover. The hardest part of the job is the lack of communication. The best part of the job is the people. Building relationships and helping others.
bad,"Working at Macy's i barely got hours, the managers and associates never picked up the phones, i did know what days i had to work, i didn't get paid a lot and they weren't doing a good job."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,It was a great place to work till we got bad management. It became a  toxic and stressful work environment. Managers would  gossip and never provide feedback. But anytime there was feed back it wasn’t good. Didn’t feel like managers treated everyone equally. So made it very hard for others.
bad,"I took on a position in merchandising because the hours fit with my schedule. For the most part, until I started getting scheduled until 2:30 in the afternoon then it started to conflict with my other job. Scheduling also became an issue when I got a different job and asked for less hours, instead I got more hours and I just couldn't do it anymore. Initially I’d started questioning my employment at macy’s when I spent an entire day doing one thing, only to be told to now do the exact opposite. Aka, they wanted me to reverse what they’d told me to do."
bad,Macy’s is in the process of going out of business.  They cut managers and expect other mangers to pick up their slack.  People are overworked and tired and the company keeps demanding more results with no money.
bad,"Where I was, you were lucky if there were enough people working to cover each ""zone"" and these zones consist of multiple departments with multiple registers and fitting rooms and things to be put away. You end up being one person trying to be everywhere at once because customers don't care that you're trying to do the work of 5 people."
bad,"Great place to work if you want your day to fly by and meet people from many different backrounds.  "
bad,It's ok place to work nothing more to say sometime if there is nothing good to say about a person or a company dont say nothing at all that's the way I feel.
bad,Lack of  open time to be scheduled in my department. Inflexible management and no support from coworkers. Not enough training and support. But get to gain experience in retail.
bad,Only work here if you have no other choice. Working here will have you gain experience in areas that you were not even hired for. Yet they seem to always find a way to include it as a mandatory assignment. Dont have a family or a life because working here is canceling every plan or trip.
bad,"This is a good starter job. The great thing is you do get 3-10 percent commission On the items you sell. Management sucked as they pretty much ignored you and the only time they come around is when they ask about credit card opening. OH YEAH, about that, Credit card opening are expected over making a connection or a sale with a client. Which I didn’t care about the credits. This store has no support system because all the managers are too busy with whatever they are doing to even care. I started there at $10 and when min wage went up to $11, they just booted me up to $11 while the oncalls were getting paid waaaaaay more than me and I’ve been there for a year. No place to grow either"
bad,this job was not hard. the managers were the biggest problem. everything else was alright. retail is not easy and the customers sometimes can give you a big headache.
bad,"The only thing I liked was the sales and coworkers.Managers always seen annoyed. Always trying to open credit, if not you go to credit class. Pay sucks."
bad,"Loved working with handbags, especially with the Michael Kors boss in Boca Raton, FL. One problem at Macys was I never got paid for overtime and my work hours where always messed up."
bad,"Ok company to work for. "
bad,Slave Wages & High Turnover Low Morale w/employees. They drive you to open credit card accts. You bring them in thousands of dollars of new credit. In return they give you $2 in Macy Money which only can be spent if you add an additional $2 of your own money. So they give take it back & get some of yours. Very poor incentives w/Macys. Too many coupons. Too many sales on a daily weekly and monthly basis. Felt like i was at a swamp meet. High end is gone.
bad,"Thst shechudeling was horrible.We were weekly shedule comes once a week.But they change the shedule 4 diferents timed, after accept.It was very understaffed, because of the pay.Some lazy coworkers, and take advantage of new hired people."
bad,"A typical day at work looked like pretty much everything you see your cashier do who checks you out when you go clothes shopping. The job wasn't stressful, just life draining. Doing the same thing for extensive shifts could get boring."
bad,It's an okay place to work they always watch you make sure you during production the hours are real good traffic is real bad going and leaving from there
bad,"You were always busy, because the location I worked at was understaffed. What I learned from my time there is the importance of time management and multitasking in an understaffed work environment. Management wasn't the best. Some managers were very helpful but the others seemed like they just didn't care. The hardest part of my job was literally everything. I was one person doing the job of 4 people. We were so understaffed to the point where I had to work 23 days in a row.. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling like i accomplished something not everyone can handle and also getting to see all my customers leave with smiles on their faces."
bad,Very productive but they expect too much from you and the pay isn't good at all and management wasn't good. Overall my favorite thing about working there were a few of my co-workers.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,5 am open truck receive items. organize merchandise to be tagged/sensor ready for floor/departments. some fulfillment online/mail orders readied to be shipped out. basic math/computer skills. It was an ok job. Unrealistic to think that you can survive of a mere $9 an hour to live these days with less that zero hours per week. Maybe Macy' should stop doing that stupid ridiculous parade and spend money on paying their employees a REAL wage! And modernize the way the do things. So outdated!  Who cares about your over inflated 27ft helium filled Turkey! put that money into your people who show up on time and give there all.
bad,When someone accuses you of something even if it’s found that they are lying they don’t get repercussions because it stops others from coming forward. I feel like if you cannot truthfully tell someone you don’t like them instead of try to get them fired you definitely don’t belong in retail you need to have thick skin
bad,I did not like working in macy it was to much competition there everybody wanted to be boss nodoy wanted to do work but wants to delgaye work to others lack of respect to trainees...
bad,"This position need's to be re-evaluated so they can actually keep applicants for more than a few months. If they set you up for success instead of having you run around like a chicken with it's head cut off trying to figure out their systems and get help with daily job duties, it would be a fun place to be. People show a nice face in front of management but they are rude and disrespectful on a one-on-one basis."
bad,"The job is super easy. It's the management/leads that make it stressful. They're not held accountable for the stupid decisions that they make. They're always contradicting themselves. The manager I worked for is the most stupidest person in the world and has absolutely no idea how to do their job. She lies, shows favoritism, brings in old employees from last job and pays them more then the employees who have been there. Things go south instead of taking blame she comes down on the associates who clearly knew it was going to happen. The leads stand around taking pictures of employees talking. Basically walk in with your head down and work like a robot! In one word of describe her as Hitler! The place is always hiring because no one can stand the stupidity that goes on in in that warehouse and corporate does nothing about it"
bad,"Learned how to operate a cash register. "
bad,I did not receive consistent training and miscommunication happened constantly between employees and management. Training needs to be thoroughly developed.
bad,"Working at Macy's has improved my customer service skills, and how to be patient with customers. However,  management can be very tricky and sometimes very unorganized and unprofessional. The most enjoyable part about working at Macy's was learning about the customers and learning what their style was. It was easy to help customers find what they were looking for especially if they were loyal customers."
bad,"I worked for for a couple months and I wouldn't say I had the best experience working there. When I was left go, they didn't warn me, they just didn't call me for any more hours."
bad,Macy's will suck the life out of you and when there's nothing left to give they lay you off terrible company to work for especially with bad management
bad,Great for men and women that are not persons of color.  The schools they recruit from are PWC's and the leadership is not at all diverse.  Not meant for people who enjoy diverse work places.
bad,"The work didn't match the pay, i was in different departments, so you didn't get to know the manager. Everyday was something different, you didn't get to learn about the department that you work in, because you was in a different on the next day.  Was not consisted."
bad,"The overall work place  environment was being accountable for your assignment and sometimes others. Learning to work with no consistent store manager, but managing with the executive team in a location. The most enjoyable part is the customer and associates, just like family."
bad,"If you don't want to work at McDonalds work here probably same pay; no growth, first job experience but beyond that there is nothing special about the job if you're 16-18 go ahead if you're in your 20s do better"
bad,"I only worked during the season as a sales associate. It was very stressful. The lines were outrageously long, customers screaming at you, and constantly being yelled at by managers to get customers to open up a macys credit card."
bad,"There's a lot to learn if you're new to the field, though you're better off taking that knowledge elsewhere once you've learned it. Once you demonstrate skill in a specific position you're basically stuck there."
bad,Discounts are great. I enjoyed working for several years.  The past two years were horrible. A revolving door for employees and managers. Employees no longer treated equally.
bad,This is a good place to work if your retired and not wanting to advance. It is a great for students first time job or retiree. The company could hire more help in the area of merchandising in efforts to put out the stock.
bad,The company could be MUCH more flexible in the dress code. Wearing black to work every day was boring and I felt like I was going to a funeral and not to work because the dress code policy was so poor.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,all about the money. customers were always rude and annoying. the atmosphere was grossly competitive and it was honestly a toxic workplace environment.
bad,"working here was ok the management at the time of hire was nice if there were any issues with other employees then it was dont turn to them for help, most long term employees were uptight and rude to everyone customers included"
bad,"My experience with Macy's was for their Holiday season, I never had a manager to report to, you just print out the schedule and post in a section. Nobody told you when to take a break, however you always had to punch out on time."
bad,"If you like being micro managed by co- workers than this job is for you. The manager is hardly on sight and hard to get in contact with. The training is poor because your training is misguided because the manger is not around and the crew members lack training themselves.  The pay is terrible and there is no room for career advancement, This job is ideal for high-school or college students."
bad,"I loved to pick orders it was fun to see what all they have at Macy's warehouse. Fast paced factory to work at very strict. "
bad,I'm a really hard worker my dad jus passed away and I need to make money for my bills so plz hire me if u need help with anything I'm down to work hard and do what needs to be done
bad,The hours didn't fit my schedule well. I didn't care for working retail at Macy's The work during the holidays was tough. I worked just for the holiday season.
bad,"it was an alright job during those moments in my life. It was ok for the extra money coming in, especially when the time came for my wife to have surgery at that time"
bad,Working on commission is very hard especially when you doesn't make your commission rate I only get an hourly pay which is only $9 an hour and plus when people return purchases that they buy also go against you
bad,Unprofessional co workers and the enviorment was unstable. Customers were very rude and management handled the situation poorly. I would never go back to work there.
bad,"Not enough hours to work. I was seasonal, but didn't work a lot of hours. Management could've improved. Worked over night, couldn't get morning shifts for hours."
bad,High Amount of customers on a daily But very Little Work associates around. So Makes the area very a very slow Paced Environment. makes Employees Very Uncomfortable and stress Levels Get Worked around.
bad,Macy's is not the best place to work. There is too much competition among the different departments. There is pressure to sell more and open new accounts even if there are no customers. Management does not care about the welfare of its employees. Customers shoplift all the time but management does not care. It only worries if an employee takes something without paying.
bad,it just wanst for me it was alot of uncalled for things and plus ts slow pace i get bored very easy i wish the story was more up beat because so many people would feel better
bad,"easy work i liked my co workers they really helped me out my first week there i appreciate that so much , and Macy's is always busy so it was fun running around helping customers"
bad,"It was a true learning experience, awful LP Manager so I decided it was time to leave.  Politics and the things that go with it, so it was not the place for me."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Retail is hard on a good day, but it was a tough environment mentally. Most co-workers are nice enough but management felt oddly separated and when corporate comes in everyone feels like they are in trouble. It has an unusual culture here in Bend."
bad,this job i needed cause i was going to school during holiday season. i would not recommend this to anyone. They only cared if you showed up on time after that no one cared about your problems.
bad,They don't allow enough flexibility at work especially for students. Co-workers are very mean because it is a commission pay an everyone is on each other's throats.
bad,work for the company only six months after being laid off. the company nation wide did a cutback. I was told that all part time position was going away
bad,"Working for Macy’s was fun, however it just wasn’t my type of job environment. Otherwise it was a good job. Fun filled environment, quick paced. Friendly people. Customers were okay."
bad,"Horrible place to work. I really don't care to answer this question or do this survey."
bad,it a good place to start off at it get back on you feet. Very hard to move up and get more expercian. hardly ever get your full hours that you singe up for
bad,I gave it a bad score because management was a disgrace there as well as their corporate. I wouldn't recommend them on my worse enemy. Limited growth.
bad,"I would organized the store. Maintained the floor nice and organized also did price check and unload the truck. Also did inventory, cashier. Put the store clearance up"
bad,Very high expectations ... needs better structure and communication development ............. nice stomospher and lively customers .. potential to make good money in commision departments
bad,pay was not great. Was not happy that i was only working 15 hours a week. The only good thing was that i was able to get lunch break while i was there. Managers yell at you if you are standing at the register when you walk by.
bad,"very stressful, you had to convert your goal in the sales dept. you had to bet your goal in order to complete the week. i had this job temporary and then it became full time."
bad,Sales on day to day basis. Provided customers with check out and assistance as needed.  Culture was something fun and provided a team driven environment.
bad,Working for minimum wage to no opportunities for advancement. Long hours during holidays with no recognition. No coaching with upper management on how to meet impossible goals.
bad,"things today as far as putting clothes on the sales floor. cleaning the area making sure it was neat for customer."
bad,"Macy's is a good place to work, but the pay is cheap, Macs make more than enough to pay employees above minimum wage. Macy management could be fixed a little nothing too major."
bad,"worked there for almost a yaer and a half. never called out never late. until one day my car had a flat and I told them I was going to be late, they said its ok. 4 months after that they fired me"
bad,I worked at Macy’s for 10 months full-time and I had to transition to seasonal because of full-time school  not only did they not communicate well but  they wouldn’t value you if you didn’t sell enough Macy’s card.
bad,"Management was not good at all.  I was a beauty consultant with no training what so ever.  I was given a hand book after a few weeks.  However, part of the problem was that the manager was leaving the job as I was starting the job.  Not good training what so ever."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"The employees are great, the work loads are to much for what they ask one person to do. The pay is not up to par. Benefits are not the greatest around. Cost of living in my state is much higher that the rest of the country."
bad,Nice and friendly work place. Great sale nice and clean place to shop at. Everybody are willing to help you fine what you want or need. When they see long lines the manager always jumps in and help.
bad,"Store was unnecessarily stressful due to lack of staff, no training, and inexperience.  While the associates are great at Parks mall, upper management is not so great. Associates are willing to learn but training is not a priority leading to job frustration and stress. Associates are also asked to fill multiple roles due to lack of staff."
bad,"Pay is too low for the amount of work that must be done daily."
bad,"Over worked and over used. Do not become reliable, not at Macy's. You will get used beyond belief. I learned that it is a cut throat environment. Management doesn't care how the job gets done as long as it some how gets there. Not relaxed, constantly tending after others. The hardest part about dealing with the lead expeditor role is that you aren't a lead, you are just another hand, of course management will tell you different. Not being there to do the job."
bad,"This is a great place to work.  It's a productive family providing customer service o a daily basis.  Everyone is striving to reduce waiting in lines, speaking to customers, completing online orders, and providing knowledge about merchandise."
bad,Working in perfume promotions was a fun experience. Standing on your feet and asking customers to sample the products up for promotion in that season.
bad,I enjoyed customer service. I met a lot of wonderful people. I enjoyed discounts and gratis given. I made new friends and was able to help alot of people
bad,"When managers are afraid you will take their job they no longer want you around. "
bad,"Since it is a big store depending which location you work for it is very difficult for you to get to know anyone high ranking, also the managers flip flop a lot so you have no good communication with the managers"
bad,Worked early mornings so that was a plus. Just the low pay and poor management were a turn off. I liked the discount that the employees received especially around Christmas time
bad,Managers let their favorite employees do anything they want while forcing others to pick up the slack. It Does not matter how hard you work. You spend about half your break walking to the break room.
bad,"No communication, only micromanagement. Good work is hardly ever appreciated, only the negative is pointed out in most cases. The salary doesn't match what they ask of their workers"
bad,"They at work Macy's is stress and to much regulation, is calls after calls and receiving many work orders.I have to do cash transfers of an account also I have to call credit bureau to open accounts or increase or closed. ect."
bad,"I worked during the holiday season at Macy's.  While it helped fill an employment gap, it was not a pleasant experience."
bad,"A  unorganized machine. The only way working for this company can be enjoyable, depends on management. Job training. you must use your common sense don't depend on help with handling customer issues."
bad,Typical warehouse work environment. During their peak season they do pay more but that is always temporary. The pay is decent for the amount of work but it can be a very boring job.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I worked at Macy's as a Shipping and Receiving Associate in Short Hills, NJ. The pay at Macy's is ridiculously low considering all the work they except you to do. The management at this location is really unorganized and lack communication between employees and management. I would only recommend high school or college students to work here."
bad,personally I think its a very corrupt company. Ive personally told managers even LP about associates committing fraud and they don't care as long as numbers are being met. You don't advance in the company based on skills it really only matters how close you are with the current managers ect. They demand and pressure you constantly for so many things at times its unrealistic. Ive known associates who had to quit due to stress and anxiety that Macys gave them. I do not suggest working here.
bad,"I like working with macy""s it is I real good work place helping customers greeting them when they come in contact with you I relly like working there the employees are real friendly to me have always helped me when I needed help with helping the customers"
bad,macys was a good place to work. I enjoyed my coworkers and discount. I wished the scheduling was better. my scheduled was changed last minute but I tried to be flexible and understanding of the coverage.
bad,Working at Macy's you are just a number out of a hundred. I hated working here. Management is very aggressive and likes to put you down. The pay isn't great and it's difficult because it is an extremely busy environment.
bad,Working at Macy's as my first job was not great. Staff quit all the time and we had new management very frequently. Too much work and not too much pay. Don't recommend this place.
bad,It wasn't that much fun working the women shoe department but the customer was always right problems were asking people if they wanted to open a credit account with Macy's
bad,Great when working for the holidays. Employee discount is amazing for those Christmas presents. Plenty of long hours if needed and wanted during the holiday period.
bad,"no living wage offered whatsoever unless you were in management or on commission."
bad,"Really inconsistent hours, sometimes won't work at all for a week. My current manager doesn't really do anything but sit on her phone all day. Employee discount is really bad."
bad,"The job was seasonal. I enjoyed meeting new people and sharpen my organizational skills. However, the manager was absent most of the time and was no very helpful."
bad,The tide comes and goes with Macy's.  This is definitely not a place for a retail worker to build a career any more.  It is just a stepping stone to your bigger picture.
bad,"competitive commission sales, no commission on sales for seasonal workers, poor management , never fully stocked with products, slow paced, you are not able to take advantage of your employee  discount without using their credit card."
bad,Working for Macy’s wasn’t terrible but it wasn’t excellent. I would work so many days and be swamp with so many customers. I basically worked manager hours. Scheduling the right number of associate needed was always a problem that it became a problem for breaks.
bad,"Everything at Macy's was temporary, very little hours, very few full time employees."
bad,"While the culture was fun, light, and had little to no stress, the compensation and advancement opportunities were lacking. Not an ideal career place of employment."
bad,"Favoritism was something that was very noticeable within this company. They made it difficult to advance and expected more than what the pay was worth. Their main focus was credit, customer service and sales goals. ""The customer is ALWAYS right"", even when they were not. It felt catty, and there was a lot of gossip, even among managers. With no physical HR it was near impossible to get important things done (such as LOA's, FMLA's, filing complaints, etc.)"
bad,I been working in Macy’s for 3 years and I advanced twice but when I applied for seasonal supervisor they gave it to someone with no experience and expected me to train them. The person lasted only two weeks with the position. It’s all about who can kiss a** better.
bad,The manger at the time of 2015-2016 when i was there had favoritism. It was hard to work in her area because she would let the ones she like to do the easy work and everyone else have to work hard.
bad,work at macys was so stressful no good management late with pay sometimes short with pay not good to pay bills staff where mean no paid breaks hr sucks
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Management was absolutely horrendous.  I was actually scolded for greeting the store manager while a customer was in the building.  They make dealing with the general public appealing by contrast.
bad,Between the chaotic changes in what your supposed to do and no real management on the floor. When I worked at Macy's it was a reminder of what not to do at a business.
bad,The managers are very rude. Coworkers are not helpful. Pay is really bad compared to the tasks.Customers are rude as well. It is a very stressful job.
bad,"Macys is an ok place to work, just go in and do the job you're asked and clock out.  it can use better Job security and overall security. the discounts are cool."
bad,"Its hard to say, they put pressure on you to get people to sign up for a credit card, you have to get about 5 a week or they will put pressure on you to plus sell as well."
bad,"Macys runs on a point system, I had to rush my daughter to the ER and they pointed me for the day. I passed out on the floor and left and got pointed."
bad,Co-workers always make your work environment better no matter where you are. We were like a close family in my department and even though I no longer work there I still keep in touch with most of my old coworkers
bad,"Their scheduling was all over the place and work environment was chaotic."
bad,its was a temp job that had promise but fell through due to lack of management. feel that they could of done a better job of keeping things neat and invested more in different departments as half the Lp stuff was falling apart.
bad,There is zero consistency. Some times it is 6 to 9 p.m. other times it is 930 to 4. No guaranteed days.  Computer generated schedules from out of state create a diffusion of responsibility. You can't have a schedule out side of Macy's.
bad,"Morning shift is better because you get to accomplish everything before the store opens up to customers, and afternoon shift sucks because the store is packed and no customers let you finish anything."
bad,Managers are obnoxious and rude. They show favoritism to certain employees. No training for certain areas of the job. Do not get sick because even if you pass out at work they will not excuse your absence and you will lose your job.
bad,"A typical work day is busy with assisting various customers with locating specific, providing product information, restocking shelves & setting up displays. Workplace culture is very competitive in achieving a certain amount of sales. Hardest part of the job is dealing with over demanding & unreasonable customers. Most enjoyable is learning the product information"
bad,Did not worked to long in off to give a real statement. Started being very confusing and no good direction dew to new management. Hours of schedules changed creating a very unhappy staff
bad,Working there was was very difficult because they demand you make everyone that comes in to the store to sign up for a credit card no matter if they have one already or not.
bad,as a whole Macy's was a decent place to work I loved it when I first started.I was told I would be give the tools to move up in the company which I was not given many. All of the employees worked well with each other and if there were issues we did feel we could bring them up to management. Most Management was there for you to help encourage you and give you any feed back you may need. I believe as the stores are closing it is causing issues working there. we are not given many hours so we feel like we did not have time to do all we needed and  have the one on one time we liked with our customers. Also many positions have been removed from the company causing many to lose there jobs.
bad,"work is ok, but it can be really boring at times. lunch time is only 30 mins and if you eat slow than that's pretty bad, most people do take an hour but that just means you stay at work longer."
bad,Macy's is a typical retail environment. The management are obviously stressed out and just trying to make it through the day. The employees work very hard for very little.
bad,"Started out very good. Went from 10 employees to 3 employees. Wanting the same amount of work done!! Understand that Macys is trying to cut costs, but they are doing it the wrong way."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,over worked and under paid. I learned that they really don't care about their employees. Pleasing the mgrs. is all they care about and their bottom line
bad,"At first I was thrilled to work at such a well know facility. Once I began working everything was great, then my hours began to get cut back for no known reason."
bad,i didnt enjoy working at macys that mcuh but i did respect the employees. i did learn a bit more about working with groups of people. i appreciate my time there.
bad,"Management would not train you on how to do things, they would simply expect you to already be ready to jump into something entirely new with no information and if you did something wrong despite vocalizing that you weren’t trained outside of a video on how to respond to what they asked to be done, they would reprimand you and treat you like less than qualified unless you pulled a rabbit out of your hat and some how teach yourself how to do what they asked right without breaking policies they never told you about. Management never prioritized training especially not in asset protection. Despite all their rules until you can apprehend they never physically go through the motions of how to apprehend someone or help with an apprehension. They will get mad if you don’t do it right however."
bad,Commision sales was great not a career at anytime unless you are thinking about going into management which I did but the management team was incompetent
bad,The managers were mean. The environment was unprofessional . Management allowed employees to talk about each other. They did not value hard work and the hours were unstable.
bad,"Fast paced, it was only a temp position for me. It was an okay company to work for if you are in need of work as soon as possible. Because I was only temp not sure what else I can say, I didn't qualify for benefits."
bad,"not friendly people they suck really bad. they let people come to work drunk and not work. the parking lot to big, bathrooms too small nasty restrooms."
bad,Doing the actual job isn't the problem it's the management. The manager was like a child from High School. Such as bringing personal business and attitudes into the work place. No Bueno.
bad,"Macy's as a company has absolutely no loyalty to their employees. Layoffs are becoming a common occurrence and there is no job security for anyone. You slowly get hours chipped away from you and scheduling is a nightmare because there is rarely enough coverage on the floor due to budget cuts and mismanagement of work schedules. Customers are used to getting away with finding loopholes for extra discounts because of weak management and fear of bad surveys. There is no manager support when it comes to customers bad behavior and because customers know they can basically get away with whatever they want if they threaten to complain online. I work in a commissioned area and saw the amount I was promised ""restructured"" to make less than I was promised. Macy's doesn't care about their employees. End of story."
bad,"This was a short lived job. I did not enjoy this. I onlt worked there for a month."
bad,"High turnover of leadership, Demanding work environment while most of the people do good work the Sr Leadership makes it hard to get things done. The Culture can be very hard to adjust to"
bad,Wish this company had more to offer their employees. It's basically a minimum wage job and they make you work harder than what you get paid. Opening credit cards is pushed on employees and that's pretty much it.
bad,"You wear pumps and pearls, along with a black power suite for 15 hours a day... that does not really connect to every walk of life. The environment was stuffy and difficult to enjoy. There was beautiful merchandising and products, but awful work-life balance."
bad,"This job was fine just a little heavy. On hot days the warehouse was like an oven t was super hot and not matter how much water you drink you could not cool down, But on cold days the warehouse was freezing cold and they wouldn't let you wear hoodies and it was hard for some people to find a sweater with no hoodies."
bad,"Hard work, no respect, terrible bosses, awful company, tolerable pay. Completely insecure in their job offers, mass firings regularly, zero human compassion anywhere."
bad,Its retail. Quick turn around. Poor Management. Huge cuts made every January. You are Just a number. The pay for what was done would have been more fulfilling as volunteer work. Loved what I did but over all working there even as a support member was depressing to watch a company slowly fall apart because they dont want to keep up to date.
bad,"As a visual merchandiser at Macy's I expected to be paid fairly and given the time of day by my management team.  My experience was the opposite.  I was paid minimum wage, which at the time was less than $8/hour, but I was fresh out of college and didn't know any better.  My management team would touch base with me in the morning and then I'd never see them again as they said in their office.  When I asked for days off I was constantly asked if I really needed it or if I could move them around, making for zero work life balance.  When I assisted with a project and tried to leave when my shift was done I was told it was unacceptable because the project wasn't finished (even though there were others to finish it would were scheduled longer).  I told them I needed to go home because I had a 40 minute drive and there was a blizzard outside.  Their response was, ""It doesn't look that bad. (to which they laughed because we could see it was white out conditions outside)"" and then made me go back to work (on my way home three hours later I went in the ditch due to icy roads...).  I felt a general lack of caring at Macy's.  In fact, their sales associates were paid more than I was and never seemed to be doing their job (I would have to hunt them down when a customer needed to be rung up).  Oh, and to get your small staff discount you had to sign up for their credit card..."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,The enviorment and staff were horrid. No one knew anything and to not know anything you were harshly rideculed. no training. horrible enviorment and very unhappy settings'
bad,"this place isnt ran in st louis anymore, thank goodness. the work was easy you sat in a cubicle took your break when you wanted created your own schedule and entered items into their ordering system to make available for order."
bad,"This was one of the most stressful jobs I ever had. The customers could be very rude and management was terrible. Getting time off was ridiculous and being sick, they would want you to work on your death bed! Terrible!"
bad,Great place to meet people and learning their style. Workers are nice to work with and you cant beat the discounts. Overall good environment to work at.
bad,"Macy's is a good place to work. But it's no room for growth.The average working families are not the same as five to ten years ago. With a big family a lot of problems come about due to sick kids,school,etc. It's understandable that their productivity come,first and maybe i wasn't ready for the quick past of working at that time with it being flu season.All and all Macy's is a good place to work. But you must be prepared for being laid off after the holiday season end..."
bad,My job at security guard was to secure the doors and secure employees exit so it was simple and apprehend shoplifters Discounts was great the job was OK
bad,"Pro:"
bad,Talking with consumers or Debt Settlement Agencies all day on the phones. I always enjoyed talking and settling deals with the DSA. The hardest part for me was talking with most of the consumers.
bad,"high school intern, worked once a week at NIH, R&W provides a variety of convenient services and products such as: film processing services, printing of business cards, dry cleaning, greeting cards and gift wrap, along with a large selection of gift items for any event. During my 4 years that I were there I also experience the fundraisers setup."
bad,it was busy and productive. At times it was  a lot of stress working with the customers but overall enjoyed my fellow co workers. The pay rate should have been more.
bad,"Was told one pay rate, then went thru the final process. Was told I can only get 11$hr. That's what the most they could even offer. The manager and the store seemed really good to work for, but don't believe everything they say to offer you. I was dead serious about starting as soon as possible."
bad,"I used to have a work schedule for school and I still wasn't getting enough hours at the job,  the manager use to yell at all the meetings never again"
bad,"Pretty slow and boring. A lot of the time there is nothing to do and it's clear why the company is declining. Management bases your character off of sales, but your sales numbers will be low due to the low amount of foot traffic."
bad,I sign in and I either put clothes away or I help wait on customers. I learned that some managers don't take responsibility for anything. The most enjoyable was working with my co-workers.
bad,Over worked under paid. No rewards I worked very hard. My sales was high and the application I recruited for new customer credit cards.clothing good !
bad,"•	Operated cash registers and assisted customers in locating merchandise based on their needs "
bad,Okay temporary job with flexible schedule. Good for students. Not a great place to make a career at.  Poor management and stressful job with low pay. Enjoy the discount
bad,"The atmosphere was bad. The management constantly was asking people to stay and work after punching out, that meant staying with no pay. THey staying longer was hard on the employees who were taking bus to work. Staying longer was forcing people them to run  to the bus stop to catch the last bus at night or even missing it. Management was pulling commissioned employees to work in non commission department depriving them of opportuning to make money in the department that they were hired for."
bad,"Prepare and complete orders for delivery or pickup according to schedule (load, pack, wrap, label, ship), Receive and process warehouse stock products, Perform inventory controls and keep quality standards high, Keep a clean and safe working environment, Complete diary logs into inventory, Report any discrepancies, Operate and maintain preventively warehouse vehicles and equipment, Follow quality service standards and comply with procedures, rules and regulations"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"A supervisor, given the same responsibilities and held to the same standards as a sales manager, but makes a quarter of what a sales manager makes. Also, a lead was recently hired that is making $4 more per hour than the supervisor. It is incredibly disheartening considering the supervisor's work ethic and previous dedication to the company. "
bad,"like with any job there are good position and positions and bad positions and good bosses and bad bosses "
bad,"Very stressful, always a fight between associates for customers. Too much pressure to sale Macy's credit cards, if you don't meet the numbers they cut your hrs."
bad,Over worked underpaid management only looks out for Management while employees deal with back lash of Upper management. Supervisors don't look out for the department and we always get the low end of Everything.
bad,I was working for another company when I was recruited from a manager that worked at Macys. I was offered a pay increase if I went with Macys. When I stated working for Macys the manager was not understanding at all. The managers attitude changed after a month of me working there. Manager left after a few months of me being there and got a new one. The store environment seemed cold and not warming. Didn't feel like a family. Managers were in their own world and  seem to not care about their associates. I could say that my co-workers made it fun to be there.
bad,"The managers do not seem willing to help, you are not trained properly. You are put through the wringer and all for low pay. There is too much to do and not enough help. Managers will give you quite the reprimand for going home sick, and will completely disregard the fact you've gone above and beyond in other instances."
bad,"Their is no work, life , balance in Management positions. Compensation minimal, fast paced environment you have to be able to adjust on the fly."
bad,"Macy's is stuck in a weird place.  They're trying to provide ""great customer service"" while trying to keep up with the online business.  Sales associates and support staff are EXPECTED to serve two roles.  Sales associates are required to serve the customer, clean up their department, service the fitting rooms every 30 minutes AND fulfill online orders.  Pretty hard to accomplish all those tasks with a line full of customers IN the store!!!  Support staff are required to merchandise areas, conduct price markdowns, change signage and help customers and ring up sales when sales associates aren't available..... which is a majority of the time!!!  And you only make $9.00 and hour."
bad,"What is there to say, it is retail, competitive and sometime cut throat, but that depends on the associates you work with. My manager was one of the great ones. She was a very cool and reasonable person."
bad,Nice place to work. Sr leadership is very much supportive and engaged. All departments works well together. I enjoy seeing front line staff being promoted and engaged.
bad,"Macys is a very flexible place to work. They pretty much will work with you on anything whether it be school, another job or personal life. Great place to work if you like interacting with and helping customers. Pay not so great and you only get hours if you are a sales associate. Support associates hardly get any hours even during the holiday."
bad,"Part of the difficulty of brick and mortar retail companies like Macy's is that the multi-directional approach to keeping the business alive(Buy Online/Pickup In-Store) is causing disfunctionality throughout the managerial hierarchy. Additionally, the responsibilities of sales associates have become so taxing that they cannot focus adequately on the customer care aspect of their position while their compensation remains the same."
bad,"It's a great place to find your footing if you've never had a job before! Recommended if you're just looking to gain experience. The customers are pretty rude, though."
bad,"DRAMA filled work environment. MANY of the  employees need a life. The company should hire women and men , not boys and girl that think that the place is called MACY High School."
bad,Although it was that bad of a job for all that I did at that company I felt wasn't acknowledge. Almost like doing the job of a personal shopper merchandiser and etc.....
bad,"Say one thing, and they do another"
bad,"The corporate culture is outdated and stale."
bad,"Not sure how to grow if you aren't willing to do sales.  Opportunitues aren't great.  A high turnover rate.  Too much expected for low pay.  Their expectations are unreasonable, and it shows in their customer service."
bad,"I had really bad manager in my area of the store, pay was bad and hours were horrible. The only thing I liked about the job was the people I met while working for the company."
bad,"7-Eleven was not the best company to work for, well at least my location was not. I gained a lot of knowledge, but there was a lot of expectations and short staff."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"this is a great start for first time jobs "
bad,Choice if managers sucks all the good ones quit. The bad managers are staying at were promoted and never get in trouble.  Over all I just didn't like my experience.
bad,"Unorganized, discriminatory culture. No Guidance on training and salary is very low compared to the work expected. Unfair policies and HR & Supervisors is not very helpful."
bad,I did like the job here at Macys. However the Salary was the reason why I left. I was unable to pay my monthly bills with what I was getting paid.  Had in been paid more I would still be there.
bad,It was a great place to make money. Just not much more. Working here was very stressful and wasn't worth the sweat and tears. They have a lot of things to work on here.
bad,"employees are fun and great. helping customers look for what they are looking for.  ring and handle payment. handle returns , customer servive top priority. management has changed so much"
bad,"I got hired onto the company in June but didnt not start working until late July, they did not care about the employees. No call backs nor comunication on what your shift was."
bad,"the company itself its okay, the job enviroment youre push to meet an impossible goals and as complicated as this may sound when it came down to commission, if you didnt meet your daily goal you basically owe them money, so when you met your goal it towards paying them. so the only days you were able t make some kind of commission was during holidays. Associates that have been there the longest were very greedy  & sneaky. You were asked to do so much for such a low pay."
bad,I did not like working here at all. The pay was cheap. The mangers treated bad. The customers were sooo rude. Having to clean out the dressing rooms were the worst.
bad,"I worked for seasonal told I would get call back for a position, never was called. I did enjoy working with the co workers and the manager. I worked my hardest because its how I perform but just felt like my hard work didn't go notice.. I'm thankful for the experience in retail, but I just would not work again for Macys.."
bad,Nothing new in new company. Too many chiefs not enough indians. Not enough pay. No ones job is secure by far.  Hardest part is standing for long hours and not being appreciated for your hard work.
bad,A typical retail environment. Some associates will work with the customer's best interest in mind while others do not. Sales are oftentimes taken by associates that didn't earn them which leads to performance issues with management.
bad,Internet sales are eroding Macy's ability to be the all-encompassing department store it once was. It is simply changing with the times. Don't expect to find a traditional career here.
bad,Overall this company was great to me and they really work with me far as hours and pay but at the end of the day it was enough for the amount of work i was putting in. Would i work there again? Yes maybe as a manager but any position under pays to little.
bad,"I worked overnight at Macy's in Manhattan New York, The manga staff can improve their management skills. They would micromanage their employees. That was uncomfortable, to say the least."
bad,"its a very dissapointing company, they talk about loyalty but cant be loyal.and i have nothing more or less to say about this company. if i only i can go to preview without posting 150 word"
bad,Macy's has a full week of nothing. I worked two days and the only days is/are the days of the truck comes and it varies in size. When it's a small truck I work just one day and that's all.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job was working with customers and building long-term customer relationships.  The culture is two-faced:  management told us to be ""empowered"" and make decisions that will ensure the customers ""leave the store happy. You do not have to always call your manager.  Be Macy's MAGIC.""  But that's not how it really was.....I learned a great deal about merchandising, worked closely with vendors and made many friends."
bad,pay sucks..there is no commission even though they might claim there is... the only thing it is good for is picking up girls. don't settle for it. Move on
bad,It was an ok job for a new graduate before transitioning into my career. The better you did the more weekends and holidays you worked. That seems more to be a punishment instead of a reward.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,A typical day at work was a slow pace but easy job . I learned how to multi-task by answering the phone and helping customers by completing there transactions or telling guest about our promotions and advertising the Macy's Discount card.
bad,"Work, life  balance is hard to find. Pay and advancement were challenging. Upper management set unrealistic goals in aa economically  challenging time."
bad,Macy's does not usually get super busy but I enjoy working there even though I am ready for a different and better job. The managment is great and he co workers are nice
bad,"Very stressful job, management expects so much out of you with little to no training. Expects you to know everything without actually teaching you anything."
bad,"macys is a pretty calm repetitive job , you do the same task everyday . there is no excitement in these type of jobs . overall its a good job for someone that's just looking for a calm job"
bad,"NO ONE and I mean no one is ever aware of what there job title entails them to do. You have the bottom feeders acting like bosses and bosses trying to play both sides. Its a stressful job, if you actually care about job performance but if you just need a paycheck to get you by for a hot min, I promise this is the job for you. Check your Facebook or walk around and shop. You wont be fired unless you steal something. Good LUCK"
bad,"Assisting customers, helping them purchase the company product is the ultimate goal. Agreeing with the customers on their liking is most fun, but not having what they want is most disappointing."
bad,Great job opportunity but they need better management. More pay because they ask you to do more than your job  title says. More hours an learn how to communicate with all their employees.
bad,"I walked in ten minutes early before the required time always, just in case. You never know what could happen last minute. I would sign in, I worked at the hand bag section so I organized and went over the entire section to make sure its tidy and clean. Then I'd come back to the register, help out with customers. Occasionally, an item a customer wanted wasn't there, so I'd have to search it up for them to see if we have it and check in the back room for more."
bad,"Management needs improvement, they over work you and don't compensate you for going the extra mile. The store itself was a older building and smelled like moth balls and stock rooms smelled"
bad,"The job was good to start in, but there was no growth, not many benefits, and communication was low. However, the morale was good and the people are enjoyable."
bad,"The attendance policy is so ridiculous. Many employees will take advantage of the point system and call out when they feel like it. Then, don't get in trouble."
bad,Macy's was very stressful. It was a slow job. Somedays were fun but overall the management made it stressful to work there. I wouldn't recommend this job .
bad,"I worked as a support member, and they don't give two f-cks about us. The only time any of the managers in my department talked to me was when they wanted to complain about something I did. The sales managers were nicer to me than my own. Whenever I picked up a shift for sales, I enjoyed it more than working in support. "
bad,"Not a good work environment, too much work drama.  Pressure from management to force customer's to open Macy's credit accounts if quota not attained points taken off and you faced termination."
bad,"This is not a good company to work for. The pay is low, hours are inconsistent and management favors some employees over others. Its very hot in the summer."
bad,"Working in Fine Jewelry Dept was fast paced .There was a lot of focus on reaching sales goal.Often had to work over time,but was paid for it.Positives was interacting with customers."
bad,unloading and unpacking the merchandise to prepare product for the sales floor. working at a fast pace to meet designated end time. learning to be a team player
bad,Not enough hours. Wish thy had more of a set schedule because it makes it harder to plan life around it. The lack of decent management doesnt help to make it a better place to work.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,the managers were very rude & showed favoritism.. tthey wouldnt aloow us to be ourselves yet stay professional but other than that my coworkers were amazing to work with & it was never a dull moment
bad,bull that's all I have to say it felt like everyone working there were zombies and the ones working with customers hated their jobs and had to put a fake personality and I sow workers being broken
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a team and making the store look amazing. It gets your creative juices flowing and proud of what you can create and accomplish.
bad,"very busy work load on a daily basis."
bad,It's a typical retail job. every day is the same. The management is awful. It's a diverse workplace. There's nothing hard about working in a store. The most enjoyable the people
bad,"The business was inviting to all nationalities and cultures. "
bad,I never worked so much for so little.  Multiple schedule changes during the week and even during the day made a work/life  balance extremely difficult.
bad,"They really don't know what they're doing. Its a circus in there and everyone is just apart of the show. There isn't really any coordination and the employees are treated like slaves. So, if a manager messes up and only one person is scheduled over an entire department then you have to fix their mess pretty much. Security is pretty trash too. I understand they're there to protect the merchandise and there for our well being supposedly but that's not the case at all."
bad,I have been in Retail for over 20 years and this is the worst place by far. If it wasn't for the people I worked with and the ease of picking shifts I wouldn't of lasted as long as I did.
bad,"If you're a college student needing a few hours and a little additional income, this is ideal. "
bad,"Overall great work environment. Management always willing to assist with any needs. Great place to begin your career, and gain experience. Personally had a great experience."
bad,"Working retail is something that requires much patience. Customer satisfaction will be your biggest obstacle. Dealing with upset people, messy stores, and or clothes sorting is a big pain at times."
bad,"My manager was the worst i never got any hours time went by slow i hated it honestly, but you get paid and a job is a job, so why not just try it out add something to your resume."
bad,It's all about sales and the Macy's credit cards. They basically shame you if you don't meet your weekly goals. It's high school all over again. Management  was never around
bad,"Job consisted of too much work , looking for fulfillment if you're scheduled in the mornings and also not flexible. A computer determines our schedule and it's hard to get days off that you really need. Also it takes forever just to receive points. We have to seek customers and keep the area clean. It's too much work for not enough associates."
bad,"Working for Macy's is just like working for any other retail job. I work for the support team flex position and I regret ever taking it because the hours is not enough. If there is only one truck a week  they only schedule you for 9 hours, or 12 hours a week but they don't want you to have a second job because they want open availability. No one can survive on a 12 hour work week. Currently looking for something full time."
bad,"Enjoyed the challenges of the job, but hard to be noticed for efforts.  Company streamlined and sent all work to NY.  We were told we could interview for NY positions but there were in fact no positons available."
bad,"I am a college student and I worked as a beauty advisor part time. The managers always expected me to put the job before my school work. I had to resign my position because it was too much for me because of school. If you have the time for all the commitments, I would recommend this job for you."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,a just good place to work depends on of your coworkers around you. management needs to be more involve with the requests that associate is asking for and for to benefit the store.
bad,"the culture at the workplace did not promote a good work environment for the workers. Management kept cutting back on workers, to the point where it would be hard to help the customers who had questions, or needed help like we had been able to before."
bad,"There is no such thing as management. If you have a problem with a coworker they will let you know that you are easily replaced. They wont fix problems between coworkers, they expect you to fix it. If you are a great seller they will listen to you, but if you aren't don't expect to be heard."
bad,"The managers and supervisors were very good people and very helpful in my experience. But the culture between the co-workers (at least at the store I worked) was very poor. A lot of standoffishness, a lot of rudeness.  Just not very positive vibes among the actual co-workers"
bad,"They expect you to smile all day, and sign people up for credit cards all day, while employees with seniority don't. But beware, if they hire just before the holidays for a part time position, they might find a reason to fire you at the end of the holidays."
bad,This was one of the more unfortunate jobs I've had to witness. The treat there new recruits unkindly after buttering you up for the first day. They were dishonest in there work ethic and unreasonable with your schedule.
bad,I didn't like it here due to the hours I was hired part time and was only working THREE hours a day. Not worth it. The staff was not bad some friendly people.
bad,Fast pace laid back kinda job you have to be able to wash dishes at a high speed and be able to work a big dishwasher and some times help out with food prep
bad,I didn't enjoy my time at Macy's. I worked entirely to hard for little pay and was later laid off for no reason. i wasn't even given an explanation...
bad,"Start at 6am and work until 3:00 but the day goes by fast. We stay busy all day and the job is often physically demanding but also can be fun. The hardest part of the job is working the first 4 hours in the dark and no heat or air conditioning. Also the shelves, hardware and mannequins are not in very good condition and are dangerous. If you get hurt on the job, the company looks for ways to get out of paying for your time off and medical treatment. The best part of the job is the people I work with."
bad,The management position is very demanding and you are not compensated for the long hours worked. There is not a lot of opportunity for career growth.
bad,I was seasonal. the sales goals are near impossible to meet. No commission ever. I would not prefer sales again. Stock room was two flights of stairs to run up and down all day
bad,An hourly retail environment even though the office is not located in a retail store. Out of date hardware and lack of technology support for such a large and recognized corporation.
bad,"This company does not know how to treat there employees, and they want to run you raged, and they do not really give you anything for the work that you do"
bad,"I woked here briefly and didn't like it. The job was boring, I was rarely entertained. I basically just showed up, did my job and went home."
bad,"hardly any communication and support, very competitive between associates with lack of guidance and planning. consistent traffic and open work hours."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I folded clothes, did recovery, helped out customers with purchase, cleaned the fitting rooms, and there is not enough employees, and managers to go around to help.the policy was terrible as well."
bad,"To be honest, I was a little disappointed with Macy's management. I never once was introduced to my manager, and was not able to get a hold of her when I needed help. They really worked with ""you're on your own"" kind of attitude. And while it is okay to work on a project by yourself, I think you have to be able to have great skills to work in a group and collaborate with others."
bad,"All the co workers were nice I had fun with them cuz they were friendly "
bad,I desperately needed a job so I accepted the Macy's job. I worked overnight almost 12 hour shifts for around $8 hr. I did my job a long with my supervisor's for the same pay. I was promised a raise but never got it.
bad,This was a holiday part time position. Cannot rate it right now. This is a very long application and I don't have time to spend on this all day.
bad,There was a lot going on and there are too many people to try and talk to about getting something fixed. It is good for seasonal or college students. A lot of walking and lifting. A lot of crazy customers so you have to be a people person
bad,"Macy's is a horrible place to work, my first day working there was on black friday and they put me a register with little to no training at all, it was a nightmare Ill never work there again."
bad,Can be a great place to work if you have a passion for retail sales management.  I did not have a positive experience with district management and found them to be insincere.
bad,"dealing with the customers that are disrespectful and wrong and still hold my composer. The customers are always right, the promote within the company to the associates that been working there and knows the business for years."
bad,"I worked there for awhile, almost a year. The managers are more disrespectful than the customers. I actually didn't dislike working, I just disliked the fact that my managers were not being understanding to my family situations."
bad,I will neither endorse or slander this company for survey purposes. If you wish to discuss this company please contact me directly.
bad,"hard to do your job when everyone working with you doesn't speak a lic of english"
bad,ringing up purchases on the cash register and getting them to open charge accounts. Stocking the shelves and opening packages.
bad,My hours were pretty short at the time with no days. My co workers made up for the short pay. The job was overall easy and stress free. I learned how to operate the register in this particular job.
bad,"Learn a lot from people"
bad,"its ok place to work "
bad,"Love working with different people , also like one day and vip sales, there products are good and can apply coupons in many things ! Love variety of fragrances and cosmetics."
bad,"I did not get enough hours and when I went in for a full-time interview, they lied and then tried to get me to take a part-time job."
bad,"Management is terrible for not really caring about their co-workers and being difficult to contact. For example: when following their policies and telling them to a customers, whenever the manager finally comes to help out with a situation, they'll completely ignore the policies and agrees with the customer while making the workers look really bad in front of them. Turn-a-arounds rates are very high for reasons some being, payroll, treatment, hours, and growth within the company. Veterans workers are always not too good to work with since they get really competitive to get sells often stealing customers away from other, yelling from across the departments at them by ""greeting them"", arguing on who gets the sells with one another in front of the customers. Newbies are just there not really caring since they use Macy's to look for something else."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,what I think about Macy's in Manhasset is that they need to change the management and also need to increase pay for the amount of work that is completed by every hard worker.
bad,The hardest part of this job is dealing with rude customers and still smiling. Average day consist of cleaning and organizing the floors. the interaction of customers can be both a delight and a nightmare. Management focus more on numbers of sales and credit.
bad,"Macy's call center was a very fun place to work, we were able to resolve customer's issues and be their personal shopper. It was very diverse and fast paced."
bad,long hours. not enough breaks. good pay.nice people.very strict dresscode. patient when training me. made me work an overnight my first shift. threw me in during black Friday before completing training. was overwhelmed and under prepared.
bad,"I would either open up the store and restock merchandise, or I would unload the truck, do sales on the floor, package and send off online orders, or set up tables and furniture for the store."
bad,"Macy's, along with other retail giants are similar. Their employees work long hours on their feet for little compensation and healthcare benefits. The employee discounts are okay, however, the commission rates are not competitive."
bad,This store is no longer open. It was closed down about a year ago. Macy reduces a number of stores. Before closing giving a minimum of 10 to 15 hours for each employee.
bad,"I love my co-workers and they make my job more fun. I love being knowledgeable with new products and learning new things everyday. I've definitely learned many things working here for a couple of months. Management isn't the greatest and they don't care about their employees. They don't appreciate the hard work we employees do. Overall, I believe that this job was a great stepping stone for me in order to start my career in the cosmetic industry."
bad,The work was easy but made hard by management no organization towards the end of my time there it was improving I stayed on as an on call to train.
bad,"checked their website if there is available time shift. I've learned a lot of patience waiting from my supervisor if they need an  associates for recovery for that day, not organized enough to handle the training of newly hired employees. Luckily I belong to this group that are very helpful to me. The hardest part of this job is the physical aspect but the best part is being able to help people in their shopping needs, because Ive' noticed that most of the customers are elderly, they need help in carrying their things into the service center area."
bad,No life balance staff pretty much unhappy but can do better if coached better.holidays are fun but busy. Staff not motivated as much.
bad,It was ok. I would rather not work there again. Thats about it. I have nothing more to say about this company. Thank you. Have a nice day.
bad,"Women's shoes department is the most busiest department in the that Macy's branch I am working with. I have regained my ""people skills"" confidence. Since I have not been working for the past fifteen years. And this job is my first job since and considering that I am relatively new in this country. My manager's expectation is so high that she expects me to get the technical side of my job done 100% perfect. Most of the co-workers are supportive though. The hardest part of the job is when I get to deal with advance transaction with the Point of Sale system because I have no actual training yet with such, and the manager expects me to deliver without mistake. The most enjoyable part though is when I see the smile in my customer's face because they got the right shoes they wanted, and they are very verbal in showing their appreciation for my hard work."
bad,"Working as a shoe expeditor at Macy's Herald Square can be compared as working on a plantation field. The managers are not qualified for one, and on the other hand, the team members resemble people who didn't even get a High School Diploma. It is the worst place that I have ever worked at."
bad,"Co workers were great but department goals are almost impossible to meet when there is not enough personnel and the salary is minimum wage, all the expectations and responsibilities demand a higher wage."
bad,Minimum hours were given. New store and associates. Nice environment. Thee work there is fairly easy and the pay is pretty much fair as well.
bad,"Over the past 15 years Macys  has increased its demands on its employees  without offering any increase in pay. . salespeople must keep  adding new clients on a weekly basis and are expected to call them   regularly . There must be at least 200  clients in a salesbook.  Opening new credit accounts  , at least 2 per week . People in commission departments  there are making the same wages they made in the 1980's !!!"
bad,Overall a good place to work. Great employees. I didnt like the shortage of hours fo I was barely making part time hours. I like that the ages of emloyess varied because I am a middle aged single mom of 4.
bad,"The work space was disorganized and hours were barely available to be worked. My co-workers were nice but some had attitude problems. I learned that patience is key when working with others and to always remained focus on the task you are given. Management was decent but not always great. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping my customers the best I could to keep them happy. The hardest part of my job was always running from department to department helping my co workers with what they needed help with when i was done doing my tasks. A typical day at Macy's was clocking in and heading straight to the register and when things were a bit to messy on the work floor, I would come off the register and tidy up anything that needed to be cleaned, and I would do that back and forth through out my shift."
bad,"At first Macy's was flexible with work hours, but while I was working there I was a full time student as well and days that I advised them in advance that I had class they would schedule you to work. Management was not that great, would play favorite and were only nice when they needed something. The only nice thing was the co-worker and lifelong friends."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,The pay was decent but the hours ranged from 12-14 per week. There was lots of pressure from management to finish unloading trucks in a short time frame. myself as well as co-workers were frustrated by this.
bad,a very bad place to work I experienced a very hostile work environment Hispanic male employees were treated very badly and males in general were being accused of many different types of violations in comparison to female associates
bad,"it was okay overall, the hours were good pay could have been better,"
bad,They over work you to death. They are not flexible. The salary is horrible. The management also takes their powers to their heads.
bad,"To me retail wasnt a career that you can grow from, it was fun while i was younger but not something i would like to continue"
bad,"Lacking appropriate staff at all levels "
bad,macys is ok but they need to be able to work with scheduling according to ones availability. they also need to give better incentatives to their employees
bad,macys is a great place to get more work experience with various job choices. it is also a diverse job where you can meet people from different walks of life.
bad,"More like a school they treat the employee like a kids not a good allowance a minimum hourly rate and a draw commesion base on sales."
bad,They dont treat the employees with respect. Moving up in the company is very difficult unless you are sucking up to someone.
bad,Given only very minimal work schedule as i am new to the company and my status is not regular.  Guidelines on work scheduling is not transparent to employees. The job requires a lot of manual/heavy labor.  The company though practice diversity and give additional discount to its employees.
bad,I got promoted from a seasonal worker to full time and worked very hard. I guess because I was the only guy there I had to do all the heavy stuff. The manager wouldn't even give me the chance to advance.
bad,"I worked at the Macys in fort Collins for almost 3 years. I started as on call, which worked well with my school schedule, moved to cosmetics after a year, and then got laid off after 6 months. I was able to take a position out on the floor, and got back into cosmetics a few months later. And I was laid off almost a year to the day after the first time. There's no job security, the time off structure is very limited because they block out sale weekends. I was never able to take the PTO that I had worked up because it takes 6 months to get it, and then I got laid off. There's no communication within the management. No one cares about you. And the pay is terrible. Don't work here."
bad,It was a challenging experience for me to work at macys. Working in retail is always difficult and everyone is on their toes. It is very difficult to manage both work and studies if anyone is working full time.
bad,Great job to interact with customers and service their shopping needs.  The most enjoyable part of the job is receiving the employee discounts on purchases.
bad,"not the best place to work. it drains all your positive energy. management doesn't help at all, never around when you need them. I just wouldn't recommend it."
bad,"Placement of merchandise in the selling floor or stock area."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"there was so much demand on this job. you needed to meet your sales goals, open up charge accounts, make donations to charitable causes."
bad,the store is not for everyone and the managers constantly talk about everyone behind their backs. trust no one in the store
bad,Confusing management. No one to report to. Never had a set duty or job assignment. I worked as a temporary associate so that may be the reason.
bad,This is a fairly simple and easy job that was made harder than it had to be due to very poor management. Things could have been so much better had the right people been put in charge.
bad,macys was a difficult environment. there were sales very often so i had to deal with alot of unhappy. i had a few issues with human resources and management afterwards with recieving my checks and them saying they had no proof ive ever worked there. many coworkers had some of the same issues and we were all seasonal workers.
bad,its a place for high schoolers and younger people because you will not be treated well if your elderly or are looking for to start from the bottom and work up.
bad,enjoyed working i wouldnt go back because everyone wanted to be the manger..... i think that the mangers and macys need to step up there pay because 8.25 per hours isnt money and they shouldnt have a problem raISING g pay because they make VERY VERY VERY GOOD MONEY SOO  THEY  NEDD TO RAISE THE PAY ASSOCIATES MAKE 8.25 AND MANGERS MAKE ALOMST 14PER HOURS THATS UNFAIR
bad,"I was only working seasonal, but working in retail was fun. I learned more about the different departments. I liked the fast pace and keeping busy."
bad,"i cleaned the floor and picked up clothes in the shopping area, made sure that everything looked good and pleased the manager. the managers were nice and were very flexible with hours"
bad,"From the start wasn't too bad, but towards the end of the holiday season, there was a mass miscommunication in if I was still going to be employed with their company or not."
bad,"A typical day at work is repetitive, not much room for advancement. Some co-workers are good workers, but it is more like a popularity contest and not so much a professional atmosphere."
bad,Use computer to clock in for the day straighten tie tables assisted customers with purchases used cash register to total up sales and issued credit for new customers
bad,"Macy's was very exciting I did a myriad of things while at Macy's anywhere from setting up displays, running the cash register and assisting customers."
bad,"Macy's is a entry level job; especially if you only have a high school diploma. If retail is your forte, then by all means, however just like any other retail job, your main focus is to keep the customer happy."
bad,"Macy's is an organization, which demonstrates little, to no care, for its employees and staff members.  The culture at Macy's is one of sole interests towards revenue and profit and little to no regard for the employees that help to sustain the business. It is an environment that is not fair or balanced for employees. A typical day consisted of reviewing cases and internal employee activity. I learned that Macy's will target, apprehend and convict certain race and ethnic groups only. The hardest part was placing all the prejudice to the side in order to do my job. The most enjoyable part of my day was when I got to leave and go home. Having a full time job was a plus as full time was not granted to all employees, but it was also a negative in that it meant I was at the job for longer than I desired."
bad,"I didn't feel like a family or part of the team, I felt like the crew didn't want me to be apart of the Macy's magic."
bad,I did not enjoy this job at all. I was on my feet all day. They never gave me any hours and I was never trained.
bad,"very rude customers, very rude employees. very discriminating."
bad,Macy's has changed since i first started working back in 2011. Theres no more incentive pay. Raises are very strict I think i got a total of 27 cents the 3 years ive worked there no matter my productivity and attendance. Management is horrible. Cause even though they havent done your job for one minute and you do it 40+ hours a week they swear they know best and tell you how to do your process. I would not work there again unless i was desperate for a quick job.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,A typical day at work is assisting customer on the sales floor. I have learned to be patience with people. Managers only want to manage when it is beneficial to them. Some of my co-workers are team players. The hardest part of my job is accepting that there is really no job security. The enjoyable part of my job is the nice customers who appreciated what I do.
bad,Meant a lot of great people at Macy's. Made a lot of friends with the employee's.
bad,macys was only busy during the holidays. throughout the rest of the year it was slow.
bad,"this was a challenging position as sales goals and credit goals needed to be met.  there was so much competition among fellow co-workers yet it was an interesting job.  I learned a great deal and met many wonderful customers who were very kind and pleasant to assist. unfortunately, I was not there long enough to be offered a chance to grow with the company."
bad,"This company will work you to death without a single care in the world.  The management was awful and just flat out mean at my location.  The job was a pain to get, even after they told me I was hired.  They took more then two months after telling me I was hired before I got my first shift, and three weeks before my seasonal employment was supposed to end they took all of my hours without cause or explanation.  The only reason I even know that my employment was concluded was because I went out of my way to get in touch with upper management."
bad,"when i first came to the store, management had changed. and they just started the all black policy for uniforms. i dont think they had quite gotten the hang of things."
bad,Compensation at MACY'S wasn't good at all. There were no employee incentives to foster an encouraging work environment
bad,Fun people to work with. Meeting new people was fun and in a commission area you need to make a lasting impression so your clients will come back to see you. The days became very long and was hard to get Management to change the schedule.  They fired many managers for no good reason so others would follow. I worked there for 2 1/2 years and they went through 9 managers. I do miss many of my friends and go with several of them still.
bad,"Macys was ok I really didn't appreciate how they let me go after all that hard work I put. I know I was hired seasonal but I felt like I really did a lot even worked couple of overnights for them, but they told me they would've kept me but once January came there budget was really low so they had to let go most of there seasonal co workers. The hardest part was doing recovery especially I got hired to the kids department in the holidays. You know most customers are buying gifts for there children's so the floor got pretty crazy but I did handle it. I did enjoy a lot of co workers that worked there they were really friendly and most times they helped me out."
bad,This position was seasonal so I couldn't work there for very long. It was unorganized and chaotic.
bad,Job was very fast paced and busy. Management was horrible. First day on job didn't even train me well just threw me out on floor. Sales goals are ridiculous. Punishment was given if you didn't sell credit cards.
bad,"This role was really easy when came to development of associates but, the only hold up was Macy's as acompany. They don't really invest anytime or money in the development of their team."
bad,I didn't really work there often so I have nothing to say. I never had a chance to get to know anyone due to the lack of hours that they informed me that I would have but never did.
bad,"i learned something new about makeup all the time … usually always a makeover to do which is always fun, but they always stood open extra late and open earlier than all stores in the mall."
bad,"Macy's is a fast paced retail store."
bad,There is no typical day here. I am always expecting something new here.
bad,it is a diverse environment and gives the opportunity to grow in the company but need to know the right people. poor security
bad,no advancement with this company. Start at 5am work till all is done. then if you are lucky you can take your first break after working 5 hours. I was hired for my experience in the retail field. learned the Macy's way
bad,"Only put you on the schedule when there is a truck delivery. You have to unload and process all in the same day, which cannot possible be done"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I worked in the women's department and it was always a complete disaster and nothing was ever organized. Management has no clue what they're doing and don't try to help at all.
bad,"Pretty good place to work at. People are nice, mangers are nice. Very nice environment."
bad,Nothing special. Schedule was never steady and pay was only $8/hr
bad,employee were very nice and kind but management wasnt what i expected .
bad,"Bad training, poor pay, and poor management of the staff. The managers did not know how to help out the staff."
bad,It was beyond stressful. The job did not pay well enough for the amount of responsibilities you had to deal with every day.
bad,The best part of the job was the event planning and implementing.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with unprofessional employees & management.
bad,Overworked and under paired. The managers always let the work pile up and pushed everything on the associates
bad,started with a awesome exciting rally letting us ;know what was the goal for the day and some of the strategy in which we can achieve it.
bad,it was fun and fast speed going if they would have game me more hours i would of stayed with the company for a longer time period
bad,I have nothing to say about working for macy's. Was not a good company to work for
bad,"-Inadequate hours, less then 20 on average per week"
bad,"working for macys is very demanding and tough. a lot is asked of you, combined with a lot more stress and a lack of supporting management makes work difficult."
bad,managers hardly talked to you unless it was to tell you you were doing something wrong or not fast enough.
bad,"Good for keeping a flexible schedule while going to school but you need to take everything that happens with a grain of salt. Very few benefits, small-print stuff, for working here. I took a vacation and didn't get paid anything for all the days I took off despite having Paid Time Off."
bad,"hated the early morning shifts"
bad,I didnt really like the hours with having a small child. The job was great and the pay wasn't enough for the hard work you have to do.
bad,high expectations with poor training to meet sales goals. unrealistic sales goals so they dont have to pay commission.
bad,The Managers Were Not Fair To All The Works And Some Got Better Or Less Pay And Hours Then Others The According To Their Achievements
bad,"bad environment,bad management ,not well organized,the hardest part is to deal with management"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,A typical day includes talking to customers and assisting them with their purchase.
bad,retail environment mostly worked with teens. the pay wasn't so good it was really busy very little pay
bad,was put on bed rest while pregnant not able to finish job. would love go back
bad,"Macys is very good with working with people personal lives. But I don't recommend anyone to work there. They don't pay great, and you rarely move up in the company."
bad,"very busy, everyday was spent at a fast rate. however I did enjoy interacting with the customers everyday."
bad,"A typical work day was pretty stressful. You were only given 4 to 5 hours to unload 20 boxes or more of merchandise. The people I worked with were constantly starting drama instead of just focusing on their work, which was very distracting. I did appreciate the time I got to spend with the managers and enjoyed all the responsibility given to me when I just started."
bad,"just temporary positions offered at the time."
bad,"Often get overwhelmed by the store putting individual goals of sales goal, items per transactions, number of loyalties, there is still more goals that they throw on top of you. This makes a hostile work environment since all asociates are fighting for the sales. If you do not make these goals they often get on your case everyday which stress you out."
bad,Macy's is not a place for those seeking a real career. Middle management was mediocre.  Promotions were not based on talent and work ethic but on who you knew.  The organization lacked diversity within the management team. Senior management was awful!
bad,"been working many years. now i m looking for part time job with open wage. I am on ssdi and cannot earn no more than $900.00.  I just want to work part time job."
bad,I did not enjoy working at MACY'S at all. I would prefer not to write a bad review about them so I will leave it at that.
bad,"Worked the cash register,helped customer find store items,that I am a peoples person,very competitive work place,driven individuals,was keeping store items neat,talking with customers."
bad,"You had to provide a good quality of customer service. the hardest part for this job was trying to sell as much as possible, the best was seeing you made your goal and customer happy,"
bad,I think there needs to be better training before they put people out on the sale floor.  The customer service experience was good.
bad,"this is one of the jobs i hated. Customers are difficult, managers tell you to do one thing but when in the situation they do what they told you not to...salary is very low based on all the things you have to go through during one day. Schedule is not too flexible"
bad,they work you to death. wasn't a great job glad i left i didnt have friends mainly kept to myself
bad,"early hours  "
bad,"i enjoyed the work environment, was very creative and friendly with both employees and customers."
bad,I would only recommend this company for high school students or someone trying to break into the fashion world. No room for real advancement. Felt like a robot.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Greet customers and assist in a friendly courteous manner.  Process customer’s transactions accurately and efficiently.
bad,working at Macy's was very calm and enjoyable to work at. I learned to organize and put things in a fashionable order at a fast past pace there. my co workers were willing to show me new things and help me out alot.
bad,It was a summer job to help pay for school to hurry up and finish my Associate degree
bad,"Macy's is a beautiful place to work, however, it does require long hours of standing, and dealing with customers that can be very rude at times.  Management is not very hands on with associates, in which can make advancement difficult if your sales numbers are not high- because that is the only thing management is interested in, more so, than the whole employee."
bad,Only worked during the holiday season. Really fast paced. Met a lot of great people.
bad,"I started working there before the holidays and during Christmas and New Years the place is so beautiful and you get this nice warm feeling.  The other workers there are very welcoming and do not mind answering any of your question if you are new there.  One of the things I did not like is that their training program is horrible.  You do not learn much from that, but you do learn a lot on the job.  I learned how to be a cashier and how to use their system.  Every story is a bit different."
bad,"Working at Macy's is no easy job. Being a sales associate you not only help customers with their sales but you also have to do recovery work all while being on commission which brings on lots of competition in the work place. It's a good place to work part time for students, the schedule is flexible. Management in Macy's could use some work. The best part of the job would be meeting all types of people, you learn from your co-workers and customers and you make new friends."
bad,Macy's is a good company overall. However the store I work for is in need of new management.
bad,Although my coworkers are awesome to work with the management would harass you for not meeting you goals! The goals were to high and they would take points away for calling out! Macy's cares only for Macy's and that's it!  They could care less about you calling out to to health problems or personal problems! You can and will be replaced!
bad,"inspite of the fact that i increased sales at the beverly center by 30% and receeeived yearly reviews that merited me raises, when i transfered to burlington i was assigned to tha men's department. when i pointed ou that putiing the largest sized pants at floor level made it difficult for obese men to access the pants so they just pulled them out which resulted in a mess, their response was ""thats the way we've always done it"". "
bad,"A typical work day involves going to a touch base meeting to determine what's our focus and priority will be. The day usually involves coaching your teams throughout the day, moving throughout the entire store addressing customers concerns ( which is the hardest part moving around an entire store of 4 floors). this was one of the things I felt that was an opportunity for the management don't designate a manager per floor to address these concerns and some customers get frustrated waiting. In Macy's the opportunity of advancement depends on who you know at the Senior and are friends with and not based on your skills. If you are looking for a career advancement career this may not be the place for you especially if you are a minority.  There is a ceiling on your advancement for 98 percent of the workforce in NY is minorities and yet 98 percent of the NY corporate level is Caucasians."
bad,I didn't enjoy working at Macy's that much and the management team was very non professional. It's just a job you work so you won't be unemployed.
bad,"i didnt really like the managers, but i became cool with alot of people thats what made my day go faster. lot of work especially during the holidays."
bad,It was just a job for me. Nothing more nothing less. No one worked together everyone was out for themselves.
bad,Very little to no training. I was thrown on the job on Black Friday Sales. I taught myself skills on how to handle the job. I learned how to work under pressure and work through difficult situations.
bad,its not a good place to work for. the managers sucks and they don't pay very well. They always cutting peoples' hours. Never can get things done on time. Co-workers always talking about one another and also wants you to do every thing and not help you.
bad,"The supervisor didn't even know my name, and when I resigned because I moved out of the state, the office called me about several times months later saying why I haven't come to work when I clearly went to the office and spoke with a manager about my situation and he didn't even bother to let HR know."
bad,"very low pay, management sucks, customers have a since of entitlment"
bad,I use to stock all the shoes in the shelves and i use to scan all the floor and i use to take out all the pennys out of the stockroom so they can process to another person so they can sent it to another store. i use to take out all the sales shoes out when is a sale.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Days happen to very slow and boring most of the time. I gained more experience in costumer service. Management was Macys weakest point. Co-workers was what would make days go faster and less stressful. Working in a busy day and having to train new co-workers and meet our goals for the day was one of the hardest things we had to do. The most enjoyable part was you meet different people every day.
bad,"Help customer find the perfect tailored suit and shoes."
bad,"I worked for Macy's for over 3 years and even after 3 years I still wasn't much above minimum wage. In order to even get a 10 cent raise was like pulling teeth and begging every manager possible to get it. The attitude that you receive when you ask for a lunch or a break is ridiculous! For many of the years I worked there I never got my 15 minute break. The discount was awesome, even though it has to be on a Macy's card in order to get it. Good starting job, but good look trying to make a career out of it!"
bad,"My time there has been fine, but I see what the company does to others who, due to being given additional responsibilities, cannot exceed their sales goal by 150%."
bad,My average day at Macy's was fast paced and a little confusing at times.  Communication was a downfall with the management.  I learned how to work at a steady pace. I learned great communication skills with the customers.  I stayed to myself when I was at work.  My coworkers were not a great experience.  The hardest part of my job was to process the clothes accurately 100% of the time.  My most enjoyable part of my job was when I accomplished everything that was lined up for me to do and the goal was completed.   
bad,"It is very easy to get hired here, but if your intentions is to make a real living this is not the place for you, it does not pay very much at all, yet they want you to carry out multiple tasks for very little pay. also there's a thing there called attendance credits and if you run out of them you get fired, no questions asked, it doesn't matter if you are sick, have a funeral to go to or anything else. at macys the customer is always right, so expect dealing with some very rude customers in which management will usually back them regardless of whether or not they are right. if you work full time or part time you get some benefits, but if you are flex there are no benefits except for the fact that you get to choose when you work if there are hours available. depending on where you work and with whom you may have fun, but if management is around there will be none of that, even though management will usually stand around and socialize with each other. It's not the best place to work if you want a reasonable income and respect."
bad,My receiving team was helpful but the Executive Office did not handle the employees correctly which affected my final paycheck due to lack of communication and attentiveness to their employees. The organization is too big and the leadership is not handling the employees fairly.
bad,"A chance to challenge yourself among others in each department, our own personal sales goals gave us motivation to sell. But often were set from the previous year sometimes easy to make other times  it requires alot of skillbuilding in order to complete."
bad,"•	Responsible for receiving daily shipments and processing and storing these shipments."
bad,I love working with the public and like working in the environment of Macy's although there is no consistency in the days of work. Each week your schedule is different which is hard on a single mother who is in school and trying to work full time hours.  Sales goals are astronomical and unobtainable unless you do nothing but ring customers all day long and leave the area a mess for other associates to clean. They say team work but its impossible with individual goals. 
bad,"A typical day included opening and placing new items."
bad,"Maintain OSHA Standards."
bad,"I started during holiday time, which is one of the most bussiest times of the year. I learned a lot about sales and helping customers find merchandise that was best for them. I learned how to speak up and go the extra mile for customers. The management team was very unorganized and the scheduling was horrible. My coworkers were very nice and fun to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a flexible schedule. The hardest part of the job was knowing that once you cleaned an area, five minutes later in would be a mess again, since there was too much merchadise on the floor."
bad,Still working there.... But it's not a friendly place. A lot of sales associates are nasty & hovers at customer like a pack of wolves!
bad,I dont like retail. Standing for long hours and folding clothes is not for me.
bad,"My job Kept me busy, in a good way, I learned that knowledge is power, and by working in different areas u learn alot. Management was understandable and helpful as well as the co workers I worked with. Hardest part of the job, was that by helping customers u would have to be prepared, and use the knowledge u learned. Being able to make the customers happy lets u see and feel how good of a job we did."
bad,"I'm not sure what else anyone needs to know about working there. Its a good place to work if you have little ambition and prefer to collect a check as your technical skills rot away. The management climate there is unrealistic and tends not to trust the expertise of even senior technicians. And you can forget about getting a decent annual increase, 1.5% increase is the norm from what I was able to gather."
bad,"Every month management has what they call a ""rally"", I would assume to motivate the employees, but it has the opposite effect. At the rally they tell you how good the company is doing and how much money they made for that quarter, yet most of the employees have not received a raise in a few years."
bad,"Pros: good work/life balance, variety of projects I work on, great co workers"
bad,-Unreasonable management
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I was hired and trained for the POS Cashier position and that lasted about 3 times and then I was told to sell. I was not given any formal training just a mounting goal. I taught myself to sell and applied what I learned and I made the sales. I also taught the other co working seasonal employees how I reached my goals so they too could achieve succcess. You need to check your time card often and remind them that 3.77 is actually 4.17 hours and that these important changes really add up in your paycheck.
bad,GOOD EXPERIENCED POOR PAY LONG HOURS . Minumun wage to employees
bad,Macy's is an ok place to work at. I believe changes in management is needed.
bad,My typical day is going and greeting customers making them feel comfortable. Advice them the best items from Shiseido for them. Ive learned to become a better leader and even more about the line itself. My coworkers are all diferent personalities. The hardest is when days are very slow and almost no customers are around. The most enjoyable part is welcoming and making every single customer feel welcome.
bad,a good place to start gaining experience.A good enviroment to gain social skills and learn basic responseablity.
bad,Supervisors require high level of job performance.
bad,Not very nice working environment. No communication with the managers. Lack of organization.
bad,"this is a company that believes in pushing their employees as hard as possible, with minimal payroll to achieve tasks and goals. If you like political corporate B.S. and being treated like a piece of garbage, this is a great place to work"
bad,"Nothing you wouldn't expect from any other 500 retail company. Sell as much as possible, but if you don't get people hooked on this credit card we don't want you working here bye bye."
bad,"promoted to a higher volume store, enjoyed working with different people."
bad,"A typical work day starts with setting up the registers, making sure my work area was clean and very organized, assist customers in finding products that match their needs, while also having to stock and maintain the work area clean throughout the work day, at the same time having to make very high unrealistic sales goals and open as many credit accounts as possible, multitasking is a must if you want to work at macys."
bad,Merchandise for Steve Madden clothing.
bad,"Horrible leaders in the department. No benefits, with long hours."
bad,"Boring, bad pay, and no advancement. The management is terrible and employees are lazy"
bad,"over worked , under paid"
bad,Poor pay but some opportunity for advancement. A good stepping stone.
bad,Slow as retail is slow.
bad,love the food and breakfast and good but pay was great but got laid off
bad,"Strict dress code,Alot of different ethnic backgrounds,and they focus on credit accounts ."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Unrealistic expectations... They dont really take care of their employees... Its all about the money...
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the people i worked with and being able to help the customers.
bad,"This is not the best company that I've worked for, but everyone has their own personal experiences and opinions."
bad,A typical day consisted of hard labour which was never recognized by management.
bad,worked fast to put out new items
bad,"making sure everything was organized, making sure im taking all the customers and helping them with anything they need. Greeting them all the time and making sure they always leave with a smile in there face"
bad,"Macy's likes to think of themselves as a cut above other competitors, and likens themselves to high-end retailers like Nordstroms and Saks. Nice marketing ploy, but their management and oeprations mentality puts them closer to Kohls.......except Kohls does it better. Their takeover of once-great companies like May's, Filenes, and Marshall Fields only made them look like a bunch of single-minded businesspeople whose only intention was to dictate what people should want. Slick ads and star power won't cut it, dudes."
bad,I like it but its not a professional job
bad,"cleaning stockroom , helping costumers , puting new stuff out"
bad,Managment is not willing to work with you on anything. They never had the schedual out in time they didnt train you very well. I didnt like the job
bad,"Good first job, but not for a career. Paid very low, expected to work as hard as possible, no incentives for support associates, as opposed to sales and managements. Not much room for growth."
bad,"Macy's, simply put, does not compensate their non-commissioned employees well enough for any individual to live off of. With today's rising economic costs, it is difficult, if not impossible, to live off of the meager wages that they pay, in particular, if you live anywhere in California. Because of the lack of jobs that are currently available in today's market, you may find yourself playing a political game just to maintain your position. Favoritism plays it's role. The benefits that they offer are too costly for the rate of pay. This job may be fine if it is a second income within your household, but it can be problematic if you are trying to work around your family's schedule as the shifts are varied. If you were not hired as a full time employee, you will be required to work six days a week just to receive 30+ hours and you most likely will have to work out of various departments to obtain those hours. Anytime that you work in another department, you will probably be treated in a cool manner from the regular staff as everyone is required to reach or surpass their daily quota. You will be rated on a scorecard and required to open a credit account for every 10 hours that you work. Due to our current trend, Macy's managers will regularly insist upon you opening those credit accounts and leave you with the feeling that if you don't live up to their expectations, you may be at risk of losing your job. You do not receive a paid for lunch hour and Macy's does not offer a very comfortable environment where they could offer you, at least, some coffee and a coffee maker instead of"
bad,Terrible management; no mentoring or coaching. Pay is standard. Coworkers keep to themselves. No company culture or ethics.
bad,Management isn't too sure how to deal with the employees and would rather not reprimand anyone for wrongdoing. You do a lot of work for not enough money.
bad,Same idea of working retail. A lot of miscommunication amongst the managers..
bad,If your looking for something longterm Macy's isnt the place for you!
bad,work non stop until break very fun and enjoyable always around different people learing new things
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,i didnt like management at all. while i was in high schooli had two jobs and macys by far was the worst place to work as a teen.
bad,everyone had bad attitudes and the pay was horrible. definetly not somewhere i would want to work at again.
bad,If you don't have any advanced skills then this is the job for you.
bad,"Not much to say. I knew people there, the customers were always looking for some kind of deal. I did have fun for the short time i was there, but it was nothing special"
bad,The review ahs been posted on my resume. I had to leave this job sadly as the management and me could not come on common grounds for my college schedule.
bad,"Working conditions were horrible. While I enjoyed my co-workers, management was terrible and pay was barely above minimum wage."
bad,you get no hours but its a fun job when they do give you hours .. the hardest part is trying to get a weeks worth of work done in the 6 hours a week they give me...
bad,"Good training, clean environment, fun for someone who likes to deal with public, but then you are on your own."
bad,"They could have done a better job at their magament staff, the construction of the building was not presentable"
bad,"It was fun working here, but sometimes it was too messy. The only bad thing was the pay wasn't enough for all the work we had to do."
bad,"Didn't really enjoy this job. A lot of the things were unsanitary working in a dressing room, it was only a part-time job and didnt have great pay"
bad,I wish the pay was higher and the company would hire dress room cleaners. The associates work so hard for such low pay.
bad,"I liked working there the job was not bad, just the turn over rate is extremely high, and they lay off at the drop of a dime. With no return call like promised. I would not recommend to a friend to apply there."
bad,Personally I like helping customers and doing things behind the counter but the work environment is very toxic and negative. Your own coworkers are trying to find something suspicious about every customer that walks into the store and just EVERYONE in general so they can receive money for it. Coworkers are constantly talking about each other and management is neither organized nor ever agreeing on anything.
bad,"The only things I liked about Macy's was the pay raises and the amount of hours I received. Other than that the customers were very disrespectful, most of the people that works at Macy's are old, very rude, and not helpful at all. It's was always low on staff, therefore, sometimes I had to cover a whole department by myself. Either people didn't show up for work or just didn't work at all."
bad,"During seasonal hiring, it was a very busy workplace due to holidays. Not much one on one learning or coaching. Very little praise for working beyond what was asked."
bad,"I hated working at Macy's. Most of the time we were understaffed around the holidays, so as a result, i was the only shoes salesperson on the floor during a rush and customers are downright vicious. My co-workers and managers were alright I guess but at times seemed apathetic. One good thing I will say is that the hours are really flexible but other than that, this job really stunk 👎"
bad,On a regular  day you help people with shopping the job is for a kid in high school or a kid in college. Something to do in retail to help  with the bills with movable work hours
bad,"This will be a long read, but it is my experience working for Macy's."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Overall, It was a good place to work. Get's hectic during Peak. You start to feel small and insignificant at this time. Compensation is average for the area."
bad,"Even though they say it's flexible hours.  It's not because they schedule you regardless and they do provide  the option to see if another employee can take your shift and if not then your pretty much screwed because if you cant come in or get coverage then you are marked for not being reliable. "
bad,"I had a prepaid employee credit card with a plus / positive balance on it."
bad,"Working as an associate in Men's, the work is never-ending and unmanageable. There will be one person schedule to close on a weekend and they will be expected to ring for all of men's, help customers find suits, shoes, and other clothing, clean out the dressing rooms, put clothing back in their respective places, and accept phone calls, among many other small and tedious tasks spread out across the department. The compensation seems to be lacking. Management seems to be tied up in other areas, and it's sometimes impossible to find a supervisor when a customer has a complaint. I stayed with Macy's for so long because they are flexible with scheduling, for the most part. The other sales associates are understanding and willing to help out whenever they can."
bad,"Over my last five years here, morale has completely plummeted. Most coworkers discuss leaving and it feels like we get no help from management. Managers will ignore lines of customers rather than help you out and many departments are staffed with only one worker for upwards of three or four areas. New employees seem to have a lack of training and thus confuse customers and take long time employees away from their work."
bad,"Toxic work environment. Bad management, horribly underqualified co-workers, impossible to move up or get fired. Just save yourself some grief and work somewhere else."
bad,"For two years you will get raises. After two years, you may or May not get a cost of living raise. Stay away from nightshift upper management and you should be able to do well."
bad,Health care way too much along with low pay by the hour. No raises. Employees are great to work with.  People lead I had was very nice they do help you but the pay you cant support yourself with.  You have to work 3 jobs to make it.
bad,Very competitive between employees trying to earn comissions Very stressful environment schedule is not the same each week training is on the job and you only shadow for one week
bad,"The job is flexible although sometimes they are strict on hours and only allow you to work what the computer schedules you, if part time sometimes 9 hours a week, 3 hour shifts."
bad,"First you don't want to work in the receiving department. The job itself isn't bad, its the management of the department itself. Co-workers are fun to work with for the most part, you get a few sour apples as usual in any job. You have to watch out for the suck ups who report everything to the dept. manager who has micro management problems already. You would be better off working a cash register and wearing slacks and tie then putting up with the baloney that goes on at the dock."
bad,"You are asked to do way more work than what you’re actually paid for. There are people that have worked for 5+ years at Macy’s and still make minimum wage. The managers do not appreciate how hard you work and have no idea what they’re doing. They’ll tell you to do one thing, you do it, and then you have to end up re-doing it because they gave you the wrong information. The only good thing about this job is that you have a pretty consistent schedule. However, it is not worth it. If you’re looking for a minimum wage position you’re betting off just being a sales associate instead of a merchandiser, you’ll get paid basically the same for a lot less work."
bad,"Do not work here unless you have no other options. You will be treated as nothing more than a number and expected to do the work of several people on barely more than minimum wage. Turnover is extremely high- with good reasons. Do not work here.  Macy’s is trying to squeeze out as much money as possible from their dying cash cow, and that means taking advantage of working people. They will expect you to do the work of several people and pay you squat so that they can give more money to their rich shareholders. Macy’s is the sinking Titanic"
bad,"Macy is not as magical as the company motto spins. Regarding retail Macy's focuses on selling the employee as much as external customers. Sadly, Macy's does not pay the employee enough to shop within the store they work at. Too much work and pressure for too little pay and recognition."
bad,"Fun and fulfilling for several years, but they don’t invest in the stores like other competitors. I watched staffing get cut to where it affected my productivity on a daily basis. As a visual merchandiser, you’re primary focus is to drive sales through displays which can difficult to accomplish when you’re constantly interrupted by a frustrated customer while you’re on a ladder painting a wall or hanging a holiday garland or dressing a mannequin, asking you to do a return or to check out because they can’t find a sales associate. HR’s presence is non-existent and they’re only concerned with protecting those at the top, therefore not much hope for conflict resolution."
bad,"Moral is only at it's best during campaigns and fund raisers for community, want high productivity, poor pay. As a single job current hiring rate cant get an apartment in that county without assistance from the goverment.  Breaks start at moment time comes while having to walk fair distance to breakroom.  Poor management as favorites are encouraged over seniority andnexowrience ofnstaff.  Suspervosors play employees against each other and ignore flagrant drug use by employees and in your face rule breaking by turning heads"
bad,"more care and attention for the employees,"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"In general the employees are friendly and easy to get along with. That being said, the fact that a large company like Macy's only pays experienced merchandisers, like myself, minimum wage, is a crime. Also never scheduled for a full 40 hour week.  1/2 hour lunches and obtaining your employee discount are inconvenient at best."
bad,"Very competitive between employees,  you have to fight for the customers so they come and pay what ever they're buying with you is all about commission, is a very stressful job...."
bad,"Typical day includes working on projects and a lot of meetings. Meetings often don't lead to direction, and opinions are often squashed because decisions are being made at the VP+ level. Political in-fighting over 'territories' has caused teams to fight amongst each other for responsibilities. Director/Management teams lack stable direction as decisions are changed without reason on a weekly basis leading to further indecision."
bad,"Manager was great, typical day was correcting packages with mistakes, supervisor was awesome and very knowledgable,monthly rallies to let us know how the site is doing."
bad,"Macy's is a great department store,  lots of cultural experience for me there"
bad,"They need to give their management classes in how to manage! Young people with no skills. It feels like High School. It gets old real quick! I see now why it's a revolving door. People coming and going. It used to be a hard place to be full-time. Not anymore. They care more about a 10 dollar shirt then they do about the people making them the money. They need to have trainers that are more patient. If you work in one area daily and are sent out of your Dept to help in another dept, they need to realize some things are different because of the merchandise you are handling. Don't stand there and look at the person like they should know everything! They don't! Your job as a group leader, people person, supervisor, trainer etc...is to help! Not humiliate!"
bad,"No personal life, mandatory weekend shifts, every weekend, the raise is 10-25 cents, you work like a slave for a little of nothing. Credit cards were hard to do they expect you to do all the work while the managers get the bonus's for it and you get 3 dollars for opening it. Managers are lazy and don't want to help when it is busy. They let customers get away with way too much and never have your back."
bad,"You meet really great people. Culture is usually pretty productive. The pay is horrible;e, commission is only 3% for cosmetics and 5% for fragrance. Its pretty competitive to get sales."
bad,There is no level of job security in Macy’s finishlines and everything rely’s on the relationship the finishline team has with the Macy’s team. That connection could be the make or break to the whole operation
bad,I started off as a seasonal and they asked to stay.  I enjoyed the shopper and peers but the retail hours are really hard physically on the body standing and developed really bad foot issues so decided to leave.  Hours were often long and little breaks or coverage to go  on a break.
bad,"Although Macy's is a great place to shop, it is not a great place to work. My hours would vary from week to week, and I could go from $200 to $80 for the whole week. no benefits, no raised pay."
bad,Super slow and not as busy as you would hope or like it to be. Time goes by so slow when there’s nothing to do but you do meet some interesting people.
bad,"I really enjoyed the time I was there. I started 2 weeks before Christmas and thought I would be there more than 4 days in total. I didn't like the way the management handled over 400 employee's laying off. We worked the weekend night shift. 6pm to 5am 1 day and 7pm to 5am next 2 days. The beginning of the second weekend we worked til around 3:30 and we're called to the front for a speech about how Macy's had exceeded their goals with our help so we could all go home basically because we weren't need anymore.  I believe Macy's corporate has no idea that there fulfillment center here in Tulsa is run like a Chinese sweat shop.  Having never worked a differential shift before I actually enjoyed it.  Being a master's degree graduate in human relations from the University of Oklahoma,  it is just my opinion that Macy's management could use an overhaul."
bad,"It's retail, so everything negative you can assume does indeed come with the territory.  The compensation isn't great.  There's burnout.  The managers are mostly incompetent and should be replaced.  The company is desperately trying to salvage any profitability by cutting hours, eliminating positions and retaining unrealistic demands of its hourly employees.  For example, it's common for one person to the only opener or closer for each respective floor, that's floor, not mere department."
bad,The management half of the time don't even do their jobs. They have other people take care of it for them. They either give out to many hours or take away to many hours from their staff. Macy's in the Waterbury mall was either over or under staffed. And the managers like to take out their anger or stress on their associates.
bad,"A typical work day consisted of morning meetings with recognition to the store and also employees.  We would also address our sales plan and goals for the day.  We had incentives...Macys money for store accounts and if we reached our goal there would be pay-outs.  Management team was a strong team.  We made our employees feels like family.  If there were any personal issues for our employees, we made them feel comfortable to come to us to assist them to help with their work/life balance."
bad,"If you like being disrespected my middle aged white women over their coupons not working, this is the job for you.  Ive worked with some unorganized job companies but never one that was such a well recognized name. My management failed to give me a schedule or teach me how to create my own schedule. I was left alone on my FIRST DAY at the register despite management telling me i would be shadowing. There was also almost nothing about the coupon policy in training despite that being the number one thing you will be asked about, ( why doesnt this coupon work with my purchase).  Additionally, you are paid pennies to what this corporation makes. You are paid the same amount as someone selling cheap food at a gas station, while every purchase a customer makes is 100s of dollars in name brand clothing. Only benefit would be the job is usually so busy and fast paced you wont be bored. Additionally the breaks are nice and long, and some of the coworkers were genuinely good people. Discounts are also nice for the employees."
bad,"I worked as a sales associate at Macy's - Downtown Brooklyn for two years, and while the job itself was retail standard and you can make your own schedule, upper management made everyone on down miserable with their constant condescension. This created a very tense work environment. If you're given the offer take it, but by all means, keep looking."
bad,"Pros: Macy's is very flexible with scheduling."
bad,"I was hired as an associate for the home department. When I was hired, they scheduled me to work a month later. They told me in the meantime, to pick up any shifts that people wanted to drop. I saw 1 shift, for the whole month that I was allowed to pick up. My first problem, when looking at shifts to pick up, they labled the Departments, very weird, not even like acronyms. They wouldnt even help me, by telling me what department is what, instead they told me I cant do this department or that department. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,the manager of the makeup department was awful. Everyone there is driven by the amount of credit cards they can get. The sales goals at my counter were absolutely ridiculous. They were very flexible with hours however.
bad,"I worked for Macy's while I was in college full-time, I was also working full-time with the company. They allowed me to pick and choose my hours, for the most part. I would say the best part of working here was the discounts you get on the clothes. I would definitely work here again for the discount. Biggest downfall is the fact that, they pretty much force you to annoy customers with opening a Macy's credit card, even if they say they don't want one, they expect you to force them to open which I feel is a disgusting habit for ay company."
bad,"Cosmetics is very competitive and sales have been stolen from me by co workers who are greedy about sales. Overall, good place for first time job in another department."
bad,I absolutely loved my department and my boss and coworkers. I quickly learned how to progress in that department. My only issue with Macys is them hiring individuals before the background check is completed. I am one of multiple ppl from Cumberland M.D. fired after 1 week of work due to my background check. Employment should not be offered until the background check is complete. Obviously you have enough ppl apply for the job that you can treat them like they are disposable.
bad,"Terrible, employee in fighting and back stabbing. Management does not support the employees. Very little feed back and hands on training."
bad,"Overall Macy's was a great place to work. Most people at the company are nice and willing to help and are very talented and hard-working. They can improve on work-life balance, health-care benefits, and human resources services. The workplace culture could also be improved so that it was more inclusive of team members on all work levels."
bad,"The management team were good people, but definitely did not managing well. Macy's as a company dumps unrealistic amounts of work onto the workers and then cut the workers that cannot make the cut. The training and orientation program is very loosely enforced which causes employees to make decisions on work that can lead them to termination if warranted. It is rather easy to pick up for a first job, but unless you already have experience and coming for the manager salary or commission, then there are better jobs that will treat you like human beings and pay you better."
bad,Macys is very unorganized and they pick and choose who they want to give hours too and I was one of the best workers but when I came to work i worked and got my job done
bad,"Disliked job "
bad,"During my time at the store, I noticed many associates looking for drama instead of working. associates that have been working there for years. I have to say for my first job I liked the hard work and smiles I accomplished to make but when it came to the other associates ( mainly in the men department) it was like they didn't care at all. I cleaned, folded clothes and helped customers, while the others acted like they didn't care a goofed around. as for the Macys warehouse I spent two weeks waiting on a pay check they lost. I was furious, because I am 18 years old who moved to a new state to start college and had to wait several weeks to be able to eat."
bad,"My customers were my most enjoyable part of the job,"
bad,"If I had an opportunity to work here at Macy’s again, I would jump on it. I enjoyed working and helping customers reach their shopping goals. If Macy’s would have had any advancement opportunities in the feild of visual  merchandising, I would still be there."
bad,"macys was no best with promoting, I was asked to help train many of employee's on new system daily but when it became time to talk promotion they felt I was not what they wanted but well after I helped their workers daily"
bad,"A fast-paced, hectic environment with flexible, but inconsistent,  hours and few benefits. Unfunded mandates with little supervision and high expectations. The hardest part of the job was compensating for those who lacked the skills required to function in a fast-paced retail environment. Most enjoyable part of the job was growing closer to those who could function in said environment."
bad,"Managers are lazy, I had to deal with some situations myself even after calling my manager. They speak to you disrespectfully. Employees are also not friendly."
bad,"Flex associates don’t get paid time off or most of the benefits as a regular associate. We work just as hard as anyone else, but the management basically sees us as “understudies.”"
bad,The company ask a lot from there employees and barely give them much hourly pay even with a lot of experience and work history. The management is unappreciative unless it benefits them. Not to mention rude and times disrespectful.Overall was horrible work experience and wouldn't recommend.
bad,"As a retail company, you are constantly being sold on how well we're doing but in actuality, all they care about is the bottom line.  There are lies told to everyone's face from the top all the way down.  At the end of the day, if you're not going into a store to buy clothing, you're not going to make money."
bad,"As a Manager, I do not mind at all the hard work time when it comes to a good customer service and when it comes to empowered associates. I wish more."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"The place itself and the work is fine, but management isn't great at their jobs and it reflects poorly on the rest of the store. Granted, each store will be different."
bad,"Along with the poor air quality and cluttered work areas, the Macy's distribution center was a terrible place to work. The supervisors and managers only care about the money they are making and less about the people actually working. "
bad,"As a Macy's employee I expected the fairytale, foolishly.  Macy's has been a retail icon to so many people, including my family and me.  Unfortunately I feel that they are falling prey to the world of online shopping and services.  I thought that Macy's did not value their employees enough to reciprocate them accordingly in relation to their experience and expertise."
bad,The display area and stock room are always a mess at the start of the day so that needs every workers attention. The Point Of Sale systems are checked and secured. The doors are opened and the customers are allowed to shop in the store.
bad,"The department was very unprofessional and mismanaged. Members of leadership were more concerned with making themselves look good at the expense of others instead of actually empowering their reports and making sure that they were properly trained and informed.  I went into the situation thinking and expecting that it would be one way, but it was completely different from what I expected......and not in good way."
bad,I worked here in college and it was a good job for that because they are pretty flexible on hours. But the pay is low and PTO is not enough. Management is pretty unprofessional and just plain miserable and mean for cosmetics. Would not recommend anyone to work here unless its just for the holidays honestly.
bad,"Worked at a pretty low volume store, so most of my days were just standing around and hanging out by the desk after doing my daily tasks."
bad,Don't waste your time. It's better to find more stable employment then be like the countless employees who get stuck working this job for decades with no pay increase and watching others advance. You are overworked and underpaid for the work you do.
bad,"It is okay for a job that someone does not want to take super seriously, for example a student. If one does want to work here and take the job seriously it is quite stressful and the management is less than ideal. There is no job security and the longer you work there the more likely you are to be laid off. Don't get me wrong, it is not a horrible place to work, but it definitely has it's flaws and I am not so sure I would recommend it."
bad,"Fast-paced, highly competitive environment.  Many quotas to be met daily/weekly/monthly."
bad,I was a flexible associate for Macys. a typical day here is fast paced and you definitely have to catch on quickly. Training doesn't prepare you for registers by any means. You have a personal goal each day which can be an issue depending on your department.  Manager retention is not high. Several managers  left for better paying jobs. definitely cant live on associate pay. I gained patience from working here but that's about it.
bad,You will be exhausted and will quickly find out if you are built for this type of job. It has it's rewarding moments but dealing with the customers can be emotionally draining.
bad,"In the near two and a half years I worked for Macy's, I was fairly comfortable. I am leaving due to limited hours and the stress of customer service. I am a student at CBC and have only really been able to get about 12 hours a week at work, that has been scheduled for me. There are many great things about working at Macy's, but in the end, I need a job that I feel will be more reliable in terms of hours, and where I hopefully won't be dealing with the same type of customers that shop clothing retail."
bad,I Enjoyed my initial role but when my position was switched to garbage removal without my complete permission it changed the momentum of the job. The lack of respect from the managers also played a role in my resignation.
bad,"very slow, long hours, little pay, the only good part about Macy's was the management they very very friendly! very easy job just not enough money...."
bad,"Temporary job, very unorganized & sometimes unprofessional. Great job if you only want a check for a few weeks. Seasonal so they hire just about anybody"
bad,Management is always willing to help teach if you have any questions. A typical day at work would consist of helping customers and keep my area clean and tidy.
bad,"It was good while it lasted, I was only there for the season. If you want a quick job for the holidays then Macy’s is the place to go. If it was up to me I would’ve stayed longer"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,The company has great benefits.   However the expectation of a exempt manager is not okay. Working on days off and putting in 12 hrs days is not okay especially when finishing your tasks and expected to do others.
bad,I worked unloading trucks at first which was back breaking but moved up to women shoe expediter. That took about 2 years. The are flexible with the hours where you make 40 hours but then there were times where you made 30 hourss.
bad,"Not bad as a stepping stone to learn something and how corporate world view the workers and customers.  However,low wages, low increases, top pay is a joke for sales or anything below management, supervision pay is low also.  This is the real meaning of ""it's a job"". Answering phones, customer complaints, sales associates questions, sales associates looking for their manager, time card edits, run sales reports, onboarding, orientation,"
bad,good place to work at for just seasonal position  other than that would not work there full time there are many management conflicts with in the company
bad,"Its not hard to work at Macy's but the pay is not adequate. i started off at 9.00 an hour I'd been working for about two years and finally asked for a raise instead of just being clear about it, we played cat and mouse, with the hiring manger making every excuse in the book as to why she cant give me a raise instead of just saying no. The hours are not guaranteed and the amount of effort they put in towards you does not come near to the amount of effort you give them."
bad,"They make you do tons of stuff other than what you applies for. Worked  long hours with low pay, not worth all the work you have do, just to get pocket change in return."
bad,"Career Advancement is difficult, hours can be very long. Taking time off is difficult, sometimes you have to check in. Atmosphere can be too fast at times"
bad,"Nothing exciting to say about Macy's, it was a job. Was in charge of what eventually became a good cleaning staff. Enjoyed working with and getting to know them."
bad,"It’s not bad, but it gets stressful in the long run. Horrible work hours, horrible pay, unfair management. Overall, it is a great experience, but everything could’ve been better."
bad,"Worked seasonally and was hoping for permanent placement. However staff was not friendly, competitive and advancement looked grim. Had to fight for hours and not given much direction."
bad,The hours were only good during the holidays. Afterwards you were lucky to work twelve hours a week. The customers were often rude and I was working for minimum wage.
bad,"Macys was a routine job on a daily basis ,to assist the customers by ringing out there purchases to helping them with credit issues .To put out new merchandise and setting sales . The management team is very uplifting in everything they do as company .  Seeing the joy and excitement and pride on the face of a cutomer for buying there very first piece of a Levian Collection was an accomplishment that I enjoyed doing ."
bad,Not trying to bash this company. I am just sharing my over all experience. I did not receive hours nor was I paid for what I knew. That job was easy and I could do it with my eyes closed. The reason why I did not stay at this company is because of management. She decided to give her friend the full time position.
bad,Managers are horrible at this store. I quit because of management. I liked my job but they also didnt let you take your 15min breaks. only your 30- 60 min lunch.
bad,Company treated associates very well.  Customers loved shopping at the store and the associates were very friendly and helpful.  Macy's money was a big deal and the associates loved earning these for prizes.
bad,"If you are looking for extra cash for the holidays this is your place. The discounts are superb.. Typical day at work is dealing with customers, I learned that customers are annoying and needy, Management is OK. Culture is OK. Hardest part of the job is the recovery of sales floor. Most enjoyable part of job is the paycheck"
bad,"Depending on your manager, your vacation time could be forgotten to be put in my the manager so your vacation has to be postponed. The longer you work there, the more pto time (sick time) you earn. In the busy holdiay season, there are more hours given to work but because of longer store hours, many associates (sales & other departments) try to work extra hours so since their immune systems are comprised, many people are working while sick come early January. Usually after the holiday season is when funeral notices are posted up where you can donate to a deceased coworker's family to cover funeral expenses or even attend the funeral. I really don't think that's a coincidence. Good thing about working the non traditional 9-5 time slot is having a better chance of less crowded subway ride. Grocery shopping on the way home or shopping after returning home from work isn't too bad either since the markets aren't full with parents and kids yet."
bad,Macy's is the job where you press the high school or you just looking to make extra money is nothing that you can feed your family awful or feed yourself off of a long period of time but if you're looking for like a second job or to make you know extra money Macy's is a good job
bad,"There was a lot to do at times but then there would be really dry periods where no one talked to each other or had work to do. Once the chemistry between associates started getting better, the job environment was more fun to be in."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"A lot of good people work at Macy's.  The environment is friendly overall.  However, they will overwork you with no remorse.  If people quit due to poor working conditions, they may not be replaced, and you will be expected to pick up the slack.  Conditions will not be improved, even if you complain to upper management.  They hire people in ""on-call"" positions, meaning you get zero guaranteed hours and are expected to come in at a moment's notice.  Even part-time is only twelve hours a week minimum there.  Very high turnover rate in most positions beneath management, and for good reason.  My manager would, at times, deny people their scheduled breaks.  Every single person working under her left within a less than three-month period.  Very unprofessional."
bad,"I signed onto the EDP program where I was supposed to go through a 12 week training with a mentor before being a sales manager. However, I never received this training and was instead immediately thrown into being expected to function like a manager. They made numerous promises they did not keep."
bad,Nothing too grand about Macy's warehouse. Was just the same ol' thing night after night. Got repetitive very quickly and didnt have anything to really distract your mind from the easy labor.
bad,The pay is not good at all and there really is no room to grow within the company. Many Macy's department stores have been closing so the job security is very questionable there.
bad,"Great for work life balance.  Pay is not competitive.  Benefits package is not not competitive.  Management culture does not foster a culture of growth, opportunity and development."
bad,"It seemed like things at Macys changed every month. I had a knew manger every 6 months no one would stay because of poor management. The environment was pleasant, and the customers were nice. I only stayed around so long because I was in school at the time Macys wolfchase has no structure."
bad,"Macy's is one of the worse company's I have worked for.  The face they put up when you are hired and to the public is not at all what they really are about.  The company is about making money at the employees and customer's expense.  As a cosmetic employee, I had 2 different goals everyday, one from the company I worked for and once from Macy's which differed and were completely unreachable and unrealistic.  So everyday I knew I wouldn't meet my goals and it eventually weighed on me.  It is commissioned based and the respect among the employees is not promoted, they just want you get the sales no matter who or how you got them.  I was supposed to have events going on at the counter but I didn't have a direct phone line, voicemail, email address or way for the customers to be reached or to reach me.  I was expected to meet both my sales goals by being on the sales floor and to make phone calls to set up events.  I had training to do every few months that required me to be off the sales floor that were really unproductive and giant waste of time."
bad,i was able to learn and have more experience in the work force. Working at Macy's was able to gain more experience working as a team and teach to be a better leader and a person.
bad,"Great first time working in retail, pay could be a little better. But not terrible. Management is the only real issue you might havw. Unrealistic goals"
bad,Struggled with management and the understanding of policy and procedure. It was somewhat stressful but ultimately the job was rewarding and I was able to gain a lot of experience.
bad,"Loading,unloading semi trucks, moving heavy furniture, quality control inventory. Very fast work environment must be able to keep up and be very hard working."
bad,It is your typical retail job...Not getting paid enough for what you actually do. There is never really management around to assist so you are left to rely on your peers (that may not always have the answers) to assist you.
bad,"A regular day involved anything from working the cash register, cleaning and organizing dressing rooms, as well as keeping displays and racks presentable.  The job did not really have any difficult aspects but I would say the most time consuming part was keeping the store organized."
bad,the environment was typically pleasing because of the staff. they give too much work for little pay and your barely get a dollar raise at the end of the year.
bad,People I worked with were most helpful and friendly . Pay is terrible compared to the tasks you have to do...Enough time for break so you can relax. Too much expectations from employees
bad,"Much contention at this workplace, particularly among the co-workers.  Managers are okay, but not much of a team attitude with the co-workers.  But I suppose that's inevitable when the pay is commission-based."
bad,Scheduling was a nightmare. Attempting to get a work schedule set weeks or months in advance was seemingly impossible. This would make planning a trip nearly impossible.
bad,"Scheduling is up and down and not consistent. Hard to make appointments around it. Always under staff, rude managers. Everyone always look so miserable."
bad,"If you like working in a warehouse, then this job is for you. I needed a job and this was seasonal so I ended up applying and getting hired. I don't recommend this if you don't want to be on your'e feet all day."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,macys is a faced paced working environment . the good thing is to have something to constantly do and interacting with all the different customers. multi-tasking in this environment is definitely a must and satisfying your customers even the difficult ones is a must as well..
bad,"Everyday I walk to the dock in the store to unload the truck. I learned its time consuming, the management is not good, its diverse, long truck, breaks."
bad,"I like my manager, she is easy to get along with. She will work with you if you have a conflict schedule. However, much needed work supplies are scarce and to come by. We always run out of much needed supplies. How can a store run out of register tape ? or envelopes for gift cards ?"
bad,"Your free time does not exist. Associates work 3 Saturdays and 2 Sundays a month. Full time associates are supposed to work 2 opening shifts, I mid shift and 2 late/closing shifts. You will work more closing shifts than anything. "
bad,Management was usually comprised of friends; sales associates are usually left to fend for themselves where difficult customer situations are concerned...they have a new method of calculating pay so it is very confusing.  There is no associate discount on Macys merchandise other than the merchandise that the associates can wear to work.
bad,Macy's has not performed well in recent months is not the best working environment for minority professionals. The pay and work was not balanced.
bad,"More management needs to defend their employees when customers get unruly, aggressive customers get away with a lot at this location. Coworkers are very friendly."
bad,"Macy's pays the absolute lowest possible salaries and wages that they can. Both executives and associates are expected to work day in and day out for low pay, terrible benefits, and ""Macy's money"" as incentives. "
bad,"Nice environment "
bad,They train you up so that you get the hang of everything and then they leave you in huge zones to fend for yourself. they treat you like slaves and pay you almost nothing.
bad,"It was the kind of job that you wanted to try just for the heck of it. A retail job experience that was the ultimate in extremes. It was either crazy busy, or hauntingly boring, especially for someone who worked the overnight shift, and often had to be in dark, quiet, and cold storage areas all by yourself. The job was just for the Christmas season, but I was actually kept on for almost a year. I liked the job mostly because it offered many types of job experiences, from hanger and sensor collection, to late night tidying and restocking. The staff was very hospitable, friendly, and courteous, as you would expect from a large department store."
bad,part time is considered up to 8hrs? that's way less then part time and almost not worth the drive alone. specially when it is minimum wage
bad,"Every Year I was there things were going the wrong way."
bad,"I adored my store manager, he was a sweet man and knew what he was doing, but some of the staff and managers were quite hard to work with. I didn't really learn much of anything, I also don't see that much advancement in the company."
bad,The overall working environment is not positive. Management was constantly changing. Not a lot of room for growth. There are a lot of cliques in the work place.
bad,The work was pretty over-whelming and didn't match the rate of pay I received at the time. My direct manager was a pleasure to work with. He made sure I got the hours I needed and was pretty flexible with days I could not work.
bad,"They tell us the policy and break it all the time.  I told a man he couldn't  get a refund for his stained shirt because it was out of policy date.  The manager came and gave him a refund for a 3 year old stained shirt.  Customers and coworkers are great,  poor management .  They tell you one thing and do the opposite which makes he associate look like a fool."
bad,"One lady (while pregnant I might add) didn't want to teach us how to do the job we were hired for when putting new product on the floor, so we mostly watched and just did things when she asked us to. The training they paid us for as mostly things about not talking to unions and what to do when toxic chemicals spilled on the floor, something that did not happen ever. The manager took smoke breaks every half hour and then disappeared. I tried to follow the lady who seemed to know what she was doing around to learn what she was doing but she didn't want anything to do with me. It was really frustrating. They do enforce breaks very well though, but it was hard finding things to do when you ran out of work."
bad,"I actually loved this job until our team got a new lead. She treated me and one other coworker like garbage and management and HR did nothing to help us out when we complained about her on several occasions. Overall it was a fun place to work but this one person made it such a hostile environment for me that the good didn't out-weigh the bad and I had to find another place to work. Work/life balance is wonderful if you're in a part-time position like i was; I would sometimes be scheduled 11 hours for an entire week so that made it easy for me to have a life outside of work! And if you're a really hard worker and you're willing to learn, you can always work in different departments in the store to get the hours you need."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Ok company to work for I actually was able to have a home life with this company. Was able to pick my own schedule. If I wanted other days I could pick them up.
bad,"-a typical day at work:  "
bad,"typical day- I would stand in front of the Lancôme counter looking for potentials. "
bad,"Inventory stocking and assisting customers, getting customers to sign up for a Macy's card, and keeping floor and dressing room clean"
bad,"What I do at Macy's is merchandise the product onto the floor when it comes in also prepare for big sales, events and visits. I also do price change when it needs to be done. I love working with my coworkers because we all work together very well and that's what I like to work as a team. Sometimes the management is okay because there is not that much of communication with all the managers and with some coworkers. I do love my job as a merchandiser because it was something new for me to learn and I am still learning day by day."
bad,"co workers and managers was rude took their positions over board, head over hills due to working there for a long time i disliked the pay rate and the way they treated seasonal workers !"
bad,"Macy's is a good entry level position for someone that is looking to gain experience while in school, with the intentions of moving on to another company. The compensation is lower than most and the outlook for the company is not positive."
bad,This was a horrible experience for me. All of the executives are miserable and it starts at the top with the store manager. Executive turn was very bad and the district never addressed it.
bad,Macys is not competitive with hourly wages.  The company does not value its employees and is constantly adding responsibility while not adding compensation.
bad,"log in to the phone, open all the programs for the day, receive calls for sales or trouble shooting from former sales checks from other associates, placing e-mails, to leads assisting our customers needed and closing sales."
bad,"First off it was great working at Macy's for a short time,it gave me in sight to what customers do on a day to day and how we help people with purchases,also great on the resume! What I do not like is when people are offered the card,people tell them they have to do it to buy from this place,if you were sold that,I am terribly sorry. The commissions you get for selling brands are ok along with the cards, the benefit like the 20% is good sometimes even stacks with most coupons on items,if not the 20% will always be there for the associate. I have had customers come up to me and look around at stuff,then try to sell them the items,then they are like no thanks,I got one from ebay,or amazon,or that ebates place for less,and sometimes the website doesn't coordinate with prices in the store too and I have found that to be true at times. The good thing about this location they do mostly price match stuff off the internet. Make sure you get the best deal though if you have to research. Customers will be customers,I've worked for awhile,it comes with all jobs. The impatient,the I want it now,the bargain grabbers,the bribers,the call your manger,the I'm gonna act ugly kind,they are all out there,but just remember that your managers are your best friend. Now management can be tough,they have their favorites and are willing to call them before you. I always had a list of favorite managers to call here, some were a lil too bossy when you were in their area,very picky, I want my area this way,that's not clean but it is clean types...and when the seasonals came in,don't ring this,ring that"
bad,The Macy's name is how this company stands out. They do not pay enough for all they want you to do. Left after a few days. The employees that I did see and would interact with were nice. Supervisors seemed to be frustrated. Helping customers if needed around the store as I was working was nice.
bad,"In-bounding and Out-bounding trailers,  completing end of the day reports, daily rod and decker reports,   I enjoyed my time at Macys. My co-workers were extremely hard workers that gave their best at all times.  The hardest part of my job was making sure the trailers left at a reasonable time."
bad,"A regular work day as a shoe expediter at Macy's could include picking/delivering 200-250+ shoes, processing shoes to put back into inventory, or making sure that the sales floor was kept clear of shoe boxes ready to add back to stock. I learned how to work in a very team orientated environment, and manage time so that the companies needs where met. My original manager was very kind and always straightforward with the task that she needed to be preformed. My co-workers were already well antiquated with each other, which made the environment more like a family - this made me very comfortable working with them. Since the work was very labor inventive, trying to balance work and school was very tiring. The most enjoyable part of this job was working as a team to accomplish the companies goals."
bad,macys is a okay place for temporary work but not for a career. Management wasnt well the store isnt organzied and many times as a new worker you were left alone to handle the register on your own and not have someone for help
bad,"It is very stressful work environment. Management are not professional in-experienced and not people person."
bad,"Macy's did not compensate their employees well.  There were too many demands (quotas for sales) enforced, for the pay provided.  The other employees were nice to work with."
bad,"The most excited part of the job was getting acquainted with customers from across the globe and making them feel at home,and comfortable in the big apple exchanging ideas and cultural ,and alongside my colleagues made the workplace a fun environment especially when we had public appearance of the celebrities fragrances that we were selling and promoting .Its a fast past,seasonal,fashion district,productive environment."
bad,Working for Macy's as a Visual Security Officer / Asset protection agent has it's perks but is not without it's few flaws. They tend to be disorganized.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Everday was a little different which was nice, you had to work like crazy to get all the work done in a small amount of time though. The managers that I worked under have been fired since I worked there and for good reason im sure.  One of the ladies was very  condesending to the early morning crew. Hopfully things have changed since. Hours got earlier without much notice; from coming in at 6am to 4am. You can get a pretty decent amout of hours because of the Union, which helped."
bad,Working at Macy's for stocking and receiving wasn't the greatest job. The scheduling was really unreliable so it made working or getting hours almost impossible. They hired more people than they had hours to go around. Kind of a bad experience working there is all I can think of saying about it.
bad,"this job is an okay job, the hours is what gets you. I only work 2-3 days a week. Their trainers and supervisors also are a short fall, I was terminated cause of an oversight in work order. I picked two days that I was suppose to have been on fork truck, thus causing me my employment."
bad,Very good relationships between coworkers but too many sales people on floor to make good money. Everything else was alright iicluding benefits.
bad,"The people I worked with where great, the management is not great, and upper management has no clue what is going on. I didn't like the way that they treated the customer if they had issues with a product or needed a return, they also need to lose all the stuff that you have to ask the customer before even ringing them up, it waste to much of the customers time, and they really don't like getting pestered about stuff they really don't want."
bad,"The work day is usually slow, unless there is a big sale that day. The compensation is not exactly fare for what you are required to do. Micromanaging management style. There was not really much that was enjoyable about this job."
bad,"Not my ideal work place, no room for growth. The salary is terrible and the works hours. Most of Management is very nice. Most of their employees are on call. many of the workers go with out work for weeks or days."
bad,"lots of customer interaction. Learned a lot about the retail industry and how they provide customers with the needs in their demography."
bad,"In this job I learned how the Retail business works from when the merchandise gets off the truck and into the customers' hands. I've leaned ways to place merchandise to make it more attractive to the customer. Performed tasks of moving the floor around to increase sales, marking down prices, re-ticketing merchandise and all other support tasks that go with the Retail business. I've had to work with a number of different people to ensure the goods are out before store opening. As well as stocking merchandise in stock room so that the sales and fulfillment teams are able to find what the customer needs."
bad,Macy's is great for college-age part-timers. Very up-beat atmosphere. Good place for corporate beginners. Can be hard to adjust to constantly varying shifts if you are used to a regular work day.
bad,"Not enough hours in the day or enough pay,  to complete every project heaped upon you especially when you work alone.  No respect for company loyalty."
bad,"I was a part time employee there for only a few months and was only given about 6 to 4 hours a week, the most I had ever worked there was 32 hours for one week. "
bad,"only the ""lifers"" thrive there- they don't want to hear any new ways to do things or value outside experience or opinions."
bad,"I worked at macy's for a year, at first just as seasonal but they kept me for longer. at first the hours were good, flexible,  I was working about 18 hours a week, holidays were about 40 and they chopped my hours down to 4, without warning or explanation as to why. the mangers all but one were persistent and came immediately when you needed help"
bad,"It's a good place to work at, always busy, they're flexible with hours but don't give enough, most employees are friendly"
bad,"•	Had to retain knowledge about furniture, clothing and home appliances given to me quickly and was expected to be familiar enough to discuss this information with perspective customers."
bad,Macy's is a company that strategizes on utilizing few workers in order to save money. Many times we were under staffed yet they would not hire any new employees in order for us to complete the task more efficiently. also we did uch more work for only eight dollars an hour.
bad,"This is a review for Macy's Summit Fair, as I have not worked at other locations I can not review them. "
bad,The pay was terrible and still is awful. The only thing I liked about working for Macy's was the discounts. The work was doable but during the holiday season it was dreadful.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Typically, my day includes answering customer/guest questions or concerns about various things; i.e. driving directions, training questions and assisting them with filing complaints."
bad,"Learned how to use a computerized register."
bad,"Erratic Schedule, changed without my personal knowledge and done without knowing if I was available. Lack of assistance when needed in department."
bad,"This job is good for people who are looking for extra work to compensate for financial need in your household. "
bad,"What works in a store WILL NOT always work online. Recognize the people that get the job done, not the ones who talk endlessly and pass the buck."
bad,"sales drive, goal oriented, management poor, coworkers are fun.  Hardest part is not being appreciated for top notch performance.  Most enjoyable ...my clients"
bad,"A typical day at work for Macys included reaching store goals and opening Macys charge cards. Overall, I learned that retail is not for everyone"
bad,"The work environment is pretty standard in terms of a retail store; if you've worked retail before then you understand.  The training is a joke due to its infrequency and the blasé approach from the managers.  The management team is nice enough and they will learn your name, which is a plus."
bad,"I've worked in the clothing department. Co-workers are very helpful and friendly, most customers are as well, from my experience the management is more focused on pleasing the customers and making themselves look good. They do congratulate you for hard work, getting credits etc. But when you need help on the floor, or have an issue about something or someone there not as supportive and helpful. They also pressure you a lot on getting credits, which can be very annoying. Policy is NOT ENFORCED by all the managers some let customers get away with things making you look DUMB but others enforce the policy. Despite the cons,  this job is great if you just need a little extra cash, or if your going to school. This job is not for people who need the money for living expenses etc. There is Not a good paying job at ALL. A LOT of WORK with Low pay. CAN BE VERY COMPETITIVE! So please keep this in mind before applying."
bad,i didnt like or dislike macys. its crazy how many people shop during black friday.
bad,I loved all my direct co-workers but I did not like the way that the top management dealt with tough situations. Instead of directly addressing the issue they would try to cover it up. It was wonderful experience in human resources during College but its not a career I would pursue.
bad,"Assisting customers, struggling to understand frequent sale changes, co-works are always drama and lazy, management is poor, enjoyable was working with the hard working employess"
bad,not the best experience. glad to out of there. The managers are never really around.
bad,"Macy's is sorely lacking in a number of fields including potential for promotion in the company. It's a fine job for entry level people with no specific skills, but there are people there who have been in the customer service department for 15+ years who make only $5 more an hour than what they started with all those years ago, and no additional skills taught by the company to better the associates. It should not be looked at as a long term employment."
bad,Hard work with not enough pay. A typical day of cleaning behind people only.
bad,Some of the managers are very nice while a couple are AWFUL. They play favorites with their employees and if you are not one of them then you get treated very unfairly.
bad,I don't like this company. I can not advance here. I have nothing else to say.
bad,"Meeting new people everyday. And building people skills•	Provided excellent customer service skills"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Most of this job was dealing with down time.  Had NO excuses for getting anything done.
bad,"A typical day goes by really slow. Ive learned some things about customer service. The management can be hard to deal with. The co-workers do not make the work day go by smoothly. The hardest part of the job is having to stand on your feet all day. Lastly, there is no enjoyable part about the job."
bad,I worked here seasonal when it was Robinson's May. Macy's bought it and I left. Ok job.
bad,macys was great place for me to work but the managers werent that helpful alos they dont feel about their employees . they live their own life and they expect the best without doing anything
bad,"typical retail environment. the hardest part of the job is there is not the right amount of staffing for any department. the frustration comes from upper management not wanting to acknowledge this."
bad,"I enjoyed the department store atmosphere, but while I am a succesfull sales person it is not my passion."
bad,"ok company to work for, get paid minimum wadge, too much pressure to get credit cards, employees not treated fairly, too much pressure for amount getting paid."
bad,"I will hand it to management, I feel for them. They were generally friendly and did what they could to help, but I do wish they advocated more for employees...I'm sure they were just as expendable as we were. So their hands were tied on a lot of issues that could have made it a better place to work. They seemed to have nothing invested in their employees that made their business run. It was all about the shareholders and that came at the expense of employees who were paid peanuts and denied full time status even though they often worked full time hours, and also at the expense of customers who should not have Macy's credit cards, but were talked into them anyway (then subsequently could not make payments..the interest rate is obscene). If you need a job to make a few extra bucks here and there, go for it. All in all your co-workers will be friendly and some of the customers you meet will be interesting. but you will start to notice the flaws in the way the company operates rather quickly, and if you're anything like me, it will leave a very sour taste in your mouth."
bad,unload truck and get everything sorted and out to the floor help customers
bad,"Poor hours, poor pay, always changing schedule. This business is so large they don't truly care about their employees, you are just another face, that probably won't be there tomorrow."
bad,"Implement programs that provided a path to educate management and associates in the causes of shortage (shrink) and safety related losses, and methods that they can be prevented. A team player with the ability to bridge communications and team spirit with Loss Prevention, store executives along with store personnel."
bad,"able to schedule around everyday life, able to work with teammates, nice work enviornment"
bad,"I worked at Macy's from June 2010- June 2011. My year with Macy's was a typical retail experience. The pay wasn't great, the hours were long and the expectation for sales goals were ""reasonable"". What I found was that most of the managers struggled as leaders and they appeared to be over worked and under paid as well."
bad,"This job is customer base and it keeps you running, producing ideas for the customer to envision themselves in the best fashions. In this position, I learned a lot more humility and I had to display a good spirit all the time; there were no moments where I could just sit in a cubical and be to myself. I had to give the customers my best all the time because they could notice if you’re not attentive to their needs and they would take their money to another associate."
bad,"I absolutely adored the lovely ladies I worked with while at Macy's, Day in and day out we were motivating each other to drive sales, pull new clients by ""traffic stopping"" and teaching/learning new techniques to stay current with the ever changing fast paced life of makeup and makeup artistry. My immediate counter manager was the most amazing female leader I have ever been blessed with the opportunity to work for. She was strict but compassionate at the same time. And she definitely knew how to drive sales. The hardest part of the job was dealing with managers who took advantage of the position of authority that they were in, and not having the backup of the HR department when specific situations arose. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people every day and playing with makeup."
bad,"Management will hound you about sales goals and credit goals. "
bad,"Call monitoring, escalation and claim resolution. Each day was different and brought new/exciting challenges but there wasn't a solid orginizational structure for new companies they took over. "
bad,"I've been with the company four years. I've applied for eight different positions in five different departments and declined for all with no explanation."
bad,Macys is an ok place to work but the managers micro manage instead of letting you do your job and not enough hours are available.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,My experience with this company was just okay. At the time Time Warner was a mini project within another building and it quickly folded so i wasn't there very long.
bad,"On any given day, I would greet all customers that I see, offer my assistance, and ring up their merchandise, if they choose to purchase anything."
bad,Full time is only 28 guaranteed hours. They schedule late closings and early openings. The pay is pitifully low and expect too much from you. It's hard to take pride in your job when the upper management treats you poorly. (store manager). There are no perks. The insurance is too expensive for the salary paid. Would not recommend employment there.
bad,worked only part time over the holidays and was not impressed at all with management
bad,I work in Intimate Apparel. I've been trained to properly measure women if need be. I love it when we're able to find the perfect fit for the customer. My co-workers make the day at work pleasant. I've learned everything from great customer service to being a leader.
bad,"Macy's is great if you're working your way through school, however, as a full-time employee I am looking for more."
bad,management was overpowering and everyone wanted to boss you around in a different direction. They worked me 30+ hours a week but said i was contingent so i would not get the part time benefits.
bad,horrible work experiences I didnt like it management is horrid
bad,"not alot of hour,workinghard there for two year no rate and love the people there."
bad,"I don't believe in giving a bad name to anybody but working at this place is chaotic much of the time. This job is not flexible whatsoever, and require much of the employees but their effort is lack. One thing that is very important for a manager to have is how to speak to people. This is something that is lacking at this job. Whether it is talking to employees or the customers. A good thing though is that I learn to work independently and how to figure things out myself."
bad,"Macy's is good for a college student, but that's about it. They run on a point system, meaning each new hire begins with 6 points and once that balance reaches zero they are automatically terminated. They don't value their employees. The vibe I receive is that if you don't want to do it the way we're asking, we can find someone who will."
bad,"a typical day at Macys as Sales Associate consist of every one competing againt each other in order to meet sales qouta, being pressure by supervisers to open as many credit accounts as possible, dealing with rude and dishonest co-workers.The most enjoyable part of this place was closing time and recieving my paycheck"
bad,I must say if u like to stand for hours on in and not do anything. then this your job. i dislike it. i was so bored i had to pinch my self to prevent from going to sleep.
bad,"Macy's is a very successful retailer with excellent product. For commissioned sales associates, however, the company's draw against commission forces you to go into salary deficit where all hourly wages must be paid back before you collect any commissions. This sometimes takes weeks or months."
bad,I was here as a seasonal employee. I learned about being a sales assocaite and transactions.
bad,"Once hired the push is to sell as many credit accounts as you can. Your continuing with the company is based on that and performance and sales doesn't figure in. I volunteered to work extra hours, take people's shifts and kept a smile on my face. At the end of season they kept on people who were surly and in one case kept a girl who was single, had two kids, really needed the job and she didn't show up for three days and quit, it didn't work for her social life."
bad,"Very disorganized. Ability to choose a flexible schedule. Co-workers are very helpful. Very hard to advance to another level. Most enjoyable part would be customer interaction & connection. The job title you are assigned, isn't your exact title, you must do everyones job. Lots of work for low pay."
bad,"the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help people in the store usually tourist,not many locals."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of reviewing important communications through company emails, relaying that information to the relevant or intended audiences. I then manage a team of 2 associates who monitor the store for internal and external theft with some minor participation with safety. Also, it is my responsibility to conduct a shortage audit in the store every month and hold a shortage meeting with all executives. This position also requires me to be part of the senior management team in which we strategize together to run a successful business to impact sales."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Hardest part of the job is that its physical, and little compensation for the hard work expected/required."
bad,"My experience here is quite biased. I enjoyed the work environment, but unfortunately, I was offered less than 20 hours a week, sometimes as low as four. This was clearly the result of a struggling Macy's during recession."
bad,I've had better jobs who care more about their employees as well as the customer.
bad,A commission-only Salary is not the best way to work. I go into deficeit when someone returns a pair of shoes. I then i have give that money back to the store out of my paycheck.
bad,"It's nice, I just dont get many hours and some costumers are rude, others are kind."
bad,"It's a good place to work as you transition back to the working field. Unless you are a selling specialist or manager expect little growth from this company and I wish they would cut out the commission that way it would be less competitive and aggressive, not to mention since insite was created the scheduling is done very poorly."
bad,"A typical day at work includes assissting customers, handling cash efficiently, as well as meeting sales requirements."
bad,"This is a great company and was initially very good. My experience was not so good with my direct manager. I did learn how NOT to manage people from him, so for that I am thankful."
bad,typical setting for retail environment. involved a lot of folding of clothes and restocking. monotonous work environment as well. would not work at a macy's ever
bad,"Most of the employees were great to work with, company places high stress on meeting sales goals and following basic sales strategy to obtain that goal, stresses opening credit accounts and pay is very limited."
bad,I started working there right out of college because there were no other jobs available in the area. The job was really fun and relaxed. Then it turned into a total nightmare. The managers were forced to start cracking down on people for making their sales goals and credit card goals even though you dont make comission. Sometimes the sales goals were insane. They started hiring a lot of flyers who do nothing but right a steal customers all day.They changed the dress code to where you had to wear dark colored clothes. In order to get the 20% employee discount you have to have a Macy's card or else you will not recieve it. The floor started looking a mess as we had most of the clothes in the stock rooms and not out on the floor so we could sell to customers. You were almost not allowed to talk to you fellow associates on the floor only customers. They only give 10 cent raises and they pay very poorly. I left making $10.00 per hour. They dont hire managers from within they recruit from outside the store. So if you want to move up quickly go to a smaller store. The only great thing about working there was that i got to meet some really cool people and who I still talk to today and we all will never go back to work there.
bad,Store in bad location for upscale business. Not a good place to work. Other stores much better!!!
bad,"the management was horrible. besides that it was a decent place to work, the co-workers were nice and gave alot of hours to work with."
bad,"Typical day at work, went in, helped out customers needs and made sure the department was neat looking. Was required to asked customer to apply for a macys card. Loved the people I worked for but when it came to management some didn't know how to talk or treat employees. Was very hard to talk to them when you needed help. When it came for asking time off or a family emergency they didn't care, you were to work or lose your job."
bad,"A typical day would be fast pace, always busy,and the day go by fast."
bad,"Macys used to be a place where skills and values were prized but as with the company's hunger to consume it's competitors, it does so with it's own people as well now. While the systems are quite advanced among most retailers, the open to listen among management is a joke and the open door policy is only on paper. For a typical planner that holds their own weight, the average day is 10-12 hours long. A lot of the people there are very good at what they do and the level of experience and expertise is remarkably high which is a huge bonus for the company plus a valuable learning experience for those seeking to learn."
bad,"great people work there with no chance for advancment or appreciation,"
bad,Follow company guidelines in a routine manner.
bad,Poverty level wages even in management positions. Very demanding with an unreasonable amount of work to accomplish. Micromanaged through all levels of the organization. No opportunities for advancement unless you are under 35 years of age.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Macy's need better management...I didnt enjoy my time there,but I loved the store it self.."
bad,"When I first started working at macy's it went by smoothly then around the Holiday season employers started to quit, it was chaotic, costumers where fighting in line. I think the floor managers were unorganized and that is why it was such an awful experience at the end"
bad,When I started at Macy's it was a great place to work.  About a year ago the management changed.  the store is currently a mess and a good employee can't take pride in their work.
bad,"Management didn’t care much of what happened as long as someone was behind a counter."
bad,I didn't appreciate how the executives didn't take extended time to thoroughly train new employees... I wasn't told anything on my first day and was expected to understand everything the moment I was put on the sales floor. I was treated like a child when I could have been easily told how to correct small mistakes made as a newer employee but that never happened. So Disappointing. Most of the other regular employees always have a negative attitude and the managers are very rude when asked for assistance when employees need them the most.
bad,"Macy’s was a lenient company, but very unorganized. The manager’s boss at perimeter would pick on her and her section. Our time sheets would often be wrong and we would often not get paid for all our time."
bad,This job can be good for a he/she that's just getting out of school. But if your looking for something long term that's not the job for you they dont appreciate or value there workers. Some management walk round and stare at you to make you feel uncomfortable
bad,I worked for a young women who had transferred from Los Angeles.  She treated me differently than the other workers.  She was constantly scolding me and giving impossible metrics to meet.
bad,There is no advancement unless you live near the district offices and VPSM get fired so much that they rather replace them with someone they knownstead of someone more capable for the job. It’s all about who you know with this company.
bad,For the sake of your sanity get in and get out. Men’s department is more desirable than than the women’s. Better suited for career positions or high school students in search of work. Paid training
bad,The good of Macy's was that the previous management was good the new management was not involve with the employees. Were not reactive to a situation just let get worse which made it harder and expensive to fix.
bad,"My co-workers and managers are wonderful, encouraging, and always give 110%.  Having said that...  The scheduling system is terrible.  Everything is disorganized and messy.  We're often understaffed, which causes frustration for customers.  Commission is given in store credit.  I don't enjoy working here."
bad,It was a mediocre job but management is awful. Pay was decent and so was the job but there is no room for opportunities. If your looking to grow with a company making more money or more opportunities this ain’t your place.
bad,"The schedule is never the same. You can't go to college or make any plans, really. When you bring this to management, they tell you to go online and change your availability. However, you can't change your availability on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. I had to quit because I had school every Friday from 8am-4pm and they couldn't do anything to work around it. But I was honestly ready to leave anyway. It was either a really good day or an absolutely horrible day. They didn't inform me of all of the job duties when I was hired. One day, I got pulled into the office and I was reprimanded because I hadn't gotten a credit (signing someone up for a credit card) but I didn't even know I had to, and I wasn't trained on how to. When I said this, I was told I had to go to a training on a day I wasn't scheduled to work, and when I asked to reschedule because of a religious event, they said it would affect my reliability negatively. My manager was never there, and I was often left to cover the whole first floor because we were always understaffed. I honestly don't recommend working here at all. Save your time and sanity and keep looking for something else."
bad,I worked for this company for three years in the Arlington va location. I got fired because my manager lied and said I did something I didn’t do the managers are very sneaky and liars.everything was honestly ok until we got this racist supervisor who literally use to harass me and make racist jokes I told human resources how I felt and they just told me to write down what happens and what he says and we will document it so I did. One day he called himself organizing the clearance section and while he was organizing clothes fell off the hangerswhen he was done he told me to go pick up the clothes he dropped and said if I didn’t he would write me up I told Human Resources once more and the manager in Human Resources told me I’m just going to have to learn how to get along with him I asked to be switched to a different department it’s not like I wanted him fired I just wanted to be comfortable
bad,"Low salary, poor management, lack of information, lack of stock. Going to an on line store slowly.  Price points became a major problem.  There 7years."
bad,"While I am thankful for the experience I gained from working with Macy's, there was a very strange culture there that made it unbearable to work at. My manager didn't like speaking to me, I had more than one coworker confide in me that they were being jerked around my management and thinking of quitting."
bad,it was really stressful for the employees to work there. I really do not recommend it to any one else. If you want to work somewhere you need to find some whrere better.
bad,"On a regular day basis, around the holidays this location was always packed and fast paced no matter the time or the day. The hardest part on the job was always trying to fold a section in time before anyone came to the table."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Macy’s has a Incredibly high  turnover of employees and extremely low pay. I worked for a manager I liked and that is why I stayed with the company. Provided a fair level of training to employees. Communication between the different levels of management and employee was good."
bad,I was responsible for the presentation of my section and cleanliness. I helped customers often to find gifts for loved ones and outfits for themselves. No one bothered me as long as I did my job.
bad,I enjoyed my job Got hurt badly on job tore knee up had to have 2 total knee replacements Macys corporate terminated. me because I could not return on a date they picked even thou surgeon would not. release me yet from his care Macys not a good place if you get hurt in my opinion besides that its alright
bad,I worked there for 6 years and it was horrible. They expect you to do so much in such a little amount of time. They dont treat their employees very good at all. They are running on a skeleton crew anymore. Customers can't find salespeople to ring them out cuz they have cut the hours back so much no one is there anymore.
bad,"Working at Macy’s was mediocre. I was a “part-time” seasonal sales associate working in the men’s sports department on the fourth floor. What made my experience poor working there was my manager wanting me and other seasonals to work 9-11 hour shifts, four or five days a week. Essentially full time. I was mad. I was in school and simply couldn’t dedicate 40-50 hours a week working. Luckily my manager let me do 20-30 hours, but she didn’t like it. Oftentimes I found myself totally alone at the register, and I wasn’t the most experienced person on the floor, neither. It was stressful, to say the least. Sometimes I saw few other associates taking 1hr+ breaks when they were only supposed to be a half hour. Keep in mind your breaks are paid too. So these associates were getting paid to not work? I often felt like I was disposable to my manager and some coworkers. The only thing that kept me from quitting was a few coworkers who truly cared about me to teach me the ropes and get to know me. It was wonderful and I miss them."
bad,To much workload with less pay. To much pressure on opening credit application. Most of the time employees don't show up to work on weekends and to much work to be done with less hours. Few employees working at the sales floor to help customers.
bad,"Some bosses are okay some are not. You are assigned to a area and must keep it up plus the areas around it."
bad,"There's a reason Starbucks at Macy's is always hiring. People don't stay long due to poor management. Bad vibes: drama, pettiness, favoritism, ""fake"" people"
bad,You don't really have a regular shift. You can give them your availability but the can schedule you varying. Ways within that & especially on weekends
bad,"Macy's has an amazing culture and history as America's department store, but like any major retailer, they are subject to the economic shifts and the whims of consumers."
bad,"Macys thinks that your life revolves around Macys. Vacations, sick-time, personal days are considered an inconvenience. Corporate wants you to work hard while short-staffed. The union guarantees you fair wages."
bad,I was accustomed to big box retail and the clothing industry does not pay the same but the physical work was more. The part time full time mix was awful and the workload was too strenuous for the lack of labor.
bad,"There is always a quota on what to pre-sale and credit cards. They don't pay good for all the work you do for them. They expect for you to dress good although they don't do it with all. Also, they will throw away your drinks if you have them out. Not a good place to work at. Management is a a** kissing and two face society. Not to be trusted."
bad,Not enough training for the job.  You have to cover a large selling floor area. Good breaks and pay is good for retail.  Retail in general is different.  Not as much coverage.
bad,"At Garden State Plaza, Paramus, NJ: "
bad,"After working in the Warehouse distribution center in Florida i can never look at macy's the same, Its a sweatshop where the space can go from 80 degrees on a cool day to 110 degrees on a normal day and that's excluding those poor guys who are forced to enter the trucks and aren't allowed out till its either empty or break rolls around, and im talking 57 foot trailors made of metal and wood to insulate the insides... so their practically ovens. Now granted they only can probably get away with these conditions in right to work states however i know someone who was fired for joking about even joining a union in hopes to get ac units or even reliable fans in the warehouse... So while the people working next to you may be okay, its a brutal experience if your not use to that style of work conditions. Also lied about the amount of work you were to expect during the interview and tour process."
bad,"Working here omg term is not optimal. Everyone there was all for themselves, they claim to be great team leaders and teammates however it was very competitive and employees were spiteful. With the extent of work that is being done, there are no raises and you get paid minimum wage. Work hours are flexible but inconsistent."
bad,"Enjoyed working with a multi culture team and merchandising new items. Fun. But the store is hot in summer and cold in winter. Terrible pay, few hours.  Unless you are a student whose parents pay for everything, or you are working just for fun and don't need $$ then it is o.k."
bad,Worked for Macy’s for around 6 months as a Flex employee. Went multiple weeks with almost no available hours. If you are looking for a job with consistent hours available do not work here.
bad,"Poor management, lack of communication on all levels, no advancement unless you were one of the favorite ones. Assoc. don't do their jobs. They fight on floor. Rude to customets and nothing is done about it. You complain about something and they see two it that you or ignored or written up for being unruly and not getting along with people. They are unfair"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"While Macy's is fun to shop its terrible to work for."
bad,"Management didnt do anything after having filied reports against my counter manager for harrassment. Department manager favored certain employees and it was apparent to other employees in the department. Never given encouragement,  only criticism and not constructive."
bad,"I worked here for over a year, after 8 months I internally advanced and was promised a raise. I never received the raise. I also asked for PTO to be approved and was told it would be entered into the system, but never was. Management, and just the company in general, has no empathy for their employees and their personal lives. It is all about money and getting people to sign up for credit cards. I remember getting hurt on the job and management started treating me poorly and one manager asked me not to file a report because it affects the store or something. Asked to do a lot of random projects with no incentive. Overall not worth it."
bad,"There are VPSM's that are incredibly insensitive and frequently leverage intimidation and shouting to influence what they want accomplished rather than mentoring. "
bad,Each day varies. I enjoyed doing Fulfillment that was my last job there. The management really didnt help me when I had a problem .I enjoyed the work that I did.
bad,"love helping customers, and the discounts. "
bad,"Cleaned tables, answered phones, greeted customers. Managment can be easy going and some not. The enjoyable part was chatting with co workers and customers."
bad,"You get to learn a lot in the company, but the lack of pay especially compare to other companies. You won't get promotion or move up quick in the company. Especially if you start in Support. Overworked with lack of pay. Annual Raise is a joke. And definitely not enough pay to support a family."
bad,If you want a job that allow you to spend time with your family and weekends off this is not the job for you. The company is not doing as well as it use to be since  Amazon is the way people prefer to shop. Due to this  every year there's a chance of downsizing and possible store closures.
bad,"Communication from superiors was lacking. High expectations with little input. Fast paced environment, I absolutely Loved and enjoyed the job that I did and the associates that worked below me kept me there,  "
bad,I loved my coworkers and the options to pick up shifts during the week if I wanted. I also enjoyed being able to call out on the website. We got paid weekly but I felt very underpaid and not appreciated. I really didn't like management. They were fine with me but how they treated some of my coworkers made me so mad/upset. They didn't train anyone and hired people who barely spoke English ( which is fine in a sense but hard when the person isn't doing the job right and don't understand when you try to help them) Their attendance policy is reasonable but they don't even tell you about it in the beginning so I was calling out and losing my points when I didn't even know about the policy. They also changed my schedule a lot without asking me. The thing I liked the most was just doing my own thing without having to deal with customers on the registers.
bad,"I enjoy working with the people, but work life balance is not possible.  The thing that I liked about working here is the people.  The structure lacks, and they don't think about their people.   If they took better care of their people, then the company would be doing so much better."
bad,"Typical day includes scanning for markdowns,recovery, and adjusting signage for new sales. Was in at 5AM when I was scheduled to work which was for like 2 days a week. Your training is 2 days behind a computer and you are automatically thrown out on the floor to do inventory management and sale adjustments. It was hard to find anyone (a knowledgeable employee or a manager) for help or clarification. HR was horrible with helping to find departments to fill in for extra hours. Perks were small shifts and the ability to make your own hours to an extent."
bad,I was a seasonal sales associate so my typical evening hours consisted of assisting customers with their purchases. It was high paced and friendly environment. Management was knowledgeable in all products which helped in keeping customers informed.
bad,"During my tenure in Macy’s the objectives were to pack major brand women shoes and cosmetics. Also scanned receipts to make labels for destinations in order ship to customers through UPS"
bad,"Lots of physical work. Not enough employees for all your responsibilities. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,macys is a very diverse companythat is regularly hiring from the outside as well as offering some career advancement opportunities to some employeees within.need to always open credits and sell daily sales goal
bad,"The interview was misleading. I was told that I'd be doing one particular job and was put in the warehouse. Very unorganized, too many confusing and misleading instructions"
bad,"A lot of people come and go frequently. Management focus on opening credit cards, not a lot of flexibility in schedules or vacation time. Hourly pay is low."
bad,Would work at different counters so it was nice getting the feel of all of them but difficult working with coworkers at times especially since there  were only girls in cosmetic area.
bad,"I worked at a relatively small store in a relatively poor community during The Great Recession. Management didn't care about all that and thought we should be breaking sales records every day. They'd act like the sales associates were at fault for a slow week in sales when WE had barely made it in to the store alive thanks to snow. And they'd hound us push their ridiculously high interest credit cards on people who were adamant that they didn't want them. ""You can save 20% on everything you buy today and tomorrow,"" they'd have us say. ""And once you're done shopping, you can pay it off at the register and you don't have to worry about it again."" Then they'd all come in a month later demanding to know what that $2 charge was. Macy's sure did love those $2 charges. I used to visit the store after I moved on to another job and look around and wonder how I'd survived for three and a half years. Then that old store closed, and there's still not another anchor store to take its place. Macy's is dying, a little bit at a time. If you need a job, take it, but never stop looking for something better."
bad,"They only care about how many credit cards you can get them, and when the customer comes back all they do is complained about the terrible service they get ugh."
bad,Macy’s is a revolving door for entry level employees. There is a point system with your attendance is difficult with management’s verbal requests. No room for advancement or higher pay.
bad,Everything you do is accounted for and audited.  Strict managers.  Most managers are not interested in the people that work for them.  Turn over has become terrible and almost everyone in my office is unhappy.
bad,"I worked at Macy's for two months, as a seasonal job. At first, it was a easy, hardworking job that had a good pay. After every shift I would calculate, my money and noticed clock in errors that hadn't been recognized by the Macy's team. When i had eventually spoke up to the shift manager he told me to correct it myself but the pay would be sent with my next check. It showed how unprofessional they are and how their systems are not dummy proof."
bad,"I loved my first job with Macy's, but I decided to move to a different department because I wasn't getting enough hours every week. Big mistake. I moved to a department with a very mean boss and my job didn't follow the job description. I said I wanted to be in that position for a short amount of time, and ended up being there over a year. I was treated horribly by the management, but all of the retail associates are so sweet. I've met some of the nicest people here."
bad,"Manual warehouse work unloading 53ft freight trucks 1 box at a time for minimum wage. Good managers, great work culture, hardest part of the job was callouts less people took longer to do the job."
bad,"The hourly rate was OK, however there was little or no commission."
bad,the Macys where I worked at was not busy would spend almost all shift walking around cleaning up the clothing set because there was no customers to engage with
bad,"Highly competitive in the men department. I worked with men shoes mostly and product knowledge is a must to sale shoes, clothing or"
bad,I did not like work there cause the pay was not good for the type of work you did. A very stressful place to work at. The only thing i like about the job was some of my co-works.
bad,"While I was there I taught myself, of course when I became an executive it became even harder, having to relocate to a store as a part of my advancement, and not get the training AT ALL while I was there,( almost 4 years) was the biggest strain. The people I worked with made it easier but was there any formal training, no, none at all."
bad,"If you are a student, it's easy to get your days off. However, there are a lot of call-outs from other people and the managers don't care about you at all. Sometimes they would take you away from your department to cover in another because they are short on people, but when you need help or cover for your self, the managers don't care and don't come to help you at all. It's a miracle if they come to you at all. If you need help with a return and know something's wrong with it, they just say return it because they don't want to come to the selling floor. If you have a good department and you like the people around you, good for you. My department (INC 4th floor) seems like the only sane department out of the whole Union Square San Francisco store. Discounts are good but with the coupons are starting to disappear and most of the customers won't be able to use it."
bad,"Fun team to work with. Management was severely poor. I was thrown on to sales floor during mothers day weekend as a flex assoc. it was basically sink or swim and after talking to many employees that was the nature of how it went for almost everyone after a daunting almost 4+ hour day of training on a register in a secluded office you were basically on your own. Store manager would come on to the floor verbally abuse sales associates. Pressed to sell Macy's credit cards  which meant taking advantage of the foreign customers who didn't understand anything other than that they were getting a 20% discount, elderly people, young people. Forced to use the my client system where you basically harassed customers via phone. Its usually who you work with that makes a job more manageable so if luck has you, youll be blessed with decent department with good people and department management. If not good luck."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I do not want to provide this information.   Fairly good team work.  Learned how to merchandise and price change.  Worked early mornings to early afternoons.  Management gave huge work tasks but we weren't given enough work hours to complete those tasks.
bad,They cut 16 associates from the store! we are so under staffed and stretched thin. My full time shift was cut. Then they offered me a part time shift. That's one of the reasons I'm leaving.
bad,fast paced always in a rush to get the products to the floor. trucks were daily so we would have to have the truck unloaded by the end of our shifts. the hardest part of the job was the trucks and lifting those heavy boxes.
bad,"As the company continues to find their place in a changing retail landscape, there have been many jobs eliminated. The jobs are pushed to those remaining, leaving many with unattainable workloads."
bad,"My expectations for working at Macy's were not met by a lot. At first it was okay, I got okay hours and occasionally full-time shifts. After 3rd week, I git hours cut off, poor management system, most staff was unfriendly. Although my experience wasn't so pleasant, I did learn how to be in merchandise and how to set up the departments and learned about sales and damages."
bad,"worked in the shoe department for Macy's it was tough worked on commission and you had to make your sales. problem was the store I was at was so slow so everyone was trying to get the sale and at times got really competitive and people were stepping on each others toes. I must say though the people I worked with made it a great time and I enjoyed them more than I did working here. The company messed up a lot when it came to me, taking away my full time and benefits because I transferred stores but didn't tell me anything before hand, promised me full time but then took it away.."
bad,"This company requires a lot but is not willing to give back in return.  Upper management has no idea what is actually happening in stores, if they spent half as much money on their employees as they do on celebrities they may have a chance..."
bad,While I enjoy my short stent at Macy's assisting customer's with their selection of make up and fragrances; I felt the hours and pay were awful.  I would not re-apply for this job.
bad,"absences are a big idea to them regardless if you're ill. depending when hired determines your ""points"" allowed for the year. no weather absences excused wether  you can safely report to work"
bad,unorganized stock rooms. Not enough communication. Not enough help. last minute schedules. The people are nice to work with. I've gone through 3 managers in 2 years.
bad,"Minimal to no growth potential, flexible work/life balance but requires full commitment to work Thanksgiving to Christmas, competitive salary........."
bad,I really liked my manager but the pay here was horrible and they are phasing out full-time employees. I got very ill for over 5 days and they let me go.  I had to tell my own manager I was fired because they didn't even tell her!  They just kept dropping my hours in the system.
bad,"I liked my manager. However, when a new position opened up that allowed people to receive commission I tried, but would never get it."
bad,"For the job they had me doing, I did not get paid well. If you're a holiday sales associate they treat you like less and you're doing the same exact job as everyone else there but not getting commission."
bad,Macy’s definitely has giving me everything I need for this level of my life. Now it’s time to go to the next level and to work towards my full potential.
bad,managment is bad all they do is boss you around instead of helping you and teaching you on what to learn. They also get sippy when yu ask them a question about something that you dont understad.
bad,"During my employment with Macy I was able to learn new skill and gain much experience from my manager, and move into a management position that allow me to train and management a team which will allow me to take that experience and as part of my career goals"
bad,"It was an okay experience. Store Managers need to treat their employees better. The assistant store manager wanted things done a certain way and when it was done that way but customers didn’t accept it the ASM was called to help. She made the employee look like they didn’t know what they were doing and instead gave the customer what they wanted, which was against the policy the ASM wanted to “enforce”."
bad,I requested a leave of absence  because my mother was sick and they said I needed a doctor's excuse for my mother. I could not obtain one because my mother was in another state and so I had to quit to take care of my mother.
bad,Its a slow sells venture with not much to do but wait for the customer. in understanding that there are other things to do as in dust or organize. other than that the job is comfortable but nothing extravagent
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,A typical day at macy's would go very slowly. at times there wouldnt be any customers around to help or any work to be completed. what i learned working at macy's was to never settle for less.
bad,"My main dislike about working there was this: I felt under-trained/under-prepared (4 hours of videos) for working multiple departments in a multi-level location. I did not know or learn where many things were, and was consequently useless to guests who would come up to me, asking where they could find something. I didn't even get the opportunity for a single shadow shift. The scale of the store and rush of customers (I worked seasonally, and my second day ever was Black Friday starting at 7 am) left me feeling panicked and overwhelmed during my shifts, and thoroughly exhausted after. I'm sure there are employees, both former and current, who were adequately trained and felt assurance about their knowledge of and role in the story. I simply was not one of them."
bad,Loved working with my fellow associates.  Felt like the pay was inadequate for responsibilities I had.  Management did not a lot of times support the associates.
bad,Your hired as a sales specialist but expect to do other things like merchandising or cleaning the department which is not bad. The only thing is not all employee help so your probably gonna do most of it. Expect to deal with a few irresponsible people who found comfort and how to avoid doing their work. Like all places there are hard working managers and their also some slackers. Overall just do your job and you'll be fine.
bad,"Great company, very good benefits, family oriented company, flexible hours, amazing mentors, customer service is the biggest key, More than a company its a family"
bad,Macy's no longer cares for its employees and I'm pretty sure they would only hire part-time if they could get away with it. Their culture has been in decline for years and I would not recommend working there unless you have no other options.
bad,"A typical day at Macy's can be boring, normal or really busy. It often gets hot by registers. Customers can sometimes be annoying as well. Managers always need you to pick up the slack for someone else."
bad,Let's be honest it's a commission based retail job. Pretty terrible work but very flexible and a nice way for a young adult to make some pocket change.
bad,"not alot of pay pay and they have it so you are working all the time."
bad,"Managment team at this particular store showed minimal teamwork, that trickled down to the associates. Work environment was stressful and unmotivating. My direct team in Loss prevention was amazing."
bad,"Well when i first started here it was great i get to learn alot and i had so much fun with my co-workers. Then later management was getting bad and a lot of people where getting fired a lot of people and i believe they are letting employees go cuz the company is not doing good. There is not enough employees at the clothing section. There is so much favoritism that if you want to be a manager or something better you have to suck up to them.  They will fire you for anything , yet again its a job not a career everyone is replaceable"
bad,"You get tremendous work-life balance here. But the fact that brick-and-mortar stores are dying and your online operation can make up for so much of the overall business. Rounds of layoffs are looming. Stock prices of Macy's (M) dropped more than 20% in the past couple weeks. No good compensation packages and no paid holidays. Lots of full-time contractors on-premises who are doing the real-work. Standard American mid-sized businesses that are run by full-time contractors, who get most of the work. Full-time employees are there to chill and work from homes. Job security and advancement are lacking thereof. Managers are weak. Some got in early and thus become managers. Or you have got to be minority of some sort. However, it doesn't mean managers are doing the real managerial work any longer as some of them work remotely a 100%, whether it's from out-of-state, or out-of-town. Job culture is more like you do less to make less mistakes to get promoted. There is no real reward systems for the majority of the full-time contractors, who're pouring in the real sweats for real-work. Totally a shadow of big American businesses like Oracle Corporation Marketing (based in Redwood shores, which shipped most of their jobs to off-shore, and hire contractors after contractors as the full-time managerial staff are already set and on-shore, enjoying wonderful life styles, and preparing for retirement. No real motivations to succeed. It's like if you're aggressive and motivated, and are willing to change things quick, you're stopped here and be punished with the mistakes that came with it. A mentality"
bad,The department I was in was handbags and  I was not getting hours and i was bored half the time.  I liked working with the people i was with but I just didn't like doing nothing.
bad,Worked at Macy's for two years but the mentality of giving the customer whatever they want and breaking rules to make the customer happy are not for me. Also no place for advancement if part time.
bad,"company is not sure what the want to do or where they want to go. They do not compensate their employees well."
bad,"This job was pretty hard had to be able to lift heavy merchandise and work very flexible hours, the work place wasnt very organized and the management was awful."
bad,"Awesome opportunity to manage a team out of college.  However, work-life balance is non-existent. Long hours, multiple weekends and holidays spent in store."
bad,"Macy's does not pay a living wage, and they also encourage the employees to buy there so that many employees put their meager paycheck right back into Macy's pocket. I had one great boss/manager and knew of several other managers that were good managers and good people, but not all. The workers get along well and most of the associates are nice. I worked in loss prevention and there were a lot of rules broken, and not a lot of transparency, and A LOT of playing favorites. There were some good VSO's that left because of high school-like favoritism. It is not a good place if you want to actually make money and be judged on your merits rather that by brown-nosing. A lot of lying goes on as well. They fired most of the good people. This is strictly in the Loss Prevention dept. Far too much immaturity in a department where seriousness should be a priority. One good manager there and he was the assistant LPO manager, and one good detective and she was the youngest one. Would not recommend to anyone who takes work seriously."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Pay is bad the people I worked with were decent and the job itself was decent. You do get a discount card for shopping. Job security exists but advancement doesn't, management was decent and the job culture makes you feel like you are part of a family but you still get paid nothing."
bad,"Depending on store traffic and location some days are busy some are dead, management treat their employees with disrespect and aggressive manner. Majority of the clients treat workers as though they are sub human loud disrespectful and rude. The pay does not compensate for the stress."
bad,"a typical day at Macys is very busy, open our registers, do fulfilments,  we have to remerchandise, and tidy the shop floor, management has a floor round meeting every morning to inform us of the progress the day before, we open up and get ready for our customers."
bad,"It seemed like Macy's had a lot of growth opportunities when I started with the company, but that has steadily declined. The company at a corporate level has become cheap, cutting higher level management positions and adding low paying leads. More work is constantly being added as well. I felt like I ended up doing the equivalent of 4 people's jobs."
bad,"I started working at Macy's maybe a year after graduating college. I was interviewed there, and was promised since I had a degree and studied make up in college that I would be hired on as a make-up sales rep. However, I would have to start off as floater in the make up department first until I was able to have my second interview with one of the reps from one the make u companies that sells through Macy's. After orientation and training I was never put on the schedule or called in. I soon found out that employees could pick up shifts online. Therefore, I picked up a few shifts for that month. Before I could work the shifts I requested to cover I finally got a call from the manager that hired me to ask me to work Black Friday, though I literally had 3 days worth of training (I already had customer, and cash register experience from previous jobs). I ended up agreeing to work even though it's one of the busiest days of the year in retail.The night went well and I made a majority of the sells that night. In the morning when the regular staff that worked that counter; though, I had did well, were very rude. The manager tasked me to hand out perfume for the rest of my shift. After this incident I was put on schedule mostly to hand out perfume tabs, which the job was mostly commission based. I didn't get to work the make up counter as much as I would have liked to being there. Though I was hired as a floater make up advisor. I didn't make as much because of this, and I never had my other interview. I ended up resigning from the position. The employees are cut throat. They don't like"
bad,I made some great friends there and I liked the flexibility. You could pick up more shifts around the holidays. You got your schedule for 2 weeks at a time sometimes more. that was helpful.
bad,"the only bad experience i had with Macy's is the constant pressure to open up certain amount of credit per day, it made work stressful and not a fun environment to work."
bad,I started off in the juniors department and relocated to cosmetics as a beauty advisor. I would say there is room for advancement BUT not worth the compensation. Another cosmetics brand that was our competition was making WAY more hourly than my counter. Unfair knowing that they are in the same store as us. Also management was always different or changing. Really liked my team I met but still not worth working there. Your better off at MAC or as a traveling artist.
bad,"Being a Macy's retail sales associate was one of the most boring jobs I have ever had. Half of the job involved folding/fixing clothes while the other involved selling customers clothes. If there is one thing that I can take from this place is that it taught me a lot about suggestive selling. Other than, the management team was hardly seen, the other employees all had their own sections of the store so did not talk much, and the pay was the absolute bare minimum wage for Washington."
bad,"Macy's overall is a good workplace. But as a student they dont work according to my schedule and cut back on hours without notice. Management wise , they could be more organized. Speaking in terms of what to do during store hours and who to listen and not to listen to."
bad,Macy's praise employees with applauds when sales goals are met. People are critiqued & encouraged to strengthen sales approach to improve sales for Macy's profit.  Macy's is a great place to learn about new trends and customer service.  The work load was perpetual but fun...Retail is a great place to work only for those who love working with the public; like myself.
bad,i did enjoy dealing with the clothes but did not enjoy working alone while still having to complete 5/6 different tasks. some of the managers where exstreamly helpful while others where lost in the sauce.
bad,"A typical day at Macy's usually consists of you coming in, reporting to your team leader at the time you get there, walking to your specified zone, assisting a ton of customers every hour, and hearing people complain all day. Most of my skills and knowledge I developed at Macy's regardless of how bad of a work environment it tends to be. I learned what hard work and customer service really means working for Macy's. Customers really expect top notch customer service each and every day from associates which can sometimes be challenging. Rest assured once you learn all of the functions of this store executing perfect customer service becomes easier as the months roll by. Luckily I worked under amazing managers but there are also a mix of horrible managers so management can be a little blended. You will get a feel for each and every type of manager style working for Macy's which taught me how to be flexible and compatible with each one. The workplace culture is just simply erratic which often times makes it a challenging store to work for. The hardest part of the job was really the culture and the employees mainly because of how depressing it can be when you hear everybody on every floor in every department always complaining about something. Don't get me wrong I met some great coworkers and the teams I worked for were usually excellent but complaints were frequent which often times leads to low morale. The most enjoyable part of the job was how flexible scheduling can be and meeting different people every day."
bad,"All focus and pressure is in opening accounts"
bad,"This was a great company to work for but with the retail climate changing to Ecommerce , the climate of the in store experience has changed. If you are looking for a long term career job I would not recommend this Company."
bad,Decent company to work for but the company is moving in the wrong direction.  Stores are closing and people are getting laid off; to include myself.  I was recently laid off as 1/3 of the Sales Managers ( my position) in the company were at the end of the 2016 fiscal year.
bad,This job alright to start with then progressively got worse. Management was very unhelpful in many ways. There is no flexibility in the schedules once you pick one your stuck with that set.
bad,"I loved this job if they payed more I would probably stay. Was a sales associate. Only anonoying thing was pushing Macy's credit cards, you were rewarded for it."
bad,"It was very boring and not very much to do on a daily basis. The best part about the job were the people you get to work with. Management wasn't the best, most of the mangers have favoritism with certain employees, others are just very friendly an actually car about you but these managers were rare. When i worked in the women's side, on the other side of the mall, I experienced some sexism as being one of the few guys who worked there. I was one of four guys who worked on that side and I was constantly asked to do things like reorganize a stock room five times because the manager didn't like how I organized it, and yes this did actually happen. If you like to work somewhere very boring, but have some pretty cool co workers, then by all means apply."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Expect to work like a horse and receive little to no meaningful compensation. Management here is a joke, they have no clue how to treat employees. They only care about customers, forgetting that a happy employee makes customers happy as well"
bad,"Macy's was my first job, but they don't appreciate your work. They wage sucks even for me being a loss prevention agent. Benefits are kind of good but paying sucks."
bad,Good place to work. They give a lot of people a chance to work for them. They offer there employees a great 401 k investment plan.
bad,"Creative review, Creative Direction, Art Direction, designing web assets. I learned a lot from this experience. However the negative work life balance took its toll. The most enjoyable part of this job was working in New York City."
bad,Macy's is a company that i do not recommend staying in for more than 3 years. Managers are unprofessional and do not help the growth of their associates. They do work with your schedule to an extent. The managers are only concern with what benefits them as well as their Macy's card statistics. Again I would not recommend anyone staying passed at least 2 years with this company.
bad,"It's a standard call center with all the pro's and cons therein. the scheduling is rigid and inflexible, but if you have a decent manager, they will try to work with you"
bad,"There were far too many managers for how disorganized a daily shift was. Miscommunication was all too common, and the environment was ultimately what caused me to leave."
bad,The job position is required to be there before the sun rises in an early morning. It is fun to look at different items of clothes.
bad,"Great experience to grow and learn "
bad,People told me not to work at macys but I didnt listen. management has no care for their employees. Employees who do their job are overlooked while other associates who ignore company policies and are selfish are gratified.
bad,I do not think the work was hard but they do not train you long enough. They make you figure it for yourself. Some of the staff was friendly.
bad,"Customer traffic changes, usually slow but it can get busy at times and busy quickly.Opened registers, provided great customer service, greet customers and sell sell sell the products,make connections with customers, help with payments, returns and purchases. fix the department and answer phone calls."
bad,Macy's has a fast paced and lively work environment. The hours are long  and the work is diverse. The hardest part of the job is standing around when work is slow. The best part of the job is meeting and interacting with people from all over the world.
bad,"i just need a job with set schedules so I may attend school. I would like to make advances at said job if it is in the field of sells, cause ultimately a career in sales is my goal."
bad,"work is relatively busy, fast pace"
bad,Macys can be both a challenging and rewarding place to work. One must be able to handle all types of issues in a fast pace enviornment
bad,"Macys does not value or respect their employees. They are constantly adding extra responsibility without extra compensation. Management strives by belittling their employees in front of customers and co workers. Policies are non existent and employees never know what to do and what not to do. This company unfortunately is one of the shadiest I've ever worked for. The only plus sides of the job are the hours, breaks,lunches, and the great co workers and customers you meet. This is definitely not fit for a long term job. But great for part time."
bad,"A typical day at work consist of connecting with customers, providing outstanding customer service and driving sales. Providing great service encourages customers to return. Management being available in difficult situations helps to resolve issues in a timely manner. Having co-workers who works as a team and helpful when busy/hectic can be very helpful. Seeing customers happy with selection when assistant requires and eager to shop more gives you a awesome feeling."
bad,"I honestly thought the experience was o.k. Nothing much to rave about. Because if you're working in labor you usually get paid less. But, it was only hard to work there due to the lack of consideration for people who've worked there a short time. Plus, having and being told to over for people who'd refuse to do their jobs."
bad,"Everyone I worked with at the time I worked at Macy's has either quit, retired, or gotten fired. I saw things I shouldn't have seen there. I hated it during the holiday and it made me hate retail."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I had a blast when i first started macys. After the first couple of months of working here, I got over asking for credits. Credits are everything here. Managers dont even begin to work with you unless you perform the way they would like you to. The hardest part of the ob is getting people to apply for accounts. Getting credits is what everyone here dreads. Also, the raises are not a lot. They rarely ever give raises over 10 cents."
bad,"Poorly managed, not a very good orientation to expectations and training.  I had to learn on the fly. Only got an average of 8 hrs per week after being promised 20-30 hrs. I did appreciate the online access to schedule and being able to switch or request changes and additional schedules."
bad,Experienced retailers with sales and or management skills will find Macy's to be on the low end benefits and pay scale. Very good job for new candidates to learn the business.
bad,My most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers. However being a sales environment there were those less honest employees breaking a lot of rules which I do not wish to associate with. Another factor is that the branding is misplaced. All sell-able items were moved to a different area resulting in making no commission leaving me with no choice but to look for new employment. It is not a career which i am looking for.
bad,"I love managing the Furniture Gallery at Macy's. Unfortunately, as management jobs are deleted, I spend less time in my gallery."
bad,"fast working shift, where we'd come in at 5 a.m. and process freight daily. prep for inventory, pricing ticketing. prep for different sale events and prepare for Christmas holiday"
bad,"Days are either fast paced or slow, depending on sales. I liked the people I work with at Macy's, the associates in my department were great. However, the management leaves something to be desired. They are a corporation so even the Store Manager has very little say and they can often not help with issues or complaints associates have. They are only there to back you up in the case of angry customers, and even then only if they will answer their phones. Co-workers are what makes it bare-able. I worked with many elderly ladies and I really enjoyed it. Hardest part of this job are the hours- you often work 1230 to 9 one day and 945 to 630 the next. Your schedule is different every week it is very hard to balance life and Macy's."
bad,After working as an Asset Protection Manager at Macy's I was subjected to numerous injuries and dangerous situations with their hands on policies in regards to making external apprehensions on shoplifters. Management does not care about their employees and development.  The overall culture is lacking within the store on all levels which bring a store together like other retailers I have worked for.  Overall I would not recommend working at Macy's.  Employees are also mostly underpaid at this company.
bad,"Macy's seems like a fun place to work on the surface but the customers and managers are rude, and stuck up. Associates were constantly trying to stab each other in the back. Managers hardly wanted to help the associates, they said to figure everything out on your own."
bad,"There where a lot of brick walls to this job . The Salon was a sub lease of Macy's and the two cooperates did not work well together to accomplish the need of the salon , which made my job more of a challenged to bring up the numbers. I did however continue to bring numbers up. After leaving the business only one girl stayed on ."
bad,"Typically sales associate alone in department to customer service, do go backs, check fitting rooms, and make goals."
bad,"While working at Macy's I have learned a lot about sales and engaging with customers, customers always come first no matter what the circumstance is. There are a variety of managers at Macy's for each department. The managers are very helpful when the sales associate are facing difficulties or need further assistance with a customer. However, when it come to the employees I do not feel that the managers are as concerned with the personal situations that we inform them. I feel as if they are only trying to satisfy their supervisor. Besides the relationship between managers and employees, one of the hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable part are the customers. Hundreds of customers come into Macy's a day and each and everyone of them is different. I love engaging with happy customers helping them find what they are looking for and learning from them. However, along with happy customers there are always some challenging ones that can make my job a little difficult at times, and keeping a positive attitude in those situations is always hard. Each customer has a different situation and some are more challenging than others, which is why I think customers are the hardest yet most enjoyable part of the job. No matter how challenging a situation may be, in the end I always learn from the situation."
bad,"Boring job, lots of clothes folding, easy work but major time kill. Management was a pain, albeit friendly. Lots of time to yourself, but constant folding, cashiering, and standing."
bad,"i would open macys and close it six days out of the week. i worked hard and was one of the top sellers"
bad,"Management at Macy's is hard to accept. There is favoritism in whoever they are close with. Managers do not provide support needed when it comes to customers. Other than supervising, they provide little to no help."
bad,I was price team member. don't have a lot of hours in that position which makes the pay after taxes so low it was too hard for me to get to work because I couldn't afford bus pass.
bad,My typical day at work is processing the truck and placing items on the sales floor. I learned how to merchandise the Macys way. My manager is very helpful and easy to work with. I love to work with my co workers helpful and fun. The hardest part of my job is making sure most of the truck is done before the store is open when I am working by myself. The most enjoyable part of my job is putting new merchandise out on the floor for customers to buy. I like to see how well it sells.
bad,"My team work so hard.  I look at my team as my second family. The counter and the sales team is what drive the business.  When is come to management, the only time they come around is when they want you to sign up for Macy Credit.  The hardest part about the job was having to watch your back at work with management, because it was too much like high school again.  if someone don't like you just because they will gun for you."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Macys is a very interesting place to work.  It provides independence, motivation, and an opportunity for growth.  Besides it gives the pleasure to see all the sales and other benefits that comes with the package."
bad,"Calling clients and seeing if they need products replenished. Recruiting customers that are in the store. Make overs, working on pre-sell and having clients scheduled for up-coming events. Meeting sales goals on a daily basis. Hardest part about the job is you can be doing everything you can possibly to meet your goals and get in trouble for not opening enough credits."
bad,I've worked for this company for the past 3 years and in that time they have laid off workers and told me that instead of laying me off they put me down to part time when I was hired as full time and that I should be thankful I didn't get laid off. The whole time working for this company I never had benefits. Each time I applied to get some they would give to me for a month or so and then end up taking it away and when I asked why I never recieved a straight answer. One of the worse Human Resources I have ever seen. They never helped employees and each time you went to them they would roll their eyes and not really care. Most of my fellow co-workers worked well within a team with the exception of a new few who tend to do nothing and get away with it. Most enjoyable part is the people who did chose to work and work in a team.
bad,"Macys is an outstanding job opportunity. It has its up and downs such as Management and employees, but it was dependable and the environment was always a success"
bad,"very focus at work"
bad,"Not a bad place to work for an associate, supervisors are overworked, underpaid and unappreciated"
bad,Good summer job for my first employment opportunity. Learning experience
bad,"A very productive and friendly environment between co workers. Also, there's a team work and our own way of having fun just to lessen the workload. Getting to know each other. And helping one another."
bad,it was a good seasonal job other than the hours. when you have a seasonal job you are working through the holidays
bad,They treat their associates like high school students. Unless you have been there for 15 + years don't expect to move anywhere in this company
bad,"My first day at the job was pretty insane. The co-workers didn't train me on my first day so I was struggling with the customers because I didn't know what the procedures were on selling, and the manager wasn't really cooperative as well. I asked for training and the manager told me that I will have to learn on my own. I figured they would at least train me for a few days but the 5 days that I have worked there was okay. I was pretty much on my own and I was only an on-call employee so I did not have a reliable schedule."
bad,work was simple and shifts were long but management seemed always to busy to assist with questions at times.
bad,"I came on as a seasonal employee towards the holiday season of 2013 while using my GI Bill to go back to school. Focus here was that school was my priority, not some minimum wage part time job. However, being a former soldier, I put my all into the job until my class schedule switched up right as hours were dying down in Feb/Mar timeframe. What happened next was ridiculous, with my department manager calling me in for shifts, 6-10 hour shifts, with less than an hour notice of me needing to be there. Multiple times, I was called in the middle of class. Now, I cant speak for Macy's INC as a whole, but this experience left a noticeably bad taste in my mouth with regards to my location. "
bad,"Friendly culture"
bad,I started out as a clothes folder for the holiday rush and was hired on afterword as a sales associate. Once the holiday season was over i has started college and told the managers that i had a schedule i had to keep and could not work those times or days. Two weeks later i have on my work schedule the EXACT time and day i said i could not work because of school. when i went to the manager to say there was a mistake they said it was my problem and i had to find someone to fill my time. Then they kept pulling back the hours until i had a single six hours shift a week. i did learn how to work a register and talk with customers well.
bad,A typical day at work was putting clothes away and checking customers out. I learned how to work better with people and how to do things easier verses harder. My co-workers were nice and helped me out when I didn't know something.
bad,Learned a lot from working at Macy's. Busy and hectic work environment but it did prepare me immensely
bad,"A typical day at work changed at the blink of an eye. Everyday was different which was nice because it wasn't repetitive. I learned how to better manage my time and what it takes to take on a management role. My co-workers were friendly and fun to be around. The hardest part of my job was keeping all my associates happy at all times and trying to get multiple jobs done other than my own duties, due to Macy's job cuts. Also, the hours were too draining and the pay did not compensate for the hard efforts I was putting forth. I want to work for a company where I have a clear chance at a career."
bad,"Working here was a little annoying when it comes to cleanliness, and customers. Alot to do in one work day, and closing was NEVER FUN."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I would clock in at 7:00a.m., then proceed to unload trailors that are already sitting in the dock doors.  It's a team of 4, and we unload 6 trucks a day as a pair.  Furniture weighs anywhere from 40lbs. to almost 400lbs. and we unload this by using hand trucks, floats, and rails.  During my time of unloading I would run out of the things that I need to complete my task, but I am also held to a timing schedule on certain unloads.  It doesn't take long to finish a 53' trailer loaded with furniture and bedding, but it takes a long time for me to get the floats and rails that I need to complete my task.  Unload trucks by 2:00p.m., and thats the end of my day.  I've learned that even though management has it's place, but without proper planning to a work day employees have to use their thinking caps.  Me and my team finish our tasks before it is time to go home even while waiting for long periods.  Management is ok, but just not organized, don't use there best judgement, switch days on your schedule without u knowing, and other things.  The hardest part of the job is really the lifting, but now thats not even hard anymore because I've learned new ways of handling heavy items.  I enjoy working with the crew and management, we all do have our laughs and smiles throughout the day so it's not stressful work even when it's difficult to deal with certain situations."
bad,"I go in to work, and go to my assigned area and read my daily report afterwards I look around my area and decide what needs to be done and what's new. I put up merchandise and help customers through out my time there. My co-workers are great and we help one another through out the day. My managers are good, but they never last long. The hardest part is seeing my managers and co-workers get stressed out over the numbers they're counter or area is not producing. We have a lot of visits and audits. Everyone is up tight and stressed during this time which seems to be quite often. Other than that....everything is good."
bad,Co-workers out take your customer's and sales bc we are on hourly pay and commission. place simply sucks.
bad,"Management made it very uncomfortable to work for.  Although change is good and I can adapt to it, Macy's changed too often.  It was hard to keep up."
bad,didn't like working here at all. wouldn't train properly. it was so bad the manaeger left to work at a cvs
bad,I like interacting with so many different people and that everyday is a challenge.
bad,"People take advantage and take breaks for several hours. No punishment. No reprimanding. Not a very strong management or company to work for. Employers want you to be part of security and you do get ""macy money"" for successfully helping. Start you at minimum wage even though company is very much sucessful. =/"
bad,okay place to work some people are nice and others arent. some what flexible with schedule i dont like the credit points they give to you though.
bad,It was okay working with the company the people was nice and some of the workers were okay to work  with
bad,"On a typical day I usually greet and help customers, answer whatever questions they may have, ringing the sale, answering the phones and recovery."
bad,"•	Receive new shipments"
bad,"A typical day at Macys would involve help the customers with their purchases and making sure the floor is neat. While working there one can learn some valuable customer service skills that can carry into other jobs. These skills are extremely valuable in helping customers, specifically those who don't really know what they are looking for. Management is an issue here, a lot of the managers are unusually unavailable when the associates need them. A large amount of pressure is put on the sales associates from the top managment to make sure the store is completely in order one or two days before a corporate visit, which are usually scheduled weeks in advance. The compensation for the work is also very poor. A great thing that Macys does for its associates is that they have control over their schedules. Associates are able to swap or advertise shifts that conflict with their life outside of work. At the end of the day the best part is helping that one customer who really needs the help and making sure that they leave happy and satisfied."
bad,"During the time that I was there, we ha a hard working crew who took pride in their work ethic. It was contagious among us and kept us motivated to do our best and most efficient work. I liked that."
bad,"This job encompasses running not only your departments , but also running the entire store 50% of your time. You are the LP, Housekeeper, Admin and Sales Manager.  Stretched too thin to do your job properly."
bad,"Macys usually recieves 1 to 2 trucks a week. We unload the freight by hand and sort it by family of business. Once that process is completed we strip the plastic off and provide security tags to deter theft. Once again this is done by falily of business and price point."
bad,I enjoyed working for the company. The hours were cut back and it began to cost me more to get their and back in gas than I was making on my checks.
bad,"I couldn't get new experience in the area of technology, so,i couldn't enjoy too much this the job, it's boring..."
bad,"I used to work part time at Macy's while I was in high school and it wasn't that bad, I worked a good amount of hours and a lot of my friends worked their, so that made it enjoyable. "
bad,"As cosmetics counter manager for Elizabeth Arden, I enjoyed the opportunity to establish lasting relationships with my customers.  My customers were an older demographic and sharing their life experiences and helping them look and feel better through quality skin care and cosmetics brought joy to my day.    I also enjoyed the opportunity and challenge of bringing an established line to a younger  demographic through special events."
bad,"I enjoyed helping customers shop for their needs. I also didn't mind the challenge of opening new Macy's charge accounts, to me this was the fun part of the job. Once you open an account a manager comes around with a basket of goodies to choose from, Macy's money, and a store wide announcement of your account which was nice and made it fun, but at least they did this because the hourly minimum wage compensation is just not tolerable.  "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Assist customers with any help they require, put clothes back on sales floor from the fitting rooms, tidy up."
bad,Macys is a great place to meet people and as a after school or summer job retail and sales is not really a career.
bad,I needed full time work and they strted me off as part time and gave me full time hours but never got benefits. I got along with all my co-workers and made some really good friends.
bad,I loved working for Lancôme Cosmetics Company but I didn't particularly like the management at the Macy's I worked for.
bad,"customer service, cashier, sale goals, cleaning sales floor and dressing rooms, tagging damaged items."
bad,"They expect you to break your back for little compensation. The more I tried to do my work and mind my business, the more lectured I got.The employees were great. The managers hound their employees to go above and beyond just about every hour on the hour. The hardest part of the job was getting sent to multiple departments you had no experience in. The environment is great, the workload can be frustrating."
bad,Was very unorganized. They hired anybody to work no matter how unexperienced
bad,"If you are not friends with YOUR OWN manager no matter how good a worker you are, your job is not secure at all. The best part about working at Macy's is the employee website where you can pick up other shifts in other departments. When I worked there my coworkers were great, but most of the younger employees don't last very long there. Most of the people that worked there when I was there have quit or were fired."
bad,-Typical work day greet and assist customers
bad,"The management only care about theirselves. They show nothing but favortism so if you aren't a ""favorite"" you can do literally 1 thing they feel is inappropriate and you're out the door. While the ""favorites"" walk around all day and do absolutely nothing... There are no full time shifts i.e., 40 hrs/ week. There's never anywhere to park. The bathrooms are disgusting. The cafeteria food is ridiculously expensive and the food is not even worthy of being on a fast food chains dollar menu. There's only one door to enter call center so you may have to literally walk a mile to get to your desk. The potential for raise at the most is 33 cents per yr."
bad,"I worked for Macy's for nearly four years, the good parts of the job were great: awesome co-workers, not too much micro-managing in my department (Support), but most of the senior management are not to be trusted. Typically the store manager (GM) is decent, but those directly under him are so worried about getting themselves promoted, they will thrown anyone under the bus they can to keep their slate clean. I would say Macy's is a good place to work for a part-time gig, not a place you should put all your eggs in at. That's what I did and regret wasting four years there."
bad,Alot of people
bad,Sell As many shoes as you can
bad,I enjoy working with my coworkers. I have created friendships that will last a lifetime. Everyday I meet new people from different backgrounds. I have learned to have patients. There are days in which I don't want to be there but my coworkers make me want to come to work. At work it may be busy and at other times it can be very quiet.
bad,"long days on your feet all day, customers are dishornest and try to get away with everything. management are inmature , coworker are childish, complain about any and everything i feel like i am working with a bunch of children. the hardest part of my job is dealing with my co workers. the enjoyable part of my job is when i get to go home."
bad,"You can try and make your own shifts but most of the time the computer does what it wants. You can schedule three day weekends for yourself so thats a plus. Daily you are given a sales goal and sometimes there easy to meet. The pay is minimum wage unless you work in ladies shoes, in shoes you are 100% commision, sometimes you have good weeks and other times you just dont, you can NOT gaurantee sales and at only keeping 8-9% of those sales it can be pretty bad, not to mention there pushy at times and you also have to open new accounts every week and most people dont care to have a card or they already have one. The managers are good there not to bad . The only thing about macy's is EVERYBODY IS REPLACEABLE, thats one thing i have learned. There is no room to move up at all. I would recommend this job for holidays or as a second job only, a plus is weekly pay."
bad,Macy's doesn't value it's employees. It offers poor benefits that are unaffordable for average employees.
bad,It's a seniority based job so don't expect to be considered for much if you have just started.
bad,in the jr's department trying to organize a rack of clothes that had been mixed up with kids and mens clothing
bad,"Took the job with the promise of commission on everything I sold after a certain point. I have heard around 3-4 different stories on how commission is done, and they are just giving me the run around. i will NOT work for nothing when I run my head off doing my job and work very hard doing it. It isnt fair, and I will not stand for it."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Most days are 6pm-10pm, where I accomplish very little. On days when I get a full shift I can get a lot accomplished."
bad,"Kailua-Kona, HI location will pass up potential good workers with retail experience and hires people right out of high school with absolutely no customer service skills or experience. HR Manager treats it like it's their private kingdom and ignores policy & procedure, especially when subjectively disciplining employees who repeatedly break rules. majority female and until recently no men in the menswear section in the store. Since new GM came on, positive changes are being made, still alot of work to be done."
bad,"Great place to work if retired, lots of great people with great personalities. Flexible schedule's , could use a pay boost but overall rating i would say it will always be a place i would never forget. The management work together to make sure that each department has everything they need to get threw the day."
bad,"If the hours I worked were broken down by pay per hour, I would never have accepted a job for that hourly rate. Work/Life Balance as an Executive is NON EXISTENT. As a single mom of 3, I was discouraged from doing school/family events and encouraged to choose work over personal. I worked 15 hr days on a regular basis and this was expected. I was on call 24/7 as an HR Director. Communication is poor. I rarely was able to take lunch breaks. I was expected to take conference calls while driving to my outpost locations. The guidelines and rules only applied if it was in the best interest of the company. I saw too much unacceptable behavior from Upper Level Management and Executives and nothing was addressed even when the proper avenues for complaints were taken from associates. Morale in the company is horrible, from the sales associates to managers to District and Regional Level Directors."
bad,"macys isn’t for everyone, especially the faint hearted. if you’re fairly new you’re treated rather horribly. it’s the same if you’ve been w the company for awhile. you don’t really get much respect or praise if you do that good of a job. if you’re snobby and cold hearted you’d fit right in. i left right after i realized how no one has a sense of humanity in them."
bad,Definitely need training updates also could never find department manages when you need them  theft is very high  hardly any room to grow customer service wasn’t as great as I thought it would be
bad,"The department didn't like the fact that I had a developmentally disability. I pushed it aside and acted like it didnt bother me, this was about a paycheck to me, not about making friends, however, made it an uneasy time to work during my time tjere.I was constantly made fun of like I couldn't understand or here there vouces. It was humiliating."
bad,They would give to many tasks for one person. They often put people where they had know idea what they were doing and often were not efficient in their work abilities because of their experience or lack of . It worked for me at the time of my employment.
bad,"Great product,  amazing diversity from the customers that come in as well as the others one my find themselves next too. Every morning all employees who are opening the store are required to meet with the other team/co-workers to address any and all concern for the store one may have. At such meetings"
bad,"I love Macy’s loyal customer who  they are enjoyed Macy’s discount  in different events like friends and family, seasonal sail, Black Friday, Christmas and etc. Macy’s customers are amazing and encourage me to work hard and be happy. I appreciate flors mangers that most of them are very responsible and helpful for  employees and customers. Even Macy’s is a good place to serve customers , the employees minimum wages  is  less that makes them  disappointed and pushed them to fallow another job."
bad,"I loved my job in Jewelry Department as well as women I worked with. However, Macy's doesn't pay well at all and it's extremely difficult to live on what they pay you!"
bad,"They work you like a Slave, a lot of drama and petty employees. You’ll be promoted if your are well liked or if you have a friendship with your manager or bosses. There’s a lot favoritism. Long hours and no they don’t want to give you overtime. $19-20 an hour is not enough. This job is very tedious. A lot of pressure and stress. The positive part is you learn a lot."
bad,managers were unprofessional and very dramatic too much catty drama with them over stuff that isnt work related at all they alll just sit in the office
bad,"Macy's starts you off at 9 per hour which  literally is nothing. The only thing that is worth getting into is management if you are capable of talking to irate customers and sticky situations. Then you can earn some decent money"
bad,"Work was great until they gave us new management and new supervisor in my department (kids) , Most of the time they’re short of staff even managers. I remember a couple of times I or one of my colleagues had to close our department by ourselves with no help not even from management. This macys is very unprofessional and unorganized but they do give bonuses every 3rd quarter ONLY if you worked enough hours. if you’re part time get a second job you’re literally working 2-3 days a week which they will only give you 12 hours per week but you can pick shifts up whenever it’s available."
bad,Worked at Macy’s as security in the Seattle west lake location. Your role was basically to stand there with a red jacket and call loss prevention via radio of suspicious shoppers. In this position  your not allowed to make contact with shoplifters . They basically just run out the door with merchandise. I felt like a scarecrow. Moral was very low high turnover rate low wages pass on Macy’s.
bad,"Sales associate receives more pay raises and more money towards their work stations, while the dock crew has to handle old or broken tools that tends to cause injury on some basics."
bad,It was a fun job most of the time. Kept busy with daily projects. My VM was awesome. He was a working VM! Hours were cut and so we're positions otherwise I'd still be there! Now they only have 1 visual tech and 1 VM to do the work in both buildings! Macy's is going downhill fast! You must do what corporate dictates even if they contradict one another. Too many closings due to online shopping. Soon there won't be any shopping malls!! Get out of retail while you can!
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,The work culture at Macy's was very challenging since they have a lot of employees with different background and different type of culture.  Macy's is a retail company where the employee are not considered as employee instead as object of work.
bad,"I was working in asset protection for my time at macys. The hours were fine and the pay was decent but the management is terrible. We had a meeting talking all about what our plans were for our department for the upcoming year and how they were gonna have us working here for a long time and how we were doing a great job. TWO days later, I get a call pretty much saying, remember when you came into work tuesday? Yeah.. that was your last day. Have a good life. Just like that, me and two others were laid off with no warning whatsoever. If you are gonna work here, have a backup plan."
bad,"If you can stand being treated indignantly. Forced to beg for credit card applicants. Like long, boring meetings in a joyless atmosphere..this is it! A company that has removed the sales force from the floor. A company that has intentionally removed visual trimmers from the visual dept. A company that allows upper management to treat people with rude remarks at meetings. If you can regurgitate a report youre a shining star. I could not believe how one of the great iconic dept stores had slipped into this lower standard of running a business. Shame on the SA regional president!!"
bad,"Working at this company is good for building your career, but not for a long term. You can learn the basics and move on to another company to get the best bang for your buck."
bad,"Best part of the job is weekly pay, the worst was being overlooked by corporate. This company overlooks promoting within and hires interns usually and promote them which most of them use management titles to leave company."
bad,"Working a5t Macy's you will always be busy"
bad,"The individual managers in the different departments were wonderful, as were my coworkers. The big issue is the store manager does not care about their employees. As a student living four hours from the rest of my family its very difficult to make time to see them as it is. I would tell my manager a month in advance when I would be heading home, but then the store would go ahead and schedule me for days I specifically said I wouldn't be available for. Luckily my attendance points were high enough that I could miss those days. It is a very stress inducing environment where they push you to make people apply for credit cards even though it doesn't really benefit the customer. The Macy Card ""benefits"" aren't able to be used with the majority of the merchandise the customer wishes to purchase which result in arguments ensuing with the customer. Macy's is a terrible company to their employees and customers."
bad,"Working at Macy's is Something else as a sales associate you have a great deal of an responsibility on your hands.  Your responsible for cleaning the fitting rooms, rining up rude customers, deal with poor managers that don't know how to do their jobs so you have to do their jobs for them including yours, Rude co-workers that have been there for over 20+ years but think they know it all Macy's at Lenox Square is the worst Macy's to work for. If your not trying to work your way up in the company please don't settle for Macy's"
bad,Macy's was ok but the management were strict. They wouldn't let you rest for a few. If you sat on the bench just briefly you were in trouble. There were a few nice people  though.
bad,"You will work like a mule for 50 cents over minimum wage. Regular staff gets pick of the hours/schedule, then seasonal gets what is left over if any at all. You will get 8 hours on Thanksgiving Wednesday and Friday with 30 min. lunch and 15 min. break. Then you can't go home on time due to lines at registers. This is not OT because you did not work 40 hours. Then you will work night on Christmas eve, and the day after Christmas will be all returns, while the regular staff makes the sales."
bad,Its a job it has good things and bad just like any other job.  mangers change a lot  you get your schedule for the next week late in the week and that makes it hard to plan or schedule things.
bad,I think retail in general is a tough place to work. I dont believe macys pays enough for the work they want. It’s a decent place if youre only looking for part time job to get a little extra money. The hardest part is when theres so many things around the store that has to be done and not enough time to finish before closing. Another downside is when you have upset customers attacking you directly over the store policy you cant control or change.
bad,"Great company to work for but mamangement is a challenge. Some managers are professional and others are not. They also retaliate if they feel like they are coming for you. Professionalism is out the door when it comes to all forms of colleagues at Macy’s. There’s no dress code inforced, polices and proceedures are not up held, professionalism and discretion is a joke, senior management only can be found when thier money is being affected."
bad,My job was sales on the floor.  I was a part time employee.  Store closed in my area so I wasn't familiar with the Macy's franchise.  I would have enjoyed continuing working there.
bad,"Being busy all the time "
bad,Seasonal work.  High energy environment.  Enjoy working with the customers.  Personal satisfaction on a job well doneCo workers are mostly pleasant and helpful.
bad,"Macys was my first retail job so they helped me for other future retail jobs. They taught me how to use a register and discount items when I needed to, I learned the entire store within a week and that same week was working with the merchandising team in the morning, so I now have experienced skills in that area. They promoted me a couple of months into me working there to be the North Face specialist for the 2013 holiday season. though, the way the store was ran wasn't really the best the did prepare me on how to work in a fast and bust environment."
bad,"I like to stay positive so I will say this about Macys, the Fine Jewelry dept is fantastic. Great group of people and the management is top notch. Hard workers."
bad,Management is terrible. Can be a fun place to work depending on coworkers. flexible hours except during holiday. When your short staff management does not care.
bad,Very early mornings. Nice environment. Other staff memebers were very friendly as well as the management team. Great place to work. Defiantly would recommend to a friend.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I enjoy my job but I'm looking for more. I help all customers as best as I can if they need any help. I give them directions on where they need to go.
bad,"Schedule can be demanding if full time employee.  Overall management is friendly and professional, good employee rewards system, and can be a fun environment if you like sales."
bad,"It was my first job ever, I was greatful that I got hired on the spot. They trained me on customer service and satisfactory, how to sell a product, and how to have good communication skills. I got paid every week so that was a plus."
bad,"Working in Macy's can be a constant headache, but since I have responsibilities I worked without ever complaining. I was an excellent worker just didn't like working there. AT ALL"
bad,"I work during the overnight hours, and it is not glamorous. I do not mind intensive labor, but they do not pay well for the amount of work they expect to be done. The processing floors and stock areas are filthy. They are mice infested and almost all areas have exposed asbestos. The overall work area is dusty and opening a window or wearing a flimsy face mask would not help if you have breathing problems or if you're sick. The have claimed that all potholes in the floor, exposed wires and asbestos, and crumbling walls have been or will be fixed, but they say that every year and your  safety is always at risk."
bad,You receive non relevant training. They throw you on the floor and expect you to learn for yourself. Other employees were unreliable. They would constantly miss their shifts and I would have to makeup for it.
bad,Macy's is not he same company it was a year ago.Going through alot of organizational changes .The restructure of the company has caused many associates to question  their jobs and working in a stable company.
bad,Poor management style. Benefits are not that great. There is no work life balance. Most of the managers are from India and they have no idea of work life balance in America. Hygiene is an other issue. Pay is less comparatively other companies. Macy's as a whole is not doing good as a business..Layoff is frequent. I would not recommend anyone to work here unless you are desperate to get any job.
bad,"Manager is rarely there when I am working when the Manager is in it is a different story - angry, blame-laying, difficult to communicate with at best! "
bad,"I learned that although the company was good to work for the management was extremely judgmental and had 'targets' an actual list of employees that they set out to write up, suspend and terminate. Not looking at their sales, or their interactions with the customers, but because they did not like them.  I did not want to work with 'management' like that."
bad,you opened cash regisger every day and closed at night to make a lot of sales and drive up the sale with more products. you put the clothes away that were on the rolling racks all day long and cleaned the dressing rooms and then you also had to watch out for all 4 depts. kids and china and home and womens too. one person was left to do this a lot at night and two on the days then weekends it was 6.
bad,"My time at Macy's was, thankfully, brief. The environment was slow paced and demanding simultaneously. The pay did not compensate for this environment."
bad,"stressful, underpaid job. There is fun environment. But if you have commission on your job forget the fun and enjoy the competition. Poor management. They don't care about you."
bad,The sales managers are rarely ever around or willing to help. The store is constantly understaffed and the sales floor is often a disaster because there aren't enough employees to clean the store and put the clothing back on the floor from the fitting room.
bad,"reactive management "
bad,"I started off as a seasonal and ended up staying after the holidays. My advice to you, It's great for the holidays but long term, no. Once the busy season ends they string you along with barely enough hours to get by that you'd be better off with a different job."
bad,Interesting and fast paced. Mangers told what to do and then left you to it. Other employees were helpful towards new employees. There was always someone to show you what to do. The only down side was cash register is very complicated.
bad,"I made a lot of friends working at Macys but the managers took their personal problems out on the employees, and everything they asked you to do would contradict something they or someone else had asked you to do earlier. You also weren't treated like a human being, you were the customer's slave. You basically felt stripped of all your basic human rights and needs, and if a customer lied about you in a review you were still punished, no matter how obvious the lie. If a customer is unruly, rude, or just straight up yelling in your face, you have to stand there and take it, and if you don't and refuse to help them you get in a massive amount of trouble and the management will break you down and guilt trip you into thinking you were in the wrong."
bad,"Great mix of employees there was nothing hard about the job a typical day monitored trucks coming and leaving the yard , checked employee badges entering"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Always busy, sales, projects, volume of inbound and outbound keep you hopping. I learned how to deal with change on a continual basis, as large as the facility is change seems to happen daily. Management is unsure of themselves changing instructions/direction frequently. Macys has great core values but lacks at following them through. Hardest part is the sheer volume of business that come through the facility and constant change in processes and policies. Most enjoyable part is the associates, very diverse."
bad,"I worked here with the intent to get hired on as a seasonal position, this go round I was unable to get hired on so was the other staff that were hired with me. Gave us 1 week notice"
bad,"Everyday to start the shift, you would meet in front of the mangers office with other warehouse associates in your department. The hardest part about the job is when they rely on you to load multiple trucks with stock coming down at a fast pace then management would tell you to speed it up!"
bad,"until they had a different HR office management and department manager who literally put me on a schedule that i cannot commit for it. I never got a warning because i thought i can pick and choose my working hours since i had been doing it  for the past two years since they know that i have a full-time job (which they were ok with it). So basically, they just terminated my employment over the phone for the reason that i never met my hours for the last quarter etc..."
bad,"I was in the sales department.  I folded clothes, restock the floor, help customers, answer phones.  It was a job that I needed, not what I wanteded.  I wasn't happy about where I was going."
bad,"They do train you at the beginning, when you first start out, but after there isn't usually anyone there to ask for help if you don't know what to do. Directions are not the best when given."
bad,"Not a fun job being a 20 something year old working in petite's women's clothing. I got hired in working in the Junior's department but was switched on my second day there. I was thrown in the department by myself doing a closing, with no one to help me close or even teach me how to do a close. You only get register training, and only for about 2 hours. I had to call management for help, but they took forever to come help. I never really knew who my manager was either the whole time I was working. It was very unorganized. The ladies I was working with weren't very friendly to me, either. I'm assuming it was because I was young. There's a sales goal given to you at the beginning of every shift that you had to make. it was a ridiculous amount that was unrealistic for the given shift. It was very slow most days, so it was very hard to make your sales goal. Overall it wasn't an enjoyable job, which is why I was only there for a couple months."
bad,Personally Macy's was not the right career fit for me but it is a rapidity growing company that offers great benefits if this kind of retail work suits your expectations .
bad,"If you're not looking to make a lot of money or just need a part time job, Macy's is a good option. They offer employee discounts and work with your schedule."
bad,"Overall good place to work, pay could be more. I liked working with the customers and the staff. I couldn't save money working here by it being in the mall."
bad,Decent place to work. The management team is very nice and customers are pleasant. However There can be improvements made on job salary and benefits. The job demands a lot from me and I don't get enough compensation for it and this is important to me because I have a family of four to support. If compensation isn't important to you than maybe you would enjoy working at Macy's.
bad,"Everyone is super friendly and understanding, however the schedule always comes out Saturday, which will tell you that weeks schedule. Meaning if you work on Sunday you only get maybe 24 hours notice at most if you're working it."
bad,"Over work employees. Wasn't the best work environment for me. The pay wasn't enough and some of the managers were unprofessional."
bad,"only work when a truck is scheduled, less then 10 hrs a week, very relaxed atmosphere and most days when I do work, it is a productive day, just not enough hours to sustain a living"
bad,A typical day of work would be clocking in and working folding clothes operating cashier register.What I learned is how to deal with angry costumers and costumer service.Management was good but then again it depended on the manager.Most managers in the store I worked at where nice.The hardest part of the job where dealing with costumers and disrespect.And definitely the low pay.It pays a little above the minimum wage.So unless you are living with your relatives or married I cannot see how someone would afford to live on this type of pay.You could make your own schedule at the store I worked at so that would be good for someone who needs flexibility.
bad,"I started working here after I had graduated high school. got offered a position in the stocking department. It was tough for me because I didn't have anyone directing me on what to do. But instead I had people talking about me in a different language, and would not be polite. I felt a huge relief after I stopped working there."
bad,"I is what it is, seasonal work. it was years ago and the business model is failing. Mark up cheap chinese garment that take a few cent to make--sell them at an exorbitant price and pay as little as possible. Working there I could not afford to shop there."
bad,"Enthusiastic Customer Service Representative who follows policies and procedures, while offering a friendly customer environment."
bad,The company was great on developing you but lack the ability to balance out the workload. With the way the market is going everyone within the company has been given more responsibility/work with not enough time or compensation. Work/Life balance is not great you are always working.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"The work required to do for the pay given is highly unfair. You are required to cover additional departments including yours, as part time you barely get any hours. You feel like you worked a full week but your check says otherwise. This job was far from enjoyable."
bad,"Macy's is a good employer for those of with more than one job, or those who need a much more flexible work week.  With their scheduling system, it is very easy to arrange the work schedule that works best for your individual needs."
bad,"Working at Macy's was fun.  I loved being around people.  The other employees were happy and helpful.  The guests were for the most part lovely to service.  The hardest part is standing on your feet for so long.  Also, the hours at Christmas were mandatory and weren't the hours you signed up for.  The most enjoyable part was taking care of pleasant guests."
bad,"Work was fine. Go in, open registers, sell stuff, push macy's cards, push macy's cards, push macy's cards, push macy's cards. Let's be truly honest...working at Macy's is literally two things: tricking people to sign up for Macy's Credit Cards and meeting unattainable sales goals."
bad,"giving a outstanding costumer service is our number thing when i used to work for them. "
bad,"On a day to day basis I produced outstanding customer service; which was shown by making a connection with customers by asking questions and listening, giving options and advice. I was also able to acquired experience in remaining focused and motivated in a difficult or distracting situations on the work floor. It was always important to display a positive and encouraging attitude within conflict resolution with an upset customer."
bad,"A typical day as a sales associate in Macy's for my job was literally just picking up the clothes from the floor and putting them back on the hanger or folding them back up. I guess maybe because I didn't have much experience, so they wanted to start me from the bottom. I learned a lot about patience, because all they wanted me to do was put things back in order, when I just really wanted to be more productive and do something different. I remember a time they needed me in the men underwear department and i literally spent like 5 more hours past my time just putting the underwear back on to the shelves or putting them back into their bag. The most enjoyable would be Fridays, just because it was pay day."
bad,"A typical day/night at work is a good environment, nice merchandise, horrible direction by the managers. Some co workers are nice and humble but you have others that try to kill your vibe. the hardest part of the job is learning how to ignore the ignorant people who try to bring you down, the part i most enjoy about work is learning new things about our merchandise and networking with good people."
bad,Hours were not the best and most high end managers just seem to care about their bonuses and how they look. Advancement seems to take longer than expected. Underpay employees.
bad,"I love working with women to help them find the perfect moisturizer or makup.  It is rewarding to help women every day.  Love the conversations; meeting new people and just the satisfaction of ""assisting"" makes my day."
bad,macys is an OK place to work.... some if the coworker are annoying.... I hate that they mess with our hours one week you'll have hours next week you'll have like 25 the hours.... you have different hours every week... I'm try to find me another job macys wont cut it.. ohhhh and most of my coworkers are messy as blank ....they like to start drama.... no life.....
bad,Didn't really like this job. The best part was getting paid every week. The employees were not a big help in  the beginning but i caught on. I learned how to manage a cash register.
bad,"the best part about macys is they allow you to control your days on & off, everything is computerized allowing you to advertise a work shift you do not want or cannot be at allowing other associates to pick up your shift at no fault to yourself this was amazing as i had school, kids, and another part time job."
bad,"I do enjoy working with the people at Macy's.  Usually work 7 or 8 hours a week.  Doesn't pay well.  Not many people speak English,"
bad,"I had never worked retail before this job.  It was a shock to my feet.  Standing all day, was miserable.  The merchandise was exciting, though."
bad,You learn the basics first on table that way you know your way around the food. Then once your trained is when they have you doing all the fun stuff. Like smashing making fun party packs ect.
bad,"a typical day at work would be clocking in then seeing a manager and working with the rods all your shift. That includes the items that's on the rods you must hang it where it belongs then do the same thing for the shift, also the fitting rooms must be cleaned every hour, picking up clothes from off the floor. I learned that I have a lot of self control and patience because many of the customers were a handful. the hardest part of the job was pushing the rods all across the store to find where what belongs. I've had co-workers who were willing to work and help keep the store looking approachable, then I've had co-workers who didn't care, just came in and didn't care how the store looked and didn't lift a finger to help."
bad,"wasn’t a great job, not much advancement, didnt care much for workers"
bad,"I found retail work very boring. My co-workers were very nice."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Learned the comings and goings of a major department store and what it entails to get product on the floor. Loaded and unloaded trucks that came in on the dock where we proceeded to prepare merchandise to be put out on the floor. The people I work with was really fun and made working there enjoyable.
bad,"Managers break all the rules! I had a very bad experience while I was there, my manager got fired, a ton of funny business was going on there !"
bad,Overall great environment with great management just very poor pay rate one of the worst i have ever had it was some what offensive.
bad,"I work part time and work my rear end off when I am there. I meet and greet every customer. I give the best customer satisfaction within the company and I get paid peanuts for doing all this. Weekly scorecard doesn't mention how hard you work to get your ""points'. Management was wonderful for giving recognition, but for little pay we should be getting something. Macy's is not able to give references."
bad,"Never got to work there as much it was a seasonal job."
bad,"very underpaid, long hrs, the commission for sales are very one sided for the company and not realistic for the employee to achieve"
bad,As a sales member I believe that the job was under paid for the amount of work you had to do. This was due to the amount of running around you had to do to keep the stock room organized while still trying to balance numerous customers and the products they selected. i actually would build up a dripping sweat while trying to keep up with the goals they had set.
bad,"Not a bad place to work, but the pay will hardly sustain anyone that needs to support themselves."
bad,"Typical day at work was making my associates happy to be at work to accomplish tasks."
bad,"Every day is always something new going on. I come in every morning to like 10 rods and 9 cages total for the men's department. we believe team work makes the dream work. when I'm finish with my project, i always go help out my teammate. To me the management team is okay. you have some of the management who is willing to work with you and help you achieve your goal, while others just don't care as long as they getting their checks. its been many times I have ask for help to advance and they just give me the run around and don't want to do the documents that. the most enjoyable part of the job is that my team we make every day fun. we laugh and help one another out."
bad,"Very fast-paced. Always new inventory coming in, sales to set/take down, products to deliver to sales personnel, etc. "
bad,"Fun and easy job but i'm looking for more hours."
bad,it is a great job to learn how to adapt to different personalities and you'll learn how to have good communication skills. At times it might be a bit challenging dealing with so many personalities but everyday is a different experience. Some of the managers lack professionalism and have favoritism over their employees. Some co-workers can be disrespectful but nothing really gets done. Its a good job to gain experience.
bad,"It's really corny and they give you promotions that only include more responsibility not pay. They also set unrealistic goals for their sales associates to make, in order to short them on payday."
bad,"Not good for advancement, long days and fickle managers learned a lot about point of sale service"
bad,Macy's is still one of my favorite places to shop but not such a great place to work.  They have transferred most of their employees from full time to part time in order to avoid paying benefits.  I met people who worked there for years with no pay raise.
bad,"It's a big start-up like environment, at website development services department you will be working non-stop with change in process on a monthly/weekly basis. I changed several roles while we had a transition to agile process and currently processes more or less stable but still changing/evolving."
bad,"Over 6years experience in merchandise sale"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"The work needed to get completed, and everyone understood that. It would've gone much better if managers would've listened to the associates more."
bad,"Productive workplace with bad management. They play favoritisim, they don't know how to lead or how to keep their personal lives separate from the work space. I do not recommend working for this company."
bad,"Originally I applied for a regular position as a salesperson at this company, but somehow they thought I was applying for cosmetics.  Oh NO!  My application following the first interview was lost and no one knew the woman who interviewed me, but some time later they found my application and wanted to hire me for seasonal work.  I was told the job would continue until February, but by the end of December I found myself hanging with NO available hours to support myself.  Management was pretty good, friendly coworkers also, and I liked the company.  I ended up not doing sales work but instead keep racks of clothing neat and keep the clothes neatly folded.  They did do things for the associates like providing food, candy (lots!), and having fun things.  You had to wear black clothing.  One thing I did see also was how there was such competition between salespeople.  I could not believe it.   "
bad,"Macy's has a very diverse range of customers. Considering this, it is a great place to learn how to deal with the public and how to handle problems that may arise in sales. However, it is a good place to start and gain some work experience. I would recommend moving on eventually to another company."
bad,"A typical day at work , would be to come in assist customers, recover the area and restock the floor. In addition, try your best to avoid the drama and stay out of gossip.  Management here is my biggest issue.  They create personal relationships with associates and let them slack off while the real hard working people like me go unnoticed and aren't rewarded for their hard work.  I go out of my way for macys. And I have never gotten a simple thank you from any coworkers or managers or supervisors.  However the most enjoyable part of the job is to meet customers.  I love making them smile and laugh.  This is truly what make me happy. Making other ppl happy."
bad,No advancement with Macys and the company was too focused on opening macy's cards rather than sales
bad,the people that work here have a bad sense of work ethic they managers puck on the works and talk down to them
bad,"•Contacted customers via email, phone, & helped customers in-store"
bad,I would work there only for temporay position. Under paid for what they assign you to do.
bad,"Macy's is a sexist company, woman run. If your a man they expect you to work twice as hard as the woman, for the same title and same pay. They give all the guys either the warehouse, home furnishings or womans shoes departments. All of them require heavier lifting, while all the woman have apparel."
bad,It was pretty busy. I assisted a lot of customers. The management and staff were great . The hardest part of working at Macysl was the hours and customers.
bad,Loved my coworkers and staff. A lot of hard work during the holidays. But good side job if in need of a little extra money.
bad,Its was an experience I worked ther for 7 years and the job just ended without notice.
bad,"If i worked the morning shift I count the register,make sure the floor is ready for the day for customers.Greeted and assisted customers with whatever they needed,did recovery,cleaned the fitting rooms,folded clothes and made sure the floor was clean throughout my shift. I work varied shifts.When i first started i wasn't trained that well,training is very poor here,I learned how to do most things on my own,if i wasn't sure about something or didn't know how to do something,i would ask my manager or my co-workers and they would always help me.Some of the management could work on their communication skills and how to talk to employees better.My manager is nice and she helps me and gives me tips on how to sell and connect with customers.Sometimes my manager can be rude and unprofessional with me in front of customers sometimes,she also talks down on me like i'am a child.My co-workers are awesome they've been the main reason why I love to come to work even if i don't want to sometimes.Most of them are friendly,helpful and they make the day go by faster.I've met alot of people from different races and cultures.The hardest part of the job was when it got busy and i had a line,some customers would get very impatient that they start to get very rude. Also sometimes some customers would argue with you the whole time causing a scene.I guess with every job it has its pluses and minuses and macy's isn't any different.This has been a learning experience for me so far,I'am still learning new things everyday as i go.There are probably alot of other things i didn't mention but this is how i"
bad,"Working at Macy's is o.k. once you know your job--before that it is very stressful. The training is not too good, there is a lot to learn and you cannot make mistakes. When the store is busy it's great, there are lot's of things to do. After the holiday season store is very slow, and very boring. The office should be run in a more professional manner on so many levels. Computers and other equipment are very outdated. Retail pay is dispicable, but at least it's a job, you get a discount and seems what you do get paid goes right on back to the store!"
bad,"I liked the fast pace atmosphere Macy's gave, however it was only a seasonal job. I enjoyed helping customers find what they needed."
bad,Loved the people I worked with. Management had no communication.
bad,"The values are great but they dont really see them through. They should take more action with the sales managers. They all should be in the same track. Also, they should recognize when a sales manager any other employee is ruining the environment and making it hostile."
bad,"Simple Job ,but cooperation in the environment between fellow employers. The early morning time provides me with a easy schedule to work with for school."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Set up displays for customer's to see. customer service and sales. I learned alot about merchandize I normally took for granted. My co workers where friendly.
bad,I am currently a Sales Associate at Macy's. The job is very challenging it is never the same on any given day. It can sometimes be difficult but it is also very rewarding when you provide excellent service and the customer is happy!
bad,"While Macys is a fun culture there are two flaws. One is that you have to earn your draw, meaning you have so sell about $1,ooo per day to earn your payment for the shift. If you do not you go into deficite with the company. So that when you do sell well and can make commission you first pay them back for paying you your salary. Secondly to get up the food chain you have to sell the credit card and any other things they have going, purchasing coupons to benefit various charities. You get scored on this."
bad,first job ever :) i learned a lot
bad,It's way too many managers telling you what to do. You never have a set work day. They may tell you to work from 6am to 6pm but when you arrive to work thats not the case at all. They're always laying people off and calling them back the next week or two weeks later. You never do the job you were hired to do. On spare of the moment you might be in a different department.
bad,"I was a floater; worked in all departments on the cash register, learned how to take inventory, worked with some good people in a fast paced environment. The job really was not hard but, frustrating because of the lack of hours and pay. The most thing that I enjoyed about this job was being able to assist the customers."
bad,I unfortunately wasn't making enough to support myself although I liked the environment of macys.
bad,My work here started in holiday season and I was extended to work part time. I spend hour upon hour folding clothes and running go backs.
bad,Leads and managers of departments not well trained and not incentivised to work with employees. Would absolutely not recommend working long-term at this company.
bad,"The work was not hard, but you are paid off commission, co-workers can take clients from you and earn the commission. The job is not hard but you need good sales skills to be successful here."
bad,This company is GREAT for college student and single parent. You can pick times to fit your schedule and overtime (extra $$$). prefect for Christmas seasonal
bad,"Coworkers at Macy's are amazing!  Some Managers are also very kind and supportive. Unfortunately there are others who are not..."
bad,Need I say more? The combination of the two jobs left AP and/or Shipping/Receiving getting a boss who was completely incompetent or couldnt care less about the extra job they now had.
bad,"Flex Worker."
bad,It's hard to access retail companies because of the business changing ever so often the mission and goals of one store may not be the goals and mission of another.
bad,"When I worked at Macy’s my immediate manager was very kind, and that made the job tolerable. However, Macy’s overall has a stifling corporate culture that discourages employees from making suggestions and I often felt like we were forced to do things in the most inefficient, illogical, difficult, and least customer friendly way. This is exaggerated further by the outdated technology- they really don’t know what they have in stock. They will never know."
bad,"I started with Macys excited to work for them, then once I started, as a manager I needed to build my team up because they were so dejected from working there. I got my team to perform at a high "
bad,"This is not a good company or there management. They hire Spanish managers who hire there people's as Spanish. They fire another people's and hire there kind of people's. "
bad,When working there I was completely new in using the cashier system and I was told I would go through training and I never did the only way I knew how to do my job was because of so many coworkers at a time to actually train me management never did anything and I feel like It shouldn’t be called management
bad,"The interview process was good. I got a job offer right after the interview. I liked the job, also, but they couldn’t really give me available hours to work. Also, my employers didn’t always contact me when they said they would.Other than that, my coworkers and manager were nice and helpful."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"If you're a person that likes to work 24/7 and read work emails even on vacation, go for it!  Unrealistic expectations without enough resources to support."
bad,"It's been 29 yrs. since I worked there so I'm not sure what it's like now. When I worked in the fine jewelry department, it was very cut throat. Hated the one day sales. They would pull you into an area where you had no idea what was what. Basically, throwing you to the wolves."
bad,"Non Respectable Customers"
bad,"The retail life is a difficult one - and Macy's is no exception. The sales manager role was challenging and rewarding. While hard work paid off greatly, the hours and amount of time spent in the store made the work/life balance non-existent. You work when the customers want to shop, and that is pretty much all the time. The job itself taught me much about business, time management, hard work, and managing/coaching people, but the hours eventually became not worth it."
bad,"Never received employee discount no one would assist in fixing this issue , manager would not work with school hours which would make me sacrifice points instead of editing availability"
bad,I work there part time because i don't plan on moving up with the company.  so i dont have much to say.  Almost Everyone I work around are very unprofessional.
bad,"The environment is laid back at times but on days like one day sale or holidays, even weekends it requires work. I recommend working here if you are a beginner in the work industry."
bad,It was a good job and was excited to work there at first but now they keep taking me off the schedule due to low volume of work. Haven’t been paid for my work hours for over two weeks now.
bad,I enjoyed it but i couldnt stand on my feet for long. The hours were long and seem to go on forever since it was slow alot other then that it was fun.
bad,"Overall the team managers are really supportive and make the work experience fun. However the company as a whole is very unrealistic when giving the stores support teams hours to complete the workload projects. They do not  give the store enough hours to schedule people to complete the weeky task. And each week hours are different so you may work 30 hours one week then only get 18 hours the next. People have bills, mortgage, rent, car payment, medical insurance. When hours are so inconsistent  we can’t afford to meet those expenses. It would be nice if they could understand what we do in the store and give the support staff the appropriate hours to successfully complete all of our weekly tasks."
bad,enjoyed the customers and upper management. Would most definitely work there again if the opportunity is presented. i enjoy helping the customers to find their products.
bad,Macy’s is a awesome job to work it you get to meet see and help different people from all around the world it’s very interesting. I loved Macy’s if it was full time I would still be there .
bad,"In my opinion the job is only good around peak time when the company is actually giving out hours. The checks around the cool down periods are not enough to live on. So if hired a second job would be a good idea. Management could be better, the managers talk like they care but only really care about the work getting done and not so much there employees that they are managing. The hardest part of the job is having to be okay with being harassed and watched every moment of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid and clocking out and going home."
bad,Listen to the associate..the people actually working with the customers...there's alit of things that could be changed..better job growth within the company for starters
bad,"The job itself is not particularly taxing by any means. Unfortunately, with retail trending to online sales, a job at Macy's right now is not reliable."
bad,Pay and benefits were good. The work culture was very immature and associates were treated like children. Was given very high daily credit card and sales goals and was shamed in front of all the employees at the morning rallies if goals were not met. Also a lot of catty tattle tail associates that tried to make themselves look better by criminalizing others. Management fed into this behavior instead of ignoring it or putting a stop to it. New associates treated poorly and harassed  by the ones that had been there10 + years.
bad,They would ask you to do the impossible to open up Macys credit cards with really no people in there because it got really slow and they still wanted you to do the same job so the end result was just about everyone on my team left and or got fired
bad,"I liked the department store because there were different area's in the store you could work at. You could choose your own hours, our breaks were giving daily. Taking off and being late were a plus for supervisors they stayed on top of every employee. Always got played on time and was played daily and fairly. Most about this job that I liked was the holiday season. The job would do things for the employees. Over all it was a good place to work at."
bad,"Most days were the same. I had to make sure the floors were clean, garbage can's was empty and that's about it. Worked alone didn't like that much. Job was easy nothing hard about it. Culture felt much like I was in school with adults, So many people working there you would never know everyone or really form any good work relationships. Which was good in a way cause you have many people to interact with but bad when you had to walk into a random stall and a lot of the times let them know you work there too. Management was good, You could just never find them."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,This company is a fair company to work for. They are flexible with hours for students. Associates are very friendly. Although I had a few issues making sales because of the competition with the commission. They also cut hours which is very unsettling if you have bills to pay.
bad,A typical work day would sometimes be ok. Not always good. I learned a lot from other co-workers not management. Work culture ok. No hard part about job
bad,"For the amount work you have to put in, the pay is not nearly enough. You are doing the work of a manager without the pay and theres a lot of pressure to open credit cards."
bad,Managers often forgot my name. You are trained electronically. Given daily sales goals to achieve and your goal is penalized each time a costumer did a return.
bad,"Overall I worked on the Flex team... Multiple Locations a week... Holiday Season, Great Time Of Year!!!!! It was A seasonal Position. I Like Macys, but working their was not what I expected. this was the Somerset Location. The pay was Not good, for all the hard work and dedication around that time of year. (Holiday Season)"
bad,Macy's was my seasonal job during the holidays. The employees were terrible besides a few and did not care if you understood what you were doing.  I had on guy shove me off a register so he could make his quota. Never work here
bad,A typical day at work was busy. I gained a better understanding about retail. The workplace culture was like one big family. The hardest part of the job was the lack of support from upper management. The most enjoyable part were my coworkers.
bad,"Since it's in a suburban area I didn't really expect to be crowed  on normal days, but during the holidays it was very slow there wasn't too many people in store, the management wasn't that great, they had me doing a different job entirely required for somebody else, and a lot of the original staff had become seasonal managers."
bad,I worked for Macy's twice during the Holiday. There seemed to be a change in upper management. Last time I was employed there was over 10 years ago. There was nothing that stood out during the experience. I really don't think I can review this job properly.
bad,This job was one of my first jobs and one of my least favorites as well. I believe in my opinion that this company expects too much work for not the right amount of pay.
bad,Felt like a robot working there. Not to many people talk to eachother. Mostly everybody is there just to do there job and leave lile the rest of us. Its an ok environment
bad,"Clock in log into phone received trouble calls from reps "
bad,Very easy job but low pay. Store discount is a perk. Sometimes the down time is too slow and can get boring. Don't receive much respect from customers as a worker there.
bad,"The associates at Clackamas Town Centre are notorious for the employees disrespecting one another and bringing their personal lives into work. When I arrived at Macy's I was immediately placed in the department with the most issues, and other employees were quick to pull me into it and pick sides. It was a lot like high school."
bad,The hardest part of the job is asking customers to sign up for the Macy's credit card and getting turned down more often than not. Every week there was a credit card quota to meet.
bad,moderate paced pretty easy work. don't go above and beyond it wont get you anywhere here even if you have responsibility outside of what your hired for like being a trainer or being a safety rep. yet still manage to hit your numbers and then some. at the end of the year you will get paid the same and get the same raise as someone who did the bare minimum.
bad,"Working with coworkers is great, is a fun environment. Management has gotten better. Macys is for the company and not their employees. Not enough man power for stock. The job is not secured they hire and let go within just a couple of years. Customer service is hard to maintain with very little coverage on the floor."
bad,Leadership assume employees are ignorant. Harassment in every degree. bullying is presents and uncomfortable. But I have grown from working in a factory environment.
bad,"Great company to work for if you want a great name under your belt but other than that I really didn't enjoy this company. It was always a lack of communication between management, employees and other merchandisers from other locations. As far as part time- the schedule was consistently inconsistent. I applied for an full-time position and was told in the interview it will be changed to part-time. Once I received my set days, which was 3 days out of the week, it would abruptly change to 2 at times. Group meetings weren't always weekly like how it should have been. But other than that it was a step up from being sales."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,you would think a top retailer could boast top pay but they pay less than the norm for the area in this category.  No possibilty for advancement. All managers and executives will tell you the same thing. no place to move up or grow. they hire from outside and experience and seniority mean nothing
bad,a very different kind of work environment but sometimes gets too hectic. It also depends on the manager regarding the type of work you were hired to do compared to the actual work that is being taken from you.
bad,I would have preferred being part time but the full time position was all that was available. I just needed something to get me started in the work force as well as something where I could gain skills through working with the public. It got crazy at times being in the shoe department. There were a lot of insane customers and crowds to deal with but hey that's retail. I wasn't a fan of my coworkers but some of them were decent to work with. Overall it was an okay experience for my first retail job.
bad,"Macy's is a stressful place to work. Customers can be rude, they leave the place messy then blame you when you don't give them what they want. They start to complain and always want to see a manager. The associates are friendly and only one manager there does what she is suposed to do. The most enjoyable part of the day is when I go on break or when I clock out."
bad,"A typical day in Macy,s would be to punch in on the kosk and get your daily sale goal hit the lady shoe floor and sale and exceed your goal 160% or better everyday."
bad,"Retail hours, work days nights weekends work all holidays you only get a discount with a Macys card once your a maxed out no more discount"
bad,Somewhat hard to move up. Way too many steps to move forward or to reach an interview.  The hours are not too bad for me but seem long for other co workers
bad,"The company seems to be trying to redirect its future path and I wish to be affiliated with a more set and secure company.  There is no longer proper time to tend to each customers' needs as we must also take care of BOPS (buy online pick-up in store) and mailing fulfillment requests by customers.  There is no longer enough staff to even give us break times and new hires do not stay long enough to even be trained properly.  The merchandising staff is so overworked that we as sales associates have to place new merchandise on the sales floor, so there are new merchandise racks often standing on the floor unattended."
bad,"Steady career paths, but very little room for career change. Become a company favorite, and you will go far. Different divisions offer different experiences."
bad,"I worked in a large volume store so a day was never the same. As a Sales Manager you are responsible for a department or group of departments. The selling, account goals, coaching, cleanliness, and customer service score of said departments fall on you. The hardest part of the job is the expectation to keep your department clean. There was never enough time in the day to clean your department the way it should be.  Another challenge was the senior leadership in the building. They are almost ghost. You would be fortunate to see them physically on the floor for more then 30 minutes in a given day because they have "" a lot of office work to do"" very demoralizing to the managers morale as well as associates. Sometimes they come through and associates who have been with the company for up to 6 months do not know who they are. In addition when they run through the store on their high horses they generally are just telling us what needs to be clean. As we do not already know! Very discouraging! Plus side is the compensation level for the position is that of an Assistant Store Manager at other retailers. Just be prepared to be treated like a salaried recovery associate if you except a role with this company. Overall would not recommend."
bad,"Macy's is run like the military. You can't be a minute early or a minute late. Wages are low, breaks are short and scarce, and they ask for a lot."
bad,"most people didn't really care for each other hear just about getting paid. staff was okay , most managers cared about employees others didn't"
bad,enjoyed everyday at work with amazing co-workers and energetic managers. Company is no longer in business however would work with the owners anytime.
bad,"Not a bad place to work, just be ready to spend a lot of time waiting for people to get back to you. People tend to get in late and leave early without accomplishing what they need, thus delaying entire processes for no real reason. But the pay is good and people are nice."
bad,"Macys is a good place to learn the basics of the retail business. The Management and Associate staff are all respectful and professional.,"
bad,"working with my coworkers was the most enjoyable part of my day. Managers in Macy's lack communication, during the week days the job can be very slow paced but during the weekend it can be rushed."
bad,"An average day was usually behind the counter or fixing the merchandise to look presentable."
bad,"No day in retail is typical as we attempt to manager chaos, but structure, as best we can instill it, is required.  An average day was spent focused on the development of the team.  That could be training around merchandising and event execution or coaching the team to selling behaviors.  Managing the balance between the analytics and turning that into action was critical.  You could end up getting lost in analysis without using the results to spawn timely action.  "
bad,"Nice, family oriented work place, where everyone is enjoying there day and working together to make the day easier. The manager were very friendly and nice and my co-workers were fun and outgoing. The hardest part of the job is staying on top of all the orders that come in every 2 seconds and running around getting them. The most enjoyable was when we all came together for breaks and enjoyed our company."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Oversees a staff of 12 and higher depending on volume.  Utilize the WMS reports to locate merchandise that was put away incorrectly, and properly research unresolved aged upcs. Maintains a productive staff allowing department’s goals, and units per hour to be achieved. Works closely training new high bay operators, ensuring they are following, and understanding the proper safety regulations."
bad,"poor communication from managers"
bad,Did not enjoy working at Macy's that environment was not for me.
bad,"Macy's is great for people that go to school or have a second job because their scheduling system allows you to tweak it by way of giving up shifts, switching shifts, or upgrading the number of hours you want to work each week. I learned a lot about fashion and style. Most of management however treats the employees as if we are below them or as if we are uneducated. However, most of us are educated, we just have not found a better job yet. Macy's is seen by most employees as a temporary job until we find what we were really looking for as a career. Also, the pay is very low for the amount of work we put in, and there is little room or offers for advancement. My co-workers were the best! That's what made the job a blast. The hardest part of the job was constantly trying to open up credit cards for the store and the relentless hours of hard work trying to keep the fitting room and go-backs in tact. The most enjoyable part of the job were my fellow co-workers."
bad,"assisted customers at the register, assisted with inventory and closing the store at night. management was a team player and made sure the workers was ok. i enjoyed working with my co-workers"
bad,"Poor Management, Terribly ran. Papers were consistently misplaced for promotion opportunities. Didn't file workers compensation paperwork on time."
bad,Perfect position for someone who just graduated or if you need to gain customer service experience.
bad,Help customers find shoes they need. It was almost always busy with rude customers and co-workers. Retail isn't always great.
bad,"Macy's is a nice place to work if a flexible schedule is necessary and meeting new people is top priority, however associate compensation is very low for such a successful company."
bad,Learned a lot working a Macy's gained a lot of experience being in management.
bad,Everyday I came into work I knew I was going to get done with my work fast and easy because I always worked hard at what I do. I always assisted customers with smiles and let them know they had my full attention. My managers and co-wokers were helpful all the time and made me feel apart of the team. I learned how to work in a fast pace workplace while multitasking.
bad,"It was only a temp job, Its a decent job but lower tier of retail jobs"
bad,"I excel at sales and I was rewarded for my abilities. "
bad,"I was a holiday employee. This company needs to do more hands on training prior to placing new employees on the floor.  Because some full time employees need to meet quota it is a very cut-throat atmosphere among employees within a department. Management does not teach you, just fixes an error and is on their way.  However, they DO meet the needs of all employee needs especially with disabilities."
bad,its a fun ad productive place to work but the hours are not that good and they can be improved to be alot better.
bad,"As for the Support Team, the positions that are available are used to take care of current and predicted future needs of shipments that come in to replenish stock. The Sales Team has more of a concrete feeling with hours and productive hours. The only changes are when important sales are coming up and are active, where the Sales associates are stretched with customers or recovering items that customers leave hanging around departments that need to be put back. The workers inside become more involved with each other, as when problems arise, the team sympathizes with each other and talks within the group to relieve stress or tension. What is the most difficult is the hours that don't seem steady unless sales are going on and you become a reliable source to the Macy's company. As long as the co-workers communicate within the groups, the job is manageable and the understanding how things are properly done is better."
bad,"Fast-paced, and can get very political. Poor managment and need to development new employees more."
bad,the expectations are too high of the regualr employees. The environment isnt bad when the managers arent breathing down your neck. The employees are super nice and make you feel at home
bad,although i enjoyed the experience they do not supervise their employees very well. they did not care about my feedback on employees that worked hard and those who did not yet they promoted me to be a supervisor. it made no sense
bad,typical work day can last anywhere between 4- 8 hours
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Its a job. **SHRUG** Macys doesnt pay well what so ever. Pay raises were horrible, as low as a penny for some associates.They claim its performanced based but there full of it."
bad,they need to pay more and offer their employees more hours. otherwise I love working there..its just that you can not live off of what they pay you.
bad,"putting racks and racks of clothing back to its place, nicer customers. lots of standing and walking around"
bad,"Everday was the same routine. Come in unload the truck, tag merchandise, after closing take merchandise to correct department, Clock out."
bad,•
bad,"Depends in which department you are working in.My first day i was in Men's(hectic),second day: Woman's(unfriendly customers).Third day:Juniors(Easiest for me) Wished the human resource department had better and friendlier staff working for them.The majority were very uncoordinated and careless.I would be called in to work in my off days and reprimanded if i ever had an opinion or not available.The customer is ALWAYS right but not all was bad,certain older associates would help me with difficult customers."
bad,"As a sales associate, my tasks are to meet a daily sales goal, assist customers, provide product knowledge, and complete sale transactions. The managers of my store did not seem to be personable with their employees, but only demanding. For co-workers, they ranged in personalities. With the enforced sales goals, some are more hostile with approaching customers and obtaining sales making a team environment competitive and unfriendly. The sales goal aspect is the toughest part of the job. There is no controlling who comes into the store and what is purchased. The best part is meeting people and talking with them."
bad,The upper management doesn't care about anybody except for themselves.  Just started to fire people without warning. Work with great people including the managers.
bad,Trained on computers with no supervision  and would leave new workers to do duties by themselves which would cause many problems with how things ran in the store
bad,A typical day is spent cleaning up after customers and ringing up sales and returns.  Most of the managers are friendly and will help with any customer problems.
bad,"Understaffed rarely get a break "
bad,"Macy’s has lied since my time of hire much more than tell the truth about job duties, hours, overtime. They are outsourcing jobs overseas which is a huge complaint from American customers, and all they do is ask to be transferred to American workers. They are taking a bite out of their own hole"
bad,You are mostly just standing still and not doing any productive work at all. It hurts your feet for the long hours that you are there and the pay does not make up for it.
bad,"The workplace was so dangerous to be in. Boxes would be left on the floor. I tripped and hurt myself daily. One of my coworkers brought an air quality checker and there were unhealthy levels of asbestos and formaldehyde in the stockroom. It was fine on the floor with the customers, but I got horrible migraines when I worked and after leaving, my migraines went away. We also had cockroaches and rats."
bad,Not good place work always let go early after job completed finish regards of timely never know start time long term employee get more hours no team players every one forself
bad,I would not recommend this job. I personally did not enjoy my time working here not only because I was not given enough hours in the week but I learned I do not enjoy folding clothes all day and figuring out where misplaced items belonged in such a huge store.
bad,"I worked there years ago and I am not sure the same people are there, but there was a lot of shady people working there. Also, the pay was to great with the horrible customers you had to deal with."
bad,To gain an opportunity that allows me to combine my leadership and communication skills in a well rounded environment while enhancing my organizational skills .
bad,"So my first month was wonderful, most of the staff have been there several years. management is new however, most are related. from New York. I slowly realized who was who in this gang like atmosphere. so while working one night( employed only 5 weeks.) my register was close to parking lot exit. And this guy walks in like he`s waiting on me to open my register. And having grown up in west Baltimore he appeared Pennsylvania Ave .Crack head  type unkept. and not at all groomed. I asked him if he work there because I never seen him in the store. just then a coworker approached and signaled it was ok. as for me I was taken aback . come to find out He is the store manager partner. And he made it seem like I wanted him. Once the manager insecurity got the best of her my work week went from 4 to 5 days, to 1 to 2 days a month."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"As a flex employee work hours were determined by what I wanted which was nice but most of the time the available shifts were full time hours (7/8 hour shifts), which needing part time hours for school, this was very hard to work with. The worst thing was not having a real supervisor or manager. I floated from different departments and never knew who was manager unless I asked and even then half of the time those who I were working with didn't know. It was just hard when needing to know who to go to for help or questions or even if a costumer wanted someone higher up. Training felt like being thrown to the wolves, some online stuff then one shift for an hour or two working under someone. Then just on my own after that. Working with full time employees was hard too because they kinda just wanted me to do the cleaning while they took all the sales. Which I understand but still it's annoying to be doing all the intense work."
bad,Wake up every day hating going into this place. Management is a joke and the pay is horrible. Anytime you need help they respond like it’s a problem for them personally to come help you. If you work part time or seasonal maybe it’s okay but do not work here full time if you can work anywhere else.
bad,"Working at Macy's requires a lot of work. In order to succeed at Macy's, you must be able to multitask. Overall, it was a good learning working experience."
bad,"its an okay environment, some people are friendly. Tireding because you are always on your feet. they pay decently but hardly give hours. Would recommend queens center mall to work"
bad,"Need more structure when it comes to training new hires especially someone coming from the outside. More clarifications on policies, and more communication from the people leaders."
bad,If i wasn't fired my manager would have found something to fire me for.  I feel like my manager didn't want me to succeed in my field and was always hindering my chances at promotions.  Every time something went wrong with making a stop that i was involved in I was getting second guessed and reprimanded for even when it was by the books.  Over all I loved the job but the Department manager made my job harder than it needed to be.  I feel like i was targeted after every stop i made by my manager because they didnt like how it was handled.
bad,"Considering the higher-end merchandise and the hard work involved, Macy's expects much but pays little. They put high pressure on you to enroll customers in the credit card more than anything, but little reward for accomplishing it. The store manager would come down to harass you on your credit performance every day."
bad,"working at macys was okay, i didnt really get to stay that long because of it closing down a couple months after i got hired on< but the time i was there it was solid work"
bad,"*A typical day at work was selling men's suits and shoes"
bad,"No drug test(unless your a forklift driver), you don’t have to have any sort of education, you can do nothing all day and still get paid it’s slackers paradise, and management yells because they don’t understand how anything works and pay is great."
bad,"Not a lot of support from management. Good discounts. Scheduling for shifts were sometimes inconsistent. Fellow employees are out for themselves, especially in Cosmetics and Fragrances. If you love retail, and have a thick skin, this could be the place for you. The computers/systems are very old. The Macy's in La Cumbre, is great to shop in...but sometimes as a worker, it can be slow. Customer Service is king. If you don't understand customers, you won't be successful."
bad,"I met other associates that I look forward to seeing daily, i enjoyed the discounts i received when purchasing items for myself at the store. The pay was not very good"
bad,"Head store managers did not support sales managers in their decisions that were best for the company just to please customers. Then, let go of great staff who had been with the company 10+ years just to pay the new incomers less money to manage more departments."
bad,job was ok overworked majority of the time understaffed badly. only good thing was the hour lunch breaks if you worked a 8 hour shift. Wasnt horrible but didnt have the advantage of becoming full time or oart time after the season which was confusing being as though we were understaffed so bad
bad,I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless they were desperate for employment. I really did enjoy the discount & the commission. The hours and pay were bad!
bad,"Each day is different form the other. Management is non-supportive; work schedules are assigned/altered with preference to ""pet"" employees. Culture is every person for themselves"
bad,"This job was interesting. It was my first on paper W-2 receiving job, so I couldn't really explain how well it ran. I got laid off for approved time off but didn't get that approval in writing. Very unsympathetic to my side of the story."
bad,"Working for Macy's was a terrible experience. Low paying job, poor management, and I felt that I was being taken advantage of for the entire time.  The store is always messy and there is not enough staff to help. The store management continues to fire employees and their tasks become a burden on whoever is left."
bad,"I was hired as a full time employee. But I turned down the job. It was a lot of responsabilities for the pay. (9.45 ph)What a joke! I was going to be in every department, fulfillment, customer care, replenishment, credit cards, reward cards, everything from A to Z for that rate... I tried to negotiate but the manager told me that because of my experience they were already giving more money. I was in shock. We are in 2019 and they still paying low rates. Do not kniw how can people work in places like that. Living in poverty while the managers and CEO makes thousands and millions of dollars...To get employee's discount is another joke. A real issue. Definitely not a good place to work. Unless you do not care about the money you will make."
bad,"I worked at Macy's when I began college, and I was not even getting paid enough to pay for my train passes each month. I did not receive enough hours, and I was getting paid minimum wage, which was about 7.25 during that time. Stress levels can be very high, especially during holiday times and on weekends, and the amount of pay was never nearly enough to cover any expenses or make it seem worth it to work there. There was a huge division between new hired people, and people with seniority."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"The caption says it all. Pay you minimum wage to do as much work as five people. Poor management. Incentive to sell is non-existent. The commission is a scam. They make it seem like you will be making base plus commission, when in reality the commission is a draw AFTER they take out your pay for the week."
bad,"i found the job was often to perform remedial tasks, and management was often too driven to be controlling with little consideration for actual benefit of store or employees"
bad,"Macys is a great place to shop but in my opinion a difficult place to work at. As a sales associate i attended customers to help find clothing of the desired size, kept the merchandise neatly hung and folded for display. Macys does not provide many hours and making commission was near impossible unless it was a holiday or you worked in a certain department."
bad,"Honestly I wouldn’t reccomend Macy’s. I feel like someone can find such a better job for a better pay. If you don’t understand cashier, don’t apply because once you are on it, you will be so confused because the managers don’t teach you. They expect you to know. The people who have been there usually are grouped up because the know each other and they seem to be talking about you. Their training is terrible because they put you on a. computer and teach you things that aren’t even necessary. They just put you out on the floor expecting you to know where everything is."
bad,"Very tedious retail store, high goals long hours and no pay compensation."
bad,"Great place to work at, flexible hours, get paid every week. PTO was given even though you are part-time. What I dislike are the people you work with sometimes. Micromanage you all the time. Love the customers will have bad ones from time to time. But the work environment was high school all over again. Too much gossip and favoritism."
bad,"I had the pleasure of being placed with a great team but great management may depend on the dept. you're placed in. Sometimes it was slow paced other times during sales or holidays, it was very faced paced and we were extremely busy. The pay was despicable. Weekends were required and attendance was monitored by a computer system that terminated you if you hit 0. And employees got a 25% discount. Overall I would recommend this job to a kid in high school but not to an adult who wants to be able to afford anything."
bad,there wasn't much training offered so you had to figure things out on your own most times. poor communication between departments didn't help the associates set up proper displays
bad,they are not flexible in scheduling so it makes it difficult to have any sort of life outside of work. Pay is not good. you only get discounts if you agree to apply for their credit card.
bad,It would a fast paced job after complete an objective there another job to do no matter if it big or small there always a job to do i learned that  hard work does in fact pay off and remaining positive does help you in the run
bad,"What you would expect from a big American Corporate company. Run mainly by statistic and numbers from the managers,  =widespread slave whip mentality."
bad,"a job for someone who is looking for part time "
bad,Worse place to work at. They say they work with your schedule and hours are flexible but it is not. Too much drama going on inside store. Managers are unprofessional and Macy’s allow it.
bad,"Retail during the holidays very busy, rude customers and very little pay.  You do get a discount toward merchandise as long as you have a Macy's card and it is taken off the bill."
bad,As long as you don’t have the managers there to babysit you it’s an ok place to work. Great place to. meet new customers as well as learn retail if it’s your first retail job
bad,It’s very disorganized and way to strict and barley see my own manager but had others telling what to do and I’ll get in trouble with my manager.the Hours was really poor and the attendance
bad,"I started as a seasonal employee and moved to full time once I was done with school. I don't know if it was the new store manager or what but the store went downhill real fast. I learned very quickly that the sales associates happiness and treating people fairly were not their concerns. They are just incredibly concerned with bottom line. If you didn't meet daily and weekly sales goals or get people to sign up for their credit card on a regular basis you were in danger of being shamed at the morning meeting in front of your coworkers or being called to the office to discuss your shortcomings. As soon as I found a new job, I took it."
bad,"Customer Service, answering phones, balancing vault for cash office, setting up cashier drawers and cash envelopes, prepared end of the day deposit..."
bad,"I worked 40hr a week but was not happy with the way they did late breaks constantly. They required working with as many as 4 customers, and on extremely busy days was overwhelming."
bad,"Macy's is a so so place to work.  Because of of the way they run their sales and promotion working there is somewhat like being in combat, periods of boredom intersperced with periods of chaos."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,Managers are not understanding or sympathetic with medical issues. Co-workers are great and always willing to help out. Pay is also good since you are able to receive commission.
bad,"Underpaid, over-worked for salary earned.  Management is totally bottom dollar focused and does not ask for employee input when it could be of use.  Lack of respect for most workers. The management team invites needless comparisons among associates and creates a culture of pettiness.  The hardest part of the job is the ever changing schedule and the total disruption of holidays.  Co-workers and some customers are the best parts of the job."
bad,They were really flexible with work hours. its really good for a student to work here as a part time position. I worked on salary plus commission and the payment structure was pretty sufficient during holiday hours.
bad,They are very strict with attendance. They don't care if your sick or if you have a sick child at home. They still take points away from your attendance. They also change your schedule without warning.
bad,"It's a fast-paced environment in which we try to make the best of the changing world of retail.  The job introduces you to a lot of different people and cultures, and teamwork is very important as well."
bad,"Last Store manager created a very negative workplace environment for the management team"
bad,"Known for herding large groups of employees on no notice and letting them go. Also, secretive meetings between co-workers with something against you and HR people can override your performance and manager's approval of your time."
bad,"Macy's is going through major restructuring, so a lot of positions are being cut or changed. Budget and hour cuts all around make working there stressful, leading to a constant shortage of supplies and/or employees. It does not seem wise to pick Macy's for a career, but if you just need a part-time job, they are willing to hire people with limited availability."
bad,"They expect a lot out of the sales associates but depending on your location, they try to at least make up for it with snacks in the breakroom. It's an okay job if you're in college but there are other retail jobs out there where you don't have to sell the credit card or meet quotas. These other retail jobs also have an employee discount you don't need a credit card application for and a more lenient dress code."
bad,Ok place to work. Not at all a growth culture environment unfortunately. They are looking for good soldiers who complete their tasks without any issues.
bad,"Just needed something to pay the bills. The hours drag on. Not much to do or think about. When there is something to do, something else usually comes up."
bad,"Sales of up-scale clothing for women.  I learned designers and their products.  It was very competitive since it was commission sales and that made it hard, but I loved the clothing"
bad,"A job is a job but can also be turned into a career when you find passion in such. Macy's helped build me into the person you see today. As such in any job it can have its downfalls but that is truly what makes any company."
bad,The store was never scheduled with enough staff to cover the store. Very high turn over of employees and the pay was minimum wage for sales associates who were expected to work their tails off. Many left to work other retail that paid the same and expected less.
bad,"You’ll grow to love the people you work with their, but you won’t be given any career advancements or job opportunities unless you’re seen as a favorite, whether you’re there for a day or a year."
bad,My day to day  job was see clients coloring nails haircuts pedicures maniCures inventory laundry cleaning taking money sales brow and lip wax stocking etc
bad,See above. Enjoyed the people I worked with but our location is a training center for those entering management positions. They had little to no knowledge on the store operations so a lot of time was training them of fixing their mistakes.
bad,"The tasks to be done are very simple however that made for a boring environment, rarely talking to people that were not customers and often working large areas by yourself."
bad,"My supervisor was great.  She cared about my personal life and allowed me to be flexible with my schedule when needed, due to me having children.  The pay was not enough for the responsibilities."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I can say that it was not what I had intended for working at Macy's. I do not want to bash the company but it was my least enjoyed job. I will not work there again.
bad,"Receive inbound and outbound trailers. Oversee a staffing of about 200 per night; mangers and employees. Respond to all emergency tones; fires, water leaks etc. Recruit new hires..  All and everything that consist of operations."
bad,"This was my first job, it was very hectic and stressful, not because it was the holiday season, but because there was lack of communication, and little to no training from the managers or supervisors."
bad,responsible for getting customers to open a credit card.stock the merchandise. Cleaning the store.Helping customers with finding what they are looking for..
bad,"I worked with macys part time. I haven't spend much time with store it was fun to work there , but I wouldn't consider it as career. for student macy's may be good start."
bad,"Macy's isn't a horrible place to work, but there isn't much room for growth. It's a good place to work as an ""in between"" job. If you can get a commissioned position, you're ok; just watch out for co-workers. When it comes to commission the ugly in people comes out."
bad,"Working at this store was an ordeal, except for the friends I've made there and the merchandise discounts.  Mandatory holidays and forget your weekends or church. One is paid barely over minimum wage and the pressure toward achieving sales goals has turned the culture cut-throat, pitting friend against friend.  This particular location has since closed its doors."
bad,"The company treated their employees poorly and did not accommodate to special requests. While putting in my two weeks, my HR manager was great i can say that."
bad,"Sairoop Technologies LLC was incorporated in early 2008. We specialize in salesforce implementation, customization and integration’s, B2B, B2C, web services and Marketing Automation.

bad,macys was my 2nd job for the holiday season. it was fun and busy but too competitive behind closed doors. it was difficult to stay focused on customer assistance and there were a lot of bickering and unnecessary drama.
bad,"Macy's brought me in for an interview, then sprang on me that they had no intention of giving me the job I had applied for, but wanted to consider me for a much lower paying position. When final paperwork was drawn up after the job offer, the pay was MUCH lower than had been promised in interview. Also, was promised part time hours, and ended up ""flex"" (some weeks we were given 0 hours, instead of the 15-20 we were supposed to have!)"
bad,I feel that Macy's expectations are a little to high and not focused properly on the consumer experience. I feel that they are more focused on numbers than representative or consumer needs.
bad,Macy's just needed for people to be able to finish the job that they had and let the workers know what they needed to do and let them have sales be good.
bad,I loved the job but didn't appreciate the little and unconsistent hours I got or the way I was talked to by managment. I also didn't like the random switch of jobs when short staffed.
bad,"•	Walk around the area for pickers down aisles "
bad,"Management isn't very good, disorganized, a lot of downtime and not a lot of hours for the position I was in. Low rate of pay and are overworked depending on the position you have."
bad,"Execute surveillance to detect along with apprehend shoplifters."
bad,The management was unorganized. Pay was not what it should be for the amount of work required. Worked every weekend with not a lot of PTO or vacation time.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,It was hard to balance school and work being here. I never felt like the store manager liked me and I couldn't manage to get enough personal time to focus on more important things like school
bad,"Most of the people there are lovely to work with.  Unfortunately, there is a great sense of disorganization making it difficult to execute tasks and be successful."
bad,The management was not good. Some customers were nice but others were not at all. The hours were not good. Co-workers were nice and fun. It is slow in the summer.
bad,"A typical retail job. some days are good, others are bad. Customers will get on your nerves and do/say the craziest things. Upper management will sometimes throw an employee under the bus just to pander to a customer even if its against the rules. AVOID workers on commission. They are the nastiest and most territorial."
bad,"As a flex-time worker, I took shifts when other called off or got called into work. Luckily I had the option of coming in only if I had the hours available."
bad,"I worked there for Christmas. I had a very good team and great management. The pay was alright, but I did get a discount which made working there great."
bad,"Okay fun long hours but a good job"
bad,"It was difficult to balance school, life and this job all at once. The schedule was very demanding, especially during the seasons and the hours were unfair."
bad,really enjoy working here maybe because I love clothes myself but got alone with everyone managers was very understanding crew got alone wonderful hardest part of this job was stocking
bad,"Macy's is an ok company to work for. Work life balance is non-existent. Hours are long and stressful. Pay is okay, but not near what I'm worth. Leadership is out of touch of what happens in store."
bad,"Management within the store was decent, but communication regarding important information was terrible. Many employees did not feel as though they mattered. The pay was low compared to other retailers."
bad,"It started out to be a great place to work, then they started expecting way too much out of one employee. This was typically the complaint of everyone I worked with. The hardest part was trying to balance out all of the job expectations in one day. The most enjoyable part is when I could go out on the floor and just straighten out the floor and the clothes racks."
bad,Not a fun place to work. No one shoppes at macys. There were very long borning days of standing around not doing a whole lot. The management made you feel less than yourself.
bad,"I like working there for the most part, I liked my schedule, but things that turned me against the business is that you have a slim chance of getting hired full time and that they are only busy during certain times of year."
bad,"Develop associates selling abilities to drive results. Work with customers to create better shopping experiences. Fast paced and constantly changing, need to be adaptable and creative to succeed"
bad,Management is terrible do not work here. This place is the most unorganized and  in efficient Place I've ever worked in my life. If they get better management the place would be tolerable.
bad,"I learned how to service people all around the world, it was a tourist attraction it was long the time extremely busy in the department, always something to do in the store lots of action."
bad,"The management treated us well, and cared about our well being. It was 50+ forklifts running at one time, with every driver trying to meet their quota for each hour."
bad,"A typical day at work: was hard"
bad,"Working at Macy's, I thought, would be the best. I felt closer to family cause they loved to shop there. Soon it turned into a nightmare. You couldn't take a bathroom break without having someone covering your department and that was near impossible. Breaks(lunch and 15) had to either be pushed back or cut short. The managers who were supposed to be walking the floor would be hanging out down in make up with the Benefit girls trying on make up and gossiping. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"The hardest part of the job, is not getting any recognition of doing good work.Your coworkers that have been working for the company, have left the company, to have a better business opportunity."
bad,Easy going simple meet new people. Unloading trucks is easy and simple. Can get very cold on dock in winter and hot in summer.
bad,"Expectations are high, but pay is low. Turnover is high. I love my co-workers because we all work together to get the job done. The work is hard. I enjoy our rallies that come with food. We have special days, such as; cubs day, hot chocolate days, two dollar lunches."
bad,The environment is not a good one. Its highly competetive and the managment team encourages it to the point where its a hostile work environment.
bad,"Part time position, only 16hrs per/week, a lot of management turnover, very dirty assignments while working with very old equipment, mostly worked alone."
bad,It was fun working at Macy's Wear House i got to learn something new every time it was very interesting to me. We get to work at different places during our days at Macy's Wear House.The hardest part is standing on you feet for more then 12 hours  every day it was hard but the pay was great we got paid weekly i learned how to stay busy and active more.
bad,"Delivered purchased items and managed customer service phone. Loaded and unloaded trucks used scanner and PDA’s tagged items with theft protection devices. Rearranged storeroom floor settings, prepared for the next shipment."
bad,"I was only seasonal help however it was a very good experience learning how to work within a large company. Responsibilities included opening/ closing, assisting customers and stocking displays."
bad,"Help customers, ring on the register, provide opinions about products, provide product knowledge, assist with recovery of the floor"
bad,"Management is horrible, along with customer service. I didn't have fun at all in this job and they never cared about the employees."
bad,Need to find a way to restructure their compensation benefits.  Sales team very competitive.  Often lost sles to other associates.  Managers not available for questions when needed.  Very little training time before working the sales floor.
bad,"I enjoy meeting people on a daily basis, and the friendship I've formed with co-workers and customers."
bad,the hardest part of my job was actually trying to make a sales goal before the day is over without feeling like I had to compete with others. I am really more a team player so this experience was not typically a good one.
bad,"Learned customer service skills "
bad,Co workers are very rude and unwilling to help. felt like everything i did was wrong. no one was willing to help me if i had an issue.
bad,"They pay is low, but was great as a first time job. Nice for people looking for some cash to get by. I really liked my coworkers."
bad,"Macy's was a good employer ,even  though the management didn't know what they was doing .The old employees never help out the new employees like they don't want the new employees to stay with the company long.But, overall its was great experience."
bad,"busy ,very faced paced, overall a good company to work for. pay was reasonable but its time for change. looking for a career that will require me to use what i went to school for."
bad,"The company has lots of areas for improvement. The systems and method of getting things done are very antiquated.  There is a lot of micro managing from very high level positions.  VPs get involved with how managers should arrange their offices, and other trivial details relating to associates level employees. There is a lack of respect and appreciation for mid-senior level managers. The environment is very unprofessional at times."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I worked at macys only 2 months for holiday seasonal. "
bad,"high expectation and low salary."
bad,i hated this place and all of the supervisors. they didnt care about any of the employees they just wanted to make money. macys is not a good place for anybody to work.
bad,Love working with customers and sharing Macy's products.  Worked with diversified people and met people with various backgrounds that shared their experience.
bad,"fast pace, never sitting down , some of the tenants are really mean. kids are constantly running everywhere . hard to kept the enivorment clean"
bad,Started out as a great place to work but have not been happy with the way management has not stepped up when they promise to help with things.
bad,A typical day at work is maintaining supplies stocked and neat or organized to be ready when working on a client. meeting clients expecations
bad,Did not see for future improvement for design and furniture and total customer satisfaction. looking at place of higher end furniture.
bad,"It was fun, because I met so many great people and was pleasure working with my coworkers.I wish I'm still working there."
bad,Its excellent very professional environment and they care for the employees i was surprise  of how they care for us they make sure that you know what you are doing and they will  trained you
bad,"It is a fun place to work. However, they dont give enough hours to make a decent pay check. I love working and meeting new people on a daily basis. I love helping people feel good about themselves and helping consumers save money. There is room for growth in this company, but it is hard because of the few hours that is given."
bad,The management does not care for the employees.  They expect too much but do not want to compensate for the work you do.  I have never worked with a less caring store manager than I did there.
bad,I learned how to be a better manager and how to organize my time better. How to open a store and how to go through a renovation.
bad,My early morning would consist of price changing the tags of items on the floor. Pull out of season items and restock them with the new items. It was more along the lines of work alone type of work. You would get your tasks when you come in and you have a certain time to have it done.
bad,"It is an okay establishment, it just never have any associates working on the important days needed. The best thing about it is picking your own schedule and receive a check every week."
bad,"I love most of my co workers but macys is not a great place to work,  they want you to work basically every weekend. It is basically the This is definitely not a good place to work when you are in school."
bad,We work very hard for the money they pay.  My manager is wonderful  very helpful.  The working conditions are quite dirty. No one seems to care to clean their stations. I can see now the money they pay and the work we do.....they should have people cleaning. The pay is very VERY LOW! They want us to take back racks and racks of clothes. At the same time helping customers. Cleaning dressings rooms. It's just too much for such little pay!
bad,"Wonderful coworkers. Challenging, but not impossible job. Poor communication from management to associates. I enjoyed the Cash office functions the most."
bad,job was wonderful people treated each other with respect and they are well organizednever had any problems with them too bad I had to move or I would have kept that job
bad,"Fast past environment....office politics, female drama of course can never be avoided. high volume calls... learned how to deal with VIP customers and assist management to understand the logistics of the company. Supervisor was the best and taught me so much and from my understanding she is no longer there. Macy's/Bloomingdales over charges for their furniture and even tries to sneak out used /returned merchandise back to their customers. They even send out refurbished furniture and bedding to save a buck so they don't have to pay the manufactures back. Merchandise is over priced and yet they barley pay their employees the minimum wage and don't offer full time positions so they can't get away from paying benefits."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,my job was to help customers with what they needed as well as talk them into buying things and go the extra mile to make sure the customer was pleased.
bad,Great employee discount. Constant scheduling issues coupled with very few and sporadic work hours make this company extremely difficult to work for. Company schedules shifts for 3 hours a day at rotating days and shift times. Most part time employees make $150 a week or less and poor scheduling by the company will usually schedule you to work at the times of your other job or school.
bad,I Enjoyed the customers and employees and i did not like that they were always calling me on my days off as i was part time when i worked at this job
bad,"fast-paced, exciting environment. Very competitive. Must be skilled in the area of expertise, goal orientated and with sales experience."
bad,"management was horrible, but employees were amazing people. I loved what I did, but getting in reprimanded for something that was not my fault killed my soul. I love helping people and I loved helping the store safe, but the store cannot be fully save when the people you work with behind the scenes don't care"
bad,I really enjoyed my time working at macy's I love my co-workers they made my day every morning going to work. My co-workers were nice sometimes not team players.
bad,It was a very nice place to work with different kinds of people who were motivated everyday to make sales meet at the end of the day
bad,"Loved most of my fellow employees, but management? Not so much."
bad,"Come into work and told about sales goals for that day. How many we need to open. Consistently pressure you everyday to open up a credit for a customer. Clean fitting rooms which are stacked with piles of clothing. Assist customers. "
bad,"This location doesn't require much energy or bubbly personality, more routine and slower paced than other locations. Management doesn't really take note to who you are unless you are constantly violating company policy. The best part is the employee discount."
bad,"I assigned sales and markdowns as well as organized and maintained multiple floors before store hours. On occasions, I worked during store hours and would assist and direct customers. The job was easy. The hard part was the sale's support team gradually got smaller as I worked there. Subsequently, my work load continuously increased."
bad,"Completely ignores your already established availability and it is very competitive to get hours. Managers were very helpful, however at times they get very unorganized especially in high traffic days."
bad,"Learned to sale more and connect with the customers."
bad,Macys was not very friendly and I was glad to leave. It seemed like if you didn't dress like the customers did or buy their expensive designer clothes and wear them as an employee then they didn't want you as an employee no matter how good your work ethic.
bad,"The real push by Macy's management is for their sales associates to sell the Macy's credit card. Customer service, friendliness, product knowledge, and job performance take a back seat to selling someone on the benefits of having a Macy's credit card, which for me was the hardest part of the job. The customer's were delightful, as were most of the co-workers."
bad,"My co-workers at Macy's were team oriented and fun to work with. As far as management goes, I feel that it is incredibly poor. Often you receive conflicting instructions from management."
bad,"A typical work day at Macy's would be very productive. There is a lot of running back and forth, constantly moving around and loud noises, There isn't anything hard about working at Macy's everything is easy to understand and the people are very nice. Although sometimes it may be a little stressful dealing with confused customers all you need is patience. Some of the management were awesome, did their job very well and some were just to stressed to be realize how rude they were. the best part about the job was getting paid weekly, getting yearly raises, getting more hours and the parties we use to have were awesome."
bad,The store at fashion valley had some nice customers but it was hard to handle during the holiday season just because there were so many people shopping.
bad,"Busy at times, especially during holidays and special sale days."
bad,Retail hours for retail pay holiday or off season. Managers are not easily approachable. Attempts to make environment fun fall flat. Benefits only if you are there for more than a year.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"There is lots of shopping so you're always busy. I have learned to be more vigilant and assertive in my approach to gain sales. You have different managers with different management styles, some micro-managers but the ones that understand you as a person and not a robot are SUPER!! You have some territorial coworkers who refuses you the space near merchandise which they know have a high value or the cash register so they will do everything in their power to keep you distracted from sales. The hardest part of the job is knowing that you're a paycheck away from being homeless. One of the most enjoyable part of the job is Happy Customers and knowing that I did everything in my power to assess the needs of the customer and provide that customer with top flight customer service!!"
bad,"Best part was helping people create comfortable homes. There were several videos from manufacturers about their product line, rather than in person reps. Mattresses were the exception. The mattress reps came once a month to make sure we had all the pertinent info."
bad,"I have enjoyed my time at Macy's, however I am seeking new employment that will better utilize my skills. The hardest part of the job is the inconsistent schedule, while the best part was being able to affect customers perceptions of themselves."
bad,Putting clothes back on the sales floor.  How to use handheld sales defining equipment.  My co-workers are nice.  The hardest part of this job is being on my feet the whole time.  The most rewarding part of this job is clearing out the racks of clothes by putting it all back on the sales floor.
bad,Providing customer service to customers while helpping them find a particular item and cash handling.
bad,I do not wish to review this company. It is an average retail job.
bad,Macy's was a fun fast pace job. I learned how to deal with all kinds of customers. I learned how to multitask. and I believe Ii have became really real at it.
bad,depending on what department I was working in I had different duties. My main responsibility would be customer and making sure that the customer was always satisfied and got the best deal.
bad,very fast paced good pay good employees and good management
bad,Very heavy loading and difficult sensoring thicker materials
bad,My job was to sale perfumes. Stock shelves and clean areas and do inventory weekly.
bad,I enjoyed interacting with customers by showing them all the choices of different products that only Macy's has to offer
bad,"im not into sales, its retail,not what im looking for as a full-time position. here until i can find something else."
bad,"It's a good job. Pay could be a little higher, considering all they expect from you."
bad,What I learn working with Macy's retail that is that customer service is always important to please customer when event they are in the wrong as well make the best of what you do at your job
bad,"I have learned so much at Macy's from all of my great leaders and managers. I have experienced setting, meeting and exceeding goals and helping my employees do the same. Working in retail can always have it's difficulties and this job is the perfect example. I enjoy doing makeup and helping customers find what they need and making their day better but i do think i should work a company that values me more and appreciates all the time and dedication i give in my job."
bad,Its not the job that billion dollar company promise the state of wv. Its just a way for them to get free tax breaks.
bad,it was ok place to work full of joy and fun. but had you standing a while
bad,This company is very discriminatory towards minorities. There is no respect level towards employees or or management it is basically anything goes to where rules change everyday.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,i really didnt like the company at all very rude people will never work for the company unless new managment
bad,"A typical day a Macy's, I would clock in and find a forklift before they were all taken. Get me a harness and strap up of course after waiting in a long line getting a what we called it ""gun"". The gun scanned the boxes that I picked out and gave me special tasks to handle. My co-workers were awesome. Great to talk to and super funny. The hardest part of the job was that we had a certain amount of time to get a certain amount of boxes. Some days it was harder than others depending on how many people were there that day."
bad,"unload tractor trailers"
bad,"Considering I was seasonal, I was the one who had to do the worst jobs. Climbing up huge racks in a stock room with NO LADDER , actually physically having to climb up monstrous rack like the ones that go to the ceiling in costco, no supervision  from anyone, whatsoever when i could have EASILY fallen; sitting in a dark closet during christmas time having to literally just sit there in the dark room until someone came and knocked on the door to get preorder things they payed for. No one cares about you, you simply get lost amongst the crowd. They also dont pay ANY attention to the schedule for holiday people."
bad,"it was pretty easy to work there if you have good customer service... no room for advancement during seasonal stuff pretty much unless you're a robot, and the best robot of that. basically if you work here expect to get paid minimum wage, and hopefully you're saving money by walking here."
bad,"In the beginning, Macy's was a enjoyable place to work. Customers were friendly and management was good. Toward the end of my career with Macy's, I noticed that there was no balance with the scheduling. No respect to family and religious life of associates."
bad,"some co workers were not very nice"
bad,"While this job provided for a great experience, it was hard work and long hours."
bad,it was OK. learned a lot from other workers. The most enjoyable part about the job was I would get rewarded for opening new accounts.
bad,"Macy's is the kind of job to have while looking for another. But working at Macy's I had fun and got along with everyone. Even the difficult custiomers. I will say this, if you didn't have patience before working at a store like this, then you will have it once you work there for a while."
bad,Decent cashier experience but low pay. Other employees were easy to work with and the management needed improvement.
bad,My experience working at Macy's was valuable. I had great co-workers and I enjoyed selling makeup and building relationships.
bad,one must always sale products. the hardest part of the job was to actually sell products because not many people purchase products like cosmetics
bad,nice work environment intense during the holidays but over was a nice company
bad,My time there was very short I was only seasonal. It was a pleasant experience nothing bad sticks out that is worth remembering.
bad,This job was a great experience to learn about the stores operation.
bad,I enjoyed working there for a paycheck and helping people but was not the kind of job i would see myself doing as a career.
bad,"It was a ok first job, but it got tedious and was tiring with all of the sales pressure."
bad,receiving invoices and shipping out orders. And sometimes working the sales floor giving superior customer service.
bad,I loved working at the cosmetics department since I am a makeup artist. I did not like the unhealthy competition between coworker. Some people at the counter were very aggressive and would sometimes take a sale when it was not theirs. The managment was not very effective since I only saw the floor manager a few times throughout my employment and all they did is walk around the department. Other than that it was an average sales position.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,being a cashier was cool you interact with guest more. but it was tedious picking up clothes from aisles that you just finishe cleaning. Security pop out on you if you bend down to tie your shoe! The nerve I am not a thief!
bad,dont get a job here you will hate it the managers are awful as well
bad,Enjoyed the Sales experience and interactions with different people
bad,Learn about customers and sales skills and merchandising skills.
bad,"First day, pretty much on your own. You're thrown on the floor with no prior training other than on the cash register. No management present to help or walk you through it. You only have the other workers on the floor and most are clueless. Once you start though, you get the hang of it. You might run into a few rude customers, but that's all jobs. Once you get the hang of it, it's not a bad job to have."
bad,"Macy's was a nice place to work, and it was always interesting to see what would happen during the holidays."
bad,"Management looks at you like a piece of trash. Nothing you say is important to them. The co-workers are just out to steal your customers. Commission is non-existent. You hardly make any and your paycheck is a joke. No benefits except the employee discount. Some good things I can say about it is some of the customers you come into contact with. Some of them are absolute sweethearts. Also, they do give out some great prizes in store raffles like gift cards, cash, merchandise, etc."
bad,"N/A "
bad,Easy going co-workers. Everyone appreciates each others position at Macy's. Management is extremely helpful. Macy's makes the customers feel at home.
bad,"Awesome Job, i really enjoyed working with all of the customers. Only flaws are miserable co workers, lack of team work, and low wages."
bad,worst job ever and bad company to work for didn't like it at all. pay was horrible you over work yourself you take on your manger job
bad,A typical day included what was expected in my job descripition as well as other reposibilities. I learned better communication and leadership skills. The management team were very hands-on and friendly. My co-workers were extremely pleasant and easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job was sometimes not having enough to do. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing smiles on customers faces and satisfying their needs.
bad,"• Maintain outstanding customer service, generate sales, merchandise product, and support the store management team."
bad,The staff and management team at Macy's Westland Mall location is incredibly unprofessional with a lack of respect for its employees especially on a temporary basis
bad,"Not my type of work, but i learned something new there like working with people so i took it as a learning experience"
bad,It is a great place to work if you have a spouse with good benefits and can afford to be off half the year.
bad,While working at Macy's I learned how to handle a high volume of customers at once. Macy's has also taught me have patience while working with multiple customers. The most enjoyable part of working in retail was assisting customers with their purchases.
bad,I loved working at macy's and it was a fun place to work as I was passionate about it even though it was a part time job. I plan on leaving this job and get something better as I am not happy in macy's anymore.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,I enjoyed their benefits and compensation but i was unhappy with how they trained me and how away from all my coworkers I was. They didn’t train me of the small things that mattered.
bad,"Macy's was a very demanding job. I did not mind the hours, but it was very hard on my body. My job at Macy's spilled over into my personal life a lot."
bad,"Was at Macy's job to make more money for school, but salary in Macy's is really small. But work at Macy's is really fun and the people i was working are nice."
bad,"Auto dialer of clients calling in to inquire about charges, tracking and promotional sales. Completing orders via an application called magic selling application. De-escalate irate customers before transferring to a supervisor."
bad,It’s a pretty cool place just have to do your job and keep it moving they try to help others out the best way they can and so whatever they can to help you
bad,"When I first started, we always seemed to have decent coverage. At least one employee manning every register counter, decent break coverage, etc. After the holidays a lot of employees moved on to other things, and management has not been hiring new employees. Now it isn't uncommon to see one associate having to tend large sections of the store with multiple counters by themselves, usually all day or at least most of the day. Instead of hiring more employees, departments of the store are being combined with others. Previously, for example, there would be one associate tending children's, and one in home store. Now, these departments are combined so there will only ever be one person at any time to tend both."
bad,Really hard to move up in the company. But you will get your hours. Its a typical 9-5 job. Management is there to help but its hard to find one when you need them
bad,"Terrible place to work, the fact is that the ceo was corrupt and I could not complete my mission as I wanted to because the ceo was very corrupt. No charges were filed but the owner should have went to prison."
bad,The hours are good but the people that work there can be a little crazy. This is a place for single and young people. I must say that there is a lot of walking that you have to do.
bad,"Organizar el departamento, verificar que la mercancía este en el área correcta, verificar que su precio este debidamente identificado, ayudar a clientes a localizar mercancía."
bad,"Well I like how they have high expectation for their staff, but I wouldn't recommend this for a first time job  highly recommend that you have experience before applying to this kind of job"
bad,It's a fun place to work. You learn about the different brands of clothes. You understand the true meaning of customer service. Ultimately the job is enjoyable when the people that surrounds you are friendly.
bad,Working at Macys returns was bit of a challenge but it was always fun to assist customers with stylish clothes for many different occasions.
bad,Gained sales and customer service experience friendly co workers great management. Great place for students to work. I worked on the flex team didn't offer many hours so I recommend this as a secondary or simply for a small income for students.
bad,"I enjoyed working for this company located in Fairview Heights, IL. The majority management and office workers could have been much better. If you are working as the cashier never leave your register open for if seen by a manager you will be written up as theft even if the store isn't open and you are told to open your register so the HR can come to your station and put in your daily register amount, just open it when they come to your station. But it's much better now since they fired all their mnangement and did a full hire."
bad,"I find Macy's okay. It offers decent benefits to us employees, but management leaves a lot to be desired. People call off constantly with little to no discipline applied to them and can make the job stressful."
bad,"Recommends"
bad,"Open and close registers "
bad,I cant beleive that my job was totally contingent on how many credit accounts I opened. Really opening credit is all they care about
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"I have been working at  Macy's in Roosevelt field mall for almost three years . Working there has been a good experience for me so far.The week day are mostly slow, but the week end are extremely  busy. I learned a lot by working there those past years. I met different type of people and  deal with many personalities. The customers are half rude and half nice so  I've learned how to be patient with them. The managers there are very nice and and are  always interested of what and how we are doing. My coworkers are awesome. We do compete alot but we always know how and when to stay out of each others way business wise. The hardest part of the job is the cleaning. The most enjoyable part of the job is selling."
bad,i loved my co workers but the management and hr were incredibly unprofessional. Never helped us out with issues basically told us to deal with it ourselves. And never ever promoted or recognized the people who wee ding a great job.
bad,"A typical day consists of unlocking and opening multiple safes, removing jewelry and displaying it properly in the showcases."
bad,"a typical day at work, first thing in the morning is to verify that I have everything ready for customers; like registers open, bags, clean counter, inventored merchandise, and log information In a book, etc. call customers to inform about their merchandise status, receive phone calls, direct calls to other departments. I learned supervising and management skills. my co-workers where awesome after all we worked together for more than 10 years, so we were like family. the hardest part of the job was not having my superiors doing their jobs, complicating mine. the most enjoyable part of my job was working with other people, I used to love to go to work."
bad,the hardest part of the job was lifting 200 pounds of couches on the job.
bad,"As a temporary employee i was treated very good because of my work ethics, the brake room was huge and had a tv."
bad,"I love Macy's. Working for Macy's is another story. The pay is horrible as a sales associate. There is no negotiating whether you have experience or not. For the amount of work they want you to do for minimum wage, it's definitely not worth it for people wanting to make extra cash. It's basically like being paid to put gas in your car to get to there. The managers are pretty helpful and nice. The pluses are the employee discount, first dibs on sale items and some of the co-workers. This job is definitely recommended for people who don't mind working like a slave for minimum wage."
bad,friendly employees and management
bad,cleaning before the store opens. using janitorial equipment.
bad,I worked there for 6 months and enjoyed it partially. My co-workers were superb but the managers majority of the time seemed as if they didn't have control.
bad,"You have to make MAGIC* maintain a 90 and above sales record, must make 4 credit a week, stock, retag, search and send, pick up phone, clear stock room, rearange merchendise, assist customer, help other employees, take misplaced items to the right department, clean fitting room etc. and worst of all the 6 point system they came up with were they deduct it if you are: late 1/2 point call out 1point, call out on weekend 2points oh and did i mention is for the year? not per month like they said at first and you are terminated if you get to half a point left. their positive say is for everymonth you dont call out or are late you gain a point..."
bad,"I didn’t like the company as a whole . I feel like I wasted my time as a collective and could have been somewhere better. My interviewed position and what they had me doing was two different  things, in which made me not like the job"
bad,I didn't like my experience at Macy's some of the managers were rude and weren't ok with you doing other jobs that was not in your description even if you were trained in it.
bad,"To be honest I like working here at Macy’s cause of the pay, people I’ve come to know, and work life balance."
bad,"They need more organized people who are reliable and also need to pay their employees more. Perks of working there include employee discount, fun environment, and if you enjoy customer service the job will be tolerable"
bad,The job was extremely fun and interesting. From running internal reports to doing plain clothes surveillance on the sales floor. absolute adrenaline rush when you actually catch a shop lifter.
bad,"This was a seasonal position for me. Christmas time, it was very fast paced working at the register. Also, a lot of clothes and shoes had to be put back in it`s original place."
bad,"Long hours standing all day. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"Work day was up and down. Work establishment was Quick-paced, but also slow at the same time. Pay and Hours were little to none and management barely offered decent work days."
bad,Macys taught me all aspects of retail selling and how to run a business. Maintaining a clientele and building relationships became a second nature to me.
bad,I enjoyed working here because you learned a lot and was never stuck in just one thing. They had you switching around to not get bored. That is one thing I enjoyed moving around
bad,"Ensure high levels of customer satisfaction through excellent sales serviceAssess customers needs and provide assistance and informationon product features"
bad,"Macy's was a really fun place to work. Unfortunately, the company rarely offers full time. They are really nice and it is nice you can pick most days you work (excluding holidays)"
bad,"Collaborate with Managers, Leads and Associates "
bad,"For 1) the training is entirely computer based and about 8 hours long, which is dull and ineffective. You can basically skim through modules and the tests at the end, are common sense. So in technicality, you don't really have focus. And I tried, boy did I try to stare at that screen for that period of time. 2) After training, you're schedules for work and throw in there, and well good luck to you! "
bad,"Great atmosphere, fun, enjoyed interacting with various employees and customers, advancement possible but difficult as well."
bad,Job was simple and straight forward they just weren't offering enough hours and the pay was too low for me. If the pay was better and they gave me hours I would have stayed on staff after the seasons.
bad,"Not a bad company to work for, but I may have just gotten into the wrong position there."
bad,"A typical work day at Macy's involves attending to customers and ensuring that merchandises are well displayed."
bad,"Must be team oriented and customer service savvy to wok in Macy's environment.  I could be transitioned from Men's to Shoe's during peak times."
bad,I liked macys it was okay for the most part I really dont have no complaints
bad,A typical day at work would be that I would stand behind the cash register and ring up constumer and help them with any questions or problems. I learned to work with people and communicate. The management was nice and very helpful. My co-workers were very respectful and friendly. There was no hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part was talking with all the costumers.
bad,"i do the truck so i barely have contact with customers and i place the truck goods out on the floor as directed by my department manager. once i have done that then i do what is next on my to do list, but as i continue my work i also find that helping customers that are seeking help for items as other associates are too busy on who is selling michael kors or this or that where as the customer that needs the real help gets over seen and thats why i love my job cause i help the real customers out. i find it to be the best part of my day and especially when i have a big truck (pallets) i tend to get longer hours then just four hours. the environment is great so is the co-workers but the GOALS need to be changed instead of being about SALES it needs to be about CUSTOMERS, im just saying. the part i find hard about my job is doing so much truck load in just four hours but i always manage to get whatever i have done within my time frame anyways, so yes i love working under pressure."
bad,"my suspicion is that I need working hard, and prove what I can do. Maybe to see what I am good at. But I did not experience so many things. I know I been in mission society in my school, and I been working in the library in one week."
bad,Working in the Warehouse is okay. The Second shift managers are amazing but I would never recommend first shift. The manager is rude and disrespectful the hours are nice but it's not worth the hassle
bad,I loved this job but then again it was just a one time thing because I wanted to be in modeling and have fun there are many things that are good about macys
bad,"I loved working at Macy's. Traveling so far was my the hardship I have experienced Working at Dulles Town Center. The demand during a one day sale. Working 12 hours a day, Working black Friday and dealing with every day issues that arrive is very exciting . I grew so much as a manager working in the higher volume stores allowed me to recognize my strengths and work to get better at my opportunities."
bad,"Very low wage. Not made enough money for my bills. For that kid of job they should pay minimum $ 12.00 per hour because we clean the fitting rooms, fold the clothes, greet the customers....That job should be paid higher. No one can survive with that little money for hard work, stay all work time...."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,A typical day at work would consist of cleaning out fitting rooms and restocking items
bad,"very busy"
bad,I loved this job also it was a very busy enviorment but I really am the type of person to have be the center of attention and that's why I couldn't keep this job
bad,Decent job for a steady income. my co-workers are ok. learned very little typical retail job
bad,"Learned how to work a cash register, assist customers, it was an ok job"
bad,you have goals to meet on a typical day at work and it helps you becoming more challenging
bad,"macys was a good place to work,"
bad,"being a sale assocate make you learn more about your self working for macy,s company show how grow up you can be the you will dress going to work for macy,s"
bad,Macy’s it’s ok to work at is not the best but will do for sometime .some people here are rude and it’s really stressful when clients come in and the clothing they try on they leave it in the floor for everyone to step on it
bad,"There isn't much to say I worked for the company for 4 years as a specialist, I never got offered to move up. As soon as I dropped down from my position basically everything was taken from me. I felt i was more labeled as a newbie and again I have been with the company for 4 years. I have been trying to get removed from the benefits and due to my hours from last year the company still thought that i was eligible for benefits when i haven't worked in almost 2months and they haven't removed my benefits. when i work its not even to get a paycheck anymore its pay my medical, when i was in school for 6 months plus my externship that was 5 weeks with no pay. So when I wouldn't work I felt like i was just working in both places for free and treated unfairly."
bad,"Macy's was a competitive store in the mall, but still constantly busy with customers. I cashiered, ordered merchandise, straightened dressing rooms, and opened up charge accounts. I would highly recommend them as a place of employment to some one who likes staying busy on the job and can provide customers with what they need, in a professional manner."
bad,Very active and productive working. Not the job for me because i love working around people. Its a place if you like to work alone not really a teamwork environment.
bad,"Kings Plaza has the worst overall management (HR, store manager, department managers) they all feel like they are superior. When i all reality you still work in retail even though you got a salary."
bad,"I loved the job itself. Many times, I worked over the $ goal and made extra money, however security would search the employees bags in front of customers when they were done with their shift. It was always very embarrasing and demeaning. Quit after a month."
bad,at macys i run back clothes and other thing in help people out with the thing they pick.and that place is nice but they dont have anything right.
bad,It was a great seasonal opportunity to work in retail and learn more about fashion.
bad,In Macy's I learned that hard work is important in order to succeed in the work place. My department is commissions and in order to make a difference you have to exceed your expected number of sales.
bad,inventory cashier work assisting customers and working to the hardest of my capabilities
bad,Not very organized. I learned a lot and feel as tho it helped me grow and know what I did or didn’t want in a career. They were in transition and had very little sales people on the floor at the time. Management was changing and I felt as tho I was there at a difficult time for the location.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
bad,"During my 26 year career at May Co, the job was exceptional. I was well respected and treated as a valuable member of the team. Promoted multiple times and acknowledged for my contributions as well as that of my team. "
bad,Great inviorment to work in I like the job but I would love a carrer at the rochester airport . Took my first flight and realized that I love the enviorment I like the people I know  I would fit right in .
bad,"Good things about the company is about working arrangement and there is not pressure to the worker."
bad,If you had a personal problem they didnt care and just let you go as not rehirable.  Which is not fair.  I had a death in My Family instead of taking this into consideration they let me go and put me down as non-rehirable.
bad,"Macys is an excellent place to work,the reason is because it is an international clients visiting from diferent countries.Co-workers are very much like me easy to work with. I can just say,that every day was fun and interesting.I would like to go back,since my husband past away!"
bad,Great company to work for but the pay isn’t that much could be better need to have more hours not just only part time the stuff is good over all the company is great
good,"It was just a seasonal position . Bare minimum . I wasn’t treated like the full time staff or recieved benefits, just discount . It wasn’t the worst but it could’ve been better . Reguardless of the environment i went to work everyday punctual and completed my task with a clear optimistic mind ."
good,"I absolutely loved the people I worked with, but definitely did not get payed enough for what I dealt with! You have to keep up with the fitting rooms every hour, help check people out, help customers on the floor! An there are days where you have long lines an can’t even make it into the fitting room for awhile, managers tell you to call but then they either don’t answer or they are too busy to come help. Then you have to deal with angry customers on your own"
good,As a person who works on draw it is seldom possible to receive a commission because of the pricing practice of the company. Some part of the day is used to look for merchandise that has been ordered on line for which no compensation except draw is paid. .In the year that I have worked there I have never seem a merchandise buyer or been questioned as to what I think the customer might want.... time to move on
good,I’m not sure why I’m being asked this I no longer work there this is pointless!! It was a seasonal job that didn’t work out! This is why Poopy ant find work cause of this dumb questioning
good,"They will give you more than 8 hours sometimes. "
good,"I was just terminated from Macys about a month ago. The store manager was an awful woman, and she made sure I got fired because she wouldn't let anyone work with me, about my attendance points. I was in at 6 am every day to do my job, but had to wait outside the employee entrance for 10-15 minutes 2 or 3 times a week for someone to let me in. That's half a point right there, over the holidays it was a full point. She wouldn't listen to me. Told the AST people to deny all my requests for getting those points back so I had a prayer of keeping my job. At the end of Christmas I was so sick I wound up in the hospital, with a doctors note, and required bed rest. I got fired a week later. I loved my job, and I loved the people I work with, but the higher ups don't care about you. They just want their money and want their sales. Now my husband and I are living on one income with a bills to pay, while I struggle to fins a job."
good,"You began by opening and counting every pair of shoes, checking inventory, and assisting customers with fittings. I learned how to manage stock inventory. Management was responsive and available. Workplace culture was a bit vague. I enjoyed the simplicity of the job and user friendly computer system."
good,"They hired too many people who in the end would stand around and still get payed for it. They had various supervisors who kept changing who they were in charge of so it was complicated on knowing who to speak to. Honestly, it was a really easy job once you knew how to use their handset but the lack of structure that made it easy for others to slack off was discouraging. I am giving it 3 stars on the overall rating because the pay was high for the easy tasks."
good,Macys was an okay place to work. The managers didn't know a lot and they were all very rude. They offered me a raise and a promotion and then gave the position to someone else. A lot of the people who work there are competitive but they don't get paid on commission.
good,super chilled environment where their is no growth nor opportunity to become better! they seem to have their favorites and only certain ppl get special treatments
good,"It’s jus a job nothing more, the pay is absolutely horrible, you gain customer experience from them but that’s about it , you learn to fold clothes and count money"
good,"Very poor place to work, with little to no help from the higher level executive team. They wanted results but would not give you the tolls or allow you to hire the personnel in order to achieve it. It was a relatively poor paying job for both Executives and for those under my repost."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macys can be a fun place to work just depending on your location. The one thing that I did like about working at Macys was earning macys money and the employee discount.
good,"Macy's was a temporary position, although in the time I was there I noticed that nobody worked together, everyone was out for themselves and would compromise morals and values to get a sale. Management also put too much of an importance on selling their credit card to every single customer. They implied that if you couldn't sell the card the way they wanted you to, your job was on the line."
good,"First time working in retail, great experience. The wages are extremely low could be better. Employees should earn commission in every department not just some"
good,"You'd be surprised if you get much of a thank you unless you get a credit, customers generally treat you like you don't matter and you go home with a less than adequate paycheck"
good,Fast paycheck long hours place is so big u spend half break time walking to and from break room! All seasonal get treated like mules with no respect and fulltime employees are LAZY!!! They believe since they have seniority why should they work hard!!! Go to fed-ex
good,The culture is great as long as everyone is there to make things happen. Unfortunately there are a lot of people coming in just to pick up there checks at the end of the week and it shows.
good,they gave good breaks and i didn't feel pressured to always be on my toes but they motivated me in a good way. they were really good with in keeping up with breaks and the coworkers were really nice and easy to get along with
good,The employees in the human resource department do not know how to handle all situations professionally and confidentially.
good,"Bad management, High turnover rate, and Okay beer.They need to update their beer selection. Have more qualified management, and learn how to talk to their employees. No room for advancement in this company, it is a favoritism game."
good,Being a seasonal associate I didn't really get too comfortable with the company. It was nice to have a second job while in school to keep busy.
good,The bad part about working at target is the management they make bad choices and won't hesitate to point fingers on everyone but themselves.
good,worked hard everyday and they never appreciated me and they were always changing the rules. Kmart was a large company to was not all nice and found reasons to do write up.
good,This company has been under new management since I have left there. Rumor has it is that few sign leases there and the company is desperate for business.
good,"While I did move up from a seasonal to regular part-time, to commission sales part-time rather quickly; I felt the only other advancement would be to full time.  High employee turnover due to poor management.  For example, although I had formally stated my availability and in several conversations with my manager the ONLY times I could not work was two weekdays after 5:00pm and Saturdays before 4:00pm due to my obligations coaching youth sports, I was regularly scheduled at these times.  It was then my responsibility to find other employees with the same issue and switch our schedules around ourselves, if no one can cover your shift you lose points on their ""attendance scale"".  This especially didn't make sense because I was only given 16-20 hours to work per week.  Constantly searching the employee website picking up additional shifts, I was also more than happy when called to fill shifts on short notice.  However, I would be penalized for arriving late despite giving the calling manager my eta, as I would have to get ready and sometimes drop my kids off with sitter.  Never any reprimands, the people are very nice, courteous, and especially thankful when you cover a shift last minute; but there is the attendance point system.  When you agree to cover a shift, the computer puts the shift under your employee number and if you clock in late, despite being on time per conversation with manager, the computer system will deduct attendance points.  As a result, I lost my job with Macy's despite being the #1 salesperson in the store the previous week."
good,"it sucks working here, all they want is for you to pressure people into opening credit cards..i didnt like working there so much.. and you can get in trouble for the stupidest things"
good,"Open Registers"
good,Bringing in clients and helping clients create a new wardrobe.
good,If You don't get credit apps then management feels you're not doing anything at all.
good,"Macy's a good Store to work for. I work for macy's for years until i moved away. "
good,"Terrible place to work, people were mean and selfish. Management was horrible, very rude and did not care about employees at all. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"When I was first recruited, I was hired on by Finally Fine Jewelers. They were a leased department. When Finally went out of business Macy's took it over. I have been in retail for 20 years plus, I enjoy people coming in and giving the complete satisfaction. I have been 3rd key, assistant manager, and manager in my past. The hardest part of my job was that we didn't have good communication when the manager of the fine jewelry department took over. They were not trained to handle small pieces with a very large retail price. In the business of customers spending very large amounts of money they deserve the best service. In a market like high end sales we need repeat business. The most enjoyable part of Macy's was the smile on customers faces, and my very dear friends that I loved to work with."
good,i learned how to assit custumers with great custumer service.
good,customer service priority. Low wages hard work. Did enforce lunch break.
good,"Count the cash in the drawer, have a store meeting, go to assigned departments. Ring out customers, help them pick out the perfect outfit for whatever occasion. Meet our daily store goals. Clean out the fitting rooms every hour."
good,This job lacks training and management. My co-workers leave work for new people to do and they don't take responsibility for their actions. The hardest part of my job is picking up everyone elses slack and getting no reward for it. The customers are the only part of my job I enjoy.
good,like the macys money
good,"I worked very hard and made sure that all my daily tasks were done on time, but I had a supervisor discriminate against me for no reason at all, she made my job more difficult than it had to be."
good,"A typical day, normally 3 to 4 hours. Restock products (fragrance) Show product line to Holiday shoppers. Demonstrations/display product stations. What I learned were different sale approaches. As for management, I was brought in from a staffing company that was located in Georgia. There wasn't much direction, but I had enough sense to make the sales and treat the shoppers with respect and diginity. My co-workers were pleasant, never the say co-workers on a daily basis (at least the shifts I worked). The hardest part of the job, make the sales, make the quota on a particular product that had difficult to sell. The most enjoyable part of the job, The Christmas season and the shoppers."
good,"My typical day at work was to unload truck loads, sort the item's, put sensors on certain item's. I leared how to work on the docks an how inventory works, how to use an bailer, a push forklift also how to use the freight elevator for the merchandise. The management was horrible to me beacause there was alot of favoritism going on and my co-workers were awesome very nice to one another alot of laughter, joking aorund just really friendly people there. The hardest part to me was having to get the truck done by the time we left work, and the enjoyable part was laughing having a nice time with the other employee's an taking the merchandise to the sales floors."
good,Only managers and their leads get full time. So everyone else has to have a completely open schedule or go on call. Forget about having a second job or a set schedule.
good,"I loved it when I first started working here, but between having to work and deal w the contractors they hire, the warehouse’s lack of order, and lack of leading management things just are not the same. Benefits were okay and pay fluctuated often due to sales"
good,"Less hours of working and more pay benefits and job opportunities for the lower class working Americans, and take part of the hemp making abilities in the industry"
good,Management expect too much from associates  and very stressful job and I as 5th top sales person could only get 20 cents of raise After my annual review.
good,Macy’s was a place that wanted customer service to be top notch! The customer was always right no matter what the circumstances were! You had to have a smile on your face even if you get yelled at by your boss or a customer!
good,Macy's was not a good place to work. The staff showed no interest in being there and customers were very rude based on past experiences they had with old employees.
good,"Unfair management. Managers tend to pick and choose who they like. When it's busy its bad, when it's slow it's bad. On slow days I would keep busy by helping the support team put out new merchandise, move clearance items and price change. Managers work you to death during the holidays with not even and Thank you or good job."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,it was a good work place but poor management. could've been better while i was there unfortunately it wasn't.                               really good customer service
good,"Any job is difficult but this is the worst. The store and management bother you and make sure you open more credit cards each day and they do not care about anyone or anything as long as the store makes its sales goal for the day. "
good,"A diverse environment where you get to work with many different people. "
good,I just feel as Macy’s being the company that they are they should be able to pay there employees more money I don’t feel as though the compensation matches all the work that I do
good,if you are luck enough to get the right managers you will succeed but in retail that is rare so try to make diamonds out of coal and maybe you will succeed
good,"Macy's is trying to keep open and has laid off/closed stores, so little career opportunities are available.  The work environment has changed to do more with less people and it has left employee moral low."
good,I worked at Macys for the seasonal time of christmas. I started in October and they did not call me unitl the day of thanksgiving to work. I had no training and they just put me on the floor. That was terrible. They asked me to stay after seasonal I said no.
good,"have worked at the company for almost 5 years and it was the worst time i had spent there. people never really took anyone serious and managers had favorites. They are bad at giving raises, they don;t seem fair at all as a company."
good,Macy's is a store I love but customer service is a learning fast paced service especially around seasonal position in which I had. Learn on my own in busy environment was good
good,"While my experience at Macy's was seasonal, it does not negate the fact that at times employees are expected to perform duties outside the realm of their capabilities and/or training, in specific areas of the city where one demographic is prominent- a non-bilingual employee can miss out on sales opportunities because of the approach of a bilingual employee."
good,"A typical day on the job was maintaining the stock and the aisles. One would learn how to quickly navigate and adjust to the environment of a fast-paced job setting; while helping customers find what they were looking for. Management was either too biased with certain employees or lacking in restriction or direction, along with racial discrimination. The workplace itself was fairly happy, most employees got along and many worked very well together. The hardest part was the lack of direction and all around biased nature of management, at times it was hard to understand what they wanted to be done or what was to be done since so little was set up; When management didn't approve of certain employees they'd punish them with little to no hours or give them more tasks than one could do alone."
good,A typical day consist of engaging customers and assisting them on purchases as well as trying to open new credits. Management was hardly around until they were paged. Co-workers were friendly and they made the workplace fun
good,"I like the company and merchandise, but working retail is something I wouldn't recommend to any adult with bills. Hard work but with very little pay. This job is only for teenagers and college students who don't mind making a quick buck. I did like having the opportunity of  seeing and meeting people of many backgrounds, cultures and races everyday. I enjoy shopping at Macy's, but this job doesn't pay enough for me."
good,"Stagnent pay with constant additions to our duties with no real compensation for it. Now as a Sales Associate I am expected to complete tasks that at one point were two different positions. However the company desperate to save money without risking the pay of the people on top are slashing positions and expecting those who are left to be willing to take on the added burden. I can barely afford to even shop at the store I work at, but the idea of a raise that's higher than 30 cents is laughable."
good,"Job is a very great place to build experience and build intellectual skills and conversing with others . I love the opportunity they have for their employees. I liked working there. fun people, clean and steady place to work. never bored always working to make it a place better. nice customers and nice employee discounts."
good,i applied for full-time and recieved a part-time schedule not only that but my schedule only consisted of one shift for the entire month.
good,"Management is horrible! "
good,"busy work environment "
good,Store Mgr is rude and unprofessional to say the least. Store Mgr Uses skeleton staff to run floor which is nightmare because is basically 1 maybe 2 people per dept during the holiday season. Would not advise anyone to seek fulltime employment here. Holiday or seasonal only.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,It's ok. Its not a stable job and people come and go all the time. The schedule is made for u and you can't switch. and very poor management
good,"The department was great meet many people and worked well with other staff and it was great team work, where staff assisted and helped one another."
good,"Macys appears on the outside to be a great and very promising company to work for with numerous advancement opportunities promoting hard work and loyalty. It is however the opposite. The company is only focused on the bottom line and favoritism is rampant among Senior Management and District heads. It does not matter whether you have previous retail experience or you perform above your peers, if you are not liked by Senior Management you do not stand a chance for advancement. Employees are not treated fairly and the compensation is below industry standards for what is expected. The reason for Macys recent unsuccessful fiscal results is largely due to its leadership. The focus has shifted from offering the customer a quality product at a reasonable price to basically slashing prices, returning everything and expecting customer loyalty on brands that have already had their 15 mins of fame. A re-branding effort is needed to revive a once prominent department store experience that has fizzled into one of desperation to deliver ""The Magic of Macys""."
good,"Macy's is hard work,  little pay and small advances. Never enough employees on hand on any given day. these employees need a union"
good,"Assisted customers with the selection of items to be purchased and conduction of sales transaction.  During the Christmas season, the store was very busy"
good,"The idea of making ""Macy's Magic"" comes down to the employees. That ability is somewhat stunted in the fact that even as a full-time employee, It was very hard to live a happy, productive, and magic filled life due to the inability to make enough to sustain that idea. When a company makes $27 Billion in profit, the company as a whole should do better and more harmoniously, instead of the top percentage taking an inequitable amount and leaving their employee's no room to flourish, but rather room to flounder. Even with two additional pay increases, and after almost two years of service, to make magic for everyone the way Macy's wanted, was too taxing on my wallet and heart. I provide one of the best customer service experiences, both in and out of professional and personal lives, but at a rate  of less than $10 per hour, killing yourself is not justifiable. Macy's is a great company with values that supersede companies I've worked before, but accepting mediocrity does not work for me. I am not mediocre. Pay myself, and every other employee that doesn't identify with laziness and basic procedures, an acceptable wage. The more you respect your employees', the more your business will thrive and succeed. We all need to thrive and succeed ; if it starts at work, even better."
good,While working at macy's I learned how to interact with all different kinds of people! I loved the atmosphere of the galleria and of the customers at Benefit! I didn't agree with my management at all! I feel like they were very unfair.
good,It was overall fun but this was a second job.  I had fun talking with customers.
good,"Overall I loved working for the prestige cosmetic lines and fragrances. I loved interacting w/ customers & educating about product & applying makeup & skincare & showing perfumes. I learned so much about ea prestige line that because I floated between all 3 of the counters & I learned alot about all the different fragrances. I ran the register alot too. I didn't like the way the policy was set up for absences/tardies & how none were excused providing a doctor's note. The new cosmetics manager lacked social skills, was very fake and unsympathetic when certain concerns were brought to her attention. I loved the managers in all the other departments, they were very sociable, understanding & always willing to help. The hardest part of the job was being asked to work in a diff area in which I wasn't familiar w/ resulting in not knowing sale pricing, the exact location of items, etc."
good,Poor Management starting with the store manager!! THIS STORE MANAGER LIED ABOUT MY POSITION AND HAS VERY BAD WORK ETHICS!!!
good,enjoy working with co-workers and meeting and communicating with people of diverse ethnic background which can be rewarding on many occasions.
good,They call me whenever they feel like and I only worked like 3 times and attended three trainings. They have not call me often.
good,"Trucks stacked to the ceiling with boxes, open the boxes, sort the merchandise on racks per department. Very repetitive. The only problem was it was only seasonal."
good,"Conduct customer service"
good,"Depending on the department that your working its a job like any other. There are deadlines to meet. Work load varies from slow to heavy, depending of the time of year. The management is a little hard to deal with because they like to sometimes give you the run-around. Although there are some great managers that are great and help their teams. The best part of this place is the people that I work with. I have meet some life long friends."
good,Working at Macy's as a general sales associate means that I would work where ever they were short staffed or where ever department was the busiest. Typically I was in watch or jewelry sales.
good,Macy's didn't pay employees for the work they put out. over worked and under paid. I worked at Macy's for 2 1/2 years and never recieved a raised or offered another position in the company.
good,Lack of adequate direct line supervision made this experience disappointing.  So much potential - so little effort by so many employees.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was making the customers happy and assisting. I learned how to become a great team player and help my co-workers with daily operations. A typical day at work would be sometimes be overwhelmed.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,A typical work day for this seasonal position is very busy. The customers are in demand and products go very quickly. It took alot of patience which I definately have and my co-workers are just as busy as myself assisting customers.
good,great job great people very busy everyday VERY energetic great job if u into fashion
good,Everyday we start by looking at the look book. We then try to simulate the same look as that in the lookbook for all the stores.
good,i really didnt like working with the company because i couldnt get the amount of hours i wou have liked to have.
good,"It was a job that was promoted as a really good job to have coming out of college. I would not recommend it to anybody. The company does nothing to promote you. The only way to get promoted is by being a brown noser to the GM and DVP. Even if you are the person with amazing results it doesn't really matter the company, you will never get promoted."
good,It was fun working here because of the employees and some pretty awesome customers I built a relationship with so I will be missing them. The managers on the other hand not so much.
good,"I learned to sell at Macy's.  I wasn't trained the best I think because it was in the Christmas season and the staff has quotas to meet, so my training wasn't a priority at that time.My manager was alittle envious and did not plan a training, or but the staff was very nice there at Ross Park."
good,Macys is a great store to shop and also work at I really enjoyed  working there as well . I have been cashier  for years very experienced  I can give outstanding  customer service  to all.
good,"Over all I like Macy's but lot's of work at very low pay. They expect a lot out of you. They can treat you very bad if they don't like you, very childish ways like that."
good,Poor management with unsuccessful leader ship at the helm no training in my area which is in facilities no communication among supervisors bad attitudes who only seem to like to play the blame game
good,I worked at the Fulton st Macy’s. Its like High school all over again. Too much gossip. Everyone always wants to be in your Business and starts rumors.
good,I work for Macy’s for a very short time it was seasonal I came in in about December and was gone within 30 to 40 days I was there every day on time and  Even covered Other shifts I really enjoyed it I just regret applying so late.
good,Several of the cashiers had an attitude and I couldn't believe how they treated the other workers or how they treated some of the customers.  The manager didn't have time to properly listen to complaints about these bullies.
good,"it could be a pleasant day or very stressful. i learned a lot, business wise, how to deal with different personalities taught me more understanding of how treat others. there's a lot of favoritism when it comes to management. I loved working with my clients, helping them with their products."
good,"Working at Macy's is very similar to working at any other retail establishment your hours are random and you will not be getting full-time employment unless it is around Christmas. You can take days off but they must be requested usually a month in advance and forget any scheduled time from October-December."
good,"Macy’s is a good place to work if you want to live there , not much family,work balance. Management was new to the company and didn’t know what she was doing. She was very difficult to work with. Macy’s pay was far less than other retail companies."
good,I would not work at Macy's anymore . I didn't feel like they were fair when hiring for permanent position. I know that I exceeded expectations. But they hired someone less qualified.
good,it was a temporary job and i did not have any issues with anyone. was fun to see all the clothes that were new and liked helping the customers finding the deals.
good,"Macy’s was a fun place to work until the culture of the store changed. Management appeared stressed, which trickled down to associates. The average pay is extremely low, compared to the work expected and there are multiple tasks assigned by different people who don’t communicate."
good,I met some great people in the almost 10 years with the company. I was able to move around a little and try different things before leaving. Pay and benefits could have been better.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy's Florida mall is a disaster. management team is awful. they cut hrs like crazy. you might work 4 hrs for a week. security is a disaster. work schedule was crazy. during holidays work schedule can be from 3Am- 11 or 12.
good,"Macy's is a great place to get a lot of retail experience in different departments, with high profile brands.  I met great people and created awesome lifetime friendships."
good,"Cash handling skills as well as customer service skills are a must! Making goals set by the Market Calendar & sales plan for the brands is what the work day consist of. Work culture can be tricky, like it's based on a serfs/Kings atmosphere and treating your peers with mutual respect is also a super MUST!"
good,"The manager I was under was very thoughtful, and treated myself and others well. It is upper management and some employees that are permanent treat you very poorly. You are there to help as well as make some income not take anyone’s job away. Upper management is just as bad if not worse. Also the dress code is not very tasteful for such a fine store. Most employees dress like they are just lounging around home instead of nice attire when you are working with the public."
good,"I applied for this job because at the time I was applying everywhere and I got it immediately, started out as a seasonal flex employee, and once that was over I had to reapply to be hired full/part time. It was great at first, but when the store manager changed the job slowly started getting worse. At this point I just want a different style of work. If you like retail jobs that can be flexible with your schedule, then this would be good for you."
good,I love coming to work it was positive environment nd fun place too work at.nd everybody got along with each other at work.we where more like a family at work I love it ..
good,Dealing with costumers every day. There was little support form management when issues would arise. The expected a lot of work effort out of the sales associates and were unwilling to help when it was needed to get tasks done in a timely manner.
good,A typical day at Macy's galleria would be working at a steady pace getting the customers what they need and making sure that they would want to return. give them great feedback on whatever they ask and make sure that they like their experience there.
good,"I think working for Macy's could have been a wonderful experience had I not worked in cosmetics. The women that work there have often been there for 15+ years. They take joy in making sure the newbie 'pays their dues'."
good,"punch in, fold clothes, ring up customers, help them find things, go to weekly meeting, count out the register deposit ,dealing with management, online sales,"
good,Learned how retail environment has its pros and cons just like any other job environment. Was able to aquire some very helpful skills when it comes to critical and creative thinking outside of the box.
good,Very low pay rate. Difficult to coordinate with a 2nd job. Did not pay a living wage; the paid rate was so low that a lot of employees qualified for Food Stamps.
good,"One of the things that really made me want to leave Macys is the hours. They we not consistent and based solely on other people inability to work. There were assigned hours, in my case i got 3 to 9 hours a week. And if wanted to work more id have to be the scrape and scrimp over the remaining hours they would release to the remain associates. Associates that were full time or a higher up part timer had access to these remain hours first, so if they wanted they could pick up what's left if they wanted more hours. Meanwhile the lower part timers pt-5 or on calls got the scrap hours if there were any left. It made it impossible to attempt to live off an already unliveable wage."
good,"There’s a lot of heart in one building! I love that! The fashion is always fun! The expectations aren’t realistic. Also, the store manager sits on her thrown doing nothing! Lead by example people!!-. How can one expect anything?!, when you do nothing?"
good,Could be a slow day or a fast one depending on the day employees very helpful and nice mangers were kind of helpful good job if you buy alot of stuff from macys for the discount
good,its very hard to believe and understand a company that is being operate with upper management that are guess their own responsibilities and are no help for move forward or success
good,I worked here for over 3 years. There is definitely poor management and basically everyone above you plays favorites. I feel like I wasn’t “safe” in my job if I wasn’t well liked not by how well I performed so much as popularity. Management does not treat everyone equally unfortunately.
good,"I am a people person, and i absolutely adored making people smile based off their purchases. what i didn't like, was the lack of people and lack of management skills. also the style for checking customers out, there is no flow or speedy way to do it. one other negative was not being able to balance time with my kids or being part of their school things. this job is for a college student or an older generation. not for a parent with younger kids. I did like the online feature of managing your schedule and being able to pick up or put your shift up for grabs for others. so there was a tiny bit of flexibility,"
good,"The managers were scatterbrained and all over the place. They often times made numerous mistakes and did not take people's personal lives into consideration (birthdays, family emergencies, ect). They were very childish and rude at times and favouritism is a huge factor in the job."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,you can learn more things while you are working like  such a macy's stores because you are going to see deferent people with deferent opinion and attitude.
good,"A typical day at work was very stressful but sometimes fun"
good,I did markdowns and worked behind the scenes as a support team member. The other associates were rude and not cooperative. The sales associates were vicious and territorial of customers. Management was poor and disorganized.
good,"Macys declined over the years as far as a good company to work for. Care more about the all mighty dollar, and less about the employee. Very sad situation indeed."
good,"Had a great experience working at Macy's. Its a very easy and fun place to work and build work experience for future jobs. I end up leaving Macy's for one reason, the hours are not consistent."
good,Poor place to work. Pay is lousy and management is not invested in the team effort. Very little hours were given in this position and there was an abundance of team member unhappiness
good,"I hated working for Macy's!  They rip off customers with their high priced clothing that they get in China for nothing! The management will drive you insane because they are so cheap the bug you about sales constantly.  If your not taking a job in cosmetics,  shoes, or jewelry - don't forget it!"
good,"I love the fact that I was transferred to different departments. I liked assisting and learning new things. Also, I dealt with a lot of customers with different cultures."
good,"assist customers with purchases while interacting in conversations. The job duties are not difficult to adjust to, but the employees are not warmth in daily conversation."
good,"a typical day was, fast paced , a lot of one -on- one with customer."
good,I worked here for the holidays because i wanted retail experience. We were often bombarded with people that were shopping for loved ones and my team and i were taking the clothes from dressing rooms and putting them away.
good,"Loved my co-workers, but little to no advancement. Minimum wage with small increases usually cost of living raises. No education available, I loved retail work but, I could not live on hourly wages."
good,"game playing, rude, being made fun of, talked down too.  I worked on the housekeeping team, of a cleaning company.  I realized after time Macys employees bullied the cleaning company.  Our equipment was sabotaged by the macys associates.  We were made to be talked down too, not good enough, didn't fit in, and never will. I enjoyed talking with the associates up to a point, until I realized everything I said, did, a gesture, or a look, was talked about and misinterpreted into me being such a horrible person.  The employees were to aware of us and what we were doing and not concentrating on what they should be doing.  Also management was right along with it.  Horrible place. Horrible people.  I wish I  never would of worked there."
good,It's easy work in general but management is no good and they don't care about their employees. They just see you as a number. The store manager is one of the worst I have ever seen myself.
good,Things changed from when store was family owned. No balance of work and home life. Benefits reduced and eliminated. There was no store manager most of the time.
good,I am not one for the sales position so this job was not for me. I was a cashier as a seasonal employee. The older employees did not seem to be very helpful to the new hires. I felt uncomfortable working there and was glad when the season was over.
good,"I didn't have the best experience working for Macy's, but it was there that i found my calling. They don't appreciate your hard work and they will use you if you're ""a rising star."""
good,Great job experience to further my career in costumer service along with learning about direct customer handling. I enjoyed the company culture and how they trained there employees.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"This company provides little room for advancement without too much dedication. You can be promoted, but you will have to demonstrate a phenomenal understanding and execution of the companies policies, goals, and culture."
good,"Looking for a nice part time around the Holidays ? Macys is the way to go, but you are constantly looking online to see if you can squeeze some more hours within the week"
good,"The room for advancement was based on favoritism, the work load was large and the pay was not enough. There are no benefits and don't expect them to give you any even at fulltime. Full time for macys is 35 hours, get more hours on your own."
good,"Typical day would be arriving on time.  Seeing what the immediate needs are and fulfilling them.  This position deals primarily with people, if you are not a people person, this job is not for you.  Some sales employees are extremely territorial, even if they are super busy helping others, they don't want you to help with the over-flow, in case your sales are higher than theirs.  If you are able to be a ""floater"" sales person, this position is good for learning the store and seeing different venues."
good,"Administrative Services Team is the catch-all for all things Human Resources, Cash/Vault, Assistance to store Leadership, Operations. Supply ordering and management for whole store"
good,"Since the day I started, management will push you harder and rude about it. even reaching the goal. Supervisor/manager will not protect employees unless you are an ""American"" Scream at you in front of Customer..."
good,i learn customer service skills how to work with others ... managment isnt the best their but its okay.. working hard getting custmors in and out has fast as possblie
good,The pay was terrible.  My coworkers were not friendly.  The manager encouraged fighting between coworkers.  Toxic environment.
good,This was a part time position. As anyone can imagine working for such a large established department store was an awesome experience. Every day was a delightful and pleasant experience.
good,"Poor management with the ""do as i say not as i do mentality"". Security manger shows up to work to collect a paycheck and doesn't train, coach or inspire employees. The security department is small only 4 individuals to work and operate 3 buildings with little to no help from manager."
good,"I worked at Macys during the holiday season. I was very excited to be working in cosmetics. however, because I was seasonal it was extremely stressful. Macys goes by a 10 point system if you miss one day you lose 2 points or something along those lines. It is very hard to gain the points back. Being late can result to .5 points being deducted and being punctual and in perfect attendance is 1 point earned back. A lot of people found themselves at 0 points and were dismissed from their jobs. I ended up leaving for a different reason"
good,They schedule you when they want. They don't train you properly and expect you to move with the flow. Good luck balancing your life/work. They have an AUTOMATIC policy that you work on SATURDAY AND SUNDAYS . Management doesn't help you out with scheduling and they want you to work in hours you don't like.  You have to keep watching the schedule otherwise you get the LEFTOVER hours.
good,I never seen the manager I have to learn myself and tech other crew members. what to do they don't pay good at all they will work you very hard with very little pay.
good,"A typical day at work detailed walking throughout the floor to maintain appearance of merchandise, to determine all items were in proper order as well as customer assistance for those in need. Unfortunately for this specific location, communication between co-works and store supervisor/management was lacking. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to interact with customers in need of help finding specific items."
good,"-Greeting and tending customers"
good,"Typical corporate bull, high turnover, inconsistent management, little room for advancement, high pressure management"
good,Seasonal work for Christmas Holiday dealing with customers from open to close. From face to face and via telephone. Some co workers are annoying especially the associates that have been there too long. They just worry the new associate will take their commission.
good,The days at Macy's are long. Typically a 12-hour day that turns into a 13.5 including before and after shift work. The processes are very manual compared to more modern D2C fulfillment centers. If you want to learn about D2C operations it's a good place to start but be prepared to take your experiences elsewhere. Limited promotional opportunities.
good,I did not like working for Macys. They will bleed you dry. Nothing you do is good enough. Unrealistic goals. There pay is horrible. You work every holiday you never get a break. Shifts are way to long
good,"Macy’s sales associates primarily assist customers."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,the hours are never enough.  the pay isnt high enough. the job security isnt very high unless you are a manager.  In order to succeed in the company you cant have a real life and you have basically work 24/7 to afford to support yourself.  It is a hard job and you almost never get payed enough.
good,"greeting customers and cashiering "
good,"The MAGIC culture that they have implemented is unrealistic."
good,"Sales are great, lots to choose from and discounts. It's nice to work with associates who are knowledgeable about merchandise. The hardest part of this job is mostly standing up."
good,"A typical day at work includes being a cashier as well as a housekeeper. We must clean up not only the fitting rooms but the selling floors as well. In all honestly the management stinks, however most of my co workers make going to work less painful. I have learned alot about retail and have gained alot of respect towards those who work in the retail industry. The hardest part about my job is cleaning up the same stuff over and over again all day long as well dealing with the most difficult of customers. I would have to say though that the most enjoyable part of my job is talking to people, meeting them and learning things i did not know."
good,"Lifting boxes 50Ibs or more, unloading, and finding a place for the shoes to go, in the correct sections of the shoe room, setting out a display for each new shoe. Everyday I learn a newer quicker stratagies to make the job much more easier for me. Management is ok. My co-workers do their job and I do mine. The heardest part of my job is everyones so dependant on me and sometimes my time is limited so I may not finish everyday. What I enjoy most is I know im the only person that can do my job the way I do it therefore just going to work alone is enjoyable for me because I have a job to do, that only im entitled to."
good,"Great discounts on most merchandise"
good,"they really only care for costumer not for their employees."
good,Working at the Herald Square location helped me gain experience in working with diverse people.
good,Provide customer service. Keep all areas stocked and neat. Clean out dressing rooms in a timely manner. Always be ready to jump on a register when needed. Deal with unhappy customers while maintaining composure and a smile.
good,"Pleasant place to work at, Very friendly co-workers, Easy work to do, I learned how to answer phones and tranfer calls to correct staff or department"
good,"Of course when you get hired you know that Macy's is a commissioned based enviroment. Funny thing is that the only employees that get commission are women's shoes associates and fragrance associates. It may sound nice to get paid every week, but unless your management the pay is horrible. You start off at 8 to 9 dollars an hour and you never get a raise unless your promoted to a specialist or manager based on your ""scorecard."" Now the scorecard can either be your best friend or your worse enemy. Your score is broken down into sales volume, items per transactions, macy's applications, and average sales per hour. The are broken down into metrics where basically you have to make over your sales goal everyday and get at least 2 to 4 customers out of the week to apply for macys cards. Most of the time the sales goals for one individual can be extremely high (4400 for a 3 hour shift). So keeping your score is impossible most of the time. Management is weak because they never answer the phone, never manage the floor, never visible on the floor, and are always begging for you to have a customer to open up an account. They are always also pushing presales even though those don't help your score. Attendance credits also come into to play. If you run out of attendance points you are fired no questions asked. So if you would love a job that pays horrible and you fight for customers everyday be my guest!"
good,macys likes you to work hard and do your best but when it comes for you to move up with the company it is hard. They said that it takes time but you always see someone else move up.
good,"very hard place for advancement, the pay is not good and very unorganized management tema"
good,It's nice to work here for the season if you can handle the onslaught of hours.
good,some were fun people that always helped you out while others loved drama
good,Hardest part of the job was for me to learn company policy but i wasnt taught all the policies so i messed up alot.
good,Every morning i start my shift by clocking in and counting the money at each register. Greet and assist cutomers as they come in. I learned good customer service skills and how to work the registers.The hardest part of the job was when there was a sell going on the store the store will get packed and customers with there nasty attitude.The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers get what they came for.
good,"There are great people who work there at macys. i love it, i love meeting new people"
good,"I enjoyed working here at first but after a year I was not happy, no respect at all, managment didnt help at all, work schedule was ok. This company could do better.."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,four to five hour days with so much to do. Enjoy the co-workers they are the best!
good,It was great in the beginning then managers started picking favorites and they didn't try to hide it. it was constantly hard to find someone to cover your shift. your not given the hours you are told you are going to get.
good,"The schedualing was really random at Macy's, and they put a lot of pressure on employees to open Macy's credit cards. I relly enjoy the company of my co-workers though, they are the best bunch of people to work with. The hardest part of my job was standing the whole shift. I learned a lot of peoploe skills at Macy's that I can incorperate into everything I do in my life."
good,over all this you was fun and great! It was only temp work
good,"unloading the truck was easy, changing prices was ok unless there was a conflict. working under carie was ok and she was the one id go to about conflicts I had with stacy. the conflicts were over pricing and percentage"
good,"Boring , nothing left to say, management is inadequate, staffing level are cut. Schedules vary from week to week, Very few people are promoted. No investment in their employees."
good,"Over worked, not really appreciated, to many changes in hour's, no benifits. If any little thing is out of place or wrong I am blamed for it. I have tried to apply for a different position within the company and denied the chance of advancement. I don't like the hours I am being worked, and it's not worth the pay. I'm actually looking for a different job so I can resign my position.  I do like the weekly pay, and some of the people who I work with but that's the good thing about the job."
good,I loved my job and the reason I left was due to poor management. I do not appreciate being treated like a child or yelled at in front of employees especially when I know I am doing a good job and making sales.
good,"typical warehouse job . I feel it is a good seasonal job, but long term is less then ideal. A lot of differences in shifts in all departments. Good luck"
good,"Seasonal Job hired to Low minimum wage hours were only atlist 12 hours a week or less, not friendly environment very unreliable not enough hours to work"
good,Working for Macys was an okay temporary job but I didn't see any opportunity for advancement. I only worked there for a few months though so my opinion might not be the best to go by.
good,Every one has their own agenda and it’s not so much about customs than it is about their competitive numbers with other stores . It has been a good learning experience
good,Management seems more focused on earning their personal bonuses then they do their staff members on a daily basis.  I was hired for time but only received part time hours.
good,Its not macys its self its management they dont know how to properly talk to employees and also are very contradicting when it comes to policy very good at making associates look like they dont know what they are doing
good,"A typical day at work is to help customers , ring out at the register & put “go backs” away . Clean out the fitting rooms and put all the clothes away. "
good,"I applied for beauty and got an interview with receiving.... I took it because I wanted to work at Macy's. I became pregnant while working there and didn't feel good while working in the dock, my manager was not too understanding and had me still working the line. HR is very very rude and unpleasant, and the pay is very low. Overall I would not recommend... Try Dillard's or Nordstrom."
good,Most of the workers are cigarette smokers and after smoking outside they come inside and all of the nasty fumes are released into the air in the entire warehouse and that makes it hard to breath fresh air especially when your allergic to
good,- Little pay for expected high work demand
good,They treat seasonal workers like trash after the got the peak is over.they bus you in and on the last day they didn't have a bus to take us hour and half home but after this man with a bus was willing to  take us home then they called their buses
good,"It's a bit of a ""clicky"" atmosphere. If your department starts to give you lots of hours and no days off you have to wonder if it's because you're doing well because there's no communication,  except when it's credit card promotion time! That's when the pressure is on and everyone is competing for prizes but they have been cutting down on the benefits and discounts..."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macy does not have a policy where if employee is out due to medical procedure, employee must use point system, unfortunately if you are new you have not accumulated enough point to advert being terminated"
good,Managers need to be properly trained on how to treat associates and they also need to have product knowledge as well. overall the company is a good company its just some managements.
good,The managers expect you to be doing three things at once and always hurrying you up when you are trying to provide a customer quality service! The pay is so low for everything they have you doing throughout the day! You are expected to do the work of what it would take two people to do!
good,Working on the dock was okay. Pay was to low.  No opportunity for advancement. I like working with my boss he is a great guy but I am actively looking for other employment that pay more .
good,"Theres to much Drama at the work place. Also if you dont suck Butt or have your noise deep in butt you wont advanced, Manager are only there to help themselves out."
good,"A real..twist on what you would expect from retail. The people that you work with are amazing. But the way management runs the business could be improved. Co-workers assist eachother to the best of their ability.. But would like to work more than the hours theyre given. Management selects their ""golden goose"" and tries to please them. Instead of being a neutral party. Under staffed for the most of the time you clock in. Exceptionally high expectations to grow and quenched and left to seek other job areas.Most skills are self taught if not shown by other employee. Overall.. A good starter job. But wouldn't say how long one should be there."
good,".I use to work here back when it was Foleys,so I was excited on returning but for some reason,lately has been a joke. The management there is ridiculously insulting & talk down on us. They have very unprofessional people managing the store. They are rude & obnoxious. The majority of them don't know anything about the floor or what we do but they walk around with their tablets & rudely order us to do things that are COMPLETELY NOT RELATED TO OUR DUTIES & when questioned about it,they always say, the rules are changing & upper management wants it this way. I no longer enjoy to work there like I used to but being that I am a loyal associate (besides the issues alot of us on the sales floor have) I would still give my two weeks before leaving & stay in good terms because that's just the type of person I am"
good,"Management did not know what to do half the time. They put all the work load on you. Had to hurry to eat, if you had to heat your food you have to wait in a line."
good,Coworkers were really judgemental. A lot of bad management. The good thing about Macy's is working there for the discounts. Some of the people are nice.
good,"log into computer do picks, (customer orders) clean fitting room bring cloths back to depts. rings items at register. Take returns organize cloths on racks"
good,It's a job when you are desperate. Low pay but it is easy to gain employment. Macy's is not generous when giving out shifts..  The three hour shifts at the end of the day especially on Saturdays and Sundays are foolish.
good,"it was an okay place to work. they dont really care about their employess. to many hours and not enough pay. peak season is terrible. you are demanded to work ungodly hours and have no time for anything but there. the manager i had was very rude and unprofessional, and didnt care for noone but himself."
good,"No job security, positions were cut every quarter. Compensation was horrible. No work life balances you would always get emails and calls you had to answer."
good,it does not pay enough per hour and expect you to do more and over work you and the store is always hot inside the store and even customers complain and theres nothing we can do about it
good,"Macy’s has its ups and downs, most times they are understaffed, which is really 80% of the time they pay horribly, people can’t make a living off of $8.00 and only receive up to 15 hours per week , totally unexceptionable."
good,If you let the negatives with management and co-workers get to you it can be very stressful. Although when first hired the work bonus was nice then they took them away.
good,"I would not recommend working here to anyone. As a big named company, you would think that their culture would be more positive and inviting and it is the exact opposite. You do not get an opportunity for balance. In order to have any problems fixed or questions answered, no managers or AST can assist you, You are directed to call corporate every time."
good,Really didn’t like the jobs over worked under paid don’t know if it was because we was temp but  really not worth the job that they make u work unless the pay was more people where nice
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Easily one of the worst places to work... hourly rate of pay isn't worth the labor and stress. Managers play favorite some are well paid after only being there for 2 or 3 years which is unfair
good,Staff was relatively fun to work with. Always a lack of communication between store teams and managers. There was a huge lack of training in every position they had me perform. So there were huge room for mistakes to be made.
good,"The Company CEO is great, however, more investigating needs to take place concerning Brand managers of Counters."
good,"Never ending Go-Backs and Fitting Rooms clean-up; various managers such as sales managers and department managers and store managers come to your face and telling you that you have to make Sales Goals, Open at least two Macy's Credit Cards daily, various Charity Donations, Signing up Thanks For Sharing and almost weekly Pre-Sale Event just too much UN-realistic goals for hourly wage at $11.00 per hours. If you want to work for Macy's, you better getting a position selling Jewlry and Cosmetics, otherwise you will be stuck up the Fitting Rooms and Go-Backs duties."
good,"this is the job I would say I have disliked the most of all that Ive had"
good,"ok if you dont mind working crazy hours, low pay and management is poor. The only positive thing is the people. They made going to work worth it. Would be a fun part time job"
good,"it was a seasonal job, no chance of really getting hired full time not with all the 800 seasonal employees they hire and bring out of state. hard to compete for a couple jobs"
good,Very difficult to get people to work together toward a common goal
good,"My experience was ok, I worked with some awesome people on a day-to-day, and I loved the laid back, creative environment. There was also a fully stocked kitchen, refrigerator and stove. Many delicious meals were prepared. "
good,"Fast paced. Very sales oriented. It was okay for a part time job, but the hours were not enough, and the lack of benefits was no good. Employees were kept at part time so the company didn't have to pay benefits."
good,Great place to shop but not a great place to work. I worked during the holiday season and my manager at the time was very unhelpful and just threw me in any department without any training
good,"Accounting department's culture is not at all conducive to promoting diversity and inclusion. No real chances of advancement or empowerment for blacks, particularly black women."
good,It was a fun place to work at especially at Herald Square location. The variety of customers that came into shop from an array of travelers was awesome.
good,"never had enough hours I would work maybe 3 days a week, was placed in different places when I was told I would be in one place, management was not very good, pay was bad"
good,"Start off by opening a cash register if you start when Macy's opens. Then spend the first 30 minutes cleaning and organizing work area. After the store opens, perform cashier duties. Sometimes managers will relocate you to do other things like restock items or make promotional gift bags or to do recovery."
good,"In the women's shoe dept the culture is very fast paced jump right in. Management is nothing to write home about the company will hire outside instead of promoting with-in. Several cases of theft with some management. The hardest part of the job is the lack of team work to help with cleaning and stock work, do designated time for this. The best part of this job is their scheduling system, everything is done online. You can switch shifts, pick up or offer up hours if you have something to do last minute. On-call also gets the discount and can pick hours to work. No management approval for scheduling."
good,I don't really know what to say except I don't really like working there the place I worked wasn't really clean there were rats all over the stock room it smelled terrible
good,your hours will get cut short or they will send you home in the middle of your shift if they dont need you. you work every holiday if your not management .
good,Once promoted the management became rude and started gossiping in asking me to lie to our corporate manager and other management so she did not get in trouble for failing to train me in specific areas. My hours we're supposed to be evenings and nights when promoted that did not last I was working mornings and ours were unpredictable. I was working my shift and doing my duties on top of hers. At the end I was unable to stay due to poor direct management.
good,Good place for a starting job. Teaches you to work with money and how to treat customers. Great for experience to working in other customer service jobs
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Great company great products and executions. Horrible management clicks and work you to death. Too much on even associate's plates however great sales training and promotions within
good,Sometimes it would get to hot at the back of the warehouse and if the elevator broke you would have to walk all the way around just to get to the other warehouse below.
good,Macy's has created a customer base that demands coupons to be used frequently creating a stressful environment with customers and management. The hardest part of my job was cleaning up Last Act and clearing the fitting rooms. Management offers no help.
good,"Senior Management is so wishy washy that it's hard to determine what your priorities are for the day let alone the week.  No one is ever on the same page.  Most enjoyable part of the day is when you actually get to talk to your peers, usually it's around lunch time or at one of the million and one meetings you have throughout the day.  Once you learn the different personalities it can be a fun place to work.  The workload does not coincide with the amount of pay that you are offered."
good,Hectic work environment with insufficient resources to accomplish tasks.  Management doesn't listen to needs of administrative staff.  Poor communication from management.  Constant layoffs -- job insecurity.  Stressful for administrative level employees.
good,"used to be a great company to work for, NO longer. Pressure  to survive in rough retail environment has cause undue stress on store line staff."
good,The company is a good one to work for starting out. You do have perks with working here. The management team needs to be re evaluated. The HR Services department is very rude and unprofessional. They don't treat all employees the same. It needs improvement.
good,"Management is not really fair"
good,The supervisor weren't very nice! It was a good job for they pay and the work environment was chaos on most days but it was peak season! Worth the part time season and extra cash!
good,"I've worked for this company a few times. When in need of extra cash for the holidays here's where you should apply, you pick hours that are suitable for you, the environment is friendly and everyone seems to love their jobs."
good,"Depending on where you work you could have a slow place or a fast place and slow places are the worst, which mean time goes buy super slow. the management is horrible they don't really do anything to show their employees they appreciate them and they're very rude"
good,If you are looking to work only two times a day then this is for you but if you want to make a lot of money i wouldnt reccomend it. and the work enviroment is really uncomfortable.
good,Overall I enjoy what I do it Macy's it's a very high pace position for working on the dock you have to be quick and ready to process and sensor all products that need processing. At times it can be very overwhelming but as long as you stay focused it becomes a lot of fun . It was very different in some ways of where I used to work.
good,"When first arrving you get in line at the conveyor to open product to hang up, or your stripping plastic off the product/ pinning security pins on product to ready it for the shopping floor. It was a simple enough job, do a task when told to do it. But the dock manager is literally gone almost 50% of the time. He will just leave in the middle of the work day and leave the crew to do work that HE was suppose to do. The other workers are polite and are generally very nice, but the pay is minimum wage and the managment of the dock is awful."
good,i had a major problem with HR my whole career there. No support what so ever. They never believed me and the HR manager would only listen to her friends there instead of both sides. The HR team made me hate my job while I was there. complete double standards for people there. All depends on your friends to help you get away with everything
good,"Work hard ."
good,"Nice if you are in school, Flexible. "
good,"-long hours standing"
good,"Macy's is a great ""filler"" job. The hours and shifts available start off pretty slow; but, naturally, the longer you work there and the more hours you find yourself to pick up / cover, the more management will notice and most likely schedule you for more hours. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Culture of the company is strong but no input by leadership roles or acknowledgement you are doing a good job. Favorite part about my day was putting a smile on my customer and working with incredible teammates.
good,"When I was working at Macy's i would hardly worked any hours and not enough training or training on the right things. I had to do a lot of on the job learning; by asking other people what to do. And they say they give you stuff and goodies, which is really nothing."
good,"It was a job. I was promised a lot of things, that after I got there found out wasn't really true. The old saying that the grass isn't always greener is true,"
good,"I usually go into work around mid day"
good,"Big box retail.  Low pay, low respect, and standardized performance expectations. Perfect position to gain retail sales experience."
good,"-I have learned how to respect and understand other cultures"
good,The job are I worked at was very competitive. Workers would comepete and steal sales. Hours were flexible but non convinient. Management wasn't very good and fair.
good,"They don't really pay well, there is no structure. It's a good job for high school students but that is about it. No room for advancement."
good,most sales associates need to push to get customers to enroll in their store credit card.  May feel like a telemarketer trying to push someone to get something they do not want.
good,Your customers are the high light of the day working at macys.  for the 6 years I worked for that company they rarely give any perks for the hard work that you do.
good,The place need to improve and organization. People act like their salve and they pay less. Therefore people feel frustrate with the manager.
good,This was my first job ever since a move to this country. I like the dynamic of it but the mangers was nasty and the pay was OK for me because a was not a mom at that point and i was single.
good,The company wants more out of you then they want to give back.  I have never worked for a company that cares so little about their employees.
good,"I work many hours as I can while I was going back to school."
good,"i will help customers find stuff thats they are looking for, and help them put outfits together."
good,"This was a Temporary Seasonal Opportunity where I gained vast experience in providing immediate service to customers, clients, vendors and co-workers.  While I was able to perform some of my usual IT tasks, I was not able to put them into practice for a long-term work experience."
good,my co-workers left all the work to me. I was very unhappy with the lack of hours.
good,"I worked in the Women shoes department so with that being said, I was constantly busy with tending to customer's indecisive want with shoes.  Overall, It was quite enjoyable with knowing the latest trends with shoes and meeting new people."
good,"Macy's is a wonderful company, however I was not pleased with management there neccessarily. My first shift, was on Black Friday morning, by myself in a section, with no knowledge of my products. I was looking for a more personal, management staff. although i was classified as seasonal, no one made an effort to know me as a coworker, let alone remember my name. Otherwise, Macy's is a wonderful company, that truly inspires the holiday spirit and seasonal shopping within their employees and customers."
good,"•	Run all weekly reports including recaps for red box and online only specials"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,If you are a women dont work hear they let the men talk touch you and u will lose your job but they will keep theres.
good,"I really enjoy the work I do at Macy's because I enjoy being around people. I like to meet new people and enjoy helping them."
good,"The job was not compensated by the pay, the management was cruel and misunderstanding. Sent to other areas of work that you were not trained for."
good,"Team environment, management okay, not always on the same sheet of music with employees and managers"
good,"Company offers great training programs, and a good work life balance."
good,"I learned a new POS system, more customer service, cosmetics and fragrance and skin care brands."
good,Unorganized. Schedule changes can be made without any notice. You are expected to open charge accounts in addition to selling merchandise.
good,"A typical day consist of assisting customers with deciding on purchases of merchandise either for a special occasion or for a night out with friends. I can say I've learned that people seem to sometimes just want someone who is attentive  and just have someone that understands their needs and wants. Management was not that reliable when dealing with an issue and was not their when needed at times, which taught me how to deal with issues on my own. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that were not that pleasant at times but in the end they would leave happy. The part I enjoyed about the job was working with others that also enjoyed what they did along with meeting new people."
good,i worked in the women stockroom and helped customers find what they were looking for
good,A typical day would start with myself being in a department that I wasn't sent to. Being the youngest person in the department makes sure that you will be put in the juniors section. I learned that management will ignore you and favor the older employee's because they have been there longer. Management doesn't take any consideration of its younger employees. My co-workers are either old miserable people who complain about everything or snobby young people. The hardest part of the job was being able to try and prove yourself worth when management didn't care. The most enjoyable part was being able to help customers find what they needed to complete their outfit.
good,"This was an easy job, as it were just sales, but the work environment was very difficult."
good,Typical day was opening up the floor and making sure that all inventory/items was taken care of from the night before.  I've learned that customer service skills is very important. My short time there was and experience and a fun time. Meet a lot of people.
good,Responsible work counting and collecting cash at checkout and providing customers with customer service.
good,Its a great job very easy to learn. They don't follow the policies they preach to you during orientation. If your fresh out of high school its a great place to start reason there is nothing but high school drama there
good,go to work. clock in. wait for orders for when and to what section to go to. work until break  get out at 3;30.
good,waiting on customers cashing them out helping them pick out clothing
good,"this was only a part time job, but macys at a whole is a good comp."
good,Need to meet quota in getting credits and sales goal for the week
good,This woman is awful to work for. Self centered and cold. Stay away from the galleria store or Pompano beach store. Do yourself a huge favor! Trust me... she will make you quit or get you fired for stupid reasons if you don't accommodate HER schedule. Worst manager I ever worker for in my 30 years of working! Before her it was great to work there! Great people and alot of smiling faces. Great job for extra cash during the holidays!
good,"My typical day at work starts at 9:00am, my job is to go there and start fixing the cases, making sure that the displays look presentable and attractive, not only to me, but to our consumers as well. I also make sure that the newness is out in the case at all times. It is important to have a focal point in every single case, which I absolutely enjoy. Management is fairly good at Macy's. Just like any other job- if you follow the rules and regulations of the store, the managers love you, if not, then they do not really think highly of you. The hardest part of the job, I have to admit is to stand on feet for 8 hours and last but not least, having awesome people to work with is definitely one of the characteristics of my job. They are like my second family and I enjoy working with them."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Good learning experience on how to drive business. Company culture is unstable because the company changes its mind every month on how it wants to drive business within its stores. Store managers are two faced with their staff. The corporate teams don't really care about anybody but themselves.
good,"I met alot of people working there ,but unfortnatlly I was laid off after the hoilday's and did not get any unemployment ,and also the department that I worked in did not have a liable manger,and at the end the manger that came on bord was not worthy of haveing did not no nothing about anything ,not nothing how to work the reigester answer customers etc....And I recently appled again went for an interview and did not get a job.When I worked there I met my goals."
good,Macy's inc is a fun and busy place to work.
good,The pay is too small. The best thing is that it was close to my house. They promised me a full-time position but when the season ended they told me that my time is ended. So disappointing.
good,"It isn't hard and it's easy to catch on despite the little training that they give you. For the most part, there's always a task at hand for me to do. Management isn't all that great but the diversity of the workplace is beautiful. Although the hardest part of working there is management, the overall atmosphere is welcoming. My co-workers and clients make me look forward to working each shift."
good,Pressure to be a super star and expectation to excel on all levels yet seldom ever given any consitant work shifts due to budget constraints. Unrealistic expectations all around and very low wages. No benefits for the majority.
good,Supervisors are supportive and work with you on hours and assignments. The job requires a lot of energy and enthusiasm and a positive attitude toward  people.
good,Management is poor. Training is poor. Pay is poor. But the ppl you meet and the customers made it fun. They are very diverse! I liked that . If you don’t mind a low pay go for it .
good,typical day at work is very slow.  Employees learn a lot because of the extensive training provided(online) and its during work hours.  Workplace culture I would say everyone participates in events and in dressing up.  Hardest part about the job is putting up with rude managers that don't provide support but instead an attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job is working at Macys and the employee discount
good,"I loved my clients but the environment was tense, most of my coworkers were stuck up. They even relocated me an hour from my house because I didn't ""fit in"" with the other girls there. I originally worked at the Boardman Ohio location and was transferred to the Niles location. Management was terrible, extremely judgmental. Will never work there again!"
good,"No work life balance and district team treats you like your at the bottom "
good,Macy's has an easy scheduling tool. It's computerised so management stays out if your way for the most part. There is freedom to change days off and secure more hours by negotiating with other associates. Commission pay  is very low. So that's a down side  . The work is generally fairly easy depending on your location.
good,"Temporary job for the Holidays. Enjoyed assisting guest, and co-workers. The hours were not flexible, and the store was not run efficiently. As it was my first job in America, it provided me a different experience."
good,"I've worked for Macy's for a total of 12yrs in different cities and stores with all types of management and employees. My last taste of Macy's was in El Paso, TX Cielo Vista, The management was lacking professionalism and leadership. Issues were brought up and nothing was done. Ideas were given and nobody listened. Work was produced and not appreciated. Commitment and loyalty was displayed but it was dismissed. These people think they know it all yet ask for feedback and ideas and they don't even entertain them or enforce them. Sad Management."
good,"Very poorly managed, managers dont know what they're doing half the time and are only put in management positions when theres no other options. Nobody moves up within the company, they usually hire from outside sources. They pick and choose their favorite employees."
good,"Typical day consists of assisting customer via checkout and helping find requested items. Shifts for full time are 7 hours, 5 days a week. Rarely get weekends off."
good,I hated what they did to fire me. The management does not care about the employees. The rules only apply to ones they dislike. They have a polices  that are in place but never apply.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Daily completion between team member's to make high sales goal. always fun for the most part. very energetic atmosphere."
good,"I worked here for a short amount of time, around the holidays. Rarely seen the managers, the environment was very slow to fast paced. I didn’t get to work with, very friendly people. They let me know last min, if I wanted to stay after the holidays I could. But when The manager finally told me about it, it was too late."
good,"Poor management, high drama.  Light harassment endured by all workers.  Poor hours awful flexibility.  Good for a young person with flexible hours and low needs"
good,"When I quit, it wasn't voluntarily and another manager quit the same day to make a statement.  A newer fellow co-worker stole my customer and quit on her current customer to take my credit app.  We needed to get those to keep the job.  Even after telling the store manager this, she was rewarded and I was blamed for not getting the credit be app.  The manager was transferred a week later."
good,"I was at the call center, not stores, so this is more aimed at the environment there. What a dreadful place. Lots of people in management who were given their jobs to fill quotas, not because they earned them through hard work. Dirty building, old & grey. Took way too long to earn any health or PTO benefits. Wretched. Absolutely wretched. The only upside was the generous pay."
good,"Managment turn around is very fast and with such a fast managerial turn over, Associates and Support Staff has less opportunity to have a clear understanding and relatability in terms of process, compliance, customer care and ultimately customer and employee curated and authentic advocacy. If an employee sole job duty is registering, managerial radar is limited. #Message"
good,Never organized. Never helping out or being happy. Always changing in staff and never really training. Just putting you out there and hoping for the best
good,I have worked for Macy’s for over 10 years and I still get paid 11 dollars. You work so hard to give the best customer experience and yet nothing. And new hires get paid more that people who have worked with the company for a long time.
good,"They don't respect employee , treat them fair , don't treat people like family . They don't work as a team . Every one there is so rude . If you are not a fast learner this job is not for you ."
good,Great for high school and college and a second job. Only good if you’re in a full time management position within the company. The people aren’t nice.
good,"It was an upgrade from my previous job but the management was lacking in my location. Apart from the poor management, I enjoyed the job. It was a fast paced work environment."
good,"Management acts like they don’t see a lot of the inappropriate things going on in different departments, supervisors and employees who are friends should not be allowed to work in the same department together. They worry about the wrong things like my jacket having a hood but don’t make their employees do their jobs. They want us to dress casual/look professional but play the worse selection of inappropriate music for the work place this place is a joke if you ask me. Managers try too hard to put up a front about the store but it’s a total mess, a few of the old people that have been working in this department need to be fired and definitely not be allowed to work in customer service, they are also Extremely rude to customers, grown women acting like children"
good,Grouping in the morning and discussed what we needed to accomplish for that day. We performed stretches and that actually helped. Just doing the same thing didn’t cut it for me.
good,"Dont want to talk about. May confusion a new person who is seeking employment and just needs a job.  If you can work without a game plan, this is the place for you."
good,"Macy’s is a good first job or retirement job to have. Schedule is flexible and employees can pick up extra shifts in other departments. It’s only min wage though and you earn one dollar for every Macy’s credit card application. Must open 3 to 5 credit cards weekly. It can get very busy as a cashier, plus you must clean out fitting rooms every 30 min since customers trash the dressing rooms and throw the clothes all over and on the floor and leave for employees to pick up! You will have huge racks of clothes to put back on the selling floor. Management does not value their employees and will give you very little recognition. Expect only a 25 cent increase on your annual reviews. All employees complain about the annual increases since the store makes billions of dollars."
good,"Enjoyed the job and employees. The hours were not often enough and we were always under staffed. Manager of the store was the worst thing about the job she was very unprofessional. Passive aggressive and very rude, cold and insensitive to employees."
good,"Yes I was seasonal, but they changed what department I was in everyday"
good,"Nobody listens to you unless you’re continuously on top of them about it. Has money but doesn’t upgrade anything. Most management team is hired from the outside. Has been a while since someone has gotten a promotion. When they promote you, they try to pay you as little as possible. Expect you to do everything with little pay and give you no recognition. Good thing, a lot of people are nice for the most part and you get to swap shifts and/or advertise them through a portal online with your co-workers. Receive gratis depending on what department you work in. Be the first to know about any special sales going on."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I been here for almost 4 years....although I am trying to leave before turning 4. It's become such an awful routine, nothing ever changes, pay is mediocre for all that you do. It takes a toll on your body since there's a lot of walking and standing for really long periods of time! (12hrs in my case). If you start working here make sure you know what you're getting into, specially if you work the night shift. Nothing against my coworkers, we all came to do the job, but management doesn't make the job worth it. You are already exhausted when starting your shift. I would suggest you staying in the warehouse for a year or a year and a half, after that you gotta apply somewhere else, this place will take all your motivation away."
good,The hiring process was very quick and then you send on your own to work.  The  people are very nice and they have shifts available to pick online thru there system.
good,Era un trabajo part time. Era divertido y agradable
good,"Seasonal work could have turned into more permanent... Management during Holidays found nothing to find fault with Fulfillment Center Sales Positions... However, After Inventory, and release of temporary workers, took several weeks to determine whether one was or was not hired... Cuts and minimum staffing led to disarray in packaging and having items available. Although other permanent positions were open and desire for training was expressed... Found self 'Laid-Off' and the store is continuing to look for new workers rather than RETRAIN an EXISTING Average employee who NEVER gave any reason for problem. Another place with severe Management DRAIN and INEXPERIENCE."
good,Must have full time and paid sick days vacation days .no advancement. need better organization for management level. upper management expectations are unreal in this environment. People shop online more and malls are a dying breed.
good,Management or top brass is ineffective when it comes to people and technology you are doing tasks at times that are above your pay grade and in the end after all the hard work ...you and your team are let go not b/c of performance or anything else other than outsourcing you for cheaper way to go Macy's!
good,i was treated as if I were a contractor or temp. I went there on my first day they did not know I was even hired. People dressed in the wrong dress code. No one was around when they needed anything. I had to do more work then stated. Did not work with a team.  I only could tough Macys Brands. I got breaks on time. Bad management  allowed other employees to email Bakersfield was denied access to emails and communication.. The HR Manager had an illegal meeting without my manager. I took this up with the Labor board and EEOC and filed two massive complaints that were taken to court in 2017. I resigned and was told to get a federal attorney and sue for discrimination.
good,"Working at Macy's call center was very stressful. The culture changed from quality of service to quantity/speed of service.  Where before the mantra was 1 call resolution meaning addressing the customers issue and resolving it in one call changed to speed and numbers calls per hour regardless of resolving the customers issues. "
good,A job is a job is a job and if you need one its a job but unless you're prepared to stand on your feet for 10 hours straight and throw big boxes and bag this isn't the job for you
good,I learned basic skills like how to work the cash register. I also learned how to communicate and handle customers. It was a simple job with a simple task. Just another retail job.
good,it was an ok place. I enjoyed the customer interactions and the job itself was enjoyable...but the management was very strict and a lot of the goals were unrealistic.
good,"Overall my location in Washington, DC Metro Center location was very slow. Management had nothing to do all day but badger employees on getting credit cards fro the company and hound you like a dog about daily goals and averages from the previous year. scheduling was flexible and working in other departments for extra hours was beneficial, however, the pay was not that great."
good,Being a sales associate is very fun when you deal with different people from different ethnicities  and cultures. But the gold they want you to reach is not reachable so it becomes a really stressful .
good,"I love working at macys but felt I was mistreated sometimes especially when it came to hours "
good,"good coworkers, good customers, great locations, not much in communicating with part-timers. super flexible, good hours, offers good sales for customers."
good,Loved helping people. The Macys culture constantly pushed more sales of product rather than the overall happiness of the customer experience. Very structured place to work and if ou didnt fit into the culture you were cast aside.
good,Macy's does not review salaries of employees when it comes to hire.  They hire new associates at more or the same as employees who have been there for many years.   This I think is an unfair hiring practice.
good,"i would begin at 7:30 am. most days it was pretty constant on what the first two hours of the day contained. for example, Wednesdays were unit block days where we would have to stand on register counters and change images above cosmetics and fragrances. then proceed to change door signs depending on the sales going on during the week . but after those two hours we didn't always know what we were going to do the rest of the day. sometimes i would be painting a wall for a new display or folding books into origami to hang from ceiling in the Lucky Brand department. other days consisted of  loosely given instructions on how the tape on the floor around a display must be placed,  and if it was not done correctly there was a lecture and redoing to follow, even though the instructions did not specify how it should be done. and other days it was following the Visual Manager pushing old, rundown carts with 10 foot 50 pound picture frames and two full sized adult mannequins for the display while they walked peacefully with a small basket in hand.  manager was very nice and sweet but also wasn't really good at giving instructions or take the initiative."
good,"The benefits are sub par, very high deductible. Some organizational changes removed what made the job good, and worth the lack of benefits. There is a vast inconsistency in rules, and the enforcement of such.  The computer systems are the worst programs I have used in my life."
good,"Corporate continues to cut staffing without adjusting expectations, requiring more and more from the associates, outside of job description and without compensation"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I took care of the INC section, I ran customers up, I cleaned dressing rooms, opened Macy Accounts, I also worked every holiday and was on my feet for a very long time. I liked helping customers out and my co workers."
good,I was able to dictate my own hours.however my immediate supervisor rarely held their word to be at my store to support me as I was the only detective for that store.
good,Macy’s is restructuring still so still have some growing to do. I will say the difference in night and day shift is just that. Night/day. Everything that’s done by Macy’s is catered to the day employees. We’ve had so many leads and managers and directors and honestly they must have a lot on their plate cause we never see them. The employee is just that anymore just a spot to fill and not a human being. They were suppose to focus on us having a home / work/ life balance but I have yet to see that happen. They are making every aspect of our job more difficult than it needs to be.  We have lost so many amazing people here lately and I am sure I’ll be next. Some of us would like to live a life. They will hire in a bunch of new people at a higher rate giving them the weekends they refuse us. The new people quit and the cycle keeps going. I would think they would want to know what would make us happy or feel appreciated? In reality they just want to know when you turn in your 2 week notice
good,"Macy's is not a Mom and Pop store where the owner/management support your side if a customer is being difficult."
good,"Hardest part of the job would have to be continuously folding the clothing right after a customer picks it up, just to see if it's there size or not. But overall very fast paced and love the discounts."
good,"I have had an okay experience with Macy's. But at the end of the day, they don't pay enough to keep anyone and expect you to give beyond what you can. If you want to grow with a company, this may not be it for you."
good,"working there was alright, the management was not something to be"
good,Company is not what it used to be. Morals is severely lacking.  Company is targeting older workers and removing them from positions by making it difficult in staying.
good,From the customers to the co workers it was a little hectic during the time i was there which was seasonal around thanksgiving and black friday. Hopefully it has calmed down a substantial amount.
good,Its a great place to work and I loved it and I will recommend to anyone the people r wonderful and the customers r great the prices and  Community  is great need more food places and update bathrooms and the smell sometimes is bad and it’s cold most of the time
good,"If you want a life, apply elsewhere. I wouldn't recommend this employer. You are at the mercy of the schedule provided and you have little input. Your holidays will be working"
good,"Enjoyable environment, fast paced, the day goes by very quick,"
good,Very Sales driven.  Seemed focus was more on sales dollars  and credit card applications than on customer services and building long term relationships with customers.
good,"Macys was a nice place to work..until they told you that they saw potential in you and then promoted you. Just to let you go because you have only been there for ""X"" amount of time."
good,Macys can be very stressful with lots of micromanaging.Often times managers instructions will conflict with each others.Job security is not stable as district closes stores that do not meet consistent sales goald
good,High pace environment and and high expectations of minimum wage. Management didn't seem to have much experience nor sympathy for those on the sales floor.
good,"They lie to you about what your really allowed or not allowed to do"
good,"I first worked for Benefit Cosmetics for 3 years and taught me so much! Took me out of my comfort zone, challenge me to my limits, gave me my foot in the door for Cosmetics. After being with Benefit for 3 years I worked for Lancôme Cosmetics for 2 years and then Impulse Cosmetics for 9 months."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I worked for Macy's seasonally. It paid well for what it was. The hours were pretty rough, I worked day in and day out... But if you're able to put in that time you can make good money. We received good break times and lunches. Seasonal was wonderful but everything went bad after that. I had to sit in on too many meetings where we were instructed to lie to and manipulate customer under the guise of it being a ""disservice"" to the customers to not. Lies involving Macy's cards, credit cards, sales, etc."
good,management is non compliant with arbitration and work disputes.  people are repeatedly passed over for opportunities if you are over the age of 30....
good,"Good pay for holiday work, you'll get weekly pay. This company does not honor special scheduling request for religious observation etc. Everyone MUST work weekends, no exceptions. Otherwise I would recommend it for those seeking pt work."
good,Good place to start in makeup pay sucked. The counter I worked at never had product. hours were good. The people were friendly that worked there. I didn't like pushing the Macys card most people had one
good,Macy's is a decent place to work. There are many issues with trying to give the customers the best experience and being very low on stock. There is low staffing and high expectations on the sales floor.
good,"It was so exciting during peak hours. I liked the customers and found selling enjoyable. I liked the atmosphere, piped-in music, happy customers or customers who could be made happy!"
good,"It was a seasonal job for the holidays so the pay was awful for an exorbitant amount of work during their busiest time of year."
good,"Would not recommend if you are thinking of learning technology and surveying for future IT career (next 5 years). You can learn retail business but again this is traditional model. This is more for easy going people. Lot of management personals for example, solution specialist does project management instead of providing solutions, Architect does project management instead of architecture. Dev Lead does management, Offshore coordinator does management, PM does minutes of meeting, Manager does management. Director involves manages small projects in bigger scale. Heavy offshore for ineffective work. If you consider joining and growing your tech skills, consider SFO office. There are much matured in process and technology."
good,"Very slow at times, sometimes you get sent home because there isn't a lot of work, management was rude, very cultured work place, hardest part is standing on your feet a lot, most enjoyable part was the flexible hours, temporary employees do not get holiday pay, over worked and under payed"
good,"Good job if you are looking for a second job to add some extra funds, but incredibly poor if you're hoping to pay the bills, even just a phone bill and cable."
good,A lot of time offered off so great during slow days for student's. Management is too stressed to care about your needs or concern's. It is not a strict environment.
good,During the holiday season is the worst time to work for their company.  Macys managers take advantage of their employers and hire you for lowest minimum wage.
good,"The younger coworkers where the nicest and kindest souls there was working there but the older coworkers where always out to steal your sales and make you look bad so they can thrive. There was so much drama and stuff that was going on it made my head spin. Not to mention almost none of the management was on the same page and also at each other throats."
good,"It's an okay store to work for and all but the management was really poor, because of the town I worked in, the atmosphere was a lot like high school and the employees and managers were very immature."
good,I just worked there as a sale associate for a few months during the christmas holiday. It was easy work cashiering and interacting with people. I left before the holiday was over due to another more promising job opportunity. They were very understanding and sent me off with best wishes and regards. Only place I received a going away present and best regards from.
good,It's very unprofessional.  Manager's are childish and very non-understanding ! I personally dislike how unorganized everyone is. I wish everyone would communicate better and the managers weren't so stuck up.
good,"The work conditions are pretty good, the management is not super organized. Things tend to be chaotic and unorganized. possibly because it is a temporary or seasonal job."
good,A typical day at work starts off with servicing the customers that come up to you and cashing them out at the register. I learned how to help others and give great customer service. The most enjoyable part of  the job is knowing that the customer is leaving satisfied and with a smile on their faces because they found all the items that they needed.
good,The Macys i work at in Oregon was crazy. The store manager was awful and we were so happy when she left. She didn't know how to take care of customers and most customers didn't even like her. the go backs were usually crazy all the time. Its a good first job but thats it.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A day at macy's lots of walking ,store is busy then the hours they give ,never a person in each department always short ,one person cant do it ,managers don't help nor stand up for they people then when something happen you question by all ,then the part time ppl think they are only customer service reps  don't feel like they need to work hard since they schedule is only 4 hours ! The whole store is just a mess ,very poor management reps don't feel like they have they back ,they need to spend more time on the floor and less time sitting down in the office watching the reps .Never seen so many reps looking for another job big turn over ,they closed the wrong store ! Lakeside is not a great place to work its us and them ,management is not with they reps !!!!!!!!!!!! So much cut throat stuff is going on in the store ..."
good,To me the management is young adults with a title under their name thinking they are powerful. At the store I'm working at no one pulls their weight. I work extremely hard while others stand around only wanting to be on the register. I wish the breaks were more than what they are since you are standing on your feet so much. I haven't run into any rude customers as of yet but like me the coupons are very confusing. The store is very short staffed. It's sad that customers complain about how uncomfortable the temperature is in the store and they do nothing at all about it. They want you to get people to sign up for credit but most customers have a card already....nearly impossible.
good,"This was a poor job, while yes you were given at least 25 hours, the pay was poor for the amount of work required for a sales associate. Management was very poor and needs a training course asap, they were never there for their employees when it came to a disgruntled customer berating us (sales associate) just to get a discount on anything. The customer is always right was the managers moto, even when customers treated us poorly. The store is always a mess, even when we clean and tend to customers as best as we can. The people you work with are pretty nice but sometimes, some of the girls can be rude and start drama with anyone so that's a downside."
good,I didn't not like my job at maces. the management was horrible. the other associated were always rude and mean. nobody was about team work. i would not recommend anyone to work there.
good,"Not a place I would recommend to someone even if it's there first job. Management isn't properly trained to effectively and proficiently run a day to day shift, nor treat there staff with respect."
good,"Macys is a great place to build relationships with diverse clients. However the store hours were long, the store was open until 9pm and it was very difficult to advance within the store."
good,"I found that as a retailer, Macy's is a great place to shop, but as a dedicated employee, not so much. They like most retailers, require long, hard hours of work for as little pay as they can get away with."
good,"Standing on your feet for hours at a time without any breaks ( except lunch) can wreck havoc on your feet &back.Most customers are rude & demanding. If you want to move up it is impossible unless like management you are uneducated and a drone."
good,"The sale associate can be very rude to the customers.  Managers almost have no idea what happens on the floor. Employees disappear for long time without anybody noticing.  Have seen several employees working only 4 hours during an eight hours shift. "
good,convenient work time. 5am-10am. Being able to work while customers are not in the store. Generally working alone to get merchandise moved quicker. Good work environment
good,No matter how hard you work the managers don't appreciate it unless you are their favorite people (who are really lazy.) Also when the department has issues with bulling nothing happens to the person doing it.
good,"My overall experience was great to continue to learn any and all trades of Fashion business, I am most grateful for the experience. I was not able to fully Overall I was excited to be in a fashion related envirornment."
good,I worked at macy's from 2014-2016. I was a sale associate in the fashion jewelry department however there was no commission at the time i was employed there. Some days were better than others. most of the sales were on or around holidays. Standing job with no sitting.
good,"I enjoyed the customers that came into Macy's. From working at Macy's, I learned the customers different way of life styles. Management could have definitely been better. Also, Macy's did not pay well especially when they wanted the associates to stay until midnight during holiday season."
good,Better then other retail places to work but hours are scarce during non holiday times bat decent pay for the job and good for a first job
good,"It is an early start in the morning and you work behind the scenes. There is not really direct contact with actual customers. During the season changes, it can get pretty busy with the new merchandise coming in so there is over time. Or some days with no work."
good,The most enjoyable part while working at Macys was the interaction with the customers. my customer made it all worth it.
good,There health benefits are ok. Pay is not good. Management mainly treats employees like kids. Very high pressure opening accounts even can loose the job over it.
good,"the managers are relentless on the workers and make up policies that best suite them at that time. The company however is a good one to work for, if your managers are good!"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,fun job but it is hard to keep up with sales goals when they do not give you the hours that you need. The store itself is very micromanaged and there is always more than one person telling me what to do
good,"Easy job yet bad management. Every shift employee required to make sure cash wrap is clean. Also, clean out the fitting rooms. Constantly recovering the floor and helping customers."
good,"I guess its okay if you can work everyday so you can get benefits and stuff but if you miss a day you just have to be glad you get a pay check.the day goes by when your keeping busy but it can drag if its slow or a small truck but  so far it been a few trucks a week to give us some work.the people are ok to work with ,they are friendly.the taking the carts to different departments can be a bear but I could be w0rking int the snow. if you can work all week you can really appreciate a good pay check when possible."
good,"I'm big on working but when it comes to competing all the time it just isn't for me.this job really tires you out, i think its only meant for single people with little to no life but that's just my opinion"
good,"It was great at first but the closer it got to midterms and the closer it got to the holiday season, my accommodations were cut short. I quit after my manager said she was tired of my excuses. I was left with the choice of go to work from 5-11am and miss my 8am midterm or fail. I didn't show up"
good,"This was a part-commission job in men's suits and shoes. It was a pretty good place to work at, though the sales goals could be unreachable by the associates, given our location."
good,Good place to work at. For a short period of time. HR department personnel was pleasant but wouldn't get back to you on a timely manner. If you want to grow with in the company this is not the company. its who you know not what you know.
good,"Co-workers are too competitive and it doesn't help with relationships an team work on the floor."
good,Wouldn't go back if asked. Poor leadership and doesn't know what one hand is doing regarding the next. Lots of hard work for not a whole lot of pay
good,"typical dy starts arund 5 am  you go in  get your daily map out, then proceded to marking penny stock down, to sales, and full blown sales."
good,Good Work environment but horrible management who only care about their own accomplishments instead of the team goals.
good,"The pay is minimum wage, and trying to advance is almost impossible. It is a job where you do not need technical skills, and unless you are willing to work almost 70 hours a week you will not be able to afford anything. The benefits are pretty much non-existant."
good,Doing security for macy's was an ok job except for when you have very rude people that come into the company and try to get disrespectful with you.
good,"Typical day at work would consist of loading and unloading trucks. We would also process the merchandise from the trucks so it could be placed on the sales floor. The work itself was very easy and nothing was too hard to learn. However, management pushes you to finish at a certain time that might not be realistic. This situation may differ across different Macy's "
good,I would never go back to work there. I was there almost a year with promises of full time and never got it. Management has no clue how to do anything. terrible place to work.
good,"In the beginning it was a nice experience I just felt more opportunities wasn't given enough to employees. Managers really wasn't understanding to college students,depending on their schedules and employees had to fight for hours. The compensation was very satisfying as well either. Overall it was just a retail and customer service experience for people who are looking to build their resume."
good,"Job security, solid company. Hours vary based on company needs. Low compensation. Good company discounts for employees"
good,typical work day would include low coverage and standing at the register all day. once you have time to move from the register you would find yourself walking into a fitting room filled with clothing. You could call a manager to help but they probably wont. I learned how to deal with very rude consumers but it pays off now because you will learn to smile at even the rudest things people say.my co workers were helpful when they wanted to be and everything is a competition with management.
good,"Typical day at work changes, one day super busy and others are slow. Learned to make all drinks known at Starbucks. Management was bad, favoritism was one of the main keys here. Hardest would have been being the new employee, due to that co-workers did not agree nor were as friendly."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"often short staffed, min wage, impossible  time is expected, you get little training , it is a good first job. leaves you tired and with little time for other things"
good,"As a starter job, it opened my eyes to dealing one on one with customers and people in the business world. Scheduling was erratic, especially on Black Friday and afterwards, however it was great while in school."
good,"I worked as the Chanel manager at Macy's and it was not a pleasant experience.  Macy's expects their managers to be available to work any of the open store hours on less than a days notice.  They also have unrealistic sales goals while giving the minimum of corporate back up and tools to the store level employees.  The biggest problem is that they are more concerned about getting customers to sign up for their credit card (whether they are approved or not) then about actual customer service and sales.  This is due to the kick back that the company receives for passing all of this valuable customer information on to American Express, the company that  runs Macy's credit card division.  Another problem, specific to the cosmetic department is that that these employees work equally for their cosmetic company (in my case Chanel) and for Macy's.  The parent cosmetic company covers 50% of each employee's pay at their counter, but when it comes down to the cosmetic company's rules of conduct and sale vs. Macy's, Macy's demands that their's be fallowed.  As a manager I was backed up by Chanel when I needed to over ride Macy's on policy but other managers did not have such backup from their regional directors and are in a constant battle between corporate and Macy's."
good,It was not a very well managed store very political place to work. Employees where friendly but thats about the only good thing about working there.
good,company sucks and is down sizing and there is no room for improvement at all. I would NEVER work there again even if I had too.
good,Fair wok place. Always busy and not enough time for breaks. Always walking around and always on your feet. They give discounts but only 10% and not enough hours
good,"When I was first hired at Macy's back at their Baltimore, MD location, it was a fun and great place to work. I enjoyed going to work and being around my co-workers and even my managers. They made coming to work everyday fun. But when I decided to relocate for a change of scenery, I relocated to the Macy's in Marlow Heights, MD. This location was the complete opposite of what I experienced at the Baltimore location. Some of the workers weren't friendly, management didn't want to work half the time, it was just an unpleasant experience, but I stuck it out. I stuck it out long enough to be able to enroll into school, when that happened I informed them that my schedule would have to change, I would be working a lot of evenings because I went to school during the day. It went well until it was time for me to start my externship for school. When I was informed that my externship was going to start in October, I informed my manager in June of the changes that would happen. I would basically have to work just the weekends. He was informed and did nothing about it. So I was basically, set up to fail. There were days that I would be late to work due to trying to get from one job to another while on public transportation, which was rather challenging. Which is why I had asked for a schedule change because I knew that obstacles like that would occur. Well nothing was done, and that resulted in me being terminated due to my lateness."
good,I did not cear for it at all the hrswere long and they pussed you to get # on things that you realy did not have time to get thoes kins of #
good,Fun workplace with supportive management. The most enjoyable part the job is to interact with customers and help them find the right item for an unbeatable price with high standard of job ethics.
good,"Messy environment, nothing is organized or looks presentable. Associates hardly ever do their entire job which includes recovery. Macy's main goals are to get credits, and sales, not to help out their customers. Managers are hardly ever managing, and also focus on sale goals and credits, they hardly ever focus on the sales support part or atleast controlling the sales support side of the business. Overall the Macys at Hildago needs improvement, maybe even a whole new management team. Hardest part of the job is getting sales associates and sales support team to cooperate and work diligently with each other without problems and the most enjoyable job is helping the customers find the products they need."
good,No benefits for me and I am one of the hardest workers in the building. Do not like the unfair treatment and poor communication.
good,It was a good opportunity to get customer service experience. The pay was very low especially for a multi-million dollar company. There were not many opportunities to be promoted to higher positions.
good,"Opening at macy's there was a few rules seat and listen to a review of our sales from the day before. Then its off to the floor where I know open 3 registers try and clean as much as possible before customers start to storm in. Start dealing with different types of customers, angry and happy, trying to leave every customer satisfy. While mangers are constantly moving me and other associates to different areas in which I am not to familiar with. The hardest part of a busy day at work is trying to get off the floor for lunch."
good,"some days slow some days fun some days is difficult to cope, some demands need to be done, no matter what, sometimes, you put hard in yourself without be noticeable,"
good,A lucrative work experience for those individuals interested in fashion and customer service. Sometime out of the day you become a personal shopper for someone. Your able to create a fusion or your taste and customers sense of style in piece of clothing or complete outfit.
good,"I did a lot of work but never felt like an employee but more like a slave. Managers always cared about customers and even if the customer was rude to us, the managers would not take our side if the error wasn't from our side. My coworkers always stole my sale and never liked the environment."
good,"not enough hours scheduled per week for part time positions, little room for advancement. good employee discounts.fast pace work very busy workplace."
good,My day usually consists of putting clothes away and helping customers. To be honest i knew everything i need to do so nothing really learned. The managers are all about the money and themselves. They don't care a lot about their employees. Most of our co-workers are pretty nice to each other. The hardest part of my job is when nobody was there the day before and left for you is a huge mess. Enjoyable part is you are basically on your own.
good,Hired for seasonal help for christmas season but was not given any guidance or assistance to perform daily tasks or service customers beyond the brief videos and readings shown during the on-boarding
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Be at work anywhere from 3am to 6am depending on sale. Scan luggage into system using RFID scanner. Take inventory of scanned luggage and then supplement where needed. Assist other departments in need when finished. Wash, Rinse, Repeat."
good,"Spent the majority of my time on the sales floor assisting customers, and maintaining the store's organization. During busy days, I'd split half my time between the sales floor, and working the register. I was able to run the entire floor on my own, (Assisting customers and running the register) on the night before christmas eve with out a problem. The best part about working at Macy's, was that I had the opportunity to choose my hours."
good,"I didn't appreciate the company not caring about the employees Work/ Life balance, especially around Christmas time, the Holiday Season started on Black Friday. I also believe that at least 70% of management was very inconsiderate. However, I did have a very good relationship with my co-workers, and I had a very good clientele. I really enjoyed assisting my regular customers."
good,Being treated unfairly is apart of life but that is the biggest problem I have seen at Macy's from Management. Customers and co workers are not a problem.
good,"As stated above. the whole store seemed to to be understaffed, as is common in retail. Macy's did have people come in for recovery during the holiday season. So this was a plus. There was little training for the associates."
good,"Macy's was job that I had while I was completing my Masters Degree in Business. I was tasked with maintaining fixtures, engaging customers, and ringing up sales and returns. The management at Macy's was very nice and understanding of the stress of retail. They certainly made my job easier. My co-workers were the best part of my job. I became friends with many of them. Taking abuse from angry customers (especially for things that were out of your control) was the worst part of this job. It does happen in most retail jobs I would imagine."
good,"Work hard for very little pay.  A good job for someone in college, or not very many bills.  Hard to move up or get management role."
good,Very productive company. An organized company with much organization amongst staff and scheduling. High activity through the day as well as holiday. Very large company with many different oppertunities to grow and expand.
good,"By working at Macy's I was able to built my costumer base, working under the Esttee Lauder companies has been a great experience. I will continue to use and recommend the products. I was able to lear more about different cosmetic lines and become and expert in skin."
good,"My experience working at Macy's is very productive.  I work all day assisting customers and clients, making sure that they have the merchandise or product they are looking for.  I give the customers and clients information on the special days they should shop and save on their merchandise and products."
good,"meet great people but no education, coaching. Was not a happy place to work ."
good,"I got hired right after my interview. I was so happy because I really needed a job, that 9.25 an hour sounded so good. and because they offered a flex schedule which is why I took the job because I have a young son and needed a job that let me work when i wanted and manage to be a parent t my son. My orientation consisted of a 1 in a half day of computer training which did not help at all because the program was outdated half the stuff I learned about I did not use on the actual sales floor (e.g clothing alterations). On my first day of work my co-workers in the petite department was so helpful & understanding weeks later I would be up shifts in different departments I really did not like how the older women who who's been working there for 20 years & plus did not treat me with the same respect I treated them. One woman kept mispronouncing my name on purpose. Also a lot of theft is going on in the store - I would always put censos on the clothes but I was told not to do that because I was taking up too much time :(...While working on go backs I would always find ripped off tags and have to make new ones because customers would switch the tags on a pricer item to a less pricey item. Also customers would come into the store to return an item and the tags did not even match =( The customers are not nice. I try to follow the store policy especially on returns but when a customer wined and complained my manager would always tell me to do what they are asking :( . . . When a customer returns an item that has obviously been worn we're still suppose to accept the item no question asked...."
good,I was not told the truth about my job hours. I was put on the job as part-time but I was working only 2-4 hours a week. I was miss treated by staff members and over looked. I would never work for Macy's again.
good,"Be prepared to take orders over phone in a noisy environment and to deal politely with irritable customers. The tasks themselves are not that difficult; the most difficult part is in dealing with people without getting their feelings hurt, or your own."
good,"While the job was not hard and it was easy to take pride in such a nice store location, the management was was so heavy handed and the sales goals unrealistic."
good,"Selling womens shoe, cleaning showroom floor learned shoe warehouse and register, management was unclear (did not know who my boss was) enjyed working 1on1 with public."
good,"A typical day at work involves assisting customers with their purchases at the cash register. Taking returns and payments. Making sure the dressing rooms and displays are clean and neat. My co-workers are extremely helpful, as this is the first job I've had in retail. The hardest part of the job is having to work a LOT of weekends. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers, and interacting with my co-workers."
good,"Besides not having work/life balance (at the Macy's I worked at)* my store manager was way too quick to belittle many of the Executives that worked for him even in front of our peers. He had absolutely no respect for his Executives. Also, little (one day) training was given. The women that had been working there gossiped most of the time which is unprofessional, yet the assistant manager and store manager were ""ok"" with it since they were the ones inquiring the gossip."
good,management sucks. they only care about the compnay. you do so much work and not paid enough but thats retail. and lot of lazy ppl
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I loved working with the customers and I also loved working with clothing and all the different pieces of clothing.
good,My coworkers aren't very friendly but the customers are. The managers are extremely happy people and a typical day on the job is mainly laid back if you aren't the only associate at the register.
good,"My work day started from 4 in the morning to prepare the store and get everything ready for the customers. I learned a lot about what goes behind the scenes and how much pressure employees are under to get everything ready. Every day was different than the other. I worked with different managers and different spots in the store. Everyone had his/her own way of getting things together. I did not have a certain co-workers, every day there were someone new. The hardest thing was too many things need to be done in little time. The enjoyable part was the experience of a new field and get to know how everything get done."
good,"clean the area, make sure everything is folded, then work as a cashier. I learned how to How to multitask. Management is not good, they do favoritism and they do not take you under consideration. co-workers were great. the hardest is cleaning the whole area, when all the customers leave a mess. the most enjoyable is leaving and going home"
good,Never a dull moment.  Fun to help customers and drive sales.  Hardest part was when there were many customers and few co-workers.
good,having to work some nights till 10pm is a little late.  Standing on your feet for 6 hours straight is sometimes hard to do.  Very enjoyable getting to meet people.
good,"Depending on the shift, I would sign in and obtain my tricoder for scanning boxes and looking up information throughout the day. I would clean and organize on the sales floor and engage customers. Retrieving boxes from the stock shelves upon request and restocking was most of the activity between ringing out customers and cleaning during slow periods."
good,"Like to work as supervisor, services specialist here but did not like the management"
good,"Lots of work, little pay, very inconsistent work schedule, some enjoyable co-workers, management too busy to address issues"
good,The work place is a good experience to obtain knowledge of other people from different locations around the world.
good,Reducing shortage and fighting crime. Growing retail chain throughout the US.
good,"If you like fashion and working with people, this would be a good place to work for the holidays."
good,This was a good place to work and I enjoyed the employee discounts as well as the free lunch on certain days
good,The managers were very unprofessional on how they handle things.
good,Working at Macy's is like any other retail job. It is a large department store with a lot of foot traffic on a daily basis. The management is friendly and understanding. My co-workers are mostly nice people. The job isn't difficult but it can be boring and repetitive.
good,I had fun working with the staff during my extership days.  the staff taught me a lot of thing while I was there.
good,This job is fine to start off with but I would never want to spend the rest of my life in retail.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Most of the managers did not direct their teams properly and could not set up the schedules to fit or accommodate the daily job. They had me move from post to post without acknowledging the other managers of my new location (department). I was being stretched and scattered.
good,"Macy's overall is a great store from a customers point of view. However when you get a job there, co-workers are very unfriendly, and managment is more focused on money and sales than their customers and employees."
good,"1) A day at work has no instructions. No guidance."
good,"it was one of my more slow paced jobs, not too fun but worth going to everyday to make money. I prefer to be happy at work"
good,"Usually opened so opened registers checked holds and the fitting rooms then went to morning meetings which consist of everyday goals to be met and feedback from customers. I loved the people I worked with some of them had been there for some years I was one of the youngest. I learned how to meet and greet people and also it wasn't just about the job it was interacting with people from all walks of life. It lets you see and here things you may not see everyday , the conversations or the people coming in and out. The hardest part had to be the change and the pressure to open up so many credit cards to people didn't want to mess up their credit and how bad the economy is. The managers where awesome when I first started working but as things changed so did the managers some stayed longer than others but I liked the ones we started with."
good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's but the management to me was kind of unreliable. I did not learn a lot about my job and therefore I suffered from it, my daily routine was never the same as everyday I was told that my job duties entailed different things.  There were days that I worked 9 hour shifts and did not receive adequate breaks.  I felt like some days I was rushed into my shift without preparation.  I worked long days and did not feel appreciated for the effort I put forth."
good,"i love macys , but working as an hourly wasnt fun , i had to man a 4 person station all by myself and was held accountable for all the cleaning before my shift was over , which was impossible to do because it seemed everyone was throwing the go backs into my area. NO STARS, they want you to work 4 diffrent areas and do 5 diffrent jobs for 8.75 an hour. how does that sound?"
good,My typical day would be opening register and counting money In register for the business day. I enjoyed helping customers find the merchandise they needed and changing their day around
good,My work day is usually very mundane and I feel that I am on auto pilot alot of the time. There are very few challenges within my day. My co-workers are awesome and the management seems to be willing to be willing. The hardest part of my job is the repetitiveness and the most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers and our guest.
good,"its a job, a good on depending on who you work for, it can be a stressfull, yet pleasant experience."
good,I enjoyed helping customer. I would restock items and clean fitting rooms
good,"i am interested in finding work else where, i do not like the company or how its set up. managers are very rude and not helpful. i was thrown on the floor the first day not knowing what to do."
good,"i can enjoy myself if the right day shows up but the customer coming to the store feels entitled and expects you to bring them the sun but i would always do the best to make everyone happy everyday. i love helping people out i loved working there but no ever has your back when ever something went down. but the people you meet everyday and the ones you connect to makes you want to wake up, but other then that if your doing one thing management don't ever have your back."
good,"A typical day at work was to get your cashier ready for the day."
good,"I would not go back to work for them, however it wasn't the worst job in the world. I was pregnant with my son at the time I worked there and they were not understanding of the weight gain or the time I needed to doctor's visits. I loved working with customers though, and I learned a lot about customer interaction."
good,"I sold mens pants. I learned that commission set environment is an awful place to work in. Initially, the manager who hired me was great, but after he was moved I had no idea who my superior was. When I quit the job I called the operator and told her I was leaving and to tell who it may be concern. The hardest part of the job was to stay motivated. The most enjoyable part was to get a pay check."
good,The pay does not at all compensated for the amount of work done in a typical day.
good,"This position does not have defined roles, yet employees working in the executive office are responsible for a little bit of EVERYTHING. That means you're multi-tasking and constantly working without any moment to breathe."
good,"I sold cosmetics, which are my passion. Met so many new wonderful people as clients. Learned immensely about the retail industry. Management was there most of the time when needed."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"assist customers finding a desirable outfit, ring purchases using a register."
good,This was seasonal for the holidays alone with other seasonal workers we put out and displayed merchandise for sale. It was all done to the specification of a prepared diagram no room for errors or creativity; the most enjoyable part of the position was that often customers would express their pleasure on the displays and when it was over I was glad I had that experience
good,The appreciation of life on the floor in so many stores gets so little attention. Limited number of floor associates are pushed to the limit and are expected to be good will ambassadors for corporations that
good,"At Macy's I am a Customer Service,Sales Associate, Cashier and a team member"
good,I felt they did not give me good training to be sucess there I had a hard time to get my goals met becaue of my Disability to see the Customers and the products they carried .
good,A Typical day involved in taking out new merchandize tagging and organizing the clothes to be put in the departments for the customer.
good,it is Macy's it is the typical big company
good, Stock Warehouse
good,"You're never working alone on a project, there is always a team or assistance available."
good,"Work day was long, and often split.Management not candid about the position and future.Terrible at staff development, co-workers (managers) not always working together as a team."
good,When working at Macy's it was not a fun experience. The mangement is not that well and the scheduling is very hard to work wtih.
good,A typical work day can be busy
good,Adequate training is provided to employees.
good,dealing with the public. helping people shop. returning items. informing customers of sales and why it is great to have a macy card
good,Learned a lot in the time I was there. Was able to add to my background knowledge.
good,"my type with macys comes with mixed emotions, even thought i learn so much about the retail business and customer service, Macy's Inc. is not known to care much about their low level employees shown with their Star System, i mean there is a reason why their customer service is not the best; it directly reflects the way employees are treated by management. the only Great thing i found about the job is was the locations and just how amazing it was to interact with so many cultures, i really like people so this was a plus to me. the way Macys makes their employees hound people with false promises for credit it down right appalling, there is so much about this huge company that needs to change but its never going to happen because their culture is not a positive attitudes but of the believe that workers are indispensable."
good,"long hours, not the greatest management, doesn't leave much to be desired"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macys is a great place shoppign wise, however when working there it is a total different situation. This Macys is very unorganized during the christmas season. I went for almost 4 weeks doing the wrong job under the wrong manager. If you are not a cashier you are not trained nor educated on the store."
good,"Great team workers to work with, ok company, lack of communication, very cheap"
good,You unload the truck at a fast affective pace. You do not know when your shift will end and the truck does not come in every week.
good,"I usually come to work a few minutes before scheduled and see what needs to be done. It is a fun work environment, there are staff members around my age so it's easy to relate. Also management isn't to strict as long as your doing your job. The hardest part of the job I would have to say is taking customers insults and not being able to give them a piece of your mind. My most favorable part of the job was interacting with customers who are polite and solving customer's problems."
good,"Fast paced working place. working with a lot of different kinds of people around the DC area and visitors from all over the world. I have learned that being patient and friendly behavior are the key to succed in the retail working environment. I also worked with a lot of nice people and some unfriendly co-workers and too. The job that I worked for the past 5 years is a comission job. So , I have to work with so many customers to seal more because;the more I sale the better my paycheck will be. sometimes when your try to work with 4 or 5 customers at the same time you will be unable to give equall attention for all 5 customers and the customers might not be happy and,this was a stressful moment . However, when you sale a lot and when you see your number (how much you sold)at the end of your shift that is the happy moment. In addition,because the job is fast paced time goes fast and I enjoy this part of my job too."
good,-A typical work day consist of folding clothes and cashiering
good,I learned different aspects of the the healthcare industry.
good,I worked there for almost five years and at the end was treated very poorly. They don't understand my morals and standards at a job.
good,"This place was so anti-union and was micromanaged like a child. Somehow I think a union would have solved that issue. I'm not sure of Macy's everywhere, but most of my co-workers were too competitive to be considered in the least bit friendly/approachable."
good,"there is no down time at work, if you are there you are working. You are allowed 1 20 min break, but nobody actually takes it. You do learn a lot of valuable skills while working there that will be able to be applied anywhere else you go afterwards. There is potential for growth... but there is nepotism in that growth."
good,"Unfortunately, I experienced blatant racism and sexism by upper managers.  HR nor my manager did anything about it ( ignores the root problem).  I learned a great deal of knowledge is both digital and print marketing and made friends for life but you must not get stuck in that toxic culture.  They also provide great leadership courses and training."
good,Alot of work sometimes they dont treat you fair. Need more people to help out some people are nice some are out to get you. I keep yo my self to get the job done. I help everyone out.
good,"Each shift was a different experience in my management role, having to deal with multiple personalities. I have learned how to overcome many challenges."
good,Don't waste your time!!!!! The only thing this company worry about is how much credit you open for them.. If you don't get credit open management is very unprofessional about it.
good,There is poor management and little to be done about it. They value warm bodies over resourceful employees. Favorites are played for sure and it is harder than normal to get time off or a shift covered.
good,It’s a great company to work for with a lot of hours. A typical work day is 10hrs. They have nice break areas to eat my lunch at. It’s also a lot of new faces every day which makes it enjoyable.
good,"Receiving isn't easy and it isn't for everyone. It is long hours, manual labor and it's not favored working conditions. It does however, give you a deep understanding of what goes into keeping a department store running. Overall it wasn't a terrible job, but it's not something I consider retiring from."
good,Working at Macy's is more like a dead-end job than any other company I have worked for. Managers do not promote from within as they say that they do. The best part about working at Macy's are my coworkers
good,Great company that promotes advancement and is good to staff. Learned a lot about management and customer service working at this company. Flexible hours and shifts
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"It was convenient but a bad time for me to work now I'm available and free "
good,It was a very fast hiring process with lots of required training that didn't really help me on the floor while trying to sell products. It was very hard to get shifts. I left because I got another job.
good,"This job is not for everyone. When I first started the hours were set 6am-10am or 12pm. Two months in the schedule switched to 1pm-7pm or 11am-8pm. Then we were told cooperate was doing our schedule. Shifts went 4pm-7pm or 1pm-4pm (not worth the drive)"
good,"I worked at Macy's for 5years and they pay low wages and horrible managment. You never knew who the managers where since they changed all the time. It is an ok part time job, but not able to live off of it."
good,"The discount is good and a few co-workers. I was told when I started working there things use to be better. That's all I have to say, nothing more to tell."
good,A place to hone customer service skills.  I experienced a wide variety of customers with varying needs to be addressed hourly.  There was no consistency between departments and managers.
good,"Macy's attracts phenomenal workers, but the management team could use LOTS of improvement.  Maybe more training is needed, since young managers are typically hired, who appear a bit green.  Management does not seem to understand the concept of leading by example and appear to have very little concern for rank and file employees.  Sales associates do not receive adequate support from managers, who typically hide behind locked doors during the workday, while sales associates stand on their feet with minimal breaks or support for very little pay.  Macy's pay scale is responsible for the high rate of attrition seen.  Macy's should, at the least, consider paying full time employees a living wage."
good,"At the beginning I worked for Burdines, which was wonderful-We felt like family. The longer I stayed (When the store became Macys) then it  started to be less compassionate, and the store lost its Florida vibe. The products became mass production, with less originality. There is no loyalty with long employment, as a matter of fact, the longer someone is there the more they want to get rid of you. If you see Macys as a short time of employment, it is interesting and most of the employees are wonderful to work with. They have a nice discount."
good,"I think this job for a part-timer. Also, student, retired, house-wife, and those who looking for light income or want the discount. I like receiving and shipping manager. She was so energetic and hard worker."
good,"My employment with Macy's was not great, but helped me matured and learned to be patient with others. Macy's was a good first job and was able to work with my school hours."
good,people were just there for a seasonal position so realistically we were all getting laid off after the holidays anyway so there is not much to review here
good,"Great work environment but in the food division you are treated worse than the sales floor employees. No breaks, discounted food on only expired stuff, store discount is enough to cover tax before it was raised. If you want to take advantage of discount in Macy’s you need the credit card or prepaid card which costs a fee.  If you stay as a entry level position in food division, you receive tips. As you move up the ladder, no tips.  It’s not bad as a start out job but wouldn’t recommend staying long. Once management changes maybe it’ll be different."
good,Changes were made and people were moved around with no input from lower level employees. Management not fully connected or engaged with employees. Lots of great programs and employee events to attempt to keep employees motivated in a work environment that was unnecessarily stressful and monotonous.
good,"When I worked here they didn’t even give me any hours. The guy who was my supervisor gave me 3 hours a week. Like come on. I have bills to pay. I decided it was best to leave. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers. And when we hit 90% for fulfillment in a day. "
good,"good department managers"
good,I liked working under surveillance. The guest interactions were fun and exciting as well.  I had a really great time meeting all the locals and regular shoppers at Mayc's
good,"Fast Busy, Competitive , Average Customer Service  , security at a average . mangers , ceos, work around schedule , but they are very loving company ."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Very active place to work for apprehensions. You get to look at a lot of internal and external material. No quota for apprehensions. It becomes a bit dangerous due to shoplifters. You follow a tactical plan that pretty much tells you what to do for most of the day. A lot of communication.
good,"Current district manager and store manager do not promote a fun environment, always criticize performance.  Store manager is split between 2 stores and we rarely see him"
good,"There is a high turn over as most start as seasonal then leave or work flex hours PT. If pay and benefits were better it would be ok, but they still overwork everyone (managers included). Most managers and supervisors are friendly and understanding. Overall good start to retail, or any job, as the hiring and training process moves quickly. Prepare to learn on the job as the training is all computer based for the most part. Worst part and why I scored this low is that the expectations are way too high, as you’re expected to do every job not just the one you’re hired for, but still held accountable for finishing your own work on top of it all. Simply put; not enough employees so they overwork the few they have managed to keep on."
good,not good..bad management....i wouldnt recommend this job. it was unorganized and a mess. i wish i didnt work there but it was something to do during the holiday season. glad i didnt go back.
good,"Macy's is no doubt a huge brand name in Retail but when it comes to paying the employees they are probably the worst. The Management like to hire new employees after every few month because they know a new employee will stay for a while at a very low pay and when he or she will leave after realizing the unstable working schedule and the  salary they are making then the Management will hire another bunch with the same low pay, again and again. Which is why you will observe their sales associates are not very friendly & professional when it comes to customer service. You get what you pay for."
good,You work so hard the customers don’t take care of what they try on. They don’t care. The company expects the Sales associate to do everything and you don’t get any commission. People that get hired after the first day go to lunch and don’t come back.
good,Most of job consisted of moving merchandise to push for sales. I enjoyed moving product and making statements with the clothes. I did not enjoy the amount of work that was required with no overtime option. Frequently we did not have enough associates or time to complete tasks.
good,"The place has wonderful people as far as associates go, however the management was falling apart. Not only emotionally but they all kept leaving or getting moved."
good,I worked in the cosmetics department and I endured bigoted comments and questions daily from the counter managers. I had my work schedule changed without prior notice.
good,I was a Supervisor that wasn't given the authority to be successful. I was under minded frequently.  I saw a rotating door of change of staff while I was there and that made me unsure of the culture.  I was open and honest about my concerns and was told that the investment of time to address my concerns has proven in the past with others to not be benefiial so they weren't going to address the changes I was asking for.
good,I didn't mind Macy's didn't like it. They try to be all team buildy and peppy but its kinda just a joke. Those back rooms are a deathtrap but there are lots of hidden passageways through the store and places i don't think people have gone in in years
good,"When first hired with Macy's Fine Jewelry.  I was told I would be a Jewelry Captain, the following week that changed to a Facilitation leader. Over seeing a group of long and short team employees. "
good,"Limited Job Security.  Best as a part time job, really no room for advancement.  Very poor management, no real room for growth, however you do get paid weekly."
good,"Management was horrible and never showed consideration for employees and working hours were distributed poorly. "
good,I don’t honestly remember how I was treated in Macy’s but it was tough due to having to work third shift but nothing to complain about Macy’s only that it was hard working at night.
good,"Favoritism is a big within the company, manager chooses who he likes and gives them the hours. Didn't enjoy the work environment either was boring at times"
good,"Good environment to work in.  Fast paced"
good,"There is a dearth of employees at Macy's.  The problem this has caused is that fulfillment, which is finding items people have ordered online or by telephone have to be pulled by associates.  Many days there is a large number of such items.  In areas where there is only one person working, it is an added burden to try to do this on top of serving customers, cleaning fitting rooms and keeping the area neat.  It would make so much sense to hire a core group of people who just do fulfillment and nothing else.  Having associates do this is a sump on their time and effort and unfortunately can negatively impact customer service.  "
good,"The day is based solely on your work schedule. With that being said it primarily may revolve opening or closing the registers in your department, handling point of sale transactions with customers, keeping track of and restocking inventory, pushing for the opening of store credit cards, contacting other branches for inventory if not available in store, keeping your department neat and tidy, and on occasion providing assistance in other departments."
good,Macy's was a learning experience for me.  It was my first job after graduating from High School.  The best part of the job was the employee discount and working in the mall.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Pay was good, especially for a seasonal position, however, management rarely noticed work effert and many seasonal associate's were left without a job despite their best efforts."
good,Too many managers who don't allocate tasks or check on employees regularly. Too much favoritism between managers a nd employees. not enough one on one training.
good,"Typical day will include sales, interacting with customers, and keeping sales floor clean.  Customer service is very important and you normally have a sales goal to meet each day."
good,"The co-workers is great, but pay is very low consider it you are working for packet money. The managers force you to open Macy`s account it is priority #1 + put customer to you client list and send them junk mails. Not good idea to make them happy."
good,"The part that I like most about my job is the interaction with customers. It gives me great pleasure whenever I  meet a customer and I am able to meet his/her's needs. I've always been people person and I get a great deal of satisfaction when I know that the customer is happy with his/her purchase and I helped make that experience a good one!"
good,Many hours spent standing at a door with no movement.  Poor pay and no overtime.  No enough time given for breaks of meals.  No job security and many layoffs coming down the pike
good,"on a typical day we are relaxing taling amongst eachother."
good,"Macy's was good to shop, but not so much to work for.  Helping customers was the most rewarding part of the job.  "
good,"Everyone is nice at first but after the first or second year, they start being rude and talking to you with attitude. It is more like you are a slave. They expect so much from you for the little pay. You job goes unnoticed."
good,"Retail is already a hard area to work in. But my experience was beyond traumatic. I'm not saying I completely hated working for Macys, but there are some things that pushed me away from the company. Management definitely needs to improve. As a full time student where all my managers were aware of my availability they still valued their gains vs what I could do. If you find a store with seat management that respects and values you as a human being I say go for it. Otherwise, good luck!"
good,"My Typical work day at macy. I would come in and count my draw. Cleaning and sorting clothes. Helping my customers find What they needed to wear for any event as far as weddings, graduations, Christmas parties ext. "
good,Stressful place to work at times with the crazy hours. I would like for a more set schedule to better plan things outside of work.  I feel like my job is not secure.
good,There was a nice work environment. Easy to communicate any questions or issues with management. Enjoyed providing customer service to each customer daily.
good,"I worked in women's shoes while at macys, I hated it. The extra commission helped but the customers were sometimes hard to deal with. Some were just rude when you just tell them what the truth of the situation is. Always moving, unless your there right at open or close and then it can be super dead. This job stressed me out, i never felt like I was doing good enough by anyone's standards despite trying my hardest. Hardest part? the complaints from both customers and management about you sucking at your job. The most enjoyable was making someones day when you got them exactly what they wanted and they were polite."
good,"Some managers are horrible, and you can tell there is favoritism. Some employees are very competitive and honestly want to see you fail. You can't really trust anyone here."
good,"Job for much younger individuals. Sorting merchandise and keeping neat, problematic. Nothing else to add really, was at Christmas time and was to be very short term."
good,"The company seems to be rudderless, particularly related to events and foods. A good temp or season option should someone need to work.  Co-workers can be a good source of support."
good,I didn't like working there. It was compete some of the employees were not nice at all. Too many times no customers and it was dead. Plus they are way too expensive on theyre products.
good,I think if they looked at sales better with a better direction (training) with the management team instead of watching a video the company would do better. If more than one employee complains about a team support lead they should cut their lose and get rid of them. Especially if they waste the company time in the morning doing nothing but stays late and brags about hours as they send people home for not having hours then stays to make 40 plus hours themselves.  It was a very hostile work place too many bosses within the company at one store. With a unclear who was in charge too many departments mangers with leads too many people telling the associates what to do no clear picture of who was really in charge. This store didn't work together as a team. People are intimated by a few leads who makes them cry daily with no action taken. Many associates will take items off the shelf to use for personal use never buying the item then will write it off or MOS it. All in the same-time management knows and nothing gets done.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy's gave me good experience and many years of diverse responsibilities.  This was advantageous for my move forward in my career.  Macy's was a very busy and rewarding place to work.
good,"I only worked at Macy's part time but found the atmosphere very depressing for an enjoyable sales experience."
good,"company policy comes from both Macys and Citibank, they kind of step on each other. meaning you have flexibility to be both right and wrong, a lot of do this, no, no, no, I mean do that."
good,Learn as much as you can from the small things to the big things no matter the role your given and always remember that this is a entry level job so don’t limit your growth.
good,"Macy’s is another corporate retail store, where you work during the Thanksgiving holidays and you need to be work early to perform tasks by the end of the day. The pay is decent depending on the amount of shifts during the week. When the holidays sales are over, shifts are nowhere to be found in about two weeks to a month."
good,Employees need to be more organized and punctual. The workspace should be kept cleaner and more organized. Overall it is a good experience but could use a lot of room for improvement.
good,the people are nice. i think management needs work & pay needs to increase. it's a competitive workplace but it is fun sometimes. there is not much room for growth there.
good,"If you were a people-person, you would enjoy working there.  Because I started with Hudson's and Marshall Field's, Macy's never lived up to the standards of the other stores."
good,"a typical day at work includes Multi-task, assisting employees and customers at the same time.  answering multiple phone calls and also training new associates. "
good,"Initially I enjoyed working at Macys for the retail experience, being on a team, and interacting with customers.  However, after some time as a sales associate and a change of 4 managers with less than 2 years, I felt I didn't have the support I needed to effectively do my job."
good,"the company continues to cut back staffing in all areas in stores and at the same time increase expectations of those that work there. while the trend everywhere is to do more with less, when it comes to customer service there is a tipping point where that is just not possible. for macys, in most stores, they are reaching that point."
good,"can be very busy during the holidays, have to meet a sales goal everyday so if you dont like pushing sales on people i would not get a job there . . ."
good,"Macy's was demanding but this was due to the time of year.  Seasonal work can be stressful.  Fast paced and fun, although there needed to be more work-life balance."
good,They were ok. No exit review. did not give me the option for part time. Then I would have stayed. So I left and retired..I cannot think of anything else.
good,"It was great except your advancement in the company was determined by your ability to persuade someone into getting a credit card which was unfortunate because the company itself is already so big that most people already have credit cards for the store. I worked there for almost 3 years, never had a review of my performance and never received a raise or recognition for going above and beyond my duties."
good,"As an associate at Macy’s Culver City workers are over worked, worker responsible for more then 1 depart, short staffed, floor not properly recovered."
good,"Work hours were long and hard. Worked every weekend because I was a counter Manager, Pay was low and there were only 2 times a year a cosmetic employee could really make enough commission to make a real difference in your pay.  I did love my job and learned an incredible amount"
good,"Purchasing of Macy's Credit Cards is a must (expected to obtain at least 2 applications weekly).  This is a hard part of the  job as most customers do not want the credit card (26% interest rate and a $2.00 monthly charge if there is no purchase within  3-6mnths).  You are expected to continually remain with all customers you encounter until they purchase merchandise or leave your area, maintain a clean and cleared work area.  Your contact among employees is limited to your sales area except for breaks and meals.  Your work schedule is done by computer and it is difficult to change.  You can obtain additional rewards if you are able to get customers to obtain the Macy Credit Card, write a review of how helpful and friend you were, and for large sales."
good,A very calm and fun environment. I loved working with everyone there. I learned all the skills needed to work behind the counter and in front and hands on with customers.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Work you like a slave and they don't even give you a second chance with your background horrible job I will never work for macys ever again they hire you and then fire you if you have a bad background
good,"I prefer not to write anything, i really don't have anything to say but they are making me write this. It was a good company when i started 13 ears ago"
good,"The pay was very low, expected to do a lot of physical work to clean, stock etc. for next to nothing pay. You have to basically beg customers to open a credit card with Macy's."
good,There were many capable and willing candidates for management positions that were looked over. The final decision was to hire someone who had no previous experience in the company. This left a lot of people unhappy and over it.
good,"Macy's is a great company and it's the people that makes a company looks bad because they had a biased and prejudicial spirit externally and brought it over to Macy's. Some of the HR personnel were very pleasant, but salary weren't commensurate with experience. Paying someone with more than 20 years management experience and multiple Masters Degree and Accredited Doctoral Degree $9 hour. "
good,The culture at Macys was is to take care of the customer with exceptional service. The problem is with what we pay an entry level associate we don't have applicants breaking down the door to start. So we basically get low qualified people and attempt to do more with these people than associates had to do in recent years and also there are less associates than in previous years. Basically if you can get the right mixture of new associates that care and tenured associates that also care and wont turnover good things can happen for you.
good,"Management is constantly on top of you to perform. Which you should as an employee, but it never seemed good enough."
good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's only because I loved helping customers and making them happy. The only hard part about the job is when the customer couldn't find what they were looking for, so then they became very upset."
good,"Pros"
good,"Macy's was a fun place to work, if you like being busy all the time. I loved the job, the customers, and the employees. Was told you can move up in the job, but saw that most the managers showed favorites."
good,Managers do not always back you up.Not flexible and very unorganized. The customers are some of the worst! Credits are pushed. The teams are great depending on which area you work in.
good,"Very busy during the holidays but slow during the rest of the year."
good,"Macy's is a good place to work, if your just starting out or if you need something TEMPORARY. However you should know they promise a lot of things that do not always pull through in the end. The job you apply for is never just your only job.. you are often asked to do jobs in other places that are not in the department you applied for. Bottom line,you'll do fine if you do not mind working like a dog for almost nothing and receiving almost no acknowledgement."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty fast and easy. Unless you need help from management than you have a problem on your hand. Overall Macy's a great place to gain experience in sales, retail, customer service, cash handling, and management. Biggest issue working here is bad management."
good,"I worked from 7pm-530am, I personally am not able to balance life outside of work with those hours. I have children that I have to take to school and pickup from school, sports practice, cook dinner and still be at work on time. I only recommend this shift to anyone who is single with no children or have teen or grown children."
good,"bonuses were okay but you had to bust you tail for hours, short staffed, under paid, felt like you had big brother over you sales, couldn't find management when needed"
good,its an ok job they dont let you pick the hours it a far drive and they want you to work a scheduled shift that is not optional to change and the benefits dont start until after 6 months
good,"I have had a good experience learning different things at Macy's.  I "
good,"Macy's tend to never have managers who know what they are doing, people who never show up for their shift, and terrible off time. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I would recommend working at Chick-fil-a over this. I am not a fast food industry supporter but working there was a bit better than mac's because if you were to get sick at CFA you could always bring a note when you returned to work. If you get sick at Macy's for more than 3 days and you have 3 consecutive absences you will automatically be terminated from the job.
good,Not a lot of room for growth or real opportunity. Promotions aren't consistent. Company is always asking for you to take money out of your pocket to support their cause.
good,Some hard working people are there. There is always few registers open which  brings complains.shipping is not  properly packed as things break and damage during shipping.
good,"Poor managers "
good,If you want just a basic job to generate money Macy’s is great. The one I worked at had poor management in my department and there was a lot of gossiping and cut throat woman. Especially this one lady in Woman’s shoes who’s been working there for 20 years and spends her whole day trying to get people fired for some reason. Very toxic woman would recommend getting rid of her.
good,Fun everyone’s super cool easy to work with nice workplace unless it’s the holidays the hours aren’t really there though but management is definitely willing to work with you
good,"I got put into one are told that I could move to merchandising but they never allowed me to do so. I got 4 hour days and maybe 4 days a week. Not enough pay to live on. Tried multiple times to advance, they said they would but never took the action to do so. Management pawned me off to someone else to train and when training with manager they left me alone first week of training without telling me what to do."
good,"no life whatsoever, staying very late, no possibility to make a doctor appointment in advance even late at night, because you never know how long you will have to stay in that particular day. No job security at all, could be fired easily after many years of work with great performance"
good,"Was fast working nights, learn how to alarms merchandise,the bad part was the graveyard hours the good part was the merchandise was ready for mornings"
good,"Always have to be on time, better to bring your own food as no canteens are there. After 1 day of training you have to do your best to meet companys target."
good,My manager was a nightmare to work for. Disrespectful and rude. Had to tell her numerous times to stop speaking to me so disrespectfully. I ended up with a bald spot on my head from her stressing me out so bad. .
good,i didn't really like working here because it was too much going on in the store. the costumers are not that good. they expected too much of you with not enough pay. The hardest part of the job was having to stay back and clean up a bunch of mess
good,"This company was fun to work for at first, then when the holidays came around, it was very competitive. The pay was low and you could never hit commission unless it was a holiday."
good,"I worked for Macys for almost 5 years and like any other job, it had its ups and downs. Managers were okay. This is where I got my start in the beauty industry. The pay was extremely low and even lower if you are commissioned."
good,Ok place to work as part time position as management allow you to work when you need too. Management does not talk to employees and people seem to be in a bad mood often.
good,My typical day at work was good I would greet customers but their was a lot of completion going on within everyone working there because they wanted to get there commission.
good,management needs better communication and company needs better pay rates. organization is another key point in the company that need better structure. over all an okay palace to work at.
good,a typical day at work is sometimes hectic due to sales. there was always competition in order to get sales. I learnt how to be more confident when approaching people.
good,The Macys I worked at was a very Slow environment to work at minimum wage was paid but was told that was getting paid more unflexable work schedule made to
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"My manager is a great leader, not only to me, but to our whole team. She is a great asset to the company. She listens and gives great advice. She works with you and informs you on what either you can do to improve your work ethics or even how to move up. She can be harsh at time, but she does it because she only wants what's best for you. She makes your team feel like family which is why we all get along so well. Communication is great and she coaches you with whatever you feel like you need help with. You could always go to her either work related or even personal life related. She is a manager I can definitely turn to in and outside of work."
good,None of the management team were communicating between each other nor were they communicating properly with Loss Prevention which made the job very stressful at times
good,I was having issues with my knee and sometimes when I first stood up it took a while before I could walk correctly.  It sometimes made me late to punch in and I was going to therapy and then let me go because when you are late you loose points.  Once your points are all gone you are left go.  If you are late once during a month you do not earn any more points.
good,IT was okay i enjoyed what i did. I work for the cosmetic section of the department store as a makeup artist. it was one of the best jobs i ever had.The hardest part of the job was leaving the company which i loved.
good,"working at Macy's was just a good temporary experience. I think they make you do too much work and make every situation pretty stressful. Even though my role was as a manager, but i tired to make sure i am being flexible to associates working under me. Overall, it was not a bad experience. I learned diff aspects related to sales."
good,Macy's salary is very low. I hired there as seasonal but I don't know they offer the same salary for their regular employees or no but for seasonal employees it really less then average.
good,"Expensive benefits, low pay, not enough hours unless it is holiday season. Managers have favorites and they get promoted. Raises consist of 10 cents no matter how good u are. They want everyone to get a credit card"
good,A typical day of work I have to say was all about work and no play. If I wasn't dealing with customers I was straightening the shoe racks or stocking the back room. The hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers and management usually wasn't every helpful. working there did help my customer service skills improve so I am able to deal with unhappy people and I a usually able to resolve their problems to make them want to come back. I enjoyed that fact that I had regular customers made me extremely happy because that let me know I was do my job to the best of my ability if not better.
good,I had to learn very fast and sometimes be self taught. Management wasn't always the best. Hardest part of the job was communication between other employees.
good,"already have  people in place not willing to look outside the box, gave 2 years for more forward, did not want anyone smarter or team builder around the employees"
good,very very poor management. pay was ok so were the benefits. they make you get a macy's card just to get the employee discount. focused more on meeting sales goals than anything else
good,Fast paced environment. Very political . Employees were great! Unfortunately upper management  did not value a job well done by staff. Constantly demeaning behavior. Could have been a great company if executive team would have really invested and cared about the staff.
good,"There wasn't much things to do but charging customers, it was Christmas season so I figured there will be more stuff to do. The employees were rude and management seem they didn't care much."
good,working at macy's was a great short time for me love my co-workers but some of the manangers need a lot of mananging skills and learning to be team players.my job was pretty much learn as you go and catch on to what you need for that day
good,"No room for advancement and too many cutbacks. Every year you take the same tests on HIPPA laws, confidentiality and how to make unbiased decisions. Macy's management breaks every rule. No communication, lots of belittling talk about employees and as much as they take pride in being flexible... your manager makes the final decision. Watch out if your boss doesn't like you. 3 years with this company and you're burnt out. I loved Macy's in the beginning and glad they try to promote within. Sadly, your promotion is by favoritism and not by how efficient you are or how good of an employee you're trying to be,"
good,"Management made the work place too competitive. I always tried to do my best work but nothing seemed to be enough. There were a few ""rewards"" that came with good sales but they really pushed us to sell the credit cards. My co-workers were the best part of the job. But I did learn a lot about customer service so my skills did improve."
good,you have sales requirements and top sellers are recognized (not with extra pay or bonuses) your co workers WILL try to steal your sales if they get the chance too.
good,I am a fun and outgoing person. I love people and love learning new things. I am passionate about helping others and seek employment that loves doing the same. I am a hard worker and will make sure I get the job done.
good,Busy because its the season. Got to package around a couple thousand items in time for Christmas. Since I worked in the back it wasn't as crazy and as long as you finish your quota for the day it generally was pleasant experience.
good,"Typically go in and unload a truck and the Merchandise ready for the sales floor,do recovery,and price mark downs,work with customer service ,help customers out to there cars with Merchandise"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Consistent work flow"
good,"During the recession of 2008, this job helped me keep my home from being foreclosed. It was also a good social connection for me and I enjoy helping customers find what they need, teaching me a new trade in a friendly workplace culture.  Hardest part of job is the multi-tasking due to a shrinking staff in retail."
good,If your a student this can be a job for you as long as you plan not to stay in the company forever. They truly do not care about employees they treat you like you do not matter. Hours sometimes are scarce so if your new or your not a favorite to the manger of the area forget about getting good hours.
good,"Job didn't really last long, wish they would've kept me but hopefully I find another job soon. The managers were great and friendly as well as the co workers."
good,Worked there for a few months and was treated poorly by the LP staff and certain management. Didn't receive enough training and was completely looked over.
good,"A typical day at work including helping customers and putting clothes back on rack/shelves. It was a good experience for retail sales, but I definitely felt like just a number with all of their employees. When I would go to work, I was always meeting a new employee. The turnover rate seemed pretty high. Most of the managers/department heads seemed very stressed, but did their best to be as helpful as possible."
good,"It is a good first job to work at , but there is a lot that still need to improve in management and benefits, as well as the possibility to move up in positions."
good,"Training was thorough, however there was not much support from management after training was completed. I do not believe this was intentional, the company was under staffed and I think there was too much demanded from management.  There was much required from associates but because of the busyness of the season, what they were asking was not very realistic.  The pay was not worth all the work and there were no benefits that made staying with the company worth while. Macy's did have team rallies in the mornings and promoted team work, which was great, however from my experience the associates did not appreciate this and did not work as a team."
good,"Overworked,understaffed, too much work, underpaid. You can gain a lot of experience from Macy's that is the only good thing about this place."
good,This job is great if you love to sale things and talk to people everyday to make the sale. This is the only way you can make more money if you make your commission other then that 9.00 a hour a person can not live on if you have a family. This is for kids who are just getting out of high school or going to college and want a few dollars in their pocket. Schedules are very flexibe though.
good,If you make commission than it can be pretty good pay. Management goes up and down with who they hire. Lately it hasn't been great.
good,The jobs not really hard but its like high school so many people talk about you behind your back and you have to pretend to like them. I wouldn't recommend working here to friends. Maybe I just had a bad experience.
good,"This is a typical warehouse job. During the peak season for the holidays, the warehouse has about 4,000 employees, and the company is solely money-driven, which is to be expected. There are a few supervisors that are good at their job, but most of the management just sees the associates as robots and assumes that their lives revolve around this job. Seasonal employees do not get holiday pay and are asked incessantly to work overtime. Some supervisors go to the point of harassment as a means to convince associates to stay for 12 hours every shift, 6 days a week. This company has the idea that the more associates, the better. So they will literally hire anyone during the season as long as you tell them you are available to work on Thanksgiving and work all of the days they ask. It's chaotic and unorganized, and there is hardly any communication with the associates, yet the blame is always put on the associates when things don't go perfectly. Also, you get no forewarning when you will be let go at the end of the season. The supervisors just tells you to check your schedule every week, and one day you won't have a schedule anymore, which means you are done working. The jobs are very easy and it offers a lot of overtime, if you need the money, which is the only upside to this job. In a 10-hour shift, you get one 20-minute, paid break and one 30-minute, unpaid break. This is just for the seasonal part of the job."
good,The work is pretty grueling but it was okay as a temporary job while looking for something more stable with better pay.  The thing I liked most about working there was my coworkers who were really nice and helpful and always seemed to have a great attitude.
good,Overall it's ok but the mangers sucks the pay is not that great and the benefits aren't either. Staff is ok a bit competitive but ok
good,The only thing I can honestly say I liked about working here were the discounts. The management seemed to be rude and unapproachable across the board & they put so much pressure on the employees to sell credit cards with high interest rates!
good,"A very productive day. There is always something to do. I've learned a lot from working there. Management is ok I felt throughout the time I worked there, they were very unorganized. I didn't like the fact that you if you couldn't get a hold of one manager you had to get ahold of another one and majority of the time what needed to get through the main manager sometimes didn't get too. Besides the manager the co-workers were amazing to work with they were helpful and patient enough to show when you needed help. The hardest part of the job was dealing more then one manager because one manager wanted a certain thing one way and the other another way. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving early and having the rest of the day to run errands and such."
good,"Worst job ever. Was treated so bad by associates. Talked about, and treated like a child. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Helping customer and give them more satisfaction to come back!!!assisting customer when they have pick up help them with their items and make them proud to be part the magic of Macy s.
good,It is great company to work for but its almost like if you don't have a buddy-buddy relationship with someone who is in a higher standing than you almost wont advance in the company.
good,Macy's is okay but the amount of work they had me doing for the little pay is unacceptable. The sick day system is honestly terrible I got released because I was at the hospital sick the day I had work and I called out because I was vomiting blood
good,"I loved what I was doing, but I couldn't stand the work environment. Management was God Awful and it became very stressful towards the end."
good,"Is a regular place to work, the best is when the costumer let you try new products or colors and at the end they love it and buy it. Some of your coworkers are lazy and you end do it all the stock, cleaning, and refill stations. Management can be bad and the option B or wherever they call for be ""full time"" is a completely JOKE because you can only work 28 hours per week. Only counter managers or workers with grandfather can have 35 to 37 hours per week. And be a ""counter manager"" is a another joke because you can be the only person in that counter o have a team of just 2 or 3 people..."
good,Macys is an okay job to have if you are working your way through college. The managers play favorite and they are not always around when you need them.
good,the feeling in your body you get at the end of the day isn't worth what you bring home at the end of the week......................
good,"Work very hard, my co-workers were great .  Work was tedius with low pay, it could have been better. But overall this company could improve towards their employees."
good,Managed wide variety of customer service and administrative tasks to resolve customer issues quickly and efficiently.
good,"It was a nice place to work for the moment, not a long term place of employment, maybe for a business major. Not really much else to say"
good,Inside a big warehouse loading up trucks as they come in till they are fill up to the end with help of 2 more guys in the same trailer when done move to another trailer.
good,fun job but low pay. not enough hours even as a full time employee i only received 35-38 hours. scheduling was never consistent.
good,"When I was there, the fine jewelry counter was a lease department within Macy's.  We had our own rules, culture, management hierarchy.  However, because we were inside of Macy's, there were occasionally power struggles between management teams.  "
good,"I wasn't able to compare it to another job since it was my first. However, the team or department i join was fairly new so management was everywhere. Co-worker were really nice."
good,Mainly they have favorites. They do not care about you and your life outside of work. They want your life to revolve around Macy's. The store manager she is wonderful. A couple of the other department manger are terrific as well. But other department managers are terrible. She only cares about her favorites I bust my butt at work and I see her reward other employee that don't even nearly work as hard as I do. Nothing is really hard about the job. Being a beauty advisor is fun but people with steal your sell if you are weak. The told me I am full time but the max i can work a week is 29-30 hours? Thats defiantly not full time.
good,"It is an easy company to work for. Depending on location, the store can be stressful or fun. There is really high turnover for this company because they under pay staff and do not hold them responsible for actions. Easy to get away with absences because of a point based system. "
good,The companies who pay the least always expect the most. The whole environment was very unprofessional. The Managers needed training on how to treat the Associates with respect.
good,"Long hours on your feet.  Enjoyable most of the time. Benefits are not very good.  If you are trying to make a living doing this, think twice.  Go back to school, get your education."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A typical day at work consists of dealing with any payroll related issues, time management/allocation of time allotted to each department in the store infrastructure. Hiring/Terminations done on daily basis, clocking errors and/or monitoring sales associates for time fraud or theft through various outlets. Modification of time within the peoplesoft system, maintaining accurate work information and/or details for work visas which may be expiring and updating employee information for sales managers. Attending to sales associates to determine whether there has been time inaccuracies or modifications and/or if corrections need to be made. My co-workers are all amazing people who go above and beyond to help each other as a team. The hardest part of the job are the holiday work schedules."
good,"Typical day at work is using register and restocking mechandise, as well as customer service and sales. Seasonal associates not trained enough before put on floor. Very little assistance from other sales associates. The most enjoyable part of the job was Customer Sevice."
good,The company is very strategic in driving the business and connecting with the customer.  A typical work day is very busy however if you're dedicated you can learn a lot about the business.
good,"a typical day would consist of arriving on time, clocking in at your departments register and getting right to go backs, checking the floor to make sure products are in place and then spend the day helping customers."
good,i worked there for two seasons and trying to stay past the season i gave up and didn't choose to stay or go back for 2015. i like working there but its no room to grow
good,It's great that they hire year round and it's not very hard to learn your role. However it becomes a daunting task as management demands a lot for the near minimum wage salary they provide and do not care too much for their employees. It is also clear that it is a company that is desperate for sales and is cutting costs wherever it can which includes hiring anyone who will take the job at their pay rate.
good,Inventory and computer skills were taught as well as management of inventory.  Long term employees are always willing to assist new hires and share their knowledge
good,Fast paced environment within the retail business.  I have been fortunate to work with and get to know many of the big name cosmetic vendors.
good,"The inner workings of the day to day process were as expected, the work condition for the most part was predictable until winter came. I learned allot about people and even more about how much I need to learn in order to support myself and my future family. The management was bad, personally. Co-workers were good, for the most part I was cool with everyone there, especially looking back on it. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck for 2 hours straight and still getting paid the same amount to do something lighter, it didn't make sense to me because of how stressful it was, we should've got paid more for that particular job. The most enjoyable part of the job were the co-workers and customers, when I would go to the sales floor and interact with them, they helped me through."
good,"People that I worked with were great, communication between depts.. really lacked. Safety was never a concern to any body,  There was no room to advance unless you relocated."
good,"- concierge services"
good,i liked getting there early and not having to deal with the customers. however the manager at the time was rude. i know that we have a certain time that we have to be done with things that we are doing. i have no problem with that. but dont keep moving people from place to place to accomplish this because nothing gets done and things are left for someone else to take care of and it makes you look like you havent done your job.
good,I was with Macy's as a Sales Associate for only 6 months.  I found the staff to be very competitive about quotas and thus not a team. I moved from the floor to the administration office and this was a breath of fresh air. I left Macy's as we had to relocate to the Caribbean for my husband's work.
good,Working at the macys taste bar is a good job to have if you need flexable hours as well as to work around everyday needs such as school and at home needs if needed.
good,"It was a learning experience. Definitely put my foot through the door 'behind the scenes"" of what really goes on in retail. Great work experience."
good,"If you are not good with selling (making your goal)  or approaching customers about opening a Macy's credit card, you can FORGET it. "
good,Help customers find a best fit for their needs. Establish clients and target repeat customers to add to your clientele.
good,great fast paced work. Satisfactory pay. equal opportunity. room to grow. Management teaches you what you need to know. great hours. flex schedules.
good,I loved working at macy's I loved the people and customers however management was unprofessional and rude. they don't care about their employees and only care about how many stars we can get a month.
good,"Selling jewelry, mingling with customers, inventories, diamond testing, offering credit cards and handling payments. Provides assistants to co-workers."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"As a merchandiser early mornings are the norm, moving quickly to get new merchandise out before the store opens. Making sure all the newest items are showcased and giving wonderful shopping ideas. The most difficult thing is during the holiday season when there is no room for new merchandise and you get truckloads everyday. I think it's wrong for them to require employees to now work on Thanksgiving day when the people who made this decision are at home spending quality time with their families. The compensation does not line up with the job that you are being asked to do."
good,Every morning there is a morning meeting in which the goals and expectations for the day are discussed. You answer customer questions and aid them with purchases. Also you are persuaded to upsell and/or inform customers about opening a Macy's card.
good,"Overworked and under paid. Then hours are cut to safe money or hours for monthly budget without any warning. Management is okay, and I love the team I work with. I do not feel like the company cares much about its workers especially those that are exceptionally reliable."
good,"excellent place to practice your skills, communication, merchandising  and how to handle a fast paced environment. great exposure to different aspects of the retail business."
good,It was a constant keep going type of job by unloading trucks all day and sorting out all boxes and pushing the new inventory up to the floor for packaging
good,"The pressure starts early in the morning, under staff, the need to hurry, the lack of equipment & space, work under a deadline. the work must be finish.  We work in an incredible, unclean smelly, rat infested place, people are constantly bumping into roll-racks and accidents or bruises are frequent.  Salary is dismal, raises are minimal, if we work too many overtimes, our next week gets shorten and penalize.  Workers are often force to do extra work with no compensation for it, etc."
good,"Working in a fast paced environment where we had to make the customer first. I"
good,"•	Achieving day-to-day goals and priorities assigned by store management. Acknowledging and greeting customers; also helping customers locate merchandise or find suitable alternatives. Handling returns/complaints graciously and effectively, controlling cash and check transactions as well as cleaning and organizing the sells floor."
good,While here I gained more communication skills. Here your always in a one on one with customers and its allows you to actually see what they like and have that true connection with them suggestions and feed back from the customer is what the company really wants in order to continue to have the right product to continue to stay in business
good,"As a Macy's Flexible Associate, good luck maintaining a fair amount of hours. At times it becomes difficult to pick up shifts during the week but during holidays/sales day it's hard to get rid of the shifts you actually don't want. The managers can be a hit and miss at times,some are really awesome and some...not so much."
good,"My co-workers were friendly and helpful. I always felt comfortable in the environment and loved helping the customers find just the right item for their occasion. Over all I will miss working with the associates. "
good,Associates not appreciated for their longevity with company.  Long hours standing without consistent break coverage. Poor staffing which increases customer issues and additional work.
good,"The security when you entered the building seemed unnecessary. There was short breaks, one being a 10 min and a 30 minute lunch for a shift from 5am to 4pm. However the cafeteria was awesome, great vending machines and options."
good,"Signed into computers, made sure the sales floor was tidy and clean.  Walked around sales floor to make sure all customers were being helped. Aided customers in any way they needed from choosing what color shirt to where other sections of the store were.  rang out customers on the register and made sure they were satisfied with their service.  The hardest part of the job was the management was not always consistent and or helpful if you needed them.  I very much enjoyed working with the customers and helping them having better shopping experiences."
good,"In the interview I specifically said I need to be moving and working with people in my job. They said they were the busiest kiosk in the mall (lies) and that I wouldn't have a spare second to hear myself think, let alone be bored.(BIGGEST LIE)"
good,I am currently employed with finish line as a leased department in Macy's. It is a great experience meeting new clientele on a daily basis.
good,"A typical day starts with running product to the various counters. Then delivering what my counters need for the day. In between I also pick the items that fulfillment requires. I'll also take care of the requests of the three department managers. After that I'll process any return to vender or destroy in field requirements. I've learned that, like most places, Macy's tends to be penny smart and dollar dumb. Management depends on the person, as with any large company, there is good and bad. The gifts with purchase are the hardest part of the job. There is a lot coming in at once and a fast turn around to get it out. I'd say, as with any place I work, the people are the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,I wouldn't recommend working at Macys unless you like forcing other to open up cards and constantly following them around. The managers only care about themselves and getting things sold. The hardest part of my job was dealing with certain people who made it impossible to have fun at work.
good,"I merchandise new and old store product."
good,"Nothing nine to five about this ""typical day at work."" I enjoy the staggered schedule that covers pretty much the whole day, from 10.00 am to 10.00 pm. This way one interacts with management,"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"-Fast paced daily structure with continual read/react to business."
good,"depending on the area you worked determined your hours, good co workers, could use more hours and more money, but it was a good company to work for."
good,"Was not busy enough for me. The district office was a mess when I first started and I organized, cleaned and made the office a better successful office.  "
good,3 different times I showed up at work at the time I was schedule only to have to sit in parking lot and wait almost an hour for people to show up bc I wasn't informed of schedule change and all I ever got was I will remembering it next time.
good,"I was an on-call employee which allowed me to choose my hours. "
good,"Have specific goals for the day and work that you are expected to meet. "
good,"Depending on which department you work for and who your managers are will affect your experience at Macy's.  If you're in the wrong department with the wrong managers, rules won't be applied evenly among each employee (for example: music, eating, and cell phones on the floor are a commonality, but a few people are singled out).  There is a 9 point system for attendance; managers will deduct points away for some employees, but not for all.  "
good,I have nothing to say. very nice people. good balance of life. but no job security at all
good,I enjoyed working at Macy's. I got paid every Friday and made connections with great people but what i didn't like was the management.
good,"Typical day involved maintaining fitting room areas returning merchandise to proper department and brand section; The  hardest part of job was being on feet for entire shift and managing large racks of new merchandise putting merchandise out on sales floor moving through crowd of customers, Enjoyed times working with a partner to put out new merchandise. Management team  very open and friendly always eager to assist with any issue or concerns may have had.  I came away with a whole new perspective and total respect for those who work in retail."
good,I enjoyed the public relations part and didn't enjoy the company's constant demand for begging the customers for more more more.
good,they would give me hours such as 6-9 or 12-3 not enough solid hours
good,working for macys on a daily bases was a challenge because each employee is instructed that in a certain time frame they are required to have a certain amount of customers signed up for store credit cards without guaranteed approval. Management was rarely available for assistance however the co-workers were very pleasant. The most difficult part of the job was working on commission and the most enjoyable part of the job was the discounts during sales for employees
good,"Macy's is a fast paced sales environment where the associates are expected to do everything from selling credit cards to cleaning the  sales floor. The management is entirely up front about their high expectations of the employee, however. The pay and hours were consistent."
good,"A good job for a little income while in school or a place to get some work experience on your way to a career,"
good,"We are not cashiers, we are customer service retail sales associates. a long name but you'll see why. A typical day at work is great with the right people who are willing to work with and help you. the customers come first no matter what, but when you find the balance to keep you, the team you work with and the customers happy then your day will be so fun, and very fast. that what most days are like at Macy's. I've learned so many things through this job I'll be taking with me throughout my life and sharing with others. the management is very lenient but they complain a lot about how they cannot do anything about the customer problems, or about a problem with an associate. most of my co-workers are really easy to get along with and easy to coach/ teach on situations throughout the work day. But keep in mind we are considered a team. when one person doesn't want to work with the team, that prevents the team from performing above or even at expectations. when there is an issue with one associate bullying the rest our managers do not fire the person responsible they simply just say ""let it go....document it... talk to HR about it"" our HR person is only available one day a week for 3 hours. so good luck trying to solve a problem, like when an associate purposely steals your commission because they're standing behind the register, and you're multitasking on the floor in good faith your associate will give you the commission and sale credit because you connected and fulfilled they're need and purpose of coming into Macy's. but lets not get distracted because you'll have one ""one of"
good,"Typical day consisted of setting pace and delegation of work load to my receiving team. I learned how to interact with Vendors, external and internal clients. As well as honed my management skills through various positions and duties.   Hardest part of the job was losing my best associates to other companies because we could not offer them a competitive wage."
good,"loading and unloading trucks filled with merchandise, a lot of lifting"
good,was a good experience to start in sales minimum wage + comission. You get to try many products and apply on customers (makeovers).They also train you thru the cosmetic line in NY which you'd get compensated for.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I would typical come in and see my coordinator in my department and would tell me where I need to go and do. I have learned about the flow of merchandise from the time you receive it to would the merchandise is sent to our customers. Management is some times not available. The coworkers work well together for the most part and will help each other out. The hardest part of the job is not always aware of the latest changes before we come in for our shift. I like that the work can easily be learned and that I can learn as I go along.
good,It was fast paces which I liked and the discounts were awesome.  Nice long lunch breaks.  Not enough management to assist in customer needs.  Not flexible with scheduling
good,Decent workplace. Corporate communication with the masses needs review.
good,"I liked the people I worked with and I enjoyed working with customers; however my direct supervisor was not a very trustworthy or honorable person.  I hardly received any employee coaching, which I found out from other supervisors and those in management she was supposed to do on a weekly basis.  She would tell employees untruths (i.e. lies) to get what she wanted.  She was very paranoid if she saw you speaking with other supervisors or going to the executive office -- even for routine matters.  I no longer have any respect for her."
good,"•	Assist customers with textile selections for matching & coordinating "
good,"Macys creates a culture of competing for sales, which is not conducive to promoting teamwork. I had wonderful co-workers, and generally very nice customers."
good,"slow paced "
good,Don't take my word for it. Some people make this their career. I just couldn't.
good,"Not a place I would like to ever work again. Management is horrible. Besides that, pretty easy job."
good,"Resolving disputes and increasing credit. "
good,"It was a different experience for me, but I would have changed a lot of work ethics, and routines at Macys to make it more productive."
good,Job expectations were extremely high for a person to accomplish or make sure was accomplished in a normal working day.
good,"The Macy's culture is based on upper management knowing what's best and never bothering to find out how their decisions affect the people at the bottom.  I found very little room for advancement because Macy's hires young people right out of college to be managers so they can be trained in the Macy's way.  "
good,"Store Manager threatened to fire me for saying ""Jesus"" while I was upset and behind closed doors in her office."
good,"My day starts at 6 am I set the sale for the day or week. After that I usually merchandise the clothes that have recently come in. I also  do mark downs. During the  holidays I am the recovery lead I make sure the store always is clean and  looks good. I also help with the customers when needed."
good,"Overall a good enviorment,advancement can be challenging"
good,"I love working for such a couture line of skin care and beauty. It truly is an honor to have everything you need to do a make over on a women and provide her with her beauty needs at home.Some of my job duties are getting to know the client and her needs, makeovers, follow ups, building a book of clientele, and keeping a clean and polished counter. If feels great to make someone feel beautiful and fulfilled."
good,"A typical day at work, I love making my customers happy. when they leave my counter feeling confident and beautiful with themselves it brighten my day. A day at work is can be very fast past I love it when we stay busy. I plan events every week for my counter so we can make our numbers. Calling customers is a must to replenish their items and invite them in to see our new products.  My purpose is to help people it do not matter what age the person I want to help everybody. I can not wait until I get  my BS in nursing that's my dream career it right around the corner."
good,bigg into sales and star rewards cards. Everything for very little. Learned not my cup of tea.
good,"Because I have so much experience in retail and being a sales associate, The job is pretty easy. My co-workers are cool, The hardest part about the job is the management."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,It was a pleasure going into this job everyday as the customers and especially the employees were such a pleasure.  The work environment was great but I felt that the minimalist amount of time used for training is a disadvantage for the  employees and their clients.  Management is not very hands on and is a bit difficult to deal with when information or back up was required.
good,good starter job for someone just starting out to gain work experience.
good,The one thing that was wonderful about the job was helping customers finding what they needed.
good,"Overall I did not mind Macy's. The people I worked with made my day go by quickly, and I enjoyed most of my time there. It wasn't until some drastic changes in management that I decided that was no longer the place for me."
good,"As an employee at Macy's, they REALLY do have good discounts! I've never paid anything over $5-10 for certain items besides expensive items."
good,"My day often started off early in the a.m., me and my team would off-load merchandise from our trailors that hab about 1000 boxes to come off. That was the hardest part of our day. We had specific duties to accomplish that was given from our manager."
good,On a daily you will meet new people and learn about them.The managers are on hands with you if you can find one. The co workers are great to work with and very helpful.
good,Felt part of a team. Loved working with people. Flexible schedule.
good,"I loved what I did and enjoyed educating people on shortage but, there was no room for growth."
good,"Duties included assisting customers in women’s high-end sportswear 	department and coordination of employees within the department. 	Merchandising setups performed weekly.  Achieved $1,000,000 sales goal in 	the fiscal year 1999."
good,"A typical work day at Macys was busy, I learned that I dont really enjoy working in retail espically around the holidays.The management was never really around to teach or help you do the job properly. I worked in a section where I was always on my own so I didn't have much interaction with the other employees. The hardest part of the job was working alone with no help, and it would have been nice to have some help at times, the most enjoyable part was the discount we were given."
good,"Bridal registry is the best area of the store to work in because it provides a bit more work/life balance than the other crazy retail hours of the sales associates, but the management is terrible. If you don't like change, retail is not the place for you."
good,"After 14 years of being self employed, I was hired as a seasonal employee for Macy's.  I went thru hours of virtual training on their computers and then a 1 day class of training.  When I first arrived for my shift, I wasn't sure of who to report too because I was just given a first name and there were several people with that name.  Second, when I did find the right person, I asked them what I should be doing, and they said, restock the floor which merch from the back.  So I did, and then was corrected constantly for what I had done.  So, then I asked management and they told me ""you'll catch on...""  LOL.  No idea what I was suppose to be doing almost on a daily basis.  Mgmt and senior employees would argue almost weekly, amongst other employees.  Very uncomfortable.  I also was not allowed key entrance to the building for my entire 4 months there, I even waited for almost an hour once to be let in to the bldg. in freezing weather.  I asked how can I get a key and was told by mgmt. that I need to report to work 30 minutes earlier to come in with others, without getting paid?... The only part of this I enjoyed was the discount and it was utter chaos every day, and wasn't worth it after all.  Was highly disappointed after watching their virtual training and 1 day seminar, the live floor is 150% different.  Chaotic."
good,management changes often. work becomes repetitive. Difficult to advance. great place to gain customer service experience.
good,"Retail Sales Associate"
good,"Management was questionable, NEVER thanked for doing a good job, Never told Thank you for working extra hours when needed, told only I could do a better job, sales, goals"
good,I worked for Rob may and it turned into Macy's then I quit. Not a great company.
good,"As a Sales Associates I greeted customers daily & offered assistance with purchases; Answer questions regarding sales & return policies, exchanges & item holding. During my shift I kept the store clean and orderly.  I maintained professional levels with all my vendors and was responsible for inventory records. In addition to my Sales position I was also responsible for handling all cash register duties which included balancing, depositing and all required reports."
good,Working at a warehouse making $8 hour is not a good thing especially with all the work we have to do. A few supervisors seem to be pretty cool and actually care about the workers. Other than that your on your own. Make sure you document everything that happens on the job
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I am a full time student and I originally signed up for part time hours. My schedule was always during times I had class so I had to part ways with this company. The management is careless and has zero appreciation for employees. I made the company over $30,000 in cosmetic sales in a year and 6 months, and gained no recognition."
good,"Typical work day relates to selling items and cleaning store.  Management lacks encouragement and training, employees are left to learn everything themselves."
good,"A typical day at work is starting your shift with asking your manager or supervisor, what are the duties that needs to perform for the day. Making sure that everyone is involved in getting those duties done. The hardest part in a job is other co- workers who's mot performing in their job tasks, the enjoyment is when everyone is doing their job."
good,Management does NOT care for their employees whatsoever. The Co-workers can be pretty petty and will argue in front of customers just for the sale.
good,I have devoted almost two years with Macy's and its just not meeting my needs. The hours are not a sure thing and the schedule could and will change in a heart beat without even being aware of this. I have no benefits on this job and would like to.
good,"Days are valuable and learned multiple tasks frequently very heavy phone communication and both written & verbal communications."
good,"Part Time Job, I only worked 15 hours a week, but I could see morale was low among employees"
good,"My experience of working at Macy's was very intense especially on the days of the big sales, lots of customers who needed my assistance to be satisfied with their purchases. I learned how to provide outstanding service and having patients. The hardest part of the job was encouraging my coworkers to meet sales goals on day the managers were absent. The most enjoyable part of the job was the able to receive recommendations from my customers on the Macy's website, who complimented my services and received rewards for it by store managers. "
good,put out merchandise and back stock merchandise and help other co-workers if needed
good,"Great place for those who are curious about other cultures. Macy's is more that just a store to some, but you could call it an institution. Representing the best model of american capitalism, you can find anything at Macy's at very reasonable prices, brand names, and great quality products. People from all over the globe dedicate a good amount of their vacation to come and experience Macy's. No doubt that it will always be an american, or international, tradition for years to come...The diversity of cultures among customers as well as employees make this an excellent place to acquire useful experience for years to come. "
good,Macy's was ok to work at..there was very little room for advancement in my position. 
good,I was hired during the winter season so my position wasn't a secure job but in the time I worked there I enjoyed my self and helping customers.
good,"I loved working at Macy's when i first started there, it was a friendly environment and a clean work place. But when it came to my work schedule, I wasn't given enough hours at all. Despite the fact that i was a part-time employee. During the spring season Mac's hired new manager that were just difficult to work with and exceptionally rude."
good,"The every day of driving sales is very exciting but can also be stressful.  In my 4 years with this company I have learned how to put my customers first and guarantee their satisfaction, offering the best product that fits their needs."
good,I wish they would hire me full time. Great atmosphere to work in all day.
good,"it was very difficult to work with my co-workers, because they was very demanding, but i learn how to control them, and focused on doing my job."
good,Kept me going from dept to dept. Make you earn the min. wage you receive. Wont let you stay in any dept. even though they promise otherwise early on. Highly supervised.
good,I really disliked this job it felt like a high school enviornment within the co-worker enviornment. I would NEVER go BACK!
good,Serve customers to find the products they are looking for. I Learned to listen to the customers and better serve their needs. The management was non-responsive to the work that you did. Coworkers were encouraging and helpful. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was serving the customers and helping them out.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Interacted and got to meet new people every day
good,"Some of my duties while working here included: Customer service, handling money, setting up clothing, maintaining clothing, cashiering, fitting rooms, opening and closing responsibilities, working closely with customers to provide quality customer service, and answering the phone."
good,"This job introduced me to the world of Commission also taught me about One to One Servicing with Clients , I build a Excellent Client Base that actually followed me to Sephora."
good,The days would go by really fast because of how fast paced it was everyday. The customers were diverse so I learned about different cultures.
good,Working in a salon is my dream job but like every work place this place has its ups and downs
good,"It is a nice place to work, fast paced, short hours, but there is no real job security there."
good,I would not recommend Macy's to anyone looking for a job. Employees are not their number one concern.
good,"Doesnt really care about the employees, not really worth the pay"
good,A typical day at work usually consists of assisting multiple costomers in satisfying their needs. I work in men's fragrance so I am recommending top selling scents as well as building connections with them.
good,"the hardest part about the job would be trying not to social with customers that asks questions. Typical day at work included but not limited to open/closing store, protecting companys assets by observing n repotying suspicious behaviors"
good,Loved working here. They need to do a better job on managing employees. Alot of employees leaving work to others.
good,"managment really dont help a lot, coworkers and nice and make you feel welcome"
good,The usual day at work was long and slow. Trying to sell things to people were the hardest because usually their response was that they were just looking when trying to ask them if they need help. The co-workers were okay when you aren't competing for commission. Also no discount unless you apply for a Macy's credit card.
good,This place has truly devolved into nothing other than a soliciting house for their high-interest credit cards (I mean 'rewards cards').
good,A typical work day for me would be covering an entire section alone with two registers to run and a sales floor. I learned about good customer service working there. Management was going through a bit of adjustments and it reflected a lot on the staff and the areas where there was no manager. Hardest part of the job was having to deal with rude managers who felt they didn't need to assist in management duties. The most enjoyable was working during Christmas and seeing the children write letters to Santa Clause.
good,"There was no adherence to company policy as far as professionalism goes, including sticking to the dress code- a simple task to say the least. There was no sense of respect between the salespeople and stock room staff in the shoe department, where I worked, or towards management in general. Even though I was only hired as holiday help, the pay was terrible and the hours were very inconvenient and not well planned. Often times, we were very under-staffed."
good,very poorly run management was rude and coworkers where not friendly
good,"*Check sales numbers ,"
good,Maintaining a neat and orderly sales floor. Assisting customers.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,A typical day at work would be handling customers as soon as you clock in
good,"Awful. Treated like a child, no job security. It would be fine for seasonal work, but it's very hard to make money with the commission scheme they have worked out. No unions. No real benefits besides a small employee discount. Someone called a ""Service Captain"" would hit on me and fiddle around all day passing out candy for good ""service."" If you were a good looking young man, you got a lot more candy. They fired my manger for accidentally leaving a sales case unlocked — even though she had nothing to do with it and was at company training for inventory that day."
good,"when going into this i did not think there was this going to be this step on your toes atmosphere. with everyone fight each other to make the most sales or ""you stole my customers type attitude."" The only people who shop at macy`s are the people who have a macy`s card. no one else. management got jumpy when you weren't trying to sell every person a card. other then that, the job was fun, i only made a few friends who were not trying to cut me off or try to make you feel like your in the way."
good,We had to be quick and always on our feet. We had to know where what designer clothing went to which rack. We had to navigate in a very narrow space.
good,"Assigned postion for the day cashier, customer service, and or back room. I learned how hectic it is around the holiday to sell as well as clean up staying open later the normal etc. Management wasnt the greatest but it suited me fine.My co workers where all hired as over flow for the season good people to work with. It was a nice flow job nothing to diffcult to complete."
good,Most of the co-workers there were very nice
good,"On a typical day, I would clock in, stock and face merchandise, clean, and prepare department for opening. Sell, sell, sell."
good,"I usually attend work early mornings, like two to three times a week. Its fast paced and always something to do."
good,"No advancement and low wages, less communication between the company and employees"
good,You need to punch in exactly or else they will punish you by not giving you a lot of hours. The full-time employees are really competitive and gossip a lot. There is a lot of competition in there and you get paid too little for all the work you do.
good,Managed new merchandise.
good,Most co-worker were nothing but drama. Did not like the pay. Hardest part of this job was having to stand for long period of hours but managed to do it.
good,"Ringing up customers, straightening and facing store. I learned how work with difficult customers. I had a great manager but he left and I did too. My co-workers were ok we worked pretty good together. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy items. I enjoyed the job more when we were really busy."
good,Macy's was a ok job for the first 5 months then as new employees began to come my hours was deducted and days was taken as well. Basically I went from 5 days 8 hours to 3 days for hours and being a soon to be father and student that wasn't working
good,I learned that not every customer is going to always be happy but it is your responsibility to change that once they walk in the store.
good,"If you are real desperate for a job, this place is for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere. The only good thing about this place is the fact that they pay weekly."
good,"A typical day at work can be fun but then could also turn into drama. I've learned that you have to really stay on top of your sales goals and commision because you may get ripped off on your check. Management can alright sometimes depending on who's the on-call managers for that day or night. My co-workers are gnereally nice but then can easily turn into dramatic indiviuals. The hardest part of the job is fighting for sales, but i manage it. I don't have a most enjoyable part of the job, but when you get that special customer from time to time who really appreciates all you've done for them. Then that's when i enjoy my job."
good,A typical day at work would involve: helping customers to have an easy going shopping experience and assist them in whatever needs they might have. I leraned that customer satisfaction is the number one priority when working with the public. The hardest part of the job is (in the worst case scenario) not being able to give the customer exactly what they are looking for.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,We have to help guests find clothes for all sorts of occasions. We have to get them to open up a Macy's credit card if they don't already have one. Overall it's a really calm and respectable place to work.
good,you get your daily sales goal. which you want to meet everytime. learned about retail and working as a team. most important the customer is always right. we were always looking out for each other with in the store. the hardest part of the job was gettting sacure hours. i mainly enjoyed helping the customer and knowing they left happy.
good,"Fast paced, multiple direction from management, lots of drama"
good,Utilized great management ablity and had tremendous opportunity to coordinate national charity events.
good,"overall my experince there was satisfactory,can't really say much about it."
good,"Retail sales, communication with customers, some co-workers are very nice to know and work with. Merchandising."
good,Loved working in the cosmetic field. It was a ton of fun working with people and making people over. Each day was definitely diferent and exciting.
good,I had a lot of fun doing this job but there was no opportunity to advance.
good,"Assistant manager do not  treat employees as she should be! Always getting anointing when is tome to help, and make employees feel stupid in front of the customer!"
good,Staff morake is at its lowest.This is componded by near arrogant style of managment. Honest and hatdworking staff are not fairly appreciated. Rewards eyeservice employees and gag outspoken employees.Tenumeration isnt commensurate with hard work put by industrious employees.
good,"Mandatory scheduling and positing in the stores. Must attend meetings with the staff and management but the motivation never was put into working with us. I could never find management when I needed them, and some of the long standing employees do not treat new employees with respect. "
good,"Customer service can be fun if you know your products and company policies.  You must provide equal customer service to all customers.  Ask questions because you do not want to give the wrong information.  Must be a fast learner and always find something to do (i.e. fold/hang clothes, organize cash wrap, restock selling floor from stockroom).  Always greet customers and make eye contact with a smile."
good,"Fellow employees were mostly pleasant to work with, though there was some malicious gossip. There were often long periods of boredom with nothing to do, with periods of frenetic activity in between. Busy periods were often understaffed. Breaks felt too short; didn’t help that the break room was so far away from most work areas and the purse locker. Management was generally understanding and helpful compared to other retail companies I’ve worked for. However, some managers told us that there would be few layoffs in winter 2017, but then they laid off all but the most senior employees. That was uncalled for, I think."
good,I have worked at macys for over 6 years and have not received the compensation that I'm worth. I'm putting in the work and driving results so this shows me that macys doesnt value their good employees. Our store in particular focuses more on hiring outside rather than training the good employees and investing in them. And essentially we have train those new people who do not have any macys knowledge but
good,"You don't get paid a fair amount ($12) for the amount of work you do in a disorganized 3 story store that for the most part isn't really organized. If you are the type of person that doesn't like to stand around on the clock and do nothing, be prepared to be taken advantage of especially when your managers feel that you are more capable than other coworkers to perform a task on your own rather than train them the proper way because we all work in the same department. All the other coworkers that play it ""smart""  get the easier task EVERYDAY (packing) leaving you with most of the responsibility (80+ item pick list in both stores!). I don't know about any other location but Green Acres isn't it."
good,Not to much to say. Hard to get promoted even when ypur qualified. The manager at Chula Vista has favorites. So it will ba hard to get promoted. Unless your her favorite.
good,"Do your 8 and skate, them people are not your friends. It might be some cool people that work there too but, you have to go through all the bad people to get to get to the cool people. People in there should come with warning labels. Lmao."
good,"This job was not what I expected after college. "
good,"Management inexperience "
good,"Upper management has little respect for people’s personal time or in creating a work-life balance or fostering an engaging team/environment. My actual job, I love, along with the people however there are so many additional expectations in addition to the actual job that it is impossible to get everything completed. There is also a significant difference in how people are held accountable and who is expected to do what."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Management does not follow up on team work and close their eyes to everyday problems. Responsible and dedicated employees end up overloaded with the work not done by colleagues who are not as dedicated. Excellent customer service is expected, but not properly appreciated. Not many opportunities in terms of career plan. They bring managers and supervisors from outside instead of promoting their own employees."
good,A typical day at macys is usually really hard and long. Sometimes it’s slow and there’s nothing for us to do. Some days were non stop working which is hard and stressful. I feel like it’s competitive and you’re only rewarded or recognized if you are friends with the supervisors. I learned this isn’t the job for me. i thought i would like it because of only working three days. Plus overtime if i need to or want too. Now there’s never any days to pick up . I would also like to work somewhere closer to me considering i don’t have a car right now
good,great people bad management and lack of synergy. has potential for growth but each role is a revolving door . you are pushed to the next assignment very quickly and barely anniversary yourself
good,if you are look to make some extra cash apply for the holidays or work there part-time. I wouldn't recommend working at Macys for full-time. The money isn't worth it & the company will work you like a dog. The customers are always right no matter how you are treated. More often than not a manager will not defend you. Get work elsewhere period.
good,"I worked at Macy's in Portland Or, Hawaii and Seattle. I was very loyal to this job but the management was not loyal to me. Though I had exceeded sales and all expectations the opportunity for advancement was never offered to be and was given to new hires that spoke another language."
good,"Management turnover is high. Every time we get a new manager, they ask ""How can we change the culture to be more fun?"" Well my answer, ""If u stay long enough, you might make a change"" We want to do better as a dept but no consistency in management= no consistency in employee performance and that is THE BOTTOM LINE. We need HR desperately or team will want to Unionize. Store Manager is great but no one wants to tell her the truth because no one wants to let her down. Wish they would bring back HR chats."
good,Good starter job I was able to pick my hours. You have to get along with everyone so you can be “liked” and get more hours or days you want off. Holiday seasons sucked obviously.
good,"Good job when there's a steady flow of customers. Sales module is great and it allows an individual the room to incorporate their personality into their sales style. "
good,"I was there for only the holiday at christmas time."
good,"Bakersfield supervision team leaders needs proper training, better work ethic and professionalism.  Promote based on skill not relationship with managers."
good,The Salary At Macy’s In Middletown is a Joke!  Macy’s expect too much from the staff with little to no compensation. Management very unprofessional with no solutions to their micromanaging. The Schedules do not allow room for staff to have second jobs. There is no room for growth.
good,"Allows for study and work-life balance. Excellent benefit packages. There will be promises of advancement but in the AP world there were very few. And if there was an advancement, the pay offered was not appropriate for the amount of work/experience."
good,One can hear different versions of policy depending on which manager you speak with. Store hours change or rewards change and you aren't made aware until it happens to you.  My supervisor rarely speaks to me. Most of management doesn't follow through and when you ask about it you are seen as a problem. There is only one supervisor you can trust to listen and follow through.
good,It’s an interesting place to work. The managers were very helpful. The training was also very educative. No unfair treatment of staff. But there’s no career advancement. They mostly employ managers from outside the organization. Also the salary is not worth it. The job is very tiring as you stand through out your shift except during break time.
good,"When it's busy, then it's busy and there's work, your day will go by fast. But, when its low or could be boring as i don't know what.....The day will drag..."
good,The manager was very difficult to work with. The staff that they had as a lead was disrespectful and unprofessional to the point no matter what they did the manager did not care.
good,"A part-time, flexible position allows you you to set your own schedule based on availability, but the available days/hours are likely to be irregular."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"When I first got this job it was cool. They Gave me a lot  of hours, but after the holidays were over they started acting funny with hours and management would not  reply to you in regards of there being any hours for you, and if there were hours they would call you late at night or last minute to ask you to come in the next day and some managers even get frustrated when you decline at such short notice. They try to make you take longer breaks than the actual state required you to do because they don’t really want to pay you. Managers edit your timesheet on insite without you knowing or without your permission, so when your paycheck comes in you’ll be wondering how you got so little money. They are very unorganized and when you about to leave for your shift, THEY TELL YOU, you have to stay without regards for what you had planned after work. If you don’t stay you probably won’t have hours for the next week.. that’s how manages get back at you. Queens center mall Macy’s play favoritism ALOT. Some managers are cool but for the most part i just wouldn’t work here again... mind you I’m still an employee but haven’t gotten a schedule in a month after being told by two of the top managers that they’ll look into it ...I’m so over Macy’s"
good,"When the store manager is away from the store all of "
good,Productive when things worked right learned how to scan for the items i needed for the orders learned how to drive a cherry picker learned where the items go to be picked.
good,Its a great company with extremely poor management. They do however leave a lot of room for growth. The pay could be better and it wouldn't hurt the security team to be a lot more alert than they are.
good,"Macys was an okay place to work but the pay is bad. If you're looking for something that can be stressful, annoying and competitive this is the job. Employees enjoyed stealing sales making it difficult for you to make commission I feel they should do away with commission"
good,"The job is easy but tiring. There are so many things to put back, large areas to cover, and there are never enough people. I worked there for two years and saw so many people come and go. Besides that, they expect you to always stay longer and help out. There are a lot of hours and a lot of work to be done. The discount was my favorite part! Employees receive 20% off and anytime you open up a Macy’s card you receive Macy’s money which can be used towards most purchases. The pay and raises and hard to get. Once they start paying new employees more the previous employees take a long time to catch up to that same amount new ones are coming in at. Macy’s is not discrete about it either. There are also a lot of visits where higher ups come and that is the only day that managers come around and truly help you and the area is well staffed."
good,"In this job, the Risk Management/Clams Department was unfairly compensated for the work the employees were expected to do and for the levels at which they were expected to perform"
good,"People are not cut from the same cloth. There are different abilities; different cultures, and personalities. Leadership expects everyone to be available; to work just as hard, and to put the company before anything else or you'll be shunned. Leadership needs to make sure everyone has read the Code of Conduct."
good,The working associates are very pressured. The managers are too pushy all the time. Never appreciate what hard work you do.They want you to only open credits every day.
good,Employees stood around played on cell phones or talking to one another instead of assisting customers or placing fulfillment orders.Macy's here closed
good,Typical work environment. Work more than you get compensated for. Difficult to advance in your career. It is not about what you know but about who you know.
good,This is not a good company to work for. They have Low pay and no benefits. I was only hired for the holiday season and had to leave for a better opportunity.
good,Macy’s Florida was a incredible company to work for. Good leadership! Good training and strong team work. Macy’s Florida belived in transparency and displayed a strong work ethic.
good,Low salary. Not enough for a single adult to live on. Not too many opportunities for ad advancement.  The managers and associates are overwhelmed especially during holiday season and often times no breaks.
good,"I worked for just couple of hours a week for less than a year as a part time worker; I don't have much to say. The company is a great company and works a lot to satisfy its customers. I really like the company but when it comes to the management, has limited or no value to employees. There is no fixed schedule so one can not have a self plan."
good,"The daily tasks at Macy's were repetitive. I learned customer service in this role. Management was stressed out as much as the employees. The workforce culture was diverse. Ironically, the customer experience was both, the hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable part of the position as well. Dealing with rude customers was the hardest part of this job; while on the other hand, customers who were appreciative of the effort that the employees made for them to enjoy their overall shopping experience was the most enjoyable part of it."
good,"I have worked in retail for most of my working career and, when younger it was okay to make 0.50 above minimum-wage and have 20% discount but, I also lived with my parents or had a roommate."
good,"The non stop ''One Day Sale!"" got annoying. Sale signs and prices would not match. Would not be able to hit sales goals on slow days. Seasonal managers seemed flustered all the time. Training was awful."
good,Managed the shipping and receiving operations during the graveyard shift. Managed between eight to ten employees and unloaded and fully processed between two to three 52 foot trailers per shift.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Inconsistant I can't really describe the warehouse it is very dusty and oh a few things I guess it's dark and a lot of stairs and heavy lifting it's a warehouse however I work in the office
good,"Macy's is a very unorganized company to work for. I worked there for a year and only saw the managers tfour to five times. The ""big"" managers that is. Because each counter, has its own counter manager, and there is also two floor managers. Freelancers are treated poorly and given minimal training; i basically trained myself on product knowledge and how to sell."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Macy’s. It was very stressful around the holiday season and I felt that as a seasonal hire, I was often given way too much responsibility. I was asked to come into work before sun-up multiple times and I couldn’t even get inside the building because my manager didn’t communicate well with me."
good,"Macy's,like all other company's, is making changes to move with the times and has to in order to succeed. But they don't think it through. They make drastic decisions without thinking thinks through, then when they don't work they do it again. As a company they keep hiring outside places to tell them how to fix things but never listen to inside people. This causes one of the worst attrition records of most of their competitors.  Every company has office politics but most companies don't try to hide it and pretend it doesn't exist. g"
good,"The work was repetitive and a bit on the dull side"
good,"You enter you clock in start duties such as count register for the day... After you either sell (cashier) attend to customers. Or (recovery) pick up clothes, clean fitting rooms, put LOADS of clothes back to clear dock which can take weeks. Also pick up diapers that people leave around and cups from Starbucks (Seriously)."
good,A typical day at work during the week was not busy but starting on Friday till Sunday it was productive.I can say learned that the things they mention in ORIENTATION was not accurate.The being able to advanced your career was not true.IT more depended on favoritism and less on your work ethics and also if you got along with your coworkers.The hardest part of the job was the lack of care for us employees at MACYS backstage we were treated unfairly and as if we don't matter until there was a potluck or a retirement party for an employee on MACYS and we had to bring some type of food.OTHER than that we were invisible and told to help MACYS workers to to recover in the morning or night shift.We never received help for any of the workers when we needed help.THE MOST ENJOYABLE PART was my co workers we all got the store ready for GRAND OPENING.Worked long hours on our feet none stop and our hard work really shows. Our communication and dedication to want our store to be great and be clean was something we all wanted to show.I can really say my coworkers were the best coworkers I have ever worked with so far.
good,"During the whole year, the work pace is languid. During holidays, every day goes fast, and it is very stressful as you need to reach your sales goals as well as to clean your department as during the holidays the whole store gets very very messy. "
good,"Always something to do, Never wasted time, every man for themselves, more than enough time to pick up and recieve the hours looking for although everyone i work with has a second job"
good,Fun place to work but very low pay. I knew people with years of experience and professional licenses who were barely making minimum wage. There was also very low work morale.
good,"Its a busy store, with the worst customer base. Customers will come in hoards on sale days (which is every weekend), destroy the place, and harass sales associates. There are two main problems, extreme under-staffing and bad management. Under-staffing means that employees are worked to the bone on busy days, stretched between trying to maintain department cleanliness and helping customers. Customers will then complain about messiness and lack of help. Management has a history of flip-flopping on store polices, enabling customers to demand unwarranted discounts and get away with dubious returns. When sales associates enforce ""policies"" but managers do not, it encourages customers to bully sales associates and make scenes in order to get what they want. "
good,"If you love retail this is the job for you. The expectation can be very high for your sales go. You only receive commission from certain departments (Men's suits, Fragrances, Cosmetics, etc.) When there is a slow day at the store, you have no control over the outcome. I loved being able to try on new merchandise and assisting customers finding clothing that fit perfectly. I am crazy about the One Day Sales. This is a job that you do out of a love for retail definitely not fo the pay."
good,"Good team work, good communication in the support team, helpful and caring manager. Flexible time, able to swap shift or cancel, good discounts at the end of the year."
good,Some days are very fast paced and others are very slow.  You do get to learn various different job roles.  Chance for advancement is there if you are in the right group.  I enjoy the people I work with.
good,The days were hectic. I was there during black Friday. And the place was a mess when I got there at 5am. Clothes were everywhere and by me being knew it took time to find where everything went.
good,"All of the people that I worked with at Macy's were wonderful. I did learn a lot on this job about working in retail. However there were often times when managers would disregard employee statements to customers about company policies and punish us for not doing what the customer wanted, despite this being against company rules and regulations. With that being said, Macys will bend over backwards to make its customers happy, and this makes trying to navigate the workplace a little difficult."
good,Working at Macy’s was not what It seemed. I got put on the girls floor so it was hard trying to help people find the clothes and tell them the right size. I couldn’t go in the fitting rooms until everybody was out.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I enjoyed working customer service and with the customers.  I enjoyed being moved to different departments to get an all around experience.  A typical day involved standing on floor, greeting customers, answering questions, trying to find certain items they desired, checking them out on cash register."
good,Hours are flexible if you are a flex associate. I have learned a lot about the merchandising end as well as how to communicate to management and customers and selling tools to use while assisting costumers. Management is very helpful when further assistance is needed. The hardest part of the job is balancing different jobs all at once. Creating a schedule and game plan for the day is helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is building great personal and professional relationships with customers and associates.
good,As a general rule in my experience they seem to favor younger employees over older employees.   The management is very very inconsistent.  However the pay and benefits are decent.
good,"I applied for the coat merchandiser which was okay first, it was actually hard at first because I was working by myself. After a few days, my manager wanted to switch me over to just Merchandiser which was a better fitting for me working with a team. I loved the work and getting up early was a good thing for me."
good,"would either process truck or set sale or markdowns depending on the day but only certain days would be there 8 hours otherwise only 4 hours a day. The hardest part is that the schedule changed everyday, lack of hours or getting more hours as well as working only 4 hours a day. Only enjoyable part was the people that i worked with"
good,"The hardest part of the job is to open macy’s credit cards, but the most enjoyable part is communicating with the customers and helping them find what they need. I enjoy talking to my coworkers making work more enjoyable."
good,"Majority of the managers are nice and welcoming and the rest feel like they have so much to prove by staying on you and hounding you. I'm in security, why would I want to steal? I get that sometime it occurs but not everyone is a thief."
good,"its okay for someone looking for a fast paced job, you learn more than ringing up customers. Holiday time gets pretty crazy and you don't get to choose the days you want to be off."
good,Good place with somewhat reliable hours however management is lacking. Getting paid weekly and knowing your schedule weeks in advance is a bonus. PTO is nice if only I was able to use it.
good,"Macy's is an ok place to work, provided you are not a sales associate. They ask a lot for the pitiful wage they pay, but there are some opportunities for advancement, you just have to work for it and it may not be worth it."
good,I enjoyed being both part time and full time at Macy's so I was able to work in varied departments and varied hours as well. Management was usually very helpful.
good,"The job is great for students who are in college, but the more you work there, your hard work is sometimes over looked and the more experience people get the credit."
good,"Job advancement became limited"
good,"A typical day at work would begin with all of the cashiers meeting together and trying to figure out who would be doing what that day. When the managers would casually show up several hours later, they would either scold us for not meeting our goals for the day, and would then disappear into his office for several more hours. Low-staffing was a big issues- we never had enough workers at any given moment. Instead of performing just out job, we would also do the work of three of more people. It was stressful and the management did not manage well, They received the praise from the GM when the cashiers who got paid minimum raise received nothing."
good,"The culture of Macy's is changing.  The work load in very challenging.  Many days we put in over 12 hours, esp on special events. It was a great experience I met many wonderful people."
good,"We can't seem to hire anyone long-term.  We are always short staffed."
good,"Macy's in theory is a great company to work for because you receive 20% of anything you get and you are the first to see the deals in your department. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,It seems to me that Macy’s doesn’t compensate the associates very well. It was my experience that there was a large turnover of employees. Some of the associates wouldn’t show up for work on their schedule day and would not call in.
good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's, and I wanted to continue to work there. But due to my PTSD I was not able to work in a certain department and when I spoke to my departments manager he never did anything about it and I continued to get hours scheduled in that department. At the end I had a panic attack because they were trying to force me to work in that department."
good,"This company tries to give us incentives, it may not always work. Not sure if it's the location or if it's company wide, some management need training in people skills. This company wants their employee to give their customers magic, then they should be willing to give their employees magic so it can trickle down.  Management should always back up their associate when they are right. they should stay firm with their policy and procedures."
good,Macy's is a decent starting point for entering the job market.However be mindful of the high turn over rate and new policies/ procedures in constant state of flux. Training sessions leave much to be desired.The pay is decent for the service provide.
good,Over the years the management was not good. There was less and less help. The atmosphere was not very pleasant. Managers were disliked by many. The managers would walk by you with an attitude and don't talk to you unless they need something.
good,"At Macy’s, if you’re really good - you’re not always rewarded.  Early in my career I was identified as a fixer.  Although, I was promoted every 10 months to a new role - many times it was considered lateral and not a promotion. No matter how are I worked, or succeeded at my job, I was left feeling that I’d be a sales manager forever."
good,"Too many hours, erratic and unfair scheduling often occurs, being assigned 10 days in a row , being assigned hours over your job description, not enough staff , expected to be in 3 places in store at one time to wait on customers, no benefits except a 20% discount and long hours."
good,"Macys is a fast-paced retail company. the coworkers are usually helpful and lively ,in which makes the workplace environment enjoyable. hardiest part of the day is the customer complaints and recovery of departments . management skills of simple 'good character' and business practices is scares within the company. there is little opportunity for advancement and rarely any pay raises."
good,"absolutely no work life balance. they expect you to answer emails, even on days off. text messages, pictures, files, are constantly being sent through use of our personal phones with no consideration for vacations or off days"
good,"An okay place to work for the holidays. There wasn't much to learn."
good,"They told me they would give me a full time position after my Christmas Seasonal Position was over and they just let me go, they did not give me the Position they promised me."
good,"A typical day at work was sign in, work and sign out. I learned how to fold clothes. The management could use some training in employee management. The workplace culture is very professional. The hardest part of the job is definitely working with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with difficult customers."
good,"I was only at Macy's a short time, but learned a lot about the department despite my training.  In other words, there was no training. I just kept asking questions until I think I drove my peers nuts!  I hired on at full time, but a family issue arose that I needed part time. The only solution management could come up with was to try to get people to take my shifts or 'call in'.  Calling in causes one to lose points and eventually you call yourself FIRED!!!!   There were three other people who worked on a VERY limited basis-once or twice a month-just to keep their discount. But they didn't want or couldn't give them my extra hours. In short...they don't work with you. Maybe I was a terrible salesperson???  Nonetheless, it's a week later and I have a new part time job of 24 hours and am making $2 more per hour.  All worked out for me in the end!!!"
good,First experience in retail which bridged me to moving on to other companies that require retail experience. Miss the discounts which are great perks for being employed with the company
good,They don't give out hours. The environment was very negative from employees to managers. There was no advancement for promotions. No really good benefits for you or family
good,Morning briefings are short as they should be. I learned that no matter if you are doing your best that it's better to know people. Work place culture-was ok but team work needs improvement. The hardest part of the job was keeping merchandise organized.
good,Macy's is good if you need a part time job. You gain experience with customer service. You are challenged to learn to communicate with all walks of life.
good,I would love to go back under different circumstances. The other employees were very nice to work with but I don't know if I'd go back only because of the pay as and the work
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"My employment with Macy's was following the immediate purchasing of a competitor. I gained great amounts of retail strategy and planning. During my emlpoyment I faced renovations, restructuring staff, event planning, brand concept roll-outs and so much more."
good,"I enjoyed the associates, most were long term employees. They enjoyed what they did and it made it easier for management. The retail market is unstable and most people with seniority were laid off."
good,"I did not like it at macys. low pay and got boring fast. in my experience there it was a lot of gossiping and that was not good either, but you may have a better one."
good,The hardest part of the job is the stress that comes with it. The best part about the job is the people who work at Macy's. Learned how to get better with customer service.
good,"I enjoy the Security Theft Control-Terrorist videos because I lack the  awareness that Warehousing, Sales and Cashier is now considered a dangerous job because due to our social climates. I enjoyed the knowledge gained working in a fast pace, policy strict and intense work climate for seasonal positions. When working for Macy's perseverance is a given and patience in a complex environment is a virtual. I was grateful and thankful to be picked as an  employee for such a renowned department store in the East Bay Area."
good,"not enough personal in my department ,unfair work load and low pay. not getting proper support from your immediate supervisors, lack of collaboration between department managers/ supervisors"
good,"You only get paid minimum wage, the managers have been there forever and never intend to leave, so there is no advancement opportunity.  They are always cutting hours so you can't make enough to pay the bills.  The only way to get the discount is by getting their credit card.  After working for the company for 1 year you qualify for their benefits."
good,"There really wasn't much to this job really. I never got enough hours for a break and when I did, my manager never told me when to take them. Most of the people I worked with were retired so they took their time and didn't really care about being promoted.I left because there weren't enough hours."
good,"Worked at Macy's for 3 years. First 2 years, manager was great and fair. I worked under commission and would be tough to hit weekly quotas. Some of the employees can be untrustworthy. Not so flexible with work schedules. I did enjoy the 1 hour lunches."
good,"It was a nice job to work at Macy's, however after 15 years new management came in and virtually kicked me out.  I did well with Sales but then they didn't treat me very well with my reviews for a small raise of 20 cents.  They were downsizing and closing stores."
good,Didn't matter if you left your shift in an ambulance you would get pointed and those points when toward disciplinary action and eventually termination. It appeared that the company was not interested in investing in long term employees. I do recall a woman getting pointed for leaving because her father died during her shift.
good,Working the cash register and interacting with customers and staff.  The training was very limited and the job at times was very slow paced. Enjoyed the opportunity to work in retail for the first time.
good,"Depending on the management team you work with, you can either excel or leave the company really quickly. "
good,"Nearly everyone I've met at Macy's has been very friendly, and I enjoy working with them, but the hourly pay is far less than we deserve.  Not only that, but the store doesn't seem to consider it their responsibility to make sure we have enough hours; one week, you will have plenty of work, but the next, you will have one shift, or none. I also fervently disagree with the decision not to cut ties with Ivanka Trump's company, since she is illegally profiting from her involvement in the White House."
good,"The hardest part is the sucking up to customers who complain about the prices because you don't have control over them."
good,For the most part Macy’s work load wasn’t anything difficult or abstract. The only thing I hated about that workplace was the lack of communication there was between the employees and managers.
good,Macy's is setup asseasonal work and has high turnover within the season. In working their two different seasons in two different deparments. they seam to have some good management on board. A good places if you nees some extra work around the holidays.
good,"very fast paced, good work hours, some of the managers were great to work for. I enjoyed my job. The hardest part of the job was all the standing in 1 spot."
good,Macy’s in Hernald square was horrible the guards would let anyone with a badge in and they didn’t know each employee by name you had to pick up shifts because it was seasonal
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I had a great experience working for Macys. I learned some new experiences. Looking forward to maybe working for them in the near future. Met a lot of great people.
good,"I worked in the clearance shoe department and it was fast paced, and stressful. the hours varied from week to week causing me to have to seek another part time job."
good,"Highly competitive"
good,"First thing I have to do is assign online orders to sales associates through our fulfillment system. Follow up with sales managers, to take upon the responsibility. "
good,"Benefit is a fun loving company, and the focus is to have fun. But the goals that they give you are almost unachievable. They want you to have a customer in your chair at all times, and if you don't they want you out traffic stopping. They will send you all over the store to try to pull customers. It's a good company to start out with in the cosmetics world, because they have a reputation of being hard to work for. It just seems like they ask a lot with out compensating well."
good,"A typical day at Macy's as a manager is all about juggling many hats. You have to go around the store solving customer service issues that associates are not about to do by themselves. While running your own department and making all sales and credit goals for the day. "
good,"It was a good part time job, taught me about working in clothes. How to fold the jeans, check fitting rooms , put back clothes & dresses. I also cashed people out for there purchases , as well as there Macys payment on there cards. Macys is a fun filled place to work & interact with the customers. During the holidays it’s non stop with the customers & cleaning the fitting rooms out. The only thing I didn’t like was the scheduling of people, they need to fix that. Working alone can be very hectic & hard."
good,"Good product. However, year after year I have seen Macys restructure with multiple lay offs. I have seen people I care about lose their jobs."
good,"Under paid and over worked! Very unorganized. I can honestly say I have had way better jobs. Great staff support, for those who are actually there or for lack of a better word, good comrade re.Its cool for part time but when you know your are meant for more and better, take that leap!"
good,Would not recommend anyone to work there as a store associate. Management has gone down hill-they overwork the employees that are actually hard workers and let the others slack
good,"Loved working here will try to work here again soon come next seasonal and will more than likely pick a new area to work in. learned how to pick and restock, management was acceptional."
good,"The management was pretty awful. They don't follow the rules to increase customer satisfaction. The pay was pretty poor (minimum wage). The employee discount is great. You are expected to work the cash register (do returns, purchases, payments on credit card, order merchandise) while recovering merchandise and the sales floor. The particulars of the job are fairly easy to pick up on. They are very flexible with availability during the week, so I highly recommend for students. Weekends are mandatory. You do get 3 unavailable days per a month. The main emphasis is opening Macy's credit cards and the magic score (customer satisfaction). I think if there was better management it would be a decent job."
good,"After spending 15 years at Macy's, I can honestly say I enjoyed the challenge and the opportunity to advance in a wide variety of fields. "
good,"Macy’s is a fun environment to work. But depending on which demartment, it’s not fun. As a sales associate, you are incharge of restocking the floor, helping customers, doing product consultation, cleaning the fitting room, and cleaning the stock rooms. Most of the time you are the only person in your department. It’s hard to take breaks because no one will cover for you, so you eaither leave your department empty, and get yelled at, or you wait far past any decent time and get yelled at for waiting too long."
good,"Working at Macy’s was an ok experience. It provided decent pay, but the coworkers aren’t the best and neither is management. Enjoyed my time there, but I’m looking forward to moving on"
good,"Was good for a temporary position, but working 430am-9am three days a week isn't something to live off of. There wasn't much advancement in the role either."
good,"Enjoyed making a connection with the customers . Coworkers could be very competitive which made the atmosphere very uncomfortable , managers did nothing to fix it and would show special treatment . But altogether it was a good place to work."
good,Macy's is a fast paced environment that teaches you structure and how to complete tasks while also multitasking. It is not a great job for people who have anxiety or aren't comfortable with fast pace. It is a great first job if you are starting out in retail and are looking to learn more about sales.
good,Working at Macys has been one of the most odd experiences I have had with an employer. It was the largest company I had ever worked for so I assumed that it would have been a lot more structured and employee friendly. Though during my time here it was confusing to say the least trying to figure out how I got paid. I spent almost 2 months haggling back and forth to finally get some information. After receiving that information my work life improved though no straight answers on whether or not I had a job available in the future.
good,"This was a great company to work for about 5 years ago but retail has changed drastically."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,At Macy’s it’s a good place to start and get experience but for a long term job I wouldn’t recommend them because the pay is unfair and on top of that the benefits aren’t that great
good,"Management is lacking design ideas and filled with hatred attitude. Good work environment.  The team I worked alongside with was a great team to work with. Extremely intense that is way more than just a a cut-throat.  Manager will criticize your every move until you are left with no confidence, basically they are lacking ideas with their brain-dead cell who thinks they are superior against you."
good,"Alot of work for not much money. Not really my speed and In the long run, you could get hurt doing this job. Some people might enjoy the idea of working this hard for $7.25."
good,"This is a good job for a short period of time. Anything too long and you'll become bored because while there is always something to do, it is not stimulating work, nor will it seem worthwhile."
good,"It was good they just didn't give me enough hours during summer school, because the job was meant for the mornings and that conflicted with my summer classes."
good,"After many years of positive experiences at Macy's, our district was assigned a DVP with a reputation for favoritism and poor people skills.  The work environment became untenable for many of us.  He has since been job eliminated."
good,The company  is a great place to start your career. However for growth and development it doesn't have much to offer. The opportunity for growth is almost none existing.
good,Ever Changing work environment glad it was constantly fast-paced and filled with customer service and customer appreciation. An interesting place to work at.
good,"Working at the flag ship store in downtown Chicago was very stressful. Demands on each and every new promotion (friends & family, pre sale, pink pony, Macys Credit Card, etc.) was never ending with no appreciation on achieving goals. Just punishment for not reaching goal."
good,"Could have been better if it was a bit more organized. "
good,Working for macys has become very stressful. Unrealistic goals are set for the management and support staff. over the last few years the workload has increased yet the productivity rate has decreased although I enjoyed the work I just cant do it anymore. The stress level runs high when you work for Macys
good,"While this is an excellent starter position, seasonal employees are not treated with same respect as permanent employees. There is little to no job security within the company."
good,Coworkers were great. The work environment was divers. There was little communication between upper management and lower management. HR was amazing at scheduling.
good,"this was a seasonal job with the possibility of being hired on. However, at the end of the season only a couple of people were hired on. I never knew who was in charge or who to report to. they treated us like the bottom of the barrel."
good,"I was in the housekeeping department,so that could be stressful at times. I found a job closer to home and in a field I had more experience in. New company also had a much higher salary. So I gave a two week notice. I would consider returning to the company,but the store nearby has since closed."
good,Don’t work as a season worker at Macy’s because they won’t give you any hours unless they need you. Iv’e been working there for two weeks now and have only gotten a couple hours of work
good,"Too many chiefs, all managers want to be he head chief. Worked over two years and the store manager did not know mine and a few others name. What does that say. It's all about their Magic. One hand does not know what the other hand is doing. Hence different managers giving different instructions. Some of them just do not know how to speak respectfully to employees. Most of the employees friendly and helpful.  Can always manage time off."
good,"waiting on customers and cleaning up after them with a smile. low pay, not the best management but not the worst. its ok but its not for me. a job is better than no job."
good,"The job at Macy's was not good.  Not enough training.  There are too many customers, and not enough cashiers.  It was very hectic and chaotic. It was hard to get help when needed from a supervisor."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The day was sometimes unprofessional and as a supervisor, the workers were not always friendly - conducive to the type of work..  The employees were not always friendly and should not be working in the retail business."
good,"I loved my job at Macy's. However I expect my manager to behave as a hard working employee. Unfortunately working the make up counter, I saw a lot of managers actually initiating work drama and hardly ever working hard setting an example."
good,"The overall company culture is very positive and engaging. There are wonderful benefits offered at Macy's. When retail's business does well there are much more engaged employees, but when retail's business is not doing well there are times when office moral is down. It's difficult to stay positive when the management within your team is fighting for the hopes of good business results."
good,"A typical day at work for me is usually fast paced, but what can you expect in a manager position.Everyone is a big family so it all flows pretty well. You have those supervisors that are terrible but your there to do your job; not please everyone"
good,"This is a job that I would recommend to someone that is currently going to school and has to pay bills and rent. However, I do not encourage people to make it a career or when you have a family, you never have a set schedule and of course no holidays off."
good,"•	Retail Sales Associate, responsible assisting customers selecting Men’s clothing and matching colors shirts and pants, ties. Also responsible as a cashier for Men’s Department. Cleaning up unfolded clothing and placing them in the correct department and folding them correctly"
good,I work there for 3 years and had mostly good co-workers. The discounts were good and I liked the interaction with the most of the  customers. short distance to drive to work.
good,This Macy's department store was located in the local mall.  I love given customer service and receiving feed back from the public.  I've learned a lot.
good,"Low pay.a lot of work, hardly any rest,always have to be producing,but not compensated well.half an hour lunch."
good,"Due to Macy's administrative changes,  remodeling, and part-time assignment at this time it would not be fair to give them a fair assessment. The position was diversified, face pace and multi tasking, with regret the lunch like all other business are short-coming."
good,"Sometimes it was stressful especially during holidays."
good,I worked for a store in Idaho for a few months.  The sales system is a joke and unless you have a wicked right elbow to defend the registrar you can kiss your sales goodbye.  girls would do anything to steal your sales including refuse to ask the customer who was helping and just give themselves all the credit.  Also the cliques of the different departments was unbelievable.  Management expected you to learn by yourself on a dummy computer in a closet or just ask your coworkers who you will find out are even more clueless than you are. They didn't even set up my employee discount for the months I was there.
good,Macy's was just a clothing store with a other household items. Environment was competitive and high stressed. Overall my review is that it was just my first official job and that's about it.
good,Working with Macys' you meet many people and learn to work through a fact-paced work place. You learn to build clientele and can grow within the company in various different departments.
good,This is a good place to earn supplemental income or extra income while in school. Early morning hours but work schedule varies week to week. Inconsistent team effort make goals difficult at times.
good,Not enough employees to perform work load hours. I felt there was no positive feed back from management. They did not honor my schedule after hired. Worked many 10 hour shifts and they expect a 45 minute  lunch and no breaks.
good,I would not recommend working for this company at this current time if you are looking to become part of management and are hoping for a company that will offer longevity.
good,Good job for someone who needs extra money. Lunch hour based on how long you worked that day. store was understaffed. Around the holidays new employees were placed on store floor.
good,"To me the most important thing is to keep the customer happy.  To do your very best to keep the customer coming back for the service they receive was OUTSTANDING.  And to make the customer feel important, that it matters to you, and once the customer hangs up the phone, and smiles, for as a customer rep., you just made their day."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I needed a job and it filled the needs. I only worked there for 3 months due to the fact that I had to return to school.  However, I worked there long enough to see that that's not where I'd like to be long term."
good,"Exciting campaigns, high workload, no work life balance, leadership does not listen to anyone but themselves, which has caused a lot of their woes.  Amazing co-workers, dynamic environment, hardly a raise, benefits are minimal now."
good,I enjoyed working here but had to leave due to having surgery but would not have been able to live on the pay anyhow. It was only minimum wage and did not receive many hours except during Holidays.
good,"A typical work day is very efficient you usually get all your work done by the time you clock out. "
good,Too stressful & poor leadership. The person that was leading my team; was always to busy to really engage with us. It seemed like she always had something else going on.
good,"I enjoyed it, not worth getting overworked and under paid. It's only temporary. If you're in school it would be good for you but if you have bills you'll be pushing it."
good,"Working for Clinique's Counter is very competitive. You have to be quick thinker and know who to work in a stressful environment."
good,"The workplace is productive. It can be overwhelming sometimes but if you enjoy selling shoes, (like I do) it's the job for you! The hardest part of the job would be the hours we have to pick up because shifts are dropped left to right."
good,"My ordinary day would be helping each customer individually to get the perfect fitting items I learned how crazy the inventory was in the shoe department, but after three weeks it was cake. The management could be more attentive to their employees and not just the customer."
good,Get paid based of off commission and per hourly. It's an okay job but if you don't like being face to face with people then this is not the job for you
good,"A typical day at work could vary depending on or off sales How to use there terminal program.Management is a quick turn over.Being in a open mall there was a lot of lookers rather then potential buyers.There was really nothing hard about the job,sales is what i like doing as well as meeting new customers which is the most enjoyable part of the job!"
good,"fresh out of high school job only, over all retail is a bad job. Customers are rude, especially in the rivergate location in Nashville, TN. The work is tedious, but its an easy job to get and its not minimum wage."
good,"It has its days, mangers aren't really nice and they do a lot of favoritism. working here I've learned a lot of customers service."
good,"Work is simple once you get the process down. Management is average at best. Many don't know what they are doing and in turn are unable to properly train their associates. Only focus on what affects their review, instead of the company as a whole. Different departments, while working for the same company, do not work together since their review metrics differ and do not coincide with other departments for the most part. Best part of my job is the team I work with and the associates I interact with. Hardest part of the job is getting management to see how bad and inefficient some processes are."
good,"With respect to retail sales, which as recent news reports have shown is rapidly declining, this is not for those looking for a sustainable career. I'd say it's much more preferable to other retail sales environments in that, comparatively, it's not as grueling. The arena of commissioned sales fosters a lot of politics among associates, especially seasoned over new hire. However, being competitive or even cutthroat is necessary if you're focused on commission. Again, it's retail sales and so, as with any other industry, you have demanding consumers and demanding management to negotiate with. There's also a seemingly high turnover rate."
good,Management works off the back off salesmen. Salesmen are left to handle all the hard work with little assistance from managers. This company is going downhill.
good,Macy's is a great place to work.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the co workers. There was nothing hard about the job. The pay was low and there really isn't opportunity to advance.
good,"A typical day at Macy's would consist of me checking customers out and assisting with wedding registries. I learned how to do returns and exchanges. I also, learned how to set up wedding registries. The management was extremely friendly. I do not know much of the workplace culture because most days I was by myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers shop."
good,I prefer not to give my opinion of Macy. Some people enjoy working there and others do not. Depends on what department you work in. I have learned a lot from this company.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"low paying job and very worried about sales goals and credit cards. very hard to get a supervisor when needed and get certain days off when they are requested, hardly any room to grow"
good,"It was fun at first but then they give you less and less hours and for having to drive 45 minutes to get there, 6 hours a day doesn't cut it. Wouldn't suggest it."
good,"Although everyone around myself and I thought I was doing great, I could not seem to move up to a reliable full time position. I learned a lot from the beauty advisors and how to's. Management favored people at my location, so that seemed to make it harder as well as all the cuts going on, it seemed as if they chose people they could pay less."
good,"One great thing about Macy's was there flyer discounts, coupons and employee discounts. Yu can get items for almost nothing, that was great thing. I also had a great boss."
good,"Work was usually fine, we were short handed a lot of the time. Management was pretty great overall. Our hr woman barely knew what she was doing and one of our managers is known to keep employees with a closing shift(9:15) over for anywhere from 20-35 minutes. Otherwise I enjoyed most of my time at Macy's. My coworkers were awesome, very easy to get along with."
good,"I was in the cosmetic department, but floated from one company to another.  I did't work for any particular company,  It made it difficult. Then I moved to Florida, Macy's didn't have any opening even though they had a sign to apply for a job in Cosmetic."
good,"Was told they would work around school yet they constantly scheduled me to work on days i told them i am unavailable, Left out a lot of information as to what the job entails that if i knew before applying i would not due to the 10.50/hr pay."
good,"* Several meetings each day"
good,Top Store Execs need to attend Management 101. Allow staff to transfer and move to another store.  Makes for unnecessary turnover and the loss of experienced staff.  The people overall you work with are nice. Most managers do their best for you.
good,I actually like working here. It's a great place to be. People there are super nice except they don't get paid enough. This is one of the many thing that bothered me.
good,"Key Notes:"
good,"okay company to work for. higher management doesn't care about their managers. they teach customer service, 100% of their value goes towards customers."
good,This is a good place to start in management to get your foot in the door.  Employee appreciation is not always shown due to the lengthy hours and physical demands on the body.
good,"I would come in and set merchandise out on the sales floor before the store opened. I would rearrange the merchandise set ups for what ever sale was happening that day or week. I would assist customers when the store was open. I also helped with signing the merchandise, making sure that sales and prices where correct. I would help maintain stock rooms for easy access to new merchandise that would come in each week. I worked well the other employees and upper management. the hours were not that great, was very hard to find a day care that opened before 6 am. The pay was not that great considering I have many years experience in retail. I felt underpaid for what I did in that company. the things I liked were the employee store discounts and the food court discounts in the mall."
good,"I worked in the one on plaza bonita they were not coordinated and had us working excessive hours, Were careless about peoples schedules, adding school and children activities."
good,This was the 1st call center I have ever worked at and will probably be the last. You only got promoted if the managers liked you I was there for almost 4 years and watched as others around me got promoted and there I sat trying and hoping. Major favoritism going on.
good,"They will throw employees from department to department regardless of their strengths. The pay is bad, and work is either boring or stressful, but never fulfilling. Management is deer-in-headlights dismal."
good,Macy's was an ok place to work.  They moved most corporate jobs to their home office on the east coast.  Benefits at the time were not great.  The office space was old and out dated.
good,"Well when I first started working here back in 2015 it seemed like a good company to work for.The store was always busy.Fellow employees and management were friendly.The beginning of this year 2017 that all changed. It has been in the news that the company isn't  doing so well. So with that ,changes have been made.My job used to be great. I would go in and know what I had to do and I had a great boss to report to. Well there were cut backs recently and I don't have the same boss to report to and I don't receive clear directions anymore.When I try to ask management questions I get brushed away.So now it seems management doesn't want to be there to help their employees anymore.The workplace culture seems to be a very melancholy demeanor.People aren't as friendly as they use to be.You don't feel very happy going to work anymore.The hardest part of my job now is not always knowing who I report to and having to deal with more tasks do to due to changes that were made in the company. Sadly the most enjoyable part of my job now is when I get to leave for the day. What I learned is don't take people or your job for granted because it can change and not always for the better."
good,the management really didn't give much direction which is a problem because there were new employees daily. we would often get backed up from doing others work.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macys makes you do work like a parcel company but pays you less. The company is really a great brand for shopping but the discount and the work is not worth it.
good,"A fast paced environment, very much responsibility and high expectations, not much of a work/life balance. Enjoyed working with new associates and delivering outstanding customer service."
good,Its a good start when you have no experience. After learning about your job and your able to teach others it makes the experience satisfying. There should be more room for growth within the company.
good,"It was not the best place to work, but it was not the worst either. Management pretty much left me alone to do my job because they did not have to babysit me but I rarely worked with anyone and spent most of my time alone cleaning out the fittingroom and helping customers find things which was pretty monotonous."
good,"- Your typical day at work consists of helping/ringing customers to complete transactions, issuing returns, running go-backs, clearing the back counters and cash wrap, greeting and assisting customers on the sales floor, processing damaged items, opening Macy's credit and Plenti rewards cards, and checking assigned fitting rooms every hour. "
good,This job was a good place to start off but not good for permanent work. As far as it being my first job it taught me a lot as far as the typical things that go on in a work place other than that it is not a good place to stay
good,"Working in retail should be fun, exciting, and engaging. However, with convoluted sales promotions, over-worked executives, and under-paid employees....it can be quite the opposite. A typical day at work starts with not enough sales staff, continues with annoyed customers (can't blame them), and ends with swollen feet. The hardest part of the job is knowing what can be done to be successful but not having the resources (or hours in a day) to accomplish it. The best part of the job is being able to satisfy your guests; making genuine connections and ensuring that they had a pleasant experience. Retail life is not for everyone...you need to be built for this!"
good,A typical day at work is helping my manager maintain the stockroom making sure everything is running smoothly. Working at Macys taught me how to become a leader.
good,"typical day was filling in products from the stock room"
good,"A typical day at work involved ensuring the department was properly organized and stocked the newest merchandise being displayed on the mannequins. I also worked as a cashier and called other stores for customers to see if certain items were in stock, as well as monitor other departments in case an employee needed to temporarily be relieved for break or lunch."
good,"The managers and other associates were friendly and somewhat helpful. Some more than others. I've never worked in retail before so it was a good experience. The most enjoyable part of the job would probably be when you actually get a decent human being for a customer and they thank you for being helpful and some understand that you're new. Other customers will try to take advantage of that. If you're new then some of the people who have worked there longer will make you do most of the work and just stand there. Had one girl in particular always ask me to help our co-worker while she stands there and complains about hours or other people. If you ever read that they'll make you do one day of training or both days then throw you on the floor its true. Luckily i had both days but it still didn't help since my training and my actual schedule were not close. i was hired in September, training was in October, and my schedule started in the middle of November but i could pick up very few hours in October. I Would definitely recommend bothering co-workers if you have a question or to ask for help when speaking to a customer. (sometimes if you're new they will not take what you say seriously unfortunately) if for whatever reason your ID doesn't work when you need to enter through the dock tell managers and HR repeatedly if you have too. I told HR and they did nothing. Other people had the same issue where their ID wouldn't work, told a manager, and then had to fill out paperwork. I never got that option except when the system didn't clock me out. I'd recommend writing the pass codes down"
good,"It was okay."
good,"standing trying to sell even when no one is around"
good,"When I started to work there, it was Kaufmanns. After about six years, the company was bought out by Macys Department Stores."
good,"assisting customers, restocking, cleaning, makeovers."
good,"I received horrible hours, the pay was decent. I was let go without any notice, management was inconsiderate, with nasty attitudes. Worst work experience I've had."
good,"I worked as a flex associate, which meant i picked up my shifts. Half of the supervisors aren't helpful, no raises unless you move up, which is hard. Co workers tend not to help or take lunches accordingly. Missed out on interviews because of this. Training is long but teaches you everything you should know. Good perks, such a ""Macys Money"""
good,"Most people who apply for Macy's think that they don't have to do anything except ring peoples transactions up. Macy's hires sales associates which means you answer customer questions and you clean up after them. You help with the over experience people receive when they shop at Macy's. "
good,"management sucks."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The expected policies for employees are only upheld when the management wants to use their lack of application as a means of firing you.
good,"If you are at school they work with your schedule"
good,do not work here it is very messed up did not like working here at all constant problemss no help avoid if possible macys does not guarantee alot of hours and they do not pay fair wages
good,"Even Seasonal workers have more benefits than flex! (like higher pay, sick pay, and flexible scheduling) Just be mindful that THIS IS A RETAIL JOB. But because this company doesn't have much coverage on the sales floor, you may get hired. The majority of the people who work there including management is middle aged and much older. Not a problem to me personally, just many personalities. Also, the volume doesn't increase unless there is a sale or until the afternoon. Continue to work on other things or the managers WILL nag you. I am thankful that I have flexibility in my schedule, and I also enjoy that there are people my age that I can relate to."
good,Great job if you like to work hard. Productive positions.learned more about dock work. Which I really enjoyed. But a little unfair at times. Good candidates for better positions get stuck teaching someone else who doesnt know anythibg about the position
good,Acquired experience in the cosmetics field and became accustomed to signing loyal customers up for a Macy's credit card to ensure they never stop shopping with the company.
good,"It was good learning about clothes, jewelry and making new friends, learning more and getting more customer service skills"
good,It's a great place to work if you just need a job. If not the customer  are rude and the management and everyone in charge put in before you your needs are not important it's always about the customer customer customer sale sale sale and every time you turn around I want you to open Macys cards with these customers you may not believe in open in the Macy's card but some people have been fired for not making their goal opening Macy's cards another thing about working at Macy's is they call you on your days off but when you meet them to give you a break or ask for a grievance date they can't help you
good,"It is a basic retail job.  Used to be fun selling merchandise, but with all of the added static like selling credit, promotions, etc... it became less fun and more stress."
good,"Work was pretty straight forward however, we were often understaffed and given too many tasks for one or two people to handle. Not only did we run the registers, but also maintained the department floor at the same time which often proved difficult if working by yourself or with one other person."
good,Macy Logistics was a very good place to work with the experience gained. Downfalls of the workplace is simply the lack of advancement and managerial conduct.
good,"Okay job to gain experience. "
good,not really good hours. you typically do not get all 40hrs. coworkers are very friendly. Helps with your social skills. Very relaxed environment. Simple and easy
good,"Macys was an okay job but to slow paced for me if we were slow the time would go by so slow and after cleaning your department, you basically have nothing to do."
good,Love my coworkers. Macy's employees some very talented people. The manager of the fine jewelry department is so knowledgable about Macy's and even more about fine jewelry.
good,"At Macy's you are empowered to assist customers, and exceed their expectations. Co-workers are helpful and very pleasant."
good,"A typical day at work would be getting to work and doing your job quickly and efficiently."
good,"I would clock in at the register at the beginning of my shift in the handbag area or whatever department I was working in that day. I would help customers find what they were looking for based on whatever department I was working in that day. There were managers for different departments in the store and one manager who was in charge of the whole store each day. Management was not always helpful when it came to training the associates, they basically threw you on the sales floor and expected other employees to train you. The hardest part of the job was getting customers to open up a Macy's credit card. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different people every shift."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The management does not back you at all.  No room for advancement the pay is low for such a dangerous job do not recommend for what they expect you to do they need to at least pay 12.00 a hour.
good,"While Macy's is indeed a place where the fashion world comes alive in their associates, vendors, and loyal customers, the inside world as a company is shameful. I was a devote associate of Macy's for coming on two years before my last day, just a few days ago. I resigned. The management at Macy's, from the top to the sales mangers in the stores is horrible. There was NO store manager when I left and the assistant store manger said to us one morning in our ""Morning Rally"" that we were ""disposable"" and that the company is a ""revolving door"" and basically if we are not happy we should leave! Can you say WOW? The ""morning rally"" is set to encourage and inform the employees and he abused it. The managers do not care about you having a personal life outside of the company. They even go as far as punishing you by trapping your schedule or not coming through with a schedule wish if you do not work when they feel they need you the most. I like the culture of Macy's and will admit that their deals kept me excited to present the store as the best for designer clothing to our customers, but from the point of view as a sales associate, I saw that there was no wonder why the company is down 200 million dollars in sales. They are unorganized and unmoral, mainly care about keeping dollars in the higher managers pockets than they care about making sure the ones at the bottom who actually operate the stores are happy and taken care of. Avoid working for Macy's if at all possible."
good,"Good money if you work hard. Hours Add up really quickly around winter time. Music, with one headphone in is allowed. Met a lot of great people that have helped me in my personal life."
good,Macy's has several people from several backgrounds and successfully is able to make the company feel like a family but the one thing is that it is not a progressive company and they are very political.
good,Nice people and place to work but minimum wage and very busy.  Always on your feet and by yourself.  Can be very hectic.  A good experience.
good,"i worked with this company for a year within the shoe dept. At the end of the fiscal year I had made the company 100,000 in sales which was very exciting. When this number was compared to my yearly salary after working 20-30 hours a week I had only made 9,000 roughly. This was disappointing because i didn't feel i was compensated correctly."
good,i first started off as a temp i advanced and got my way in to a on call sales person but i mainly enjoyed working there because of the people i made friends with they made it bearable
good,"typical day at the store was helping customers check out at the cash register. management was okay. co-workers were great, had a great relationship everyone very helpful and friendly. Most enjoyable part of the job were the early morning rally's and the store parties we had."
good,Execute weekly markdowns of old merchandise to make room for new inventory. Set up projects for new inventory and for holidays. Process fulfillment orders by locating and packing up the merchandise for customer orders.
good,The best part of the job was walking around and engaging customers making small talk with them to see what there needs are for coming to store.
good,OK it was one of the worst and dramatized jobs i have ever had in my entire life. it was just to little pay for all the work they have you do. thin clothes are so hard to fold back up as soon as you get your area clean customers knock it right back down in a heartbeat.
good,"I would start my day counting and opening the register in my assigned area, then would proceed t print and fill on line orders and put them in designated area. Then the store would be open for business, I would meet and greet all customers within 10 feet made eye contact and offered any expert assistance needed. Managers there were for the most part nice, but definetly over stressed, and not always able to share certain promos in a timely fashion, as I took it upon myself to go to the website every day to look up codes and such to give all customers the chance to save. The hardest part of the job for me was standing on my feet all day, not getting the necessary coverage for meals and breaks when needed, due to lateness or callouts, which a good pair of shoes helped with tremendously"
good,"I first took this job knowing that it was seasonal. I would arrive and do my tasks required by me while assisting customers to my best ability; which wasn't bad at all. Most of the customers were friendly and happy. Unfortunately there was a lack of training. I wasn't the only complaining about it. Also the management didn't acknowledge anything else you would go out of your way to do, but, rather, they only focused on your sales numbers. I shouldn't say that because they would notice if you weren't doing something and then in that case you'd be reprimanded."
good,The best thing about working for Macy's is the discount on clothing. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting with different carriers
good,"Enjoyed working there, at the time, I worked with some great people and mgrs. I had a hard time with scheduling, there was a problem with the new system"
good,The pay is below the average amount of work a person is responsible of doing. It is minimum wage. The discount is good. The workload is extremely heavy.
good,"I do not like having to wear all black all day every workday. Despite the fact that you work on your feet, you are not allowed to wear anything other than dress shoes. There is a big push to sign customers up for their credit card. The hours can be ridiculous during the holidays."
good,"A typical day at work would include talking to customers, selling merchandise, and keeping track of sales.  The hardest part of the job was fixing problems customers would have, however, this was a necessary part of the job."
good,"It's a very stressful environment. Being a sales associate at Macy's requires you to do more then greeting costumers and ringing them up for their purchase. You have a sales goal everyday which makes it stressful to meet and also it brings a lot of competition with your co-workers which tends to bring a lot of arguments. You are also required to open credit, 1 card for every 20 hours you work. Also for events you have to sell coupons. You have to clean the fitting rooms and it's always a mess, it makes your back and legs hurt. Their coupons are not very specific which means you'll get a ton of angry costumers asking for a manager which makes them more angry because managers usually take sometime to get there. Also there is something about the shoppers at Macy's that make them feel like they are above you and your are there as their servant, so every now and then you'll get grumpy one's that will treat you like you garbage. The pay is low, if your older you will get good benefits, but if your working for money this will not cut it for you."
good,"The macy's at metro center can be hard to work at sometimes."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I worked there for several months packing orders for shipment during busy season. Macy's is a good company. Its hard to get hired full time.
good,sales associates have many task the most rewarding is giving customer service. Having a person leave the work place with a smile on their face.
good,"Macy's had given me a position where i had to choose my hours online and was not given a definite schedule. this was good in the beginning, where i was working about 20 hours a week (my desired hours). But a couple of weeks later it was a struggle to even get 4 hours. I had talked to management and it was like pulling teeth trying to get a little extra hours."
good,It's a retail job. expect to work every weekend. Holiday's and random shifts. Management isn't personable and is always looking to cover their own instead of doing what is right and driving employee moral. Dealing with most of the managers is like dealing with middle school kids. Sales goals and work load are unrealistic. Never staffed appropriately.
good,"Macy's is wonderful, but trying to get the scheduling right is a mess.Other than that, I love helping people find what they need."
good,"Although Macy's is a great place to shop, it's also a great place for those who are either just entering the work force or retired. I have made a lot of friends at Macy's and have really enjoyed working with them and the customer's as well. "
good,"All about the numbers more-so than personal growth and development"
good,"Fun place to work I just needed more hours and more pay"
good,"Coworkers are usually friendly depending what department you get. Hardest part of the job is having your manager scold you or get on your back when you don't meet their credit goal and not understanding when there are 5 people working a dept. and only 2 registers or a slow day and want you to work on all the go-backs. "
good,Flexible work schedule. Sometimes hard to pick up hours. Sometimes short handed must work two departments at once. No full time positions available
good,"It was a pleasure working for the company for 3 years. There were some good and bad times. There was room for advancement, The hard part was probably when there were call outs on a very busy day. Which more than likely made that the hardest part about working there. The enjoyable part was making the customers happy with providing excellent customer service."
good,macys is a great place but you have to be good at getting majority of the customers cause to make your paycheck better u have to get alot of commision
good,Overall a good company to work for. Staffing was always an issue and the pay was not enough to compensate the work performed.
good,"A  day of keeping area clean and organized Making price goals and getting credit card applications."
good,"extremely busy, micromanagement, misguided direction. poor leadership, more about the numbers not so much the people."
good,working at Macy's proved to be a very challenging job. dealing with the customers and keeping the floor clean was an everyday task. often times customers are rude and some even will try to get you in trouble for things that are out of your control.some managers are not as professional as they should be and that also applies to some of the employees. Macy's is an okay place to work if your are looking to only have a job for a short time. it is not a long term position especially if you have major bills to pay.
good,"Its like any other retail outlet, it has its flaw but you just have to make the best of it and do the job you signed up for."
good,The company doesn't have a great deal of respect for its' employees and doesn't ask for our input on things. The pay isn't great but it's retail.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"receiving merchandise, organizing and putting merchandise in display or stock rooms  "
good,I like working at Macys the only problem that I have is that there really is no opportunity for growth. the people are great to work for but for the work the pay is not enough
good,"Loved everything about the Burdines years. It was a small company and everyone was down to earth. Policies were good and no politics were involved. Once Macy's took over, everything changed"
good,"A very classy retail job with high quality employees, managers and customers, however, not much opportunity is given to those who desire to work in a different area or to move up."
good,"opened register counting drawer"
good,"Long hour"
good,The people are wonderful and even your bosses are great people. As with any job some thing could get better. More staff! cashiers or a person to keep up on fitting rooms. In some areas needs to be all the time. locking of hours given within a short time was not good they got better about that towards the end. Not ever being able to get a pay raise as flex was a horrid thing as if i was worth less than the others i worked with some i work longer than helped teach the ropes etc. They need to change that also no paid time off no vacation nothing as flex; it should build maybe with hours worked or years even. I liked working with the customers helping them. It got crazy in kids jr etc school time home coming dresses etc. I like the faster times like that and x mas. Hardest part of the job was being made to work Black Friday in a store you find more employees than customers in at midnight till about 11 am on thanksgiving into Black Friday. very few line up for a sweater more go to places like best buy bigger ticket items etc and come to a place like Macys later in the day but is there money spent so they open as they wish. You are so sleepy trying to stay up all night for a minimum of a 12 to 13 hour shift or you can do a split shift that you can't think right half the time falling asleep standing up. Mostly at this type of job are not used to night shifts so working a shift like 3 am to 3 pm is a killer.
good,This was not bad for a seasonal/holiday position but it was quite a clicky group and competitive too! I enjoyed helping the customers on a daily basis! I did not however enjoy having to work a 10 hour shift on Black Friday that was mandatory may I add I couldn't pick a shorter shift at all! Was glad it was only one day but wow! Other then that the hours were pretty variable and flexible and other then the odd scent they pumped in through the air vents that made my allergies on full alert every time I worked it was great!
good,"Sales, customer service, merchandising; good camraderie with other employees, but often managers are not up to the job. Advancement opportunities are extremely slim."
good,The day starts off with filling in orders. We have to check the fitting room through out the day and do the go backs. We go up to customers to see if they need any assistance and help locate items. Sometimes we have to call other stores and order the item for the customer. We have to open line of credit and reward cards. The best part of the job is being with your coworkers and working as a team. The job can be overwhelming  at times with a lot of go backs or not enough staff to help.
good,"They are okay to work for. It was the only job I could find after college, even with a degree. I was hired on the spot. I stocked inventory and pricing. It was fun, but the hours were different for me."
good,The managers are no where to be found when you need them to the floor. Minimum wage for so much work. Hours are OK just need to be quick when trying to get more hours.
good,"unloaded truck & separated merch by depts, sensory tagging, merch prep, merchandising in Men's Furnishings, markdowns, recovery, yearly inventory"
good,"Working for Macys is a fun job, not only employees get to have additional discounts but you get to see what comes out in style before all the other regular customers do. "
good,My normal day at Macy's was being on the floor helping customers with any questions they might have or cashing them out at register. I learned people skills how to talk to customers that were upset and also showing good customer service. Hardest part about the job was keeping your composure when costumers are upset even when its not your fault with what ever problem they have with the store. Most enjoyable is working with people and getting to know customers that like to converse with you.
good,"They do not like to train anyone for a job. The most you get for orientation is videos around what jobs you may be doing. Everything is always a hit or miss. Advancement depends on the management or whoever is willing to kiss up the most.  For support only way to get some hours is to keep learning new skills. Signing, helping with the truck, markdowns, rtv's, fulfillment, etc..."
good,I have worked in retail sales most of my working career. At Macys I enjoyed working with so many different types of people and learning so much at the store in New York.Everyday was exciting to know how many people needed shoes and all the different styles people were asking for.The Management was on point with their staff and treated me very well. The hardest part of working at Macys was learning the different departments but as time went along I learned . My co workers were very nice when I started and I learned so much from everyone that was willing to help.
good,"I helped customers pick out a fragrance, learned how to deal with rude customers, enjoyed the people I worked with. I didn't feel there were any hard parts about the job, just trying to please every customer was very important to me. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people, and helping my customers."
good,"Some unsupportive management personnel"
good,"Typical day at work included opening the store doors, counting opening till, fulfilling customer online orders, recovering sales floor, restocking merchandise, assisting customers with their shopping experience and resolving any of their issues or complaints to the best of ability unless management is required, closing store doors, counting closing till, putting money into a marked deposit bag and depositing into vault."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,the people make it a great place to work they go out of there way to make the customer day. you can learn a lot about the different products that they sale.
good,"Its more/less your common retail place to work at, you work with 100+ people, get to know people in your area, I loved the lady managers (Not being sexist or anything) but the female managers were always so nice and polite, the 2 male managers that were there, not friendly, not talkative, gave unclear directions and when you did them, they brought you in the back and wrote you up."
good,"I had a some good times there, the most stressful part would be during big sales and Christmas time when you're alone but overall depending on who your manager is, it could be a great work environment."
good,macys was a good place to work but the promised us when they hired us in October that those of us retained would be given full time status after Christmas.  by august of the next year we remained p/t at 20 hrs and no benefits and they hired a new training class for f/t positions.
good,"I did it for 3 years and tried my hardest to get out. It's not something I personally wanted to turn into a career. The people that you worked with makes the job. The management is trying to reach a bottom line, regardless of what it takes."
good,"this was a great place to work at, I enjoyed completing tasks and making sure things at work were done neatly and on time. This job gives their employees a great opportunity for advancement."
good,"Nothing special here. Just your average retail job, Each associate has a daily sales goal. You meet it and go home. The management is terrible. They bring in young people with no management experience."
good,"Macy's for me was my first job so of course a few bumps were expected. My mangers at Macy's from the beginning weren't all that helpful, so it took time for me to understand how things operate. On top of that my other coworkers didn't even care much new associates. Despite all that i was able to enjoy the perks of being a sales associate, helping the customers with their inquiries, and ringing up their purchases. I enjoyed helping the tourist most. They understood very little English, and some of the associates didn't seem to care for them because they didn't want to deal with them. Naturally, I make sure I go out of my way to give them assistance. It's very rewarding to help them out because I myself understand the difficulty of adjusting to a new environment."
good,"Finding out store goal for the day, and basically organizing, keeping the sale's for clean, and organized for customers comfortability."
good,"I didn't like the way they paid us , sometimes I would get my paycheck and it would be short on money . then I would have to wait  till I get my next paycheck."
good,Daily tasks vary. Co-workers are fun and knowledgable.  The supervision is minimal.  The hardest part is carrying jeans as they tend to get heavy.
good,"Sell, sell, sell! If you love selling things and working floating shifts this is a place you'll excel. The scheduling system is easy to use and you can log in and try to switch shifts or see when you're scheduled. The breaks were varied depending on how busy the store was so were shift length obviously, but the hardest part was working during the holidays. Long shifts, lots of customers and co-workers stealing your sales."
good,if your a receiver expect to be over worked you will have to do many things out of your job description. You'll work wont be consistant and will very day to day.
good,"When opening the store, if a new sale starts that day, the sale has to be set. I work in the shoe department (in which I love!), so that means scanning each and every shoe on display floor - roughly 400 pairs. Prices are changed if need be and plaque inserts changed out and modified. On big sales it could easily take 2 people an hour to an hour and a half, we are given 45 minutes for one person and can take upwards of 3 hours. A closing shift is much more simple. An audit it done every night to make sure we have 1 pair of shoes on display for each style of shoe. Organization and observation play a key role in the day to day activities. My co-workers are bright, motivated and pay attention to detail so we get along famously. There are four of us in the shoe department, 2 of which are new, and I've learned that in order to have a successful team, everyone has to take pride in what they do. If they have that, everything else falls into place, even with different personalities and motivations. I feel Macy's doesn't care for their employee's, there is a lot of turn over and we feel expendable. The upside is management is easy to talk to, they are down to earth and they work really hard. I think it definitely helps that I love shoes."
good,Only worked seasonal. Compensation was not enough. Constantly on your feet. Did not see growth potential. Part time employee.
good,"Great Staff and colleagues"
good,"I'm part time and part time is only guaranteed 12 hours a week. My schedule is constantly changing and at the last minute. I have to have at least 25 hours in order to keep my benefits, but I don't get that, so my insurance is always being cancelled."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Give customer service, ask questions so that you can get a idea of what the customers are looking for, give advice on the colors and styles go well together , and give the customers product knowledge. I have learned how to listen to customers, how to handle mad customers, and how to service many customers at once. Management has empowered the associates with the ability to do whatever we have to make the customer happy. I really like my co-works we all get along and make work fun. The job is not really that hard, I guess the hardest thing would be being able to give customer service to every customer when it is very busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers."
good,"taking care of customers more than there own employees.  its also very flexible job, it helps me work my schedule around my classes."
good,"Pros: Employee discount, great brands, busy most of the time, somewhat diverse, paid training, set your own schedule, paid weekly"
good,"Well working @ Macy's is hard work and I really mean its hard work. You some time's have to come in and clean up after every body even your co-workers and when your boss say they will get someone to help you out don't count on that help right away, how about within 30min depending on the time of the day. A typical day in the mens department that you will have to measure men to their correct dress shirt size and suits has to be an accurate size as well, same thing with woman suits. Now since you will be getting paid on commission your co-worker's will try you and take your customers and the crazy ones will try to fight you for a customer especially if they are paying $500 or more worth of items. You can make your sales goal but you will still have a low pay check because the part time commission pay is 10% and full time commission pay is 20% out of 100% trust me if I would have known that I would not have accepted the job its just too much work and the stress for 10% out of a 100% its not worth it. Now if it was a hourly job I would have not quit ;~)"
good,It was a seasonal opportunity & I enjoyed helping customers. The managers were a little rude but with my professional demeanor I learned how to work with different kinds of people. I also enjoy working with the cashier & counting money.
good,"The job is easy, but you're on your feet the entire shift."
good,Typical day was any where from chaotic to very slow. I worked the seasonal time period for the Christmas holiday. Some co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part of the job was standing on a concrete floor for hours.
good,"Coworkers were nice, and things seemed relatively fine at first, but then things took a turn for the worst when my manager fired me without warning the day after Christmas. Seasonal or not, she should've given me a warning, but in her mind, she felt it more appropriate to let me go. It left a bad taste in my mouth, especially her reason why, and I will not be returning to the store, as an employee or customer, any time soon."
good,"A typical day of work was always different. As a seasonal sales associate, I had to be prepared to take on any responsibility given to me by my direct manager. During my training session, I realized as a Cosmetics/ Fragrances Sales Associate, I had to learn everything from Recovery, to P.O.S, to marketing fragrances and so forth. I learned how sale products to people of all races and culture using neat and clean appearance, as well as having a very sweet and positive attitude, I learned how to do loads of work in one day without  getting stressed or overwhelmed, I learned how to use clean folding techniques for department floor displays, I learned how to be polite to people who are impatient, rude, and mean, and I learned that there is no need for making friends at work. The management was fair there. One  african american woman in particular who works in Human Resources department did not have a good attitude. She treated everyone so badly, her reputation is clear to all of the seasonal and regular employees. My direct manager was also the same. She too had very poor communication and people skills. For an example, i came to work with my head wrap. I was in fear that no one would hire me because of my head wrap, so I played along with everyone else until I knew I had the job. She saw me with my headwrap three days prior to her acknowledging it as an issue. When she finally said something to me, it was not like she pulled me to the side in a discreet manner; she called me out in front of customers and other employees on the sales floor. Not only that, the way she said it was"
good,I educated the proper way to take care the skin. We also educated the type of skin each clients had to ensure they are purchasing the right products.
good,A typical day at work consist of being on the docks an getting merchandise prepared for the sales floor. I learned how to work as a team an to make merchandise flow in a timely manner. Management was very motivating an encouraging. My co-works were hard workers and good team worker. The job was fare.
good,Macys sucks they don't care about their workers.  Their only concern is opening up credit cards and putting people more in debt!
good,"I worked on womens shoes department."
good,"A day at work was helping customers."
good,"It is a very fun place to work, with ups and downs, above all, I enjoyed the time that I work there, I learn new skills."
good,Fun working environment. You meet new people everyday and you feel self rewarding when it comes to meeting customers needs.
good,"I would make sure items in the store were neat,and i would refold clothes that were out of place."
good,They demand a certain number of cards that you have to open every day and they`re on top of you if cant convince people to open a credit card
good,"Macy's was an okay job, depending on the floor you work on. I started in men's dress shirts and ties, that was good. I was moved to bedding and towels and that wasn't really my cup of tea. It's a lot harder to meet your goal in some areas that in others. Also, there's a lot of favoritism and the employees who have been there for 5+ years are very territorial."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I liked the fact the visual Manger position was hourly. I like that the job was physical alot of walking ,climing ladders etc."
good,"A physical, fast paced  job where you can learn about how retail operates ""behind the scene"" and some visual merchandising. Most coworkers are friendly, however there is an overall climate of unprofessionalism. The job is not  difficult, however  management lacks effective communication skills and does not provide consistent adequate hands on training. IMO there is no growth potential."
good,its great for a starter job and to gain expirience but no opportunity for growth
good,"The hours rent good and the pay is low. I do a lot for 8.50. Its okay workin here, I just want more. I want to advance in retail career. The good thing is no one is on my back to do anything, only if they paid more money."
good,you assisted customers with their purchases. the pay was not the best considering it was macy's
good,I learned a lot of new things from this job and gained some experience of marketing and advertising.
good,a typical work day in receiving at macys consists of unloading trucks. after the truck are unloaded then we start hanging and processing the clothes. afterwards we clean up the dock and receiving floor. My most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that i am taking care of what i need to do so that everything can move more smooth and efficiently.
good,"I like the day to day- love working with my sales associates and other managers. Gained lots of experience running a business, developing people, building vendor relationships etc. Don't like that I spend most of my time doing other people's jobs so it's hard to get mine done."
good,I worked for a commercial cleaning company and would have o say that working there was okay but the employee's were to nice nor friendly..
good,"Macy's Guam was a great place to work when I was young and starting out into the world. As I got older, I was able to see the flaws with the company because of politics. Many of the employees questions and concerns about their benefits have fallen on deaf ears because upper management did not have the ability to take care of their employees. However, the employees in Macy's Guam have more than proven their worth in their sales goals and customer satisfaction. Co-workers became life long friends who help each other when one of them was not able to meet quota for the day. When upper management was stubborn about certain situations, lower management such as department managers and supervisors argued to look at the situation through the employee's actions rather than their numbers on a piece of paper. Overall, Macy's Guam is a great place to work if one is able to handle the pressures of upper management."
good,"Has been a good job while I was in school. Semi flexible hours, the current job that I have is working in the fulfillment department, where we collect internet orders, process them and ship them out."
good,Way too much work and way underpaid. They write you up for everything and force you to sign it. The one manager treats you like complete dirt and will even call you from home to question you and what is going on at the store. Micromanagement to the max.
good,"Hours are unreliable, on the signing team. Morning hours. Co-works are nice."
good,"Even though the atmosphere is friendly, you'll find that your over worked because their always short staff yet they expect the work be completely done. Transfer papers always get misplace or lost. Poor management."
good,"Macy's CFC is a great place to work for individuals that are not seeking growth in their careers. Compensation isn't great, there's little to no advancement opp. and management is set in their ways and not willing to adapt to their changing environment."
good,"I was assigned a new department at Macy's to walk the area, and see it I could find customers who needed assistance, or ring up as a cashier. Do go backs, greet any customers in the area, help them shop for special occiations."
good,"It was a job, not much else to it. If you wanted the employee discount you needed to apply for a credit card. Hours were set and were like pulling teeth to change."
good,"It was a season job for a couple of months a decade ago."
good,Greeting customers and assisting them with purchases. Keeping area neat and organized.
good,"was fun to work in that environment"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macy's has always had an harassment free environment that customers cherished, but will do much better if they had a few readily available associates and a few extra cashiers to assist you."
good,I have learned how to multi-task and how to handle stressful situations.
good,"A typical day included completing transactions for customers and providing a helping attitude, and great customer service. Very large business, great management staff."
good,"This place will continue to lose customers and support."
good,it was fun to work there because my supervisor was never around.
good,"Typical day at work was great, though as a new employee I did take on alot of responsibilities. As a fast learner that I am, I was able to take on the duties as handling with customers the best I can and the register. I did work on the store floor too, including checking the fitting room, folding up clothes and making sure the store floor was clean. The hardest part of the job was making sure the customer was satisfied with the clothe they purchase or if they were being taking care of on the product they needed. I did had to take in customer orders on a daily and sometimes we do not have it in stock. I handle it the best I can which is locate a store that has the product and let them know best way possible that they have the same exact product in another Macy's Retail store. Usually, the customer on phone and in person never get upset which was a great thing."
good,Enjoyed working with the customers.  They always made the day interesting. Each transaction was a different experience.  The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for eight hours of the day for six straight days.  The atmosphere was that of a family oriented among co-workers.  Everyone looked out for the next person.  Someone was always willing to assist.
good,Customers demand excellent service.  Like my co-workers.  Fun to help customers choose clothing items.  Many repeat customers due to my excellent customer service.
good,I didn't realize how much I loved Macy's until I started working there. The sales are fantastic. I am not able to get nearly enough hours scheduled to even come close to making a living wage but the employees and managers are fun and nice and they are the reason that I have not given up on Macy's yet.
good,Liked the workandmost of the people but there is a hole in communications and they dont have much appreciation for your time.
good,"selling products to customers.  required to provide outstanding customer service and to meet selling standards, according to a Macy’s job ad for sales associates. Sales associates are also expected to provide customers with a satisfying experience so they will shop again at Macy’s"
good,Everyday is a different experience with different people and your loyal customers. It is a fun environment to work in as a part time. It has advancement opportunities. The hardest part of the job is to meet your sales goals but at the same time it makes it fun to meet them because you go in daily raffles.
good,"The hours were long and inflexible, especially to someone with a family.  The pay was poor.  There wasn't a lot of communication between staff and management about expectations.  Training was abysmal and practically nonexistent..."
good,"busy food traffic on weekends and certain holidays."
good,"Great company as far as advancement is concerned, but benefits aren't the greatest."
good,"It is a job that pays the bills."
good,"only worked for a few days through out the months and it was okay to work there,"
good,"The days go by fast."
good,"There is no verbal interaction with staff.  The manager will not explain what they need or how they want a job completed."
good,"I take inbound calls all day, helping people place orders. Also locating product in different stores & shipping it to where ever customer lives. Assist customers in service recovery as well as store related issues."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I get to work within a diverse team of people, all of whom I respect and get along with"
good,good people not enough pay online shopper what more can i say it was a easy job
good,"management is too focused on card application numbers than theft prevention, total sales, and overall effectiveness of their style.  Most managers seem overwhelmed and underqualified."
good,I liken my experience at Macys to the military....I have many fun and fond memories of my comrades but can't say the same for management or the work...I've never felt more a sense of relief upon leaving a company.
good,"Working with customers, merchandising, cleaning, sales, a little bit of everything.  Always very busy.  Always something else everyday. Pay was poor."
good,"This was my first ever retail job and right away I know this retail life is not for me. I was hired almost a month before I actually got hours. The training was a joke. The only way you can actually learn the register is through trial and error with real people. I was glad I was able to make my own schedule and get a lot of hours for the holidays. The only bad part to me was just about everyday I would work in a new department and customers would get mad if I didn't have knowledge of the area and could answer their questions. I got lucky that majority of my co-workers were actually nice enough to help walk me through procedures. The most annoying part of this job was dealing with a difficult customer and their annoying coupon/discount questions. These customers will argue you down for $1 off a $300 purchase. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the plethora of people that came in and helping customers find exactly what they were looking for. I could grin and bear it for the holidays. I did however try and make sure to come in with a smile, do my job right, and leave a good impression for my managers.. just in case they want to keep me after the holidays.. :) (We know what this economy is like)"
good,"Macy's wasn't a difficult place to work for and was somewhat satisfactory in the sense that the customers were mostly polite and everyone I worked with was actually rather excellent and easy to get along with. My duties were rather simple, but somewhat numerous considering the amount I was getting paid. I enjoyed a lot of the material I worked with, though I avoided the Home and Children's store, and I also liked the purchase-associated benefits of being an employee. However, management doesn't take much consideration when it comes to informing On-Call associates of what is going on in the store."
good,Associate benefits are great and flexible work schedule. However very bad with part-time employees who need time off. I need time off for back surgery and I was told that I may lose my job.
good,I did not enjoy my time with Macys at all. My training was very short and I had to learn a lot of things on my own. The managers are in training at the same time at the employees so you really can not get the help that you really need. It is very frustrating and confusing to work their.
good,"cashier, customer service, draw counts, set the sale fast paced, goals to meet"
good,"A typical day at work was very busy, but went by fast by working and attending to customer needs. I learned to have a lot of patient and time with the customers we received day by day. I learn to treat others how I will want to be treated. I help a lot of customers go home with a smile and not look at everybody the same. The management at Macy's was not the best management but I learn how to take deep breaths and deal with their attitudes and moods swings. Co- workers were amazing. Co-workers often times end up more like your family. We disagree to agree and team up to make the company much better. The hardest part of the job was the end of the night cleaning up all the clothes off the floor and holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting someone new everyday and getting paid."
good,"Working at Macy's was ok for the most part. Some of the staff and people who worked there were caring and fun. Some of the managers were fair, and some just didn't want to help you."
good,"This was a fast pace environment that required you to give 150 percent of energy each and every minute that you are on the clock, management was very uptight. I learned how to communicated much better with a large public and how to operate in a high traffic area."
good,"Enjoyed some things but hours were not appealing, co workers being catty"
good,"I work in the men's shoe department. Macy's is all about the customer so that is were we focus the majority of our time and energy on: helping the customer. The management is friendly, albeit a bit distant. The co-workers generally know more about the store than the managers, but they are not invested in training you. The hardest part of my job is fetching shoes from the store room and going up and down steep steps with boxes of shoes for anxious customers. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is not having a manager constantly staring at you and monitoring every move you make on the job. If the commission were more than 1% I would say that was the best part of the job, but considering how much the shoes cost at Macy's that was disappointing."
good,"Not the best place ever, but if you need the money, go for it. Some managers here are really fake, and will stab you in the back when they need to. Do not trust them no matter what they seem like. They will also force you to do things out of your job description, and you can't do nothing about it, except tell the union, and managers always find a way to get away with it. Suck!"
good,"loved the work."
good,"Very uplifting and fun because of the various encounters with different sets of people but very tiring and over demanding for the hours provided in a shift. In other words, too many demands, not enough time."
good,"Macy's is a fun place to work but the managers have lost the care for customer service to focus on sale rather than finding a medium. Lack of managers for specific ares , lack of organization with scheduling ."
good,"very busy, pay was not worth the hours spent, very hectic environment."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The most enjoyable part was making women feel better about themselves. Seeing their face after a makeover was the best reward for me. I learned to be confident and absorb as much information about the products I could. I had a passion for my job so it made my job easy. A typical day at work was maintaining a professional appearance and welcoming new clients.
good,I helped customers and in down time tidied up the store. My co workers were all fun and nice but there was one pseudo manager lady who was always on my case because the Store Manager gave me her hours. The job was relatively easy if not boring. The best part of the job were the customers who were appreciative of my service.
good,Could pay better. Benefits aren't that great. Most bosses know that you have a family and they understand
good,Macy's is always a busy work place. There is always a sale going on with a lot of customers. With  all of the customers there is a lot of  multi tasking is require.
good,"Comfortable environment to work in. If you are opening the store you have to count all the money in the registrar's, and count once again when closing. The difficult part of being a Sale's Associate is standing on your feet for hours, so you have to wear really good comfortable shoes. "
good,"As a sales manager I was responsible for 30 plus employees at a time, plus achieving sales plan and merchandise presentation. Over the years, manager positions were eliminated leaving only enough managers for one to close. I worked at a huge location and running the entire store from 5pm until 10 or 11 (sometimes later) was daunting. I enjoyed the fast paced environment, there was never a dull moment, and always something to do. However, the long hours (we were scheduled 50/week and during holidays or special promotions it could be more) and low pay took its toll. Overall, it was a good learning experience but not something I could do forever"
good,This job doesn't offer alot of opportunity for advancement.
good,Management needs a lot of work. Co-workers need to be more professional. The job was easy but made difficult at times depending on the professionalism of fellow co-workers. 
good,"Working at Macys can be a growing experience. I have learned how to communicate with different people from different cultures. It is a great place to learn about certain trends, and what is in season at the time; you can also gain valuable customer service skills. A typical day at Macy’s is meeting and greeting customers while assisting them in their needs. As well as keeping a clean work environment and marinating the fitting rooms and fitting room log. Our management and co- workers are customer focused and at certain times are helpful in what you may need. However, during busy work days, the managers are a little harder to reach then usual. For example, when there is a problem that needs to be run by a manger, they are sometimes out of reach and you must use your best judgment. The hardest part about working at Macy’s is sometimes working with some of the employees. Some of the workers are very competitive and at times care more about their goals then the customers’ needs. For example, pressuring customers to sign up for Macy’s cards, even when the customer has said no. The most enjoyable part about working at Macy’s is the flexibility that it provides such as: being able to advertise your shifts, pick up open shifts, and being able to work around school (if you are a student)."
good,it was a lot of fun working with diffrent people as well as working in that type of up beat enviroment. Loved that fact that i was able to satisfy customers needs.
good,I loved working there but too much favortism and always blames for issues.
good,"Worked customer on a daily basic helping. Being a cashier, and sales associate as well."
good,Packaging there products with care. Making sure the items ordered are correct befor packing. Be sure you have all paper work in the box before sealing it closed.
good,great people helping managers
good,I met wonderful people that I am still friensds with.. The one thing that was really hard to deal with is you get your scheduled printed out for like 2 weeks. Well you show up for your shift and it has been changed.. Nobody notifies you by phone. Your told you have to go to the website and check your schedule everyhnight after the store closes. Not ok.
good,"At Macys, Customer service is key. Without great customer service the store would definitely not be what it is today. A typical day at Macy's starts off with a morning rally to prepare the employees for the days event such as sales and what we can do to encourage company growth. After that we are sent to our schedule departments with the customer always being our first priority. The management at my facility can be a little impatient at times as well as badger the associate about opening Macys accounts for customer who have clearly stated thier un-interest in it but they are always there when you need big help. My co-workers in my department are very helpful. We all are willing to help each other out with work related situations as well of out of work situation and because of that, we treat each other like family. The hardest part of my job would have to be that when you are hired as a sales associate, they expect us to do everything such as clean up the department meaning pick up any loose clothes or hangers off the floor, clean out the fitting room, answer calls to help over the phone customers as well as help customers as customer service and service as a cashier; and at times, doing all this on a busy sale day and you are scheduled all by yourself with no help. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my fellow co-workers in my department. We have all worked in the same department for a year or two so we have all developed a special bond. Working with them makes me feel good about my day at Macys."
good,Macy's was okay in the begining... The scedule was difficult because it was hard to collect hours when you were a flex team member
good,"Like any corporate place of business, it was strict and the pay was not worth the amount of work you put in and dealt with."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I thought working at Macy's would be fun. But after getting a new manager who didn't really know what she was supposed to do that dream went down the drain. I spent most days paired up with a more experienced employee, mostly assisting them in what they needed to get done. I never really felt like I learned anything while working there."
good,"Customer interpersonal relationship was a typical day at work for me and I've learned to adjust on the pros and cons to deal with a various ages of customer. The Higher Management was worthwhile but the middle Management which the Managers and Supervisors are not well accommodating, I can just count my three fingers not the five. The hardest part of the job was with the everyday huge sales goal that the marketing strategy I learned was not sufficient especially garments are seasonal. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving bonus/commissions/awards based on quartely basis. I enjoyed so much working with my co-workers, maybe because I'm pleasant to them too. I just did the best working atmosphere to all my Managers an co-workers but working skills and good income was the best tandem."
good,"Loaded dock, truck. Assist with the receiving and processing of new merchandise. Assist with setting up sales displays. Loaded the merchandise from the trucks and checks in shipment as needed. Stages merchandise for the sales floor. Scanner, cutting down the boxes, setting up all the racks, and separated. Opened up the boxes, take out all the merchandises and folded nice and neat. Sized them, and do signs pricing. And also I assist with the customers on the sale floor, and fitting room check. It's was lot of so much work to do in the dock. I really like the mostly working on sale floor."
good,the job was fast paced and very interesting.i learned more about customer service and with that i was able to add those skills to my recent experience to become more successful. The hardest part about the job was knowing that i'd be laid off after the holiday season. The most enjoyable part about the job was the customers.
good,Another High paced environment. Benefits were wonderful. management was also helpful & wonderful
good,great managers. challenging dealing with customers. You learn alot about retail
good,"typical day range from handling merchandise returns and arranging merchandise for weekend sales. evey day your are a given a sale goal, where you will be expected to meet each and every day."
good,There is plenty of oppurtunities if you are looking for part time employment.
good,"A typical day at work would be to open my register and then walk my department to make sure everything was in its correct place and if any stock was low on floor or if new merchandise came in I would go to the loading dock and stock room bring up new and or fill in merchandise to my department tag the merchandise and place it on the floor in its proper place, sometimes that mean changing the entire department decor around so that it is appealing to the eye of the customer and putting new produce in front. All while delegating different task to co workers in order to get product out and on floor."
good,so many people
good,I enjoyed working as a Hairdresser. I was usually scheduled an 8 hour day and give 45 minutes per customer for a basic hair cut and blow dry. When I first started working at Macy's all styling chairs were filled with Hairdressers. There was about 6 or 7 of us total. We all got along well and seemed to be on the same page.I enjoyed coming to work. I would check my schedule for the day at the reception area to get an idea of what kind of work I would need to do on each client in order to get there chemical cards if needed.
good,Enjoyed working with the public and helping customers. Wish I could've stayed pass seasonal. The hardest part was the holiday customers.
good,Typical day consisted of new claims 3 part contacts within 24 hours.
good,I have been with the company for 4 years and the highlight has been the wonderful people I have met working here.
good,Great place to work. Gives you good ideas on what to spend your money on.
good,easy job short hours things change to quickly management was good days were short only till 7pm
good,"A nice place to work. Nice people to work with. You learn a lot on the job, there is a lot of business. There is good team work at the counter."
good,Macys is a wonderful place to be able to work. The associates are nice and ready to help you when you need. Managment is not the best.
good,If you understand your customer needs and wants you can definitely exceed at Macys.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The rate of pay is not enough for the amount of work we do. We are sales associates, customer service, merchandisers and so much more."
good,I really enjoyed working at Macy's in the beginning. I liked my direct manager and my coworkers made the day fly by. We would make sure the floor was clean and presentable and we would make sure the fitting rooms were always clean. We had to offer credit cards on every transaction which sometimes was hard because I hate sales but it was ok. But after I put my 2 week notice in I was accused of stealing money from the register! Which was totally untrue. I ended up having to threaten them with a lawsuit and then the security guard finally dropped it. I later found out that the loss prevention dept has a quota of internal and external arrests. So they were just trying to meet their quota and probably didn't expect me to fight back!!
good,"Working at Macy's is fun you meet a lot of new people. The management not so good, some of the manager are young and they don't have experience dealing with people."
good,Daily I was conducting meetings and helping my associates improve productivity. I did learn how to be more organized on time management. I knew more than management on how to work the system and know the people that I had under me. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with alot of different people.
good,"Worked at Macy's for a year and counting. Starting pay was minimum wage. Same position at similar stores seem to pay more, from my research. Their is no full-time positions, from my understanding. No healthcare provided, unless you work X+ number of hours per season. Even then, you have to pay for it, which isn't cheap. Better off getting your own healthcare elsewhere."
good,Working at macy's was an awesome time. During the holiday's the store stayed very busy and passed the time away. The hardest part about my job is when it was seasonal it was hard to leave or see other good co-workers go
good,"Shifts started with reading logs to find out what part of the department I was for the shift, such as being on the floor helping customers choose items, guarding the fitting room or at the register cashing customers out and at the sometime trying to get them to apply for Macy's cards. I worked in the juniors department and I learned a lot of unpleasing things about teenagers. Co- workers and management were okay."
good,A typical day at work is putting back clothes keeping an organize area and making sure I make my sales goal and greeting customers.
good,I love Macy's...its just us being open til 10 p.m. and having slim to none customers on Thursdays. They pay $8 per hour but its weekly and im part time so its like $120 a week. :(. But overall I love my job its productive.
good,"Breaking down pallets, peel plastic off all merchandise, tag everything according to price and take to respective floors."
good,"helping customers, sale assiaocate, organize my dapartment"
good,I worked at Macys for 1 1/2 years. I began as a seasonal associate & worked my way up to an eventual part-timer. I eventually had to go back to an on-call because they did NOT work work well with my school schedule & my church schedule. My management changed multiple times resulting in about 3 different managers in about 1 year. I did not receive any raises even after my year of working there.
good,"I enjoyed the short time working through the holidays for Macey's. The employees were fun and everyone seemed to work as a team and help out where ever help was needed. Management seemed to be very happy with what work I did for them in the short time I was there. A typical day included answering phones and greeting guests, assisting callers and visitors with any questions or complaints, working with Microsoft word and excel, filing, creating new hire badges and assisting with new hire first day paperwork, along with any other administrative duties needed by any departments. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep busy. Business was very slow that holiday. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a group of fun and professional individuals."
good,Responsibilities included but not limited to: Loading and unloading of shipments of up 2300 cartons. Defining of manpower needs for the processing of the shipments. Assembling of merchandising structures for use in store and teardown of merchandising displays for shipping to other stores while using a multitude of hand and electric tools. Purging out dated inventory in a safe and theft free way. Providing consumer assistance and working to implement new safety protocols
good,"Working with Macy's was a very unique experience. I learned that retail is not as hard as I thought , although it involves a very determined approach. I really enjoyed being able to interact with the customers ."
good,The fragrances and cosmetics department has tons of perks and my fellow associates are great to work with. The glaring flaw with Macy's is the lack of professionalism from the management team. The fragrances and cosmetics department head doesn't even know anything about the products.Criticism is more condescending rather than constructive. The only saving grace is that I love the products I sell and the people I work with.
good,"Company philosopy of MAGIC selling and providing excellent customer service sets Macy's far ahead of other retailers. As awesome as the customer focus idea is, training was ridiculously inadequate from my first date employed. Plop you in a room with a computer program linked to the cash register with the expectation that you'll get through computer based training in a ridiculously short amount of time and emerge fully prepared with enough knowledge to act like a professional in any department."
good,Worked as Sales associate for customer service and cashiered in every department. Recovered merchandise and organized the sales floors. There was so much merchandise it was hard to find where to put it. There were shop lifters that need to be delt with and security wasn't always alert. The greastest part of that job was meeting the customers and helping with sales. The registers were easy to use.
good,"Products are new and exciting, commission structure is OK, good management."
good,Staff was always short handed
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macy's Magic Selling means employees are monitored and analyzed to the inth degree by management which means a highly stressful work environment. In addition, unrealistic goals are assigned and, if not met, then management counsels them every week. There are not enough employees to handle big sales and the staff on hand is left to deal with dissatisfied customers."
good,"Macy's offers a large selection of merchandise and service to the consumer. They always have vass knowledge of their products and services, as well as great customer service. As an employer the company has much needed improvements in reguards to employment, such as better work schedules, health benefits, and management staff relations. over all Macy's is still one the top retailers in the nation who offer some of the top of the line merchandise at a great price for the customer."
good,This job is great for college studenta nd young teens thats just starting put in the work force
good,"They have a new scheduling system that need alot of work. There is either too much coverage for your area, or sometimes noone is working, this doesn't provide good customer service."
good,Managament and staff could use some work on how to effectly talk to people.
good,"I was truly dissapointed with the management team. Not all of them. They were over worked. I think that had something to do with it. But, I would go back"
good,"schedules are very flexible, busy environment. exciting."
good,"Personally after working for the company, I could not fathom how some of the associates could stay with Macy's for 5,10,15+ years. The only thing that made me stay for a brief period was that I didn't have many options to go for another job. The one positive thing that I can say is that it helped get me on my feet, and put some change in my pocket at the time. However, I feel department stores are not for me."
good,Though it would have been nice if at least one of my many many managers knew my name and who I was.
good,"I never saw so many unqualified people in my life selling cosmetics. Very simple not hard work for retail. The place is not really organized. Forget it, about training you do it on your own.No help from mangers.they are busy watching soap operas and shopping. My advise dont work to hard its retail."
good,Open up more part-time positions. Many retired people are looking for part-time work because they are dependable. They usually show up for work. One can set their own availability hours to work and pick your off days.
good,It’s a lot of work for very low pay. Most of the time you don’t get good enough hours. The people there have been alright. It’s very dirty and messy in the areas to the point where sometimes you can’t even get through
good,they dont pay enough for the work they expect from you. I learned a-lot about how to talk with customers to better understand there needs and offer recommendations. Management will encourage you to do well and meet goals but they are the only ones who benefit from your work. they dont do anything to show there appreciation for there employees only the ones they like. one time they had a party for a select few of employees. and after the party was over they gave the other employees the leftovers of the meal that was crazy. Employees here are not very friendly either no one talks to each other.
good,macys was a fun place to work for part time. schedule was flexible but it was not worth working full time. the clientele was just bad and dangerous at times for asset protection.
good,Ok place to work. Very limited opportunity for advancement or working with new technology stacks. They do offer summer hours where everyone gets the second half of Friday's off during the summer.
good,Even thought the Pay is terrible and they expect the salesperson to do EVERYTHING I did like it in the beginning but towards the end I realized how they take advantage of people and expect you to drop whatever to come in and do what they want so I got tired I just quit.
good,"Assist customers with there Online pickups and merchandise returns."
good,"Traveled to 90 stores"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"You work 2.5hrs a day with a "
good,"The commission based salary is perfect for go-getters! Management can often view you as just a number, but if you stay in your own lane- all should run smoothly. Had fun working in the lingerie department!"
good,"Overall I enjoyed helping the customers and meeting new people daily, getting  to know a lot of the customers on first name basis was extremely rewarding ,and  attending to the well being of my department goals and standards."
good,"Needs better Health Insurance. Needs better training program for advancement. Should have free gym membership for employees and discount on Hotel, Airplane. Broadway shows, amusement parks and charities."
good,Ehh most managers are strict. Do your job go home that's the feeling to get don't overachieve it's not worth it their are no incentives to work harder than your supposed to rarely get raises. Union company tho.
good,I really appreciate the discounts. I feel that management should be hired on experience and not based who you know. I enjoyed meeting with various vendors and building relationships.
good,Working at this company gave me brand familiarity as to the response I received from people outside the work place as being a great company for there families.
good,"Not much room for growth, managers do not tend to team members as much as they should. Hard to approach most of the supervisors. Team members are very friendly."
good,Great place to work. Most managers are great. If you want 40 hours you have to find them. You can be full time but only get 28. You have to bust butt to get all recovery done plus wait on people and there isn't enough help but they don't care. They do show appreciation to their workers in other ways that are fun.
good,'Greeting' Customers at Cashier Reregister ringing-up merchandise paying cash or credit cards and having customers to sign-up for Macy's credit cards.
good,macys is a great place to work at. the employees is amazing and i had the best managers. The customers showed me respect and they was so funny. working at macys was difficult too.
good,"That's all. They don't have enough workers and they constantly pushed credit card sales. When you call lost prevention they almost seem to do nothing at all, and sometimes will watch the employees more than the actual thieves."
good,"My job at Macy's is fine, but during busy sales times, things can get hectic and I was occasionally pressured for taking some much needed time off.  If a shift is short-staffed, it can get very overwhelming and there are times when I had completed my shift, but was still requested to stay longer, even if it would total up to a 12 hour day and I had to be at the store the next morning.  But, when things are running smoothly, Macy's is a nice place to work."
good,I work in cashier and putting the clothes back I love it but my manager was not a nice person but the other mangers were nice and the bad part AMD u has to open los of credit card
good,"In the eight years I was there, my headcount was reduced by almost 75%.  Of course the workload remained the same....lot of time wasted on stupid audits, and equally stupid, sensitivity training."
good,I really enjoyed working in the warehouse. I was very upset when I was cut as a seasonal worker. I would love to be there full time. They hire during peak season and cut the temps first.
good,Was told that my job position was eliminated but found out i was replaced by someone they could pay less to because I would have been there 11 years and they probably didn’t want to give me a raise or more vacation time.
good,"Great company, great people. Like most retail today struggling to reach sales goals and stay relevant in a world driven by on-line sales. "
good,"Assisted on floor moves, merchandising, and display maintenance."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I was in stock so it was a very fast placed environment, everybody was running in and out the back to grab things for the customers, it was during holiday season so it was expected"
good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's for the most part until commission and competitiveness became an issue among staff members. Management also doesn't handle things in the most professional ways at times, it can be very high school and gossip easily spreads unfortunately."
good,"Macy's is an OK place to work. I enjoyed the people I worked with, just need like how the company operated. I went above an beyond at this place and still received no recognition or deserving pay raise."
good,It’s a nice in easy job to do in you get discount on clothes in on holiday you get a lot of hours if you are up to it that’s when everybody gets to see some real money
good,"Worked on the dock, not enough women considering the heavy lifting, management was biased, lots of employee v employee conflict, but I enjoyed the laborus work"
good,Very stressful environment. Pay raises and benefits do not keep pace with inflation. Turnover and arbitraryreassignment of jobs hurt performanc3 and make for an unpleasant work environment. Fun activities are good but do not make up for the deficiencies. Erratic work schedule.
good,"Macy's is a job for those who has another job or goes to school. They're flexible with sscheduling but that's it. The pay is minimum unless you work there for years and the store management is sub par at best. It's just"
good,"I worked on weekends in their HR office. I chose the weekends because it was less busy, but as time went by the work load increased because of call outs, most of the time i worked alone, when it should be two people scheduled for the weekend. The work environment was cheerful, coworkers was friendly."
good,"I love doing this type of work since it involved constantly beautifying, organizing and making a pleasant environment for customers and staff. Unfortunately my last supervisor was extremely rude and demeaning."
good,"While I had worked at Macy's, i enjoyed being able to connect with customers as well as my coworkers. The work load was not a large amount at all but due to having no benefits, I was not able to want to advance."
good,When I started I was excited to begin working I soon realized the pace was far quicker than anything I've ever done but I enjoyed it until after my first week I was promised more hours do to me having a open availability so when. I would have to work on Wednesday and not work again till the following Friday and that's was pretty much it very inconsistent work schedule for me great people  though
good,"Primary responsibility was to restock the floors from the dressing rooms, fold and straighten displayed merchandise.  There was a lot of pressure to work long and excess hours."
good,Favoritism is an issue with mid level management. That is something I found very difficult to work with. Loved the products and upper management. A good temporary type job but not long lasting.
good,"Since we don't really receive any type of benefits, I feel that Macys should pay for 1/2 hour breaks.  Can't they afford $6.00?  If not, that's pretty sad."
good,I was initially lied to upon receiving the position I got hired into. They expect a lot but the managers don’t actually care. They spend more time doing persons things then actually tending to the floor. If you’re an adult who’s use to a certain type of work environment then this isn’t the place for you. Too much is wrong for this to be such a large corporation.
good,Macy’s seem to need employees that they’d hire people without experience. It’s a good first job if you just turned 18 or if you’re new to this country. What I don’t like is the union thing that I’d have to pay $78 a month. Some people like it for job security reasons because Macy’s can’t fire them even if they do bad things. I didn’t like it because I only worked 20 hrs a week and see it as a worthless liability and the $78 fee is better spent somewhere else.
good,"It was good while it lasted  basically learned alot thanks to my coworkers  thanks to my boss I moved up and was motivated , even though almost all of us left the job we still stay in touch because work was work and we were all friends at the end of the day"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"well it could've been the way management , handled their workers , they would say at the very last minute that something had to be done , and one had to learn how to , poor explanation , people were great , but since it was seasonal , they just wanted everyone working in shipping and not in our designated areas"
good,"This was my first job. I was only a temporary employee. I worked four hours a day, two to three times a week. I mostly worked in the stockroom. Tagging clothes, putting clothes away, pricing clothes etc. I had nice coworkers. And management was really nice and helpful to me. I kinda wanted to work there longer. But the store closed and everyone got laid off. So I don't have a in depth review. But my time there was nice, however short it was."
good,i worked for Thanksgiving/Christmas season so it already is chaotic. Management was getting on my nerves. It was unorganized and manager kept telling me to smile more...
good,"When working for Macy’s the one thing they care about the most is sales. They prioritize sales. That is why for people like me who barely work on the sales floor, we tend to need more help than what is scheduled. Managers tend over staff the sales team and under staff the support team. And customer service will always be needed, whether you work on the sales floor or not."
good,"They hired me as a style advisor, I assumed I'd be helping customers find clothes for certain events but I'm just another associate for them to move around when someone calls out. Would not work here again"
good,I only  did seasonal work. I work there for six weeks.  I worked in the Fragrance Department.  I cleaned the department.  I worked in the  Men's Department. I cleaned. I wanted to be an  online shopper.
good,I had a lot of fun working this company everyday was new adventure you never knew what the next day will bring unfortunately they have no place a mistake you mess up once and you a goner
good,"It has been several years since I worked there. "
good,"My favorite thing about working at Macy’s Cielo Vista was that I made my own schedule. There were a lot of things that would come up that were not in the training, definitely learn as you go. Managers helped but wouldn’t be too eager to do so. Being bilingual is a must, more than half the customers are from Mexico & don’t speak English. It was a lot of older ladies in the mornings & younger people in the afternoon that would go to school in the morning. Super flexible schedule. If you can’t work a certain day you can swap it with someone else or advertise it for someone to pick it up"
good,"Once a new SM came in to our store she turned it into a hellhole. The fun and enjoyment left the moment she took over and all the managers tried to kiss up to her by seeing who could be the most annoying trying to enforce the most rules, even when she wasnt there."
good,I'm grateful for having a job to help pay the bills. Advancement is scarce and my schedule is inconvenient. It really depends on which position you have. A lot of my coworkers have become good friends.
good,Working at Macy's is very stressful but you will learn a lot  and see different time of people but know this know what you here for to work not make friends cause those same people will still be there but you won't
good,"The position I was hired for was temporary, but they asked me to stay on. A lot of changes were happening during my time there, which may be the reason I wasn't satisfied with the job. And the hours that were available were horrible, but I was a college student with limited hours already. Overall not a bad company to work for, but I didn't see any way they were willing to promote me. The job is a good stepping stone, there for a minute, but ultimately just a temporary job."
good,"You work either 4x10’s (four days a week for ten hours) Monday thru Thursday, 6am-4pm or you work 3x12’s (three days for twelve hours) Friday-Sunday 6am to 6pm. They do have all of their scheduling online as long as you memorize your ID number and PW which they make standard for you because you use it very often, but you may change if you’d like. You must bring your own lunch or bring money for the vending machines to buy snacks. You get two paid 15 min breaks and an unpaid 30 min break, though if you work the ten hours you get one 15 min paid and your 30 min unpaid and the time you get off of work would be the time you get a break if you were working a 12 hour day.. Fridays are days of a mix where there are some ten hour workers and twelve hour workers.."
good,Management teams there are really poor. They bumped up people who did not have the right leadership qualities or management skills needed for this job.
good,"In my experience, it was ok when I first started. But after I got transferred to a different store, it was horrible. I'm not sure if it was because the store was big or because it was an important store, but management was awful. I was lucky to have nice managers though. Coworkers were ok. Some were nice and helpful, others not really. Really crowded and packed though. But overall, kind of dusty and awful fitting rooms."
good,This is a great place to get started in the work field. You pick up lots of skills and get to build on them. Perfect if you are still in school and needing to have flexible hours.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I started working for Marshal Fields,  During that time the Marshal Fields policies were ""give the lady what she wants""  We had a number of very good training sessions to train us on everything we needed to know about customer service.  The main objective from top store manager down to cleaning crew was to be pleasant and courteous to everyone and do your best to assist the customer in their needs.Have a very strict hiring policy so that who you hire can reflect the Marshall Fields image. When the store changed over to Macy's all that went out the window. Hire anyone and everyone. Managers became cold and ruthless. It is all about the bottom dollar  Dont bother us with trivial problems solve them yourself.  Bring in Dollar Store junk and sell it for cheaper. Schedules are what they are - no changes.  And as THIS IS TRUE one of the managers said of Macys changes in a store meeting ""If you dont like it-theres the door!"""
good,ovarial a good experience as I received work experienc3e with coordination of bridal and fine wares.  I loved providing customer services and helping customers meet their needs
good,"Keep your focus and a positive attitude. Some positions offer salary and commission, if your a hard worker this will benefit you most.  Schedule changes for the company change promptly so be prepared to dedicate your life to Macy's."
good,"Being a full time college student, I was only working on the weekends. When I took some weekends off to study for upcoming exams they took me off the schedule for about a month, which for a college student, is detrimental to my type of living (studying for classes every day and also having bills to pay). Only take this job as a place holder while searching for somewhere better."
good,Some of the management team was very unprofessional and rude. Management didn't try or follow availability. Treat you as if you don't have no social life...
good,The management did not do anything of value to ensure the sales associates could succeed. They pressured us to meet goals that were unrealistic and slammed us when we could not do so.
good,"Macy’s can be a somewhat fulfilling place to work for a retail job. You will get a lot of upset customers, as the stores are usually understaffed, and workers are poorly trained. But once you learn your job, you are pretty much on your own running your department, so you can make what you want from this job. If you focus on making the customer’s day and turning negative experiences into positive ones by providing outstanding customer service, your sales will go up, and you’ll get some regular customers who enjoy your help during their visit. "
good,"I have to say the location ""Almeda Mall"" that I worked in particular is very poorly managed. When I would call and ask for help most of the time they never came to help. They fired my and gave me a bogus reason for doing so and didn't want to give me my final pay check stating the whole check went as a final payment towards my insurance..What insurance? I never had insurance with Macy's so that was complete BS. Overall terrible experience."
good,It's not bad if you're a student and you work here part time. It can get busy and dealing with customers they can be too much just like any retail job. Overall I wouldn't mind working there part time again.
good,"Good seasonal job.  There is plenty of work if you like to keep busy.  A lot of slackers too.  As long as you stay busy, and get your work done you'll be fine.  Long days, but there's enough to keep busy.  The supervisors I had were laid back, very thorough, patient, and willing to pitch in. Great seasonal job.  Warehouse."
good,"working here is very stressful, people are very mean at times, but overall a very flex and learning place to work at. Low pay and long hours at some time."
good,Going in this environment was fun I got to learn new things how to use different things . And how to ship things off   Things I didn’t do at my other retail store
good,It ok for now I need to grow as a human being there is no growth for me here . I need to do something that is going to help someone.  The environment is upbeat and fun on busy days on slow days is very dry .
good,"When I first starting working at Macy's it felt like a family with everyone there to help each other. But with change in management over the last several years, the environment was no longer the same, no none wanted to help each other, staff with longevity were being overlooked for promotions, and the clientele and items being sold had changed. In-store retail isn't the same it use to be."
good,"Enjoy the culture, working with diverse groups, and learning about myself. The business is a learn by doing and gives you the experience needed to be a good sales manager"
good,"Starting with VP store manager, highly unprofessional and favoritism. My direct supervisors were all pretty much ill equiped for their positions. Co workers are competitive and hostile, some will go as far as to take your commission by ringing up your customers at the cashier after you spent time helping those customers."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Decent entry level job. Didn't see much opportunity for growth. Call center environment and relaxed working conditions. Take inbound calls for Macy's credit card holders and retail sales associates.
good,Macy's has very good work environment at times and can be fun but can also be slow and the pay is low and it is hard to get full-time work even with years of retail experience and working with them.  Others have told me they worked for Macy's a few years and still not allowed to move to full-time.
good,"While Macy’s is a great store for customers, it’s not so kind to it employees. If your looking for a job that is fufilling but also pays well, I’d say look elsewhere. Macy’s is a great starter job for those who want to lack onto the ways of a competitive job"
good,I worked with some very nice people at Macy's. we worked 10 hrs per day. the pay was ok but others in the area pay more. in Dec we worked 12 hrs per day.
good,This place has horrible management. The management there only cares about making goals to better there raises but when it comes to helping employees none is given .the turn over is high do to low hourly wages and management that is lazy and will not help you if u have a prob that’s needs fixing . They would rather hire a outside person then  promote with in because they don’t wanna give a raise
good,Nothing to really say. It just wasn’t the job for me. It could’ve been better. Only if the benifits was better. I had gave the best customer service a
good,"The hardest part of working at Macys Fulfilment Center is going from about a thousand employees to about 4,000 employees in November and December.  We also had buses of people we would bring in from other cities, one of which was an hour and a half away.  It was very chaotic, but also exciting.  The best part was all the wonderful people you get to meet from all different walks of life.  Macys does an excellent job of staffing its centers with a very diversified pool of people.  Some days were a lot of fun, and others like cyber Monday, you didn't think they were ever going to end.  In the end, it was solid employment and good work experience."
good,The job isn't for everyone. It is very hard on your feet and back. If you have kids working here can be difficult if something happens. They don't care why you have to leave you still get punished for it even if its an emergency.
good,"I'll be honest, working at Macy's was fun, especially when you work in the intimates department, like I did. But they promise flexible schedules, and it was everything but flexible. I was given a hard-time when they scheduled me for a mandatory meeting on the day and time of my final exam in college. I had marked that day as a day I could not come in, and yet my manager scheduled me anyway. I had to involve HR and it sucked. I really hated leaving, but they honestly didn't give me a choice after a while. I was lucky to have the co-workers I did, and I loved working there. But I couldn't keep up with their crazy scheduling system."
good,Hard to get a consistent weekly salary . Lots of management turnover yet our stores sales out rank the big city Seattle and Spokane stores. They don't make it easy to transfer unless you are promoting. They don't show appreciation for the early morning start team core employees. They have lots of sales.
good,They could do better in management and the way they promote people. No one in management is held to a standard and they lose employees over pay and the horrible absent credits.
good,I needed to work for few hours while I am going to school for my bachelor. The time schedule was not cooperating with me and the driving distance was too much.
good,"Great for a job to start out with, other than that no. And you have to pay for parking yourself. Was very subpar no set hours, you get what you get. I probably wouldn't go back."
good,Had meeting every morning. Management would acknowledge any employee who meet their sales goals. Up beat music was a plus. Lots of communication. Healthy competitions.
good,"typical day at work; depending the days it can range from moderate to light amount of customers and cleaning. it's almost always busy in the fitting rooms and they dnt really have or seem to want a permanent fitting room associate."
good,After working for the company for over 20 years and giving my all I learned that there is no job security and you can be replaced easily.  Its a very strong company just needs to care about its employees.
good,"All shapes and sizes. Managers constantly changing and get transferred.  Cleaning up after sloppy and rude customers. Females in the fitting rooms are the worst."
good,Macys was a good job i got to management myself since i was a counter manager i did make up and facials. I learned about the products clarins had to offer so i could teach the clients.
good,Overall it was a fun experience I learned good customer service and it was a good environment. Very easy to adjust and feel in a safe working environment
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,A day would consist of me organizing merchndize and selling merchandize. I learne how to sell mechandize and customer service skills. I rarely dealed with managaement during my job. The hardest part of the job was fast paced part of the job. The most enjpyable part of the job was getting to offer help to the customers.
good,Operational and systematic changes yearly.  Communication can be problematic.  Changes are not sufficiently coordinated to allow employees to adapt to the best of their abilities.Training is weak.
good,"for the most part fellow sales associates are the only thing that makes this place worth while. Management is horrible. All they do is try to catch you doing something they don't approve of, and then try to scold you about it. Management loves to be browned nosed, the associates that chose to brown nose are obviously their favorites. Not a horrible place to work, just don't let yourself get bullied by management."
good,This was a pretty stressful placement. Not enough workers to carry out the needed task to keep the store operating efficiently. My managers were nice enough; but they constantly had us in roles outside our capacity.
good,"Very fast paced, limited information to be able to complete job, usually are limited by upper management.  If willing to work and ask for it pay can be good, overtime only during Christmas, good benefits and can earn vacation days the longer you work there."
good,A typical day at work was 10am-6pm. I learned to be patience and not to over re-act. It really us a stronger management team. The hardest part is working holidays. Some of my co-workers were amazing.
good,"A lot of lack of management , managers all over the place , they just care about you getting customers credit cards and when you do, there’s no good job or anything ,"
good,Active fun retail environment
good,As a package handler my tasks are to basically load my assigned trailers with merchandise which is coming down from the conveyor belts and to also keep my work area clean.
good,Working on the dock wasn't too stressful. Everything about the job was okay except the lack of advancement opportunities and hours being cut almost at random.
good,I enjoyed my job but the company is making so many cuts that it is impossible for most people to meet deadlines and complete all the work they need to do on a daily basis. Most employees are frustrated with the lack of resources and people to get the job done correctly.
good,Some of the managers show favoritism. I'm a troubleshooter and there is other troubleshooters and they choose one out of all us to get paid more than my supervisor and we All started when the building opened. The person that gets paid more does not do her job correctly.
good,"go in restock shelves customer service, help employees rearrange department clean dressing room help customer locate items. retag sale items. Penny out last season attire"
good,Super hostile environment. The workers with commission bonuses made it a super competitive and uncomfortable workplace. They would steal customers from you and make you feel like you didn't belong there.
good,"management is terrible."
good,The hardest part of working at Macy's was the go backs and the organizing. As well as finding coupons that actually worked for customers. Overall the job is pretty relaxed.
good,"This may be an issue at my particular store, but when I was first hired the atmosphere was fantastic. The management team got along well, they made us associates feel cared for, and that they wanted to see our talent develop. Once that team was cut from the store, it has not been the same. The cut backs of associates has been the main blow to this company. Ask any employee at any Macy's and they're probably over worked and under appreciated."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"It was my first retail job ever, started as a support associate for the holiday season, I worked in the dock and its really mainly males working that area i only had 2 other girl working there too but the guys were extremley disrespectful to the girls to the point i had to get out and change a different position. The dock manager was the worst never really acted professional, talked badly about other managers, mtms and store managers. I ended up working in Estee Lauder for my remaining time as a seasonal employee and I absolutely loved it, It was fun, energetic, always something new and I loved selling and helping costumers, I learned so much working as a seasonal employee. I decided to leave in the end because management in cosmetics was not great, they hardly ever scheduled me, the communication was bad and employees and management would talk about peoples back and i thought it was unprofessional."
good,"Not a job for anyone who likes a fast paced workplace with an inclusive management. Favoritism was high here, and not much encouragement from management. Slow but demanding workplace; getting credit cards is really the most important thing."
good,Not trying to say so bad just the pay don't match the work you do . Macy is a stepping stone for young people with no responsibility or kids. Differently if your doing security
good,"Macy's is a company with a historic reputation that it is struggling to keep in a fast changing retail environment. Many of the things that built the company's reputation are being swept away by a new generation of consumers who demand different products, delivery systems, and company culture. As the company adjusts to the new demands, it has created a tense work environment where you are trying to do your best work to maintain the Macy's image while not being sure if your services will still be needed next month, or if your position will just disappear."
good,"In today's world, retail is in a transition. All retail stores are being affected. With that said, the typical working week and day is shorter for all associates. Our work week will consist of the minimum 28 hours, and we are responsible for picking up shifts. What seems like just under the required amount for health insurance. We are also given a choice of one day off a week that is consistent, yet it changes for the needs of the store. This makes the work/ life balance not as great. It would be easier to sell more products if there were not so many retail games played, with the coupons and internet sales. Customers are feeling as if they can't trust the company any more, due to all the exclusions on the coupons. Working and buying in the retail world used to be more fun for all."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was how welcoming and nice the co-workers were. Also, how well they train you before putting you to work so that you're prepared.  The store is big so there's always something to do. You will never get bored."
good,working condition was not worthless/lack of management/minimal benefits/salary with job advancement.Lack of team work.enjoyable was just helping customers.
good,"You will learn how to handle the merchandises and how to organize the clothes on floor."
good,"Macy's is a retail giant; consequently, the Corporate structure isn't conducive to individual associates' needs. It's too dollar-amount driven, without the Company investing in individual stores. Fewer associates end up on the sales floor, to the aggravation of Customers and a lessening of profit to the Company."
good,"It can get very stressful working in the clothing departments. There's pressure to meet daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly team goals. Pressure to open credit cards. People that think they're entitled will be very rude."
good,"I was a loss prevention officer. I stood at one of the entrances to the store, and observed whether anyone was stealing. This position was extremely boring."
good,"The job wasn't paying enough, not enough advancement, or overtime. I was looking for a better pay and opportunity, when i found it i submitted my two weeks notice."
good,I was there over 2 years and was laid off despite the Herald Sq store being massive and understaffed. There were open positions they couldve put people working there but they hired back christmas temps instead and let dedicated people go. They try to do sneaky things that violate the union contract.
good,"Macy's is a supportive culture that allows you to pursue your educational needs. However, work/life balance is difficult. Strong boundaries between work and life are needed."
good,Macy's can be very friendly place to work. Always having good sales. When I worked there the Customers were always first. And the staff works close to keep everything correct.
good,"The pay was good for working in a clothes store. I was in college when I worked here, so the extra money was great. The managers were kind of iffy but you hardly saw them."
good,"Working at Macy's is a very active job, you will be busy running around the warehouse all day. There are many positions available. In ICQA, you run around and scan items all over the floor to make sure they are all in the correct spot and update how many of those items there are."
good,"Working at Macy's was a great opportunity, it gave me the chance to work in a fast paced environment, around great people. Learned a lot about shoe department, and I gained a new respect for the sales associates. I learned about marketing, merchandising, and creating displays in order to attract the customer.  Management  was great they worked collberatively with the sales associates to ensure productivity. Hardest part of the job was making sure the floor stayed neat at all times.  Most enjoyable part was seeing the smile on the customers face, and knowing that u made them happy."
good,Cutting floor hours makes it even more difficult for customers to get the service they expect. Macy's  offers no reason to come in the store as opposed to shopping on line.
good,"Clean fitting rooms and last act. Check out the customers. Clearing Z-rods. Managers are constantly walking around in circles, not too sure as to why. Higher up, like the store director and store manager are some of the most rude people you will ever meet. I can count on one hand how many times they have said any words to me since I've been an employee and I see them every shift I work. It makes you not won't to work. I often feel unappreciated at work which makes it hard to want to go."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I worked here for over 20 years and would probably still be there if I could have promoted.   There is very little opportunity to promote unless you are willing to move to a large market."
good,"Not every manager is the same, but some managers would stress you so much when the job is not supposed to be stressful. It is a fast paced environment at times, but if you cant handle being very busy and multi tasking, then I don't recommend it for you."
good,"Working at Macy's was definitely a learning experience because I had to learn to get out of my comfort zone. The job required to meet a minimum of sales and credits per day, so every day was stressful because I felt the pressure to meet those requirements. On the other hand, I made some good friends there, although it's a hard environment to make nice relationships because it's a competitive job."
good,"Very fast paced job that includes various different tasks to do but never give a proper amount of hours for the employees to complete tasks. If one is to apply to Macys one should expect an unset schedule per-week, lack of hours during certain times of the year, and an ever changing flux of management and or environment."
good,"The company needs to do better at management , they don't care about their representatives being trained appropriately. No one is ever on the same page and customers are always upset."
good,"day at work:"
good,"At first it was a really good work environment and it turned out to not be what I wanted , there’s too much competition inside of the store, everyone loves taking advantage of the other"
good,Management was good at helping you with issues. Extreme high paced work place in the AP field. When i Worked at Macys there was lots of job advancement  opportunities.
good,"The job itself focuses more on customer driven sales instead of maximizing each sale. It was different from other retailers I've worked for previously. Without commission based pay, it lowers the employees level of customer service and the customer's overall experience."
good,"Nice workplace enviroment, I'm not too sure about their hiring process as a drug test wasn't included. Overall good management and training, but many issues with the HR department with scheduling. The Insite website seems to be on maintenance often, so those wanting to pick up hours or post their shifts cannot and this is the only way of doing so to my knowledge."
good,"Pleasant working environment, wonderful co-workers, but there seems to be a shadow of doom hanging over our store.  It could be closed at any time.  Also, the pay is not worth the hard work I have put in, and nothing is ever good enough for management."
good,"The company has gone through two major employee layoffs in the past two years; 7,000 associates in total.  The management ranks have a high turnover rate as the basic training is very poor during the on boarding process.  They have restructured at least 4 times in the past six years and it makes for a poor environment to stay with the company.  In the Joppa facility alone, there were over 10 managers that quit due to poor management concerns from above their level."
good,"Not a team environment. The jewelry was not quality overall.  The senior sales rep was not truthful.  The environment was not a place I would have kept long term.  I do not recommend this Macys as a place of long term, vital employment."
good,The best part about working at Macy's is the people you will work with.  The staff is fun and the managers are outstanding.  Recommended for a part time job.
good,"I, personally, didn't very much care for the heat or how much they moved us around without our consent, but that was just a part of the daily grind. You get used to it. However, standing and walking around for half the day takes a toll on your joints and your sleep schedule with be shaken out of wack."
good,Sales isn’t for everybody but if you really enjoy sales you will love Macy’s. They strongly encourage interaction with customers instead of just waiting at the register. You are scored on your sales performance and if you score high you could end up promoted to head of the department or a commission job.
good,"There is not enough coverage for this particular department. Typical day is exciting, fun work environment, interaction with all associates, enforcing policies/procedures. Long hours during the holidays, overtime is optional. PTO is not flexible due to the department coverage."
good,"Depending on what department you are in, Macys is very competitive. You must meet a goal everyday. if you don""t make that goal then you have more work to do the next day."
good,"great job if you are connected to the Armenian culture other than you get the leftover hours that no one wants."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"It was fun working there. But the pay isn't. It's definitely for teenagers and younger adults that's working towards something better. I wouldn't recommend an adult to settle for it, because the pay is small. Unless you work in shoes or fine jewelry where commission pay is evolved."
good,"The people I worked with, including my managers, were all nice people and enjoyable to work with. However, I felt like there was some communication problems that needed to be worked on."
good,"I can't really say much they only gave me an on call position and I didn't even apply for but it was something. "
good,"My mornings at Macy's start at 6 am every morning. Sometimes we may have a 5 am start but not that frequently.The early mornings are a little hard because i have to wake up at 4:45 am. I've learned a lot here being that this was my first official job. However, there are some negatives that come with this job. One would be the pay its horrible. They want to give you plenty of job responsibilities while they start you at $9 an hour. It's ridiculous. Also your hours are not stable at all. You never know what your hours for next week are gonna look like. Your just hoping for the best.The environment is also not the happiest. You can tell that some of the associates hate there job. My time at Macy's has it's ups and downs but overall it was an alright job for my first one."
good,Lack of advancement makes macy's a difficult place to work in the long run. But great discounts and sales all the time. Employees get the best deals on merchandise
good,Working at Macys made me realize that there are companies out there who care about the customers more than employees. Manager only favors you if you are exceeding sales and will have no respect for you if you are unable to meet the goal for the day.
good,"I have nothing to say really about this job, I am just filling in space to take up the min characters on this field to move to the next step, do not include in review of business."
good,Macys is fun and flexible to work for. They also give you an employee discount. Its good for those going to school and requires flexibility. They offer partime and full time.
good,"typical work day was fast pace. on phones all day helping the customers. They gave great benefits , i was part time and didnt receive anything. the business closed down in 2016. The management was very down to earth.and always willing to help"
good,"Working in a retail positiom was not my intended goal. I had recently divorced and graduated from college during a recession. I accepted this position because I felt that any job was better than no job. I continued searching for work and eventually accepted a position at Windermere Property Management"
good,"Very fast paced during the Christmas season. I worked in just about every dept. Very easy work helping customers and ringing up their sales. I loved the discounts for employee's, especially during sales."
good,A good place for someone without a family and much responsibilities to work for as the salary is not competitive at all the work environment is good and the fact that it is center city based is a plus. I would recommend this place to someone with pay rate caution
good,"I worked at Macy's during the busy holiday season. I was made a manger in the children's clothing department. It was an impossible situation and a lot of hard work in order to keep the department in shape, but I was praised for my hard work and dedication."
good,Continuous reminders to enroll all your customers for Macy's credit cards is insane! Eventually all your customers will already have them and won't need to upgrade. Breaks are nice and depending on your department your shift will be enjoyable.
good,"A  great place to sell because gets a lot of traffic. However management is protective of union employees, and there are to many managers and not enough good salesmen. Human resources is hiring for diversity, not for talented salesmen or saleswomen."
good,"Working at macys was great learned how to make a customer smile after the experience at macy,s.Great merchandise ,and selection.The customers made it an enjoyable experience"
good,Most management is bad.  Great co-workers.  Benefits are good. Fast paced environment that requires a lot of detailed work.  Always standing and lots of lifting involved.
good,"jus didnt fit in well there. didnt get enough hours and i was taken advantage of,was made to do things that originally werent in my job description but i did anyway and then was let go."
good,"You are salaried and usually have to work more than 10 hours a day. For fourth quarter you are required to work 6 day works weeks for a total of five weeks. There is no work life balance. It is a fun environment to work in and you learn a lot. If you like working a lot and don't have much of a personal life, this would work for some people."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,i like it at this job i enjoyed making the customer happy and ensuring everything was in order. i learned you cant jugde a book by its cover and its a job that im sure people would love.
good,Always on the move packing online order shipments on the most busiest season of the year. from time to time it was longer shifts then other days management was good.
good,I learned a lot while working at Macy's Inc. If it had not been for poor management I probably would have stayed. There were only 3 Loss Prevention Detectives through our Christmas season. There was nowhere near enough coverage for the store more importantly during their open 24 hrs during the last 3 days before the Christmas Holiday.
good,Macy's is a good job to have as a part time second job or if you are in school needing a flexible schedule. There online schedules were one of the biggest perks to the job. The pay was bare minimum and the employees are under appreciated.
good,"My position is very stressful, the hours allotted for my job are skewed not in my favor and with a constant team of new hires it sets myself up for failure. The women at my job are also extremely condescending and rude, they appear to just live to be mean to anyone who isn't their friend and constantly cause people to want to leave the job. Also my current boss tends to talk to her subordinates in a condescending way as well. Withing the recent months my store has been flipped upside down, people have been fired, promoted, hired, left and the stores (back of house) has been in complete disarray."
good,"As department stores are slowly disappearing, there's a lot of downsizing, constant layoffs, and work overload. Salary is low and really no flexibility in career growth as veterans try to keep their position."
good,Good job for young people on a part time basis. Not a job if advancement is your goal. Frequent management changes resulting inexperience management. The 20% discount in helpful especially on sales items.
good,"I've worked at 3 Macys as a seasonal sales associate."
good,"It's a great first job to get started in the work force. The people are generally easy to get along with and the work is rarely boring unless you decide to slack off, there's always something to do. Even as an on call associate I've managed to pick up enough hours to work as often as a part timer. If you do have a problem all you have to do is speak up to either your manager or HR and you will be heard and something done about an issue."
good,A typical day at work included putting clothes back where they came from and helping customers. I learned the value of being kind to others. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the fitting rooms. The most enjoyable part of the job was ringing up sales and giving discounts.
good,Macy's has away of selling you a dream and you might buy into but at the end of the day you feel abused. The people that work for this establishment come from all walks of life . You want too go to place where your job does not weigh on. I feel like Macy's is that kind of place. Part time hires should be happy not spend all your time in a place like Macy's.
good,This brief period at Macy's was an assignment through a outside cleaning agency. I found the experience to be an enjoyable one with Macy's store staff
good,"A typical day at work was coming in and reviewing any new specials or products. Calling our clienteles and setting up facials or make up sessions. I have learned the variety of products provided for different types of skin from damaged to aging. The management was lenient and flexible but firm. It was a diverse setting of various ethnicity. The difficult part of the job was to be able to sale a product to an older crowd with my age at the time. The most enjoyable part was educating myself with people's variety skin types and what products that can prevent further damages. Also, getting to try the products to see what suits my type of skin."
good,"Easy job. Fourth Quarter it can become hectic and more demanding. Coworkers make it worthwhile. Very much routine from day to day duties. Hard to advance, has favoritism."
good,Great way to start or get out there as a first job but I would not recommend staying her long at all. Learned a lot there but the hours quickly became overwhelming
good,"Macy's is a pretty laid back work environment. Not faced paced at all. Not really anymore opportunities to grow with the company which is why Ieft, but if you are looking for a seasonal job for the holidays I highly recommend it."
good,We were understaffed because employees quit because of poor management. If you change your availability they still will schedule you for anytime. They make you stalk customers to apply for credit cards.
good,ok place to work. however way too cutthroat n too much unhealthy gossip management needs to address the older sales associates to help out the new sales associates instead of bullying them
good,"Love the culture of the environment. Employee incentives were decent however the wages where very low. Enjoyed working with the customers. Very diversified customer base. They made my day worth the commute. However, employee morale was very low most times and getting the assistance needed was a little difficult some days."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The discount is great. the pay isnt for someone who likes to shop and save. not consistent shifts. Management isnt good. I worked there for 3years and never met the store manager.
good,"The company has the right intentions but puts too much pressure on stores. Associates have to make sales goals, sell extended warranty programs, or they are let go. Managers have way too much responsibility. There is not enough time in the day to handle all that is required of managers. Then, the good people get eliminated and leaves everyone scrambling to find out who has the answers. It is too stressful. Managers come and go, turnover for associates is high and those that are loyal and stay, cannot guarantee that they will not get cut. "
good,"My managers/supervisors were very nice & helpful when needed, my job as a markdown associate was not hard at all, very repetitive, but did require good attention to detail & a sense of urgency to get as much done as possible during your shift. Did not want employees to work overtime. My fellow co-workers were always friendly and helpful. Constant standing, bending, stooping, carrying & pushing large racks of clothes. Always running around from one end of the store to the other. Had to wear comfortable shoes. I enjoyed keeping busy at this job, but the pay was very low for the amount of work involved, also, not enough hours."
good,For part time use but a great learning job. The way they manage the associates are great and the management is great. Not the best job if you are interested in getting promoted.
good,I personally wasn't a fan of working at Macy's. It was a temporary position with little to no hours for two months then the expectation to work approximately sixty hours a week. I was also pregnant at the time and couldn't quite keep up with that. The people working there were very friendly and I would have stayed if my pregnancy didn't get in the way.
good,"Hours are only plentiful around the holidays and sometimes during our inventory period. I enjoyed the people I worked with and we all got along like a family. The pay was low and during the non-peak time of the year, you were lucky to get 20-25 hours a week. I stayed there because of the people, but I just couldn't afford to stay any longer."
good,"It's a stressful work environment, it's not worth the pay. The hours are limited and the early mornings are killer. Support associates get over looked and over worked"
good,Working at macys is a fantastic opportunity if you are a college student. I began working at Macy's in Temecula starting my first year at school and I've been there for 2 years now. The hours are flexible and the managers are pretty forgiving when it comes to scheduling if you talk to them in advance. You must have patience to deal with the customers though.
good,I enjoyed my short time at Macy's. Lost my job due to Macy's annual job cuts. Job security is not good! Co-workers very easy to get a long with. Great team environment.
good,"This is not a job if you are trying to survive. They past qualified employees up on better positions. Managers are micro managers. Not enough PTO options. They have a My Day, My Way for schedules and its a dictatorship of your life and schedule. You don't have options, pay scales is poor. No real raise, pennies, literally. Demanding to work all holidays"
good,"The best thing about macys' was specifically the crew that I worked with. The job I had was under appreciated, the hours were ungodly, the scheduling was havoc. I couldn't plan much in advance with their putting out our schedules by the week. Out of all the places I've worked it was worst in this respect. A typical day was not too hard but perhaps frustrating from the forced use of older technology. Management was always changing, so I can't consistently say it was good or bad."
good,I started out at what they call full time which could mean you could work anywhere from 28 plus hours depending on what they scheduled and what you could pick up from other co-workers.
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers. the hardest part was keeping the place clean due to so much customers. workplace culture was diverse. management was good. i learned how to fold properly, work in a fast pace, help customers find what their looking for. a typical day at work is helping over 100 people with ringing up clothing, helping find cloths or also putting away the clothes"
good,From day one I was not given proper training and the older employees did not want to train properly to ensure that seasonal works did not learn all the requirements.
good,"Manager were not pleasant to work with. They did not have respect at all. They will talk negative to you. If you asked a  question, they will look at you like you are crazy"
good,I enjoyed working for Macy's.  I learned how to handing large amount of cash. I also enjoyed the discount I received. I loved the free samples and using products everyday to help sell products to the customer
good,I would prefer not to comment about a company that I am currently working for.   I would recommend working for Macy's as a second job for people who really don't need the money.
good,"Huge emphasis on sales, numbers and ""the customers always right"" mentality. Felt like a pushy salesman or a welcome mat. The company doesn't particularly care about you and my area manager certainly didn't care about me."
good,A typical day was loading the room and unloading the product into the bins. I learned a lot about how the scanning process work and learned to view items on the computer.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I worked at macy as a. Janitor love it. Clean had time no rush whats so ever. Was part time but still job is a job. I was looking for full time, mother of 3 kids. The pay was not enough though"
good,"This was a logistics job--so the work itself just involved sorting boxes and taping items."
good,Macy's is awesome at giving schedules in advance. Often times they would give the schedule six weeks in advance. The only poor thing is that there is no consistency in the schedule.
good,"worked here over holiday season, was good job but management wasn't easy to talk to, and people didn't check to make sure you were doing your job, coworkers were nice"
good,"It wasn't a bad job.  I didn't like having to push credit cards on everyone, but I liked shopping so I enjoyed helping people with their purchases. It was a typical retail environment, nothing special to comment on."
good,"Great place to work! Flexible schedule, fun and  safe environment, The hardest part of the job is to maintain a clean environment due to massive sales."
good,Job is hard work and constantly busy. Not many coworkers actually wanted to do the job but were very nice people. Managers wanted to tell you what needed to be done but did not really want to help get those tasks done. Almost impossible to advance with the company. worked there for years and never moved up at all regardless of promises for advancement
good,"Overall, being a sales associate required patience and speed. We needed to be constantly associating and engaging ourselves with the needs of the customers. We learned how to work basic computer software when ringing up customers and attempted to keep personal contact with customers to let them know of oncoming sale events. Managers were decent there, some knew how to manage better than others."
good,"Before working here, please be expected to be on your feet the ENTIRE TIME. yeah, its base pay with the commission, but comes at a D*ck head of a catch. you have to pay a draw first then commission starts rolling in."
good,I get paid every week which is amazing but trading shifts is a bit hard. Also is understaffed. Commission is great on busy days but returns are awful.
good,Macy's was a good job but nothing more.  If you need a paycheck and our working towards something else its fine but don't expect much advancement or help if you are a part time associate.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of opening registers, counting the drawer, maintaining cleanliness of my area and making sales. The hardest part of the job had to be work and personal life balance because of the inconvenient schedules that were given."
good,"Not much postive to say, the Store Manager took little to no interest in your development. Never walked my floor with me the entire time I worked there. I always had to insert myself into the conversation when high level people walked the floor. The rest of the management staff (with a few exceptions) were cold and self-centered."
good,"I worked the Holidays at Macy's and my typical day would usually consist of folding clothes and cleaning chaining rooms every house.  I would also direct people to parts of the store and help them with purchases, trying to give them the best sales.  Occasionally I would Open or Close the register to count the bills."
good,"Very slow. Macy's Eastland is now closed. I stood in middle of aisle and sprayed, handed out samples of men's fragrance. Open Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, thursday, friday, Saturday and Sunday."
good,"Despite having separated from the company, I liked my experience because of my co-workers and the regular customers who came in with a smile. They made the mundane and stressful worth it. I learned and gained a fair amount of knowledge from my co-workers. What I have learned the most is the more positive your attitude, the less likely you are to stress during peak times."
good,It was enjoyable at first but they favor the older people more. They think as if the new people are trying to steal their job. I was not on call at first hen ended up being one without notice. It feels as if I do not even work there because they do not give me any hours since April.
good,"Very spontaneous environment. Mostly, the amount of customers is consistent and other times it becomes overwhelming with the ratio of customers to the number of employees on the floor to help. The training from the assisting managers was great. They were very helpful. I worked in handbags and learned a great deal about the types of bags, specifically Michael Kors. Overall, the job was easy and simple, provide good customer service and open or close the register depending on your shift. I improved my level of patience and understanding as devotedly working to succeed in giving superb customer service, of course with the help of the team of coworkers on the floor."
good,Learned how to be my own boss. How to manage and run my own counter as if it was my own boutique. Met different customers and did there makeup. this is a great job
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Being an Associate at Macy's at the Burlington Mall was an exciting job for me. There were always fun and positive moments. I enjoy customer service. It built my customer interaction skills.
good,"Lots of change and uncertainty right now, jobs and expectations are changing daily"
good,"Working at Macy's retail, only during the holidays was very fast paced. When the holidays ended, not many sales occured and all seasonal hires were let go without official notification."
good,the company always has some sort of party for appreciation of employees.bad things is that they are serious lay off & cut backs do to the economy.hope this is helpful
good,"This environment is super fast paced. Theres so much going on all at once.You do learn to highly muiti-task on a day to day. Theres a lot of competition. Management is okay, theres a lot of room for improvement. The hardest part of the job is maintain your numbers while still trying to increase them and make goal. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new clients and building a special bond."
good,If you thrive off of drama you will do great. It can be good but since they hire young kids it's hard to get any real work done it's hard dealing with Macy's rules and then the other companies rules too
good,Just like any retail job. Very dependent on the management of the specific store you are working at. I happened to be lucky and have the chance to work with great coworkers and managers. No complaints. Only complaint is with the company itself; poor compensation.
good,"The past 10 years have been a great learning experience. Ive gotten the opportunity to meet customers from all walks of life, as well as the  development of my communication and problem solving skills.  I've had plenty of opportunities to mentor new employees."
good,Long standing company with a lot of positives but needs to change to survive.  Ability to move within the company exists but often to the detriment to any consistency for the business.
good,"There was always something to do. A lot of different aspects to be learned. Many different departments, training others, cleaning, walking, manual labor, and efficiency."
good,"Macy's was a good place of employment, however there is no room for advancement in most stores and there is a sense of favoritism. The Macy Money is a great employee incentive! The reason for the low rating is the dynamics put in place when a department is dissolved. Current employees must re apply and no assistance is given."
good,I worked at Union square in San Francisco which is a Union Store and because of that I was on a Base plus Commission sales position.  I was motivated to help the customers and received additional pay for it.  However there are very few union stores in the country and the Management is attempting to eliminate it completely.  If it were not for the Commission I would have not been paid enough to stay as long as I did.
good,"The day would start by showing your work badge at the security  station, head to the clock in stations, head to the beauty Dept, which would take 7-8 mins.  I started off by Checking out the product from the blue totes, and scan them into their home location,   (im a very fast learner by the way)   then i started to pick the beauty product did that for a couple weeks, then started to do Replenish stock. worked my tail off, outta the 100 new hires that were there, was there every single scheduled work day, (i was a seasonal hire)  to only find out that they hired only 2 people out of the 100 and i wasn't one, i was always finding work to do, via the supervisor...   Management plays favorites and only hire pretty looking girls..."
good,Good place to start off a work career. Learn some of the basic skills you will need for future job and opportunities. Get yourself familiar with a work environment that can be easy but stressful. Learn how to work under pressure or under a time watch.
good,"Great if you love retail, don't mind working all weekends/holidays. I have worked at three locations and liked they all. Company culture is ""go go go!"" all the time"
good,Good company to work for alot of overtime available  not alot of advancement available great overall hours and days to work  different shifts available to work
good,Lack of organization.  Very small amount of communication between the managers and kept the employees confused because of the constant misinformation that was expressed.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"It was fun working at a makeup counter, planning events and activities to promote business at the counter. I enjoyed all the other vendors who came in"
good,"I worked as a Part-time employee . Tried to get full-time from day one . Was there almost a year. I believe Macy's is a great Company to work for . Would love to grow with them . But I had to deal with things were bad and So when you deal with things that your Manager is responsible for and comes out . Just because you mention it. You are the bad person and you don't get to be full-time.  There's a lot of issues "
good,Macys is a competitive workplace. You'll get great hands on experience and communication skills. You have many tasks to complete in a typical day. Can feel overworked and underpaid.
good,"The employees are definitely the highlight. There are opportunities for lateral movement and promotion. "
good,"they don't pay enough but want u to work long hours for minimum   the supervisors are rude to new people,   the work schedules are alwsays messed up all the time"
good,"I was working night shifts and it did not fit the hours for my schooling and it was only seasonal employment, but only after a month they wanted to keep me. I gave them my 2 week notice and left, due to me schooling."
good,"The work was not hard and the hours were consistent, however, hard to become permanent. They can be strict within reason, but the workers are pretty descent."
good,"my typical day at work is taking care of the customers needs ,listening and giving advice, in my department we are like family we all from different cultural back ground but we get along fine . our management staff is all good to our needs. being at macys I have learn at lot I can merchandise I can do signing and scanning etc being there thought me a lot and I am willing learn new things every day ."
good,"Job work/life balance: It great that you can make your schedule by picking up shifts."
good,"It's a good place to work if your not planning on making a career there, it is  a friendly enviroment when it comes to the people you work with, they're engaged in makig the work place a little bit better everyday"
good,"Macy's is a great place to develop many skills required in a fast paced environment where multi-tasking and delegation is the norm. "
good,loved this place everyone mad sure you knew what you was doing . i worked as cleaning and cashier which was the easiest things of them all. all the managers were professional . i loved working in juniors the worst part of the job was nothing because i loved that job too
good,I love working for Macy's. But when it comes to a raise it is not a company to work for. I have been with the company for a year and a half but only had a quarter raise. I have worked 6 to 7 days a week just to have 36-40 hrs a week in order to pay bills. To live comfortably this is not a company to work for unless you are a college student that has finance aid that pays for half you're bills.
good,I worked at Union Square in SF which is a union store.  The pay was good for a department store because it was base plus commission.  The hardest part of the job was selling the Macy's credit card it is a bad product that I was forced to offer to the customer.  I was not a fan of the culture there because they would make it so I would not want to be promoted to management.  The company would move managers all the time so it was much more stable to remain in sales.
good,"first stable job, it was ok, not great, but I had some good coworkers, some good managers, also learned a lot on being disciplined, it was alright in ways"
good,"I learned a lot about the making of many furniture manufacturers.  A typical day at work for me since, being a part timer fluctuated.  At times it was very busy and other time it was very quiet.  Many of the crowd were the late shopper."
good,"Doesn't really care about the employees or their life or their health it seems like. Just as long as you show up on time you'll keep your job. However, god forbid you are sick or have a family emergency or are in college trying to better your future. Availability request is a joke. You come when they say you come and that's it. There's a point system. You start with 9.You have the option to switch shifts or ""advertise"" and hope that someone can pick up your shift or is willing to switch with you so that you can make it in on time. If no one does and you still can't make it, because say for example you have class, you lose a point. This was their attempt at being convenient. Unfortunately its not predictable so you cant plan your life around your schedule as you do work different shifts on different days every week."
good,My responsibilities while working here were to change light bulbs and unload the delivery truck which arrived on Tuesdays and Thursdays  to bring new merchandise. I was responsible for switching merchandise from different stockrooms and taking plastic off of merchandise.
good,Its a pretty decent job if you like retail but you really get no recognition for your hard work. Not much room for advancement. You have to clock out for lunch which is ok if your part time.
good,the hard part of working for retail would have to be watching out for those who would steel clothing and other things from the department store.  making sure that your section that you working in wasn't being taken from those who wanted to steel
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I don't feel that they paid us enough to work there. Especially with such high demands and standards. The management was somewhat snotty and always expected you to do things that weren't even part of your job.
good,"A typical day at work is always being ready and prepared for anything that comes my way. Managing a team has helped me build customer service and customer interactions skills. The best part of managing a team, is building a team that works together and that communicates efficiently. Having a great team eliminates any potential of having a bad part of the job. Interacting with customers and getting to know their experience is always the best part of any job."
good,"This company have the most unprofessional set of managers, I have never worked around the most impolite, unorthodox, inmate set of individuals. I won't recommend this job to my worst enemy."
good,I feel Macy's overall just was not a great fit for me. The way management only cared about the promotions for the Macy's cards was the first negative for me. I never want to feel like I'm bashing something over someone's head as if they are obligated. I had the opportunity to work at two different locations one big and one small and both of them had the same outcome.
good,"Enjoyed working with the public, especially in Fine Jewelry.  "
good,This place was really helpful for me  because I needed a lot of flexibility and you can learn many things about fast pace work environment and team work. Costumer service is needed as well and always have a smile on you so the costumer will always feel welcome back in the store. The hardest part is when you need to calm down some people who does not reason at all and can act very aggressive. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with many different people who taught me so many views about life and work related.
good,the experience at Macy's varying by region and manager. Such a large retailer makes it hard to be recognized. Compensation can be fair at the executive level but there is not much job security.
good,"There is just not job security right now. The associates are really great and fun to work with. It is a fast pace job, some is repetitive but for the most part it is always something different"
good,"I have nothing to say about this company. They are closing a lot of stores which is its own review.  Think what you may"
good,"Pleasant atmosphere and staff.  Only complaint is that the warehouse was too hot at times.  They only enforced rules when they felt necessary, such as dress code and food and beverage rules.  Otherwise show up work hard and maybe they will keep you after the season ends, oh wait I did and they offered positions to people that didn't."
good,"I really loved this job other than the poor management. I didn't mind working long hours and full time, I encouraged it. They just quit giving me shifts."
good,"Ive been here since I was 18. I am now 22 and find it the biggest regret of my life. Theres no really moving working retail here. Its so hard to support a family or even help out with a job like this. They don't work around your schedule at all.  Its not bad as a first job , but if you have bills to pay this isn't the place."
good,The Employees are what make the place even semi enjoyable. Till your separated between rows and rows of products for hours on end. Little to zero management involvement.
good,"A good job for college kids who need something to get through their degree, not a job for advancement. A good job for a work/ life balance somewhat easy to get days off if you have things to do. Not a great job for healthcare of benefits."
good,"Poor management, managers are very young most are just coming out of college so they have no communication skills or no problem resolution skills. "
good,Morning unload of shipments.  Stock carried to floor.  Items checked for correct pricing.  Learned to work within a group setting.  Management overall was quite good.  I got along with my co-workers well.  The most difficult part of the job was learning to exact floor layout in each directive.  The enjoyable part of the position was working with customers after the morning opening
good,"Maintaining department appearance, inventory, product knowledge and reaching sales goals."
good,"Pros: Great people to work with, Executive Development Program is great training"
good,"I enjoyed working here, but was given more hours that I wanted. My co-workers were all very nice. Some managers were nicer than others."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,It has taught me how to handle difficult customers in an efficient and yet satisfying manner. I enjoy meeting all types of people in my job and especially finding that special gift for someone in my customers life.
good,"I feel like the local Macy's needs to be overhauled. It has a few good managers, the rest are toxic and ungrateful. I hear it was once a wonderful place to work and I am inclined to believe it since there are people who have worked their entire lives at Macy's. I feel like this Macy's can be saved but they need better-trained management and to raise wages. Micromanagement kills morale. Lack of staff coverage and appreciation also kill morale."
good,"-Very very early in the AM"
good,"seasonal job"
good,"The people I worked with were amazing, and at times the work was rewarding, even though some customers can prove difficult with certain attitudes they bring. The management structure wasn't very good, communication could be improved but they did alright for what they were working with."
good,"fun place to work and everyone works as a team there, meet lots of great people. the employee discounts is just one good peak"
good,There are a lot of different personalities that work there and if you can get along with them you'll like it. The customers are also very my way or the highway and the company rolls over. The hours can be decent but management doesn't understand how the real world works when you are selling on the floor.
good,"Sometimes the heavy lifting was difficult, but you never felt too rushed, the storeroom was always almost as cold as outside and usually was so full of boxes that walking from one end to the other was difficult. Everyone would often poke their fingers on security tags, from poking them through clothes, or from fishing them out of the large barrels they were dumped in. It wasn't as organized as it should've been."
good,"It was good working there, but I found myself in many situations where I was either not trained enough or being left to handle jobs meant for many people."
good,a typical work day at macys usaually consisted of merchandising and putting things in place on the sales floor. folding organzing and un packing products daily
good,I came in for the holiday season last year and was told I was going to be in one particular department and once I was done training they put me in every department except the department I was told I was going to have . The management was almost non exsistant. I couldn't pinpoint who my manager was because I was working under so many people and that made it hard for them to get to know me. They showed favoritism which is never good .Once the holiday season was over I expected to get a permanent position but instead it looked like they picked people who they favored and it didn't seem like their work ethic mattered at all. I was a very hard worker and worked over time when I was needed but they kept all the complainers and lazy people. I was thinking of applying again for this holiday season but it's just not worth it.
good,Great for part time while in college or second job for a little extra cash. Not recommended for long term or career. Don't expect to move up with at the location.
good,"A fast paced work environment, learnt to be an achiever, handling challenging clients  became the most enjoyable part of the work."
good,"No training"
good,"Working at Macy's is great during the off season periods, but this is a company that is known for Christmas products and Christmas is a regular word and sight beginning in August. So don't expect to have a life between August 1st through December 31st. "
good,"A pleasant environment to work in, but limited opportunities for"
good,"I Love working with people that get the job done, I wish Macyshould pay more for the work we found and the environment we work in. But Macys is an okay job."
good,Macy's is a great job for you if you're interested in the day to day competition of the sales world.The biggest difficulty of working here was trying to find a shift to work. The system to pick shifts is a bit complicated which was a shame because the other coworkers on the floor were a joy to work with.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,my expeience working for Macys was an interesting one. i worked for the company for 4 years and 3 of the 4 years was unhappy. the job was very stressful. the pay was not comparable to the amount of work i was doing.
good,Minimum wage and lack of advancement in the work place. Shortage of work staff especially during major sales can cause turmoil for dedicated workers. overall the working experience is jovial
good,"After working in a Macy's for 1  and a half years, I couldn't wait to get out of there. The sales commission was ridiculous because of their return policy being so lax. Yes, you get a few cents when people buy things, but they return them frequently because they can. So the company takes the money away at paycheck time.Also the base pay is minimum wage matter  where you came from and how much experience you had. Some associates took advantage of their superior position of longstanding by stacking or layering many customers at a time. As in : I'm helping her, and her, and her...... Management has many departments and is for the most part fair, calm and useful. But the customer is always right and you are not."
good,"Not very supportive, management sticks to all business aspects and fails to follow work life balance. A very who do you know in order to progress in the company"
good,"I was a part of a recovery team, I did inventory some times, I learned how to interact well with others to accomplish tasks. Athough, I would say that having this job was very hard because my manager was also new and I don't think either of us knew much what we were doing at the time. He was very pleasant, but we didn't often see eachother during the work day, which lead me to do a lot of work on my own."
good,"A typical workday consists of cleaning and folding up clothes, returns, purchases, and consistently utilizing people skills. But at my time there I learned allot about clothes and how to measure their quality. Although ""I will say there is a major disconnect between employees and the management. It always seemed to me that the management played favorites. As for my coworkers, they're all awesome at their jobs and very bright and nice people. The hardest part of the job is dealing with snippy customers while the best part of the job was my coworkers."
good,This a really good workplace to gain customer service experience and to get a feel in the retail world. Very flexible with scheduling.
good,"we will run shoes, pull markdowns or assist in any others as needed. sometimes the manager will pull some of the guys in my area to another to help. it is difficult getting things done when no one is on the same page, the best part of the job is the coworkers who normally have great attitudes. while on this job i have learned more about management, holding people accountable and budgeting hrs."
good,I wouldn't work for them again! management is un orderly and no matter how good you work as a seasonal employee they will never ask you to stay on and will find ridiculous ways to fire you.
good,It use to be a great place to work for... last year it went downhill for me. Managers talking to you disrespectful on the sales floor in front of customers and other co-workers..I worked 19 years and just had to leave... they claim there is a union for this store but it does nothing for the working person when you truly need them...
good,"Work day consisted mainly of monitoring a floor where no one really came often to buy, mostly because a competitor was nearby and the store was in the very back of the mall. "
good,I love working with customers. helping them out even if it wasn't my department and I didn't make the money off it its all about GOOD CUSTOMER service!!!!
good,Fun and busy. Had training process but was not very good. Computer training and on the floor is very different. Had to learn as you go. Team members were not very friendly or helpful.
good,"Great co-workers and great support team management.  Support associates are all flexible and are assigned to work wherever is needed after fulfilling their given jobs for the day.  I am over shoe stock.  This entails unloading and putting new stock away and maintaining/organizing the stock room every morning (6:30-10:30).  I also will pull and ticket clearance shoes every week.  The afternoon (after 10:30AM) can put me anywhere from fulfillment orders to markdowns with the rest of the team, processing product down on the dock, or sometime staying in shoes if the load demands it."
good,barely reach your sales goal for the day because there isn't a lot of customers and its hard to get out of deficit. the managers are never nowhere to be found.
good,"I am a merchandiser at Macy's. My job requires me to set sales, mark down prices,and put out merchandise. I work part time which is only 4 hours a day. From what I understand, Macy's only gives out so many hours to the managers and the managers have to take those hours and divide them up to their department staff. I am not sure if it only works like this for the support staff and the different departments that make up the support staff or if it is a store wide thing, I'm not sure. Sometimes I will want to work more than 4 hours but my manager says no. If there is a lot of work to do he will ask me to stay. Maybe all of a sudden the hour fairy comes and  gives extra hours on days when there is a lot of merchandise that needs to be put out(I am rolling my eyes while I type this fyi). I have been employed at Macy's for almost 2 years. The other thing about Macy's is that they work on a point system. You start out with 10 points. if you are 1 to 5 minutes late you lose half of a point if you call out for the day you lose one whole point. If you call out on the weekend you lose 2 points. You can earn the points back. You have to come to work two weeks on time consecutively to earn half a point back, so it takes a month to earn two points. The best thing about my job is that my manager has worked with me as far as time off because I am a single parent and my child would get sick or some kind of issue, I get to interact with different people, I am always moving and I learned a lot about using the RFID handheld and about how the behind the scene people work to keep the store operating."
good,"Great work life balance, but needs more diversity in management and more consistency in the messages given to employees. People working there are extremely smart though."
good,"tough to maintain a living and move up in the company since it going through a rough time in the market. "
good,"Macy's on State Street taught me a lot of what I needed to know, in order for me to move up within the store. My managers coached me into becoming a great merchandiser, who is self-sufficient in his field, and can lead a team. My team was very hard working, we had a great understanding of what each others roles were, and we executed accordingly. One year a member of my team and I both received Macy's Making Magic Awards, which I believe said a lot about our work ethics. The most enjoyable part about my Team Lead job was simply the fact I got to lead/ and work with such a great team of people, who all worked their hardest and the team chemistry was amazing."
good,"a typical day working at macys was busy, fast paced during the day shifts I wouldn't recommend to be scedueld nights especially if your considering to be a commissioned based worker since nights were frequently slow and empty (you wont make any commission during nights) if you enjoy interacting with people this would be the perfect job for you"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macys had a great work life balance you could choose to use points to not work on certain days, Co workers were extremely friendly but management lacked the skills and care to help employees."
good,"It's an okay temporary job, did not see a future in it. Paid the bills that I had at the time. Thought the management did a great job and I was happy for working there."
good,"A typical day at work involved meeting to a customers needs, no matter what your task.  The customer was always the first priority."
good,"It's an alright place to work if you're not scheduled as a seasonal recovery shift employee. "
good,"Opportunity to work in many different areas,depts.,etc, overall great company assisting the customers and keeping the store organized ."
good,"Management suck, pay was not good. I did not like it at all. Having to deal with rude customers every single day of the week. it was just horrible and i would not work there again."
good,"Macy's was a difficult job but I enjoyed it all the same.  I worked early morning shift and it was severely understaffed but the people made it a great team.  Lots of work with little direction, I believe they have since changed their structure to support this role better.  The hard work was a great lesson in life, as well as the great team work that existed there."
good,"Meet many nice co-workers and customers, learned all phases of jewelry selling, new promotions, mark downs, clearance, and mark ups."
good,love working here. Best Job I ever had! I LOVE talking to customers and meeting my sales and credit goal. Only thing I didn't like was the amount of hours.
good,"Macys was my first job out of college. I was with the company for 6 years. There really was not any sort of work life balance. Jobs and hours were always getting cut, which means the workload always fell on to the salaried executives. Over the years they have tried working on engagement b/c turnover is always so high. Compensation is horrible. Under payed for working 50-60 hours a week. The best part of working for Macys was meeting the people that I can now call my bestfriends."
good,"IF you want to just work , this is the place for you ! However if you want to actually help people resolve an issue , this may not be the best place."
good,"It's Good Temp job, and an overall good learning experience for those entering retail.  You can move around and learn almost all aspects of working at a major retailer."
good,hours not what you expect and commission is so hard to understand that even the manager can't explain it to you. customers are very rude.
good,"Not a lot of room for advancement, managers are never present.. Hours are decent, pay is decent.  Okay if you're just looking for a ""filler"" job."
good,"Sales. how to interact with customer on the regular. making sure the department up to par. Had a great relationship with my co-workers."
good,"Overall it is like any other retail job. Not enough hours or pay. One of the best things is if you are in school there is flex schedules to make that possible."
good,"Macy's is a place of business with 3 floors in which the management expect seasonal workers to keep clean for $8.50 an hour. Christmas time is very hectic, the amount of work that needs to be done is not equivalent to the amount of pay in which you receive."
good,"The management lays duties upon duties on their associates.  They don't care about the associates.  Management will work them hard, with not much reward."
good,"Each day I learned a new skill in Macy's HR office. "
good,Macy's was a very laid back environment with not a lot of micro-managing. I would recommend this job to college students who are not looking to make a serious living from this job but just looking to have some mont in their pocket.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macy's is a fast past distribution center. You learn something new everyday. The distribution center is a close knit team depending on each other to effectively get the job done. The job requires working long hours as needed, however it also included different jobs."
good,"Job was temporary not permanent, some training but not much, felt loss at times, employee's not to friendly because they knew we were only temporary, management did not help with concerns.  But if I would have been able to work full time permanently the place was not perfect but it was retail"
good,"it is a small group of us which turns what should be a family environment to a catty highschool clique, when most employees are men and there's only three girls. The management team plays favorites."
good,"I was a bra fit specialist, so I showed customers how to pick a bra based on their needs and wants. I also demonstrated the use and care of the bras.  Receiving a discount at the store is a great thing if you were big on shopping."
good,"Works days went well, especially dealing with customers face to face, they always make the day. The company as a whole is not family oriented, but the co workers were delightful. I learned patience and communication is very important."
good,"low salary"
good,"This job was spending money for me throughout my last two years of high school, and my freshmen year of college.  It worked with my school schedules, until I started working at the current job where the two eventually interfered with each other.  I enjoyed the company overall, and still shop there occasionally to this day."
good,I worked for Macy's after awhile I did not care for it cause at times the managers had favorites people that they made excuses for. Also night crews never put away clothes always left it for the morning crew
good,"minimum wage $7.25 for 2 years ,long hours on your feet. Management was great. Team members excellent . great opportunity to interact with people . "
good,It was what you made of the job. I worked with an older group of employees who mostly needed extra cash. It's a good part time job to have but I didn't see myself making a career out of it.
good,"A typical day consist of heavy flow of customers. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday. The Management was good. I loved my co-workers. I learned costumer service skills, money handling skills, and etc...."
good,"Biased, does not recognize hard work.  Terrible learning environment for new workers.  I felt alone and I had no foundation for learning very complex procedures.  I had to ask around for help from people who were working also.  Chaotic atmosphere which creates stress."
good,"Macys was an okay place to work, not a lot of opportunities to advance and not a lot of help from upper management. very sloppy on scheduling."
good,"Not a terrible place, they don't give enough hours and management tends to be rude to employees.Co-workers are mostly good people and you can hold conversations with them during the day to make tasks that are monotonous go by a little faster"
good,"If you like working with people and, your a team player this is the job for you. not everyone if a team player so be ready to pull your weight."
good,"I worked with the support team, so we were in there early mornings changing signs. Unfortunately, hours were not the best and only a few full-time/part-time positions were open. If you are not a morning person this is not the job for you. Tasks were calculated in the computer on how long it should take you to complete it, but it was very unrealistic."
good,It is a fun place to work in as your starting job. Helped me through the college years because of flexible hours and schedules.
good,"The management doesn't care if someone stole your sale to reach their job goal, it's your fault you didn't make it. If you don't get enough credit for the day you get reprimanded. And those who reach their goals are treated like they're on a pedestal even though they steal someone else's sale. Everyone thinks their department is better and no one wants to help anyone else. It's competitive even when most departments don't work on commission."
good,the only thing i enjoyed with working with macys was i met good friends. other than that the macys that i worked at needs BIG improvements with better managers etc.
good,there wasnt much room to grow in the company and the management was not helpful either with the process of growth. the environment wasnt the greatest to work in either.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The employees always looked happy and friendly. Yet, the sales goals made the employees very competitive towards each other. I worked as on-call. Therefore, this allowed me to set my own hours and days. This also allowed me to work in all the departments and to gain experience."
good,"Great for part time employment and flexible scheduling.  An excellent opportunity great for retired, stay at home spouses with flexible lifestyles."
good,"Most work days at Macys are routine, unless there is a big Sales Event. The same process is generally followed day in and day out."
good,"You would Macy's is the place to work and gain experiences, the experiences yes but not a place you would want to create a career out of."
good,"A typical day at Macy's would be walking around looking for a customer to help running around gathering and putting away shoes that was requested by a customer, having to stay busy even if there was no customers to help. the coworkers where very competitive because the work was commission base. the management for the women shoe department was very helpful and hands on, they where always looking for ways to help a worker sale more or teach them how to approach a customer or ways to try to convenes a customer to buy a pair of shoes. over all i didn't really enjoy working at macy's."
good,"It was an okay work experience. Management doesn't care anything about your life or family / emergency issues that come up, only that you are at work making them money."
good,When you first start the job they just expect you to know exactly what to do. There's no type of guidance and being that Macy's is so big you dont know exactly who to go to with a problem and when you do find someone they give you the run around. There was really no team work because during seasonal which was the time I worked everyday you was working with someone new. The hardest part of the job was trying to assist a customer with something that only a manager could do because a manager was barely around and the hardest thing to do was contact them and when you did it took almost 30 minutes for them to get to you.
good,A typical day as a Sales Associate requires stocking and organizing clothing and working the cash register. Communicating with new customers everyday is mostly very pleasant and keeps the day interesting.
good,"some managers really suck. a couple are awesome. no hot water so no proper hand washing after a potty break. managers hound you all day every day to get people to sign up for credit cards, and no matter how hard you try sometimes it just dosent happen, and god forbid that. you wont hear the end of it."
good,"I was very excited when I moved to cosmetics, but after a while I figured out that the environment in the cosmetic department wasn't something that I wanted to stay apart of. "
good,"Not too much opportunity for advancement, the benefits are not good, healthcare benefits are too high, salary its ok if you have been working there for along time.  Not my favorite place to work."
good,"security for loss prevention over all good company to work for store location very busy in downtown Los Angeles, job duties were intense to do public traffic, parking was expensive for me per day as i progressed coming in daily."
good,"Not ran as well as it could be, but the managers try, and that's all anyone can ask for. The shifts most of the time were pretty short, and from living a far distance, half the time it was hard making it to work 30 miles away, for three hours worth of payment at minimum wage."
good,best for someone who quickly needs a job. coworkers are great and the freedom is cool. stay to yourself and work and get credits.
good,"the only thing i enjoyed was helping customers with their cosmetic needs. the work environment around the counter was horrible, and the communication between the managers and the employees was bad also."
good,"know all your products that are in your department"
good,"I was there for a year and a half, when first getting hired there was no one around to help when needed. Mangers are never in contact with other manager and they can't ever be found when needed. The constantly harass for associates to get credit cards open. they have little appreciation for a good job. Be aware that they would look for anything to fire a person. The only discount as an employee is 20% which is nothing. The atmosphere is a face pace environment and getting to know co-workers is not easy since they don't welcome new  co-workers unless you have something to offer. The job is pretty easy once you get the hang of it. The pay is low from $9 and moving up in the company isn't something to happen."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A typical day at work begins with opening registers and tidying service areas. I have learned to work quickly, effictively, and politely with customers. I have also learned multitasking during short interactions with customers. My management is very supportive of their employees. They empower us to make decisions without their assistance or approval and recognize us for achievements. My co-workers and mostly students and have the job for extra money outside of school. The hardest part of my job is working hard for very little pay. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with many people everyday."
good,Not a bad company. All the co-works I work with were nice and cool to work with. Hardest part of the job was remembering which clothes went on what rack.
good,great for extra cash...not so much if this is the only job you have..retail pays little and asks for alot of responsibilities in order to get 10 cents raise
good,Dealing with the direct public every day all day long. Team work was always great and customer service was good as well. The hardest part of the job was the holiday season.
good,"Never really enjoyed it, a lot of pressure to open credits. I would have liked more advancement but always turned down. Never really enjoyed work."
good,"Fast pace environment, have to learn quickly, attend to multiple customers at once. I learned how to work together with others and how to handle the fast environment."
good,Managers lack basic skills for their respective positions. They fail to upkeep a good morale among the crew members. They're more bosses than leaders.
good,"A good place to work, but the only downfall is the fact that their is no room to climb the cooperate ladder. Promotions in the sales department is limited."
good,"I had a great overall expierence at Macys but not much room to grow. Not a career for me, but a good place to work if in college. They were really flexible about our schedule."
good,a typical day at Macy's last for five hours or more depending on the situation. i have Learned how the receiving aspect of retail is done and how to work in a fast paste work environment.
good,"It's a fun environment to work in when you're with the right people but it can definitely get stressful when management starts pressuring you to solicit credit card applications. Also, I completely disliked the first come, first serve scheduling format. It's truly inconvenient because as a temporary associate, I wasn't even guaranteed at least 20 hours a week and if I was able to pick up a shift it would either be only 4 hours long or closing."
good,"A typical day at work was a full shift for 8 hours, but shift times varied drastically. I learned how to coach and lead a team of employees. Management was good but managers were often stressed and burnt out. I loved the people who worked at Macy's. The hardest part of the job was time management because even if you planned your entire week out, it would never all get done. Moreover, because every day was different, constant interruptions, and customer issues take time."
good,"It is retail, not enough pay. Flexible hours, good management, some of staff are friendly. Great customer service. Good hours"
good,"Macy's is an ok place to work but, no the place where you want to stay for ever. They have a very high manger turnover rate which will drive employees nuts since expectations are so inconsistent. Macy's also tends to over work you for the amount that you get payed and doesn't really care about their employees."
good,"The workplace is built around having almost all of the associates working part-time, and working at all sorts of odd hours of the day"
good,"In the department I worked in, it was easy to get away with what you wanted to do and not get in trouble for it. The manager was friends with a lot of the girls who had been working there for a while already, so I wasn't treated very well when I came in. I was not able to change my availability in the scheduling system due to new semesters at school, so I would be scheduled on days I had class and had to give up many, many shifts. The girls I worked with were able to be on their phones and just hang around the cash register whenever they wanted instead of actually working like we were supposed to. It wasn't my best work experience."
good,Macys Cherry Hill is very unorganized when it comes to management style. There are too many chief and not enough indians so to speak. they will low ball you when it comes to terms of pay rate. They will string you along with no knowlegde of what they are doing with your position. They do not communicate well at all.
good,I worked at Macy's when I was in high school and thought it would be a good start for me in the work force. It turns out I was a great sales associate and loved it. My management was awesome and they truly cared. The scheduling is annoying and just sucks. Once you give them your availability you can't change it easily and it takes two weeks to be approved and then corporate schedules so it is random each week and is not consistent. You have to advertise shifts and hope someone picks them up or you have to skip work and that obviously is a terrible thing to do but people do it because it's impossible for shifts to be covered right away. They have a point system for this reason which seems ridiculous to me. Most people who work there are older and tend to be a little stand offish to the younger workers and it's unfortunate. They need to change the scheduling and work on corporate operations and it would be better. If you are an older person who needs a job but not consistency then it is perfect for you. But i wouldn't work here if you are in high school or college due to the fact you have little control on when you actually work.
good,"I merchandise new products to the selling floor as well as open new receipts and put the items in the proper places. "
good,"At Macy's I worked mostly stock, so my basic duties where was making sure shipment arrived and was signed for. Restocking new merchandise, organizing  my area also multitasking with stocking and  helping customers with online orders and in the store purchases. As far as I remember about my co workers they were very  helpful and funny, lots of laugh at this job, I learned at macys customer service skills mostly, hardest part of the job was the long days sometimes due to call outs but otherwise it fun working in the mall and macys."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"temp postion , hours were not that great. Pay was very low. Managers were not very helpful. No advancement, no full time hours."
good,"As a company they are good. But they require way to many things not job related that ARE required. Like getting people to sign up for credit cards, donate to charities at least once a month. Also required associates to donate their own money. That should be a choice, not a requirement. But in general I loved it there. My co-workers were great as were some of the managers."
good,"Most people at Macy's are nice, however when it comes to management I can't say the same thing. Of course it depends from the store. Employees some times are pushed too hard to achieve unrealistic goals and rarely recognized for doing so. Advancement opportunities are for those who really wants to grow. It is hard, but not impossible. The team work and the people I was in charge of were the two things that kept me working there."
good,"There is no typical day at Macy's. It is a fast paced dynamic environment where you encounter a myriad of customers every day. Typically, however, you review your sales goals, and start assisting your customers using M.A.G.I.C. A great tool to help you connect and determine your client's needs. The environment is also team work based. Co-workers are always helping each other out. The hardest part of the job is time management on your busiest days. At times you will have a line of customers to help. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing your clients leave happy and return to you in the future for all of their needs."
good,"You are on your feet 100% of the time, there is no creativity involved, every job is streamlined into specifics tasks, lack of work/life balance"
good,Macy's is a great company with not so great store managers. Working inside of this particular Macy's. The managers seemed to display a LOT of favoritism towards certain employees. My coworkers there would take advantage of their break way too often and would be gone for almost 2 hours. The only enjoyable part of the job is being able to successfully satisfy a disgruntled customer.
good,Enjoyed customer service and interacting with people. Knowing I've helped and satisfy a customer just by knowing my way around the department is a good feeling.
good,you have to work alone a lot often using two registers. managers work multiple areas so its sometimes hard to get help when needed. also their loss prevention is more interested in get the employees fired than watching the customers or any other activity for that matter.
good,"Organize the Store Management Office, execute operational administrative functions, oversee scheduling maintenance."
good,"Nothing much to say about Management,not good.not bad it okay,very good co-worker we help each other, worked as the team."
good,I worked in Macy's for almost 2 years and I was very unsatisfied with my experience at this company. Managers were very unprofessional.
good,The job at Macy's had crazy work hours. I also found out that Macy's didn't have enough spots to make seasonal workers permanent.They ended letting all the new workers go.
good,"Work is pretty easy. Not laborious at all really, though depending on which department you work in you could walk 10-15 miles per day. Pay is pretty low for a warehouse and there does not seem to be much room for job growth since there seems to be a very ""clique-like"" atmosphere around management. There are a lot of really smart and talented people that would make good leaders but are put off in a corner somewhere not using their talents."
good,"The managers were terrible at communicating, the employees were rude to not just other employees but other customers as well. it was jut an overall bad place to work at."
good,"A typical day at work I greet customers, help them find items that best fit them, clean and stock my area, and open up store credits. At Macy's I learned how to be more people oriented and also learned great customer service skills.Management was well put together. My co workers were rude when I first started but as time went by they became more polite. The hardest part about my job is getting customers to open store credits. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping serve the customers needs."
good,During holiday season there's a rush of things to do between juggling customers and making sales goal. Days gets long and slow after holiday. Management is poor a lot of disorder to a lot of things. The store-manager is very distant ad only speaks when there is some type of cooperate is doing a walk through. Co-workers are cool a outside friendship can be made. Nothing really hard about the job.
good,"Enjoyed the customer contact and providing customer service, always with a smile and a kind word.  Merchandising is an additional part of the job that I enjoyed.  The management and fellow associates were pleasant and helpful, for the most part."
good,"I worked here for almost 7 years and got laid off (for the second time). My boss was great and the managers were cool with me. I worked in the back so I didn't have to deal with the stress and mayhem of the sales floor and evil customers. "
good,"A typical day at work would have been organizing clothing on the rails and shelves, replacing clothing items left in the fitting areas back in their proper sections and rails, cleaning the floor of fallen clothing and debris,aiding customers with clothing options, and directing customers to locations of brands and styles. "
good,"The store I worked at had horrible communication skills. They only trained by watching a video. If you're lucky you'll start the following week after training but most start up to 1 month AFTER watching the training videos.  On your first official day no will help you. They force you to make customers apply for a credit card and to put them into a client list when you HAVE to call them once every 3 months if not you get a bad evaluation and they won't give you a raise. The raise is usually only about .10- .25 cents if you're lucky.  As soon as your hired they force you to open a credit card or ""pre-paid"" card to receive store discounts. Management changes like crazy. They put so much more stress on you than that's needed. Just don't do it!!  HR doesn't check when you're actually available they just call regardless of the time.  No matter what department you work they will make you fold the clothes."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I was in the lingerie department, different experience, different customer service experience that I was used to giving."
good,"The work itself wasn't that demanding. My responsibilities were simple, clean the store, assist customers when approached and keep the shelves stocked. I learned how to deal with all types of people. All of the managers except for one said I was an excellent worker. My co-workers were both male and female. I got along with all of my co-workers, we got along as if we were friends instead of co-workers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with my manager because for some reason she didn't like me and blamed me for everything that went wrong, even things that were done when I wasn't even at work. The most enjoyable part of the job was the job itself. Going to work, seeing and conversing with my co-workers and helping the company move its product."
good,"I learned to run a register, and the hustle and bustle of sales life. Folding, attaching price tags, how to look up price of sales items, the original price, as well as sale prices. Hardest part of the job was break time, wasn't long enough to really do anything so there was just idol time. The most enjoyable part was the bustle, and getting to help the customers. I truly enjoyed running the registers at Macy's."
good,"Pay isn't great, hours isn't really guarantee. However the biggest pro is the knowledge you gain especially if you going to school for Retail Management"
good,"I have worked in two different Macy's location as a sale associate and later sales support and I am disappointed. There is no organization or leadership. Although we are required to complete training courses, they do not prepare you for the actual job you were hired to do. Some managers lack the needed qualifications and understanding of what their job functions is and the knowledge to do it and as a result they become overwhelmed . I thought transferring my store location would change my opinion but it only made it worst and solidified it. On the up side, having a flexible schedule and receiving discounts is a plus."
good,"Macy's was a very interesting place to work at. The environment aimed to be professional and clean, although it did not succeed most of the time. We never had enough associates working in the Junior department, which was my department. And during big weekend sales and busy nights, their was never enough coverage for the entire sales floor. I did enjoy the energy of the place. I love working in a team oriented environment because we lifted each other up when someone needed help. I also enjoyed helping customers find exactly what they came in to find, and even for the things they were not expecting to find. The management was very poor and unprofessional and I often felt that they belittled me. Training was very extensive with not enough hands-on action until your first official shift on the sales floor."
good,"As a support associate during the busy holiday season, you are employed to help all departments. Your responsibilities include, processing and expediting new merchandise to the floor, ensuring the store is neat and presentable, assisting with the signing team to make sure all merchandise is appropriately priced, while also always making sure customers needs are being met. This is a multifaceted position with many roles."
good,"Opening of registers, prepare merchandise for presentation for customers. Recovery. Greet customers, do returns, take payments and open new accounts. "
good,A typical day at Macy's was pleasant..I loved sellling and giving customers advice on items. Very friendly and fast paced environment. Being able to see different trends hit the market before most was very cool. The rewarding part of the job was carrring a sale and the customer was very happy.
good,"A interest company to work wich you can learn about the reatil business. If you work hard and have good relation with your team you can llearn the different areas from merchandising, filling in, mark down, drive sales in a given area. Also the co gives you the opportunity to develop your team and base on your daily sales you can present your strategies and action plan for the rest of the week to reach your goals. You have to be consistent and achive your goals and work in partner with your vendor to use them as a support to drive sales."
good,I learned that you cannot be friends with people at work or with managers. You do not have a secure job here. The hardest part of this job is dealing with irresponsible people who like to blame others for their mistake. This is not a teamwork environment.
good,Some managers were fantastic but there definitely was favoritism in the flock.
good,"Very team/results driven environment"
good,"My typical day at Macy's varies, as it is never the same. I have to opportunity to work with a diverse group of talented people across many platforms.  I have been challenged and stretch beyond my imagination and Macy's has afforded me a unique career opportunity."
good,a very competitive company to work for Hardest part daily goals makes each associate move competitive especially when not busy. most enjoyable the people
good,"not enough hours available. low pay."
good,"While working as a sales associate, I learned how to communicate with customers. I learned how to be direct, comfortable, and open to new ideas."
good,"It's difficult to live on the salary Macy's provides, but it was a good experience to learn so much about customer service. I value the importance to have the patience in difficult situations and to be able to come up with solutions under pressure, and how to be fair with everyone, without favoring one person over another. It was easy for me to get along with everyone, and it was fun to talk and help everyone every day. I enjoy having many things to do, and I would continue to work there if the pay and benefits had been better for the work load."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macy's was a good place to work, got a lot of invaluable experience"
good,"Learned alot about customer service, and how to keep clientelle."
good,"Sales Associate, opening credit cards, customer service, greeting, replenishing, stocking, inventory, styling, money handling and counting, closing/opening registers, meet the sales goals, and clean and neat store."
good,stand by the door greet customers show customers to departments located in the store report suspicious behavior
good,"Very routine, the job consisted of answering inbound calls and assisting customers with their purchases of bedding and mattresses. I learned how to be a mattress expert. There is more to buying a bed than just the look or the price. The management team had more turn over than the actual team itself. The management that we had definitely over abused their power at times and were not as helpful due to lack of knowledge of the products. The hardest part of the job was making our quota and staying up with the other scoring because we were not receiving any calls. Most days we had 1-2 calls on an 8 hour shift. The most enjoyable part about the job were my team mates. We struggled together and we helped each other."
good,Had fun working with some employees others were too self centered
good,"My daily duties involved, making and exceeding in daily sales goals by selling cosmetics. vast product knowledge in cosmetics, must know selling points to each product, must encourage sale and must try to upsell, this also includes the selling of macy's credit cards( had daily goals in credit as well), Put cosmetics on customers from foundation to eye shadow and everything in between."
good,"Saw over 50 customers per day, macy's never worked around my school schedule"
good,"Loved this job, but does not pay enough and there is no room for advancement"
good,There will be many good and bad days seeing that it based off of customers and location. Great meeting new people and learning new ideas on products and customer service.
good,it's not a career choice if that is what you were looking into. It's a job to have if you are looking to transfer to a better more career oriented path.
good,Sad to say that I was making the same amount of money at Macy's as I did at Famous Barr 20 years ago
good,This place is one big headache. Management team forget it......its not worth all the work you do just to get paid min wage.
good,"Worked at Macys for 2 years. I loved what I did as far as being a beauty advisor, however at that particular location the management is horrible."
good,"Too many chiefs and not enough Native-Americans. Lack of staff, lack of staff-training, lack of staff intelligence, lack of decorum of staff."
good,Job seemed cool at first but became a strange environment to work in.
good,"Lame work"
good,Terrible experience. Received a work related injury and had to be off for a few days. They took me off the schedule with no explanation or concern.
good,"I used to sell shoes, it was a hard job, is really busy sometimes and the department was usually understaffed. Manager was always on vacation and paid no attention to our department. The pay is not that great is mostly commission, so if u didn't meet the goals they would pay you but the next check they'll take it out. The best part was the flexibility in hours, and the awesome deals."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Very Low Pay"
good,"Morning rally (update employees on goals for the day and inspire with contest incentivies)*walk the floor and ensure all employees are present and go over break and lunch schedules*continue to walk the floor carrying walkie and phone (if manager of the store; 4 hours at a time)*resolve employees sales issues, cash pick-ups, customer issues and manager override issues)*daily turn over update for manager changeover."
good,"My review is based on Ethics values and management. It was great to interact with customers, hair, makeup, skincare, etc. Was not tolerable working with co-workers that were interested in communication or team work. Also the business hours and home life where difficult to balance."
good,Meeting new people was the best part of the day and helping them find the right product for themselves or as a gift. I learned product information which helped me with sales. Managers I encounters were pleasant and helpful.
good,I worked as a recovery associate on a flex schedule. I didnt really like it but I needed holiday money. I would never consider this place for a career or long term employment.
good,"My biggest problem was the pay and Management. Overall a great experience, the customer were great. The hardest about my job specially was the fact of just stand still for so long not able to interact with customer or co-workers the way you wanted"
good,This was my first job. It was a great way to meet new people and begin my career in the sales field.
good,I had great employees. The management and trying to move up and forward was ridiculous. Trying to work you way up in this company doesn't happen often. They would rather hire off the street before they look into inside hiring for a position.
good,"regular working environment,nothing especial.Helping customer is the  most essential and the fun part of the jobs."
good,a typical day at work is me getting hassled atleast 4 times a day from different managers but when you need the most they are no where to be found. this is also the hardest part of the job. most of my co workers were cool it was all about team work with us. what I learned there is that you always have to cover yourself.
good,"It's a good place to work at if you're a student or looking for extra income. Good energy for young people, co workers get along they are there if you need help. You either open registers or close them, work alone or with a partner/group. Ring up customers, answer phone calls, check dressing rooms are clean, put back shoes in the racks, clean your area, open macy's accounts and open or close the registers."
good,very fast and unpredictable work environment.  The best part was that my co-workers made the experience well worth it
good,"learned a lot about retail/business/people, management is good if they have good repore with you. "
good,"A typical day at work would be there will always be someone who tries to steal from the store. I've learned how to keep a mild calm  spirit. Management i had some favorite managers that would look out for their employees. Ive gained close relationships with majority of my co workers. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with unhappy, difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of job would be seeing the smiles on my customer faces."
good,"During the holidays the store is very busy. My job is to provide outstanding customer service to the customers, provide product knowledge and to insure safety and cleanlyness within the store."
good,"Macys is a good place to work. It has benefits if you love to shop, nice clean work area."
good,"It is extremely stressful, there is hardly ANY room for advancement, the pay is ok but if you need a manager, FORGET IT. They never seem to be around when you need them but the moment the store is dead and there's nothing to do they magically appear again! Honestly, it's horrible. My first day on the floor was Black Friday, first thing in the morning. I wasn't even given an exact spot to be in and wasn't told till the end of my shift that I had been in the wrong spot all day."
good,A typical day at work would be monitoring CCTV and apprehending shoplifters. Hardest part of the job can be making the arrest of a shoplifter. Most enjoyable part of the job is the team atmosphere in which you are associated with.
good,Really good job. Has its good and bad  days. Be very careful with which shoe to wear.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Fun workplace. Needs better chance for advancement. The message and culture at the company are not consistent.
good,"I did not like this job, It was filled with workers that gossiped and thought they were better then others and the pay was terrible. Minimum wage, STOP IT"
good,"Challenging, meeting new people each day."
good,visual department is very fun but doesn't pay well. worked at 7am and had lots of fun dressing mannequins how i wanted. Didn't have to follow a book but had some guidelines.
good,"All days are about the customer. .Ensuring great customer service. I have learned to be more patient and to fully listen to what the customer want' s .I have a few really good managers and my co-worker are the best.. My hardest part of the job is recovery and not having mang, back me up and what I enjoy and love most is being able to help a customer putting that smile on her face.."
good,"A typical day at work would be to make sure the sale is set, make sure all the inventory is out, make sure the floor is presentable for the customers and greet every customer that passes by your department. I learned how to approach people without being nervous, also how to keep up a conversation with a total stranger. Management in my department always kept changing which became frustrating, because you didn't know who was in charge. The co-workers where really nice and understood how to do their job. Probably the hardest part of the job to some people was working on weekend, because it will be really hectic and sometimes understaffed. Then instead of helping five customers your likely helping around ten or fifteen and bringing out about twenty boxes of shoes at a time. Which was never a problem to me because all that means is more money, since we worked on commission. Like I said before favorite part of working for this company was being able to meet new people everyday."
good,"Macys was a great experience with the exception being you didn't have a set schedule so if you had to do things as far as appointments and such it could be an arduous task. A typical day was Floor recovery, Engaging with customer, Offering advice on merchandise, Cashier, Opening/Closing. My coworkers for the most part were great and generally supportive. The hardest part was dealing with a lot the politics of the company for instance workers who were there previously and looked at the younger associates with disdain due to their seniority. The fun part about the job was interacting with so many different people."
good,"Working at Macy's is exactly what you would expect working for a major retailer. Macy's does not provide sales and support associates enough compensation for it to be a long-term full-time job, but it is a fun place to be for someone looking for extra money for part-time work or a discount during holiday season, students, retirees etc. You can work as little as 40 hours per quarter. There are always contests going on in the store for associates that pay out ""Macy's Money"" (which are basically in-store coupons), so if you enjoy shopping at Macy's it is a good place to be. The hours range from 7am-midnight on major sale days, and around 25 dates a year are required (""black out"") work days, working Thanksgiving and/or Black Friday are absolutely required and are a mandatory 10 hour shift. Helping people shop and learning about new products is fun. My favorite part of the job was my co-workers. The hardest part is dealing with customers that act inappropriately."
good,"A typical day for me consisted of pulling reports, contacting my clients, assisting new couples with their bridal registries and assisting their guests with purchases made from their registries. It also involved sales and special events."
good,Learned to communicate with customers properly. Learned to handle money.
good,The job was easy; they taught me how to sell a credit card. The hours were decent and management was quick to answer when they were needed. Co-workers were friendly.
good,"review communications, monitor cctv, meet with day shift, . Shoplifters and dishonest employees are constantly finding new ways to steal. You never as good as the team is. Waiting for action is the hardest task. Catching a shoplifter/DE is the most rewarding."
good,"Good company to work for, coworkers are very friend.  Downfall is your paycheck goes back to them especially if you love to shop"
good,"In Macy's it was great working & learning environment. I've learned so much about almost every item/product in basically every department they have. I didn't like the management overall. There were one or two managers who were good at their jobs but the other managers & store manager were not so good. They weren't professional, they weren't organized, it was a headache to work in that place but I would say my co-workers & working there alone was a great opportunity & I really liked working in Macy's.The hardest part of this job was just dealing with the whole management & how they ran things in the store & with the employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work together with my co-workers & learning about items/products."
good,"I've been in retail for more than 10 years now and Macy's taught me how to become very patient when it comes to dealing with customers, co-workers and basically dealing with all kinds of people. I only work part-time and in our department we only have 1 full-time employee and 4 of us are working part-time. The saddest part about it is that, only 1 part-time employee receives a lot of hours and whatever is the remaining hours, will be shared by me and the other part-timer. Favoritism is very shown that leads to complicated situations among staff. I am thankful that the head of our department is aware of it and I am hoping that this kind of management already STOP at Macy's."
good,"Keep busy ASAP, stay in-tuned with changing work plans, scheduling and rules that apply."
good,Sales managers have very little control over the some important factors that they are held accountable for. 
good,"Great college job to learn management skills! Great co-workers and working environment. In shoes, I was a commissioned employee. I would probably not go back to this area since it is a draw vs.commission pay scale and did not earn a lot this way. "
good,Good work experience and learning opportunities.  Other employees are very nice and pleasant to be around.  My supervisor helps me to develop my skills more and allows me to take control in areas I am stong in. 
good,Working hard for little to no pay.You have to do way more for this job than what they were paying.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The most enjoyable part of my job would be building client relationships and working with a team to achieve a common goal. A typical work day consist of product sales and client consultations i've learned how to multi-task under pressure and manage my clientele.
good,"Had a great time at this employer! I loved meeting new people, I learned how to get and maintain a clients. "
good,A typical day at work involves working directly with customers to satisy his/her needs in terms of sales.  It is very competitive with the focus being on commission.  The hardest part of the job is around the holidays when patience and stamina are needed the most.  
good,I worked as an on-call associate so my experiences were limited. My co-workers were all excellent and supportive and management was decent. The hardest part of the job was the lack of a regular work schedule. The most enjoyable part was making customers smile.
good,"I worked for Macy's for 4 years and it was great while I was in my teenage years with minimal responsibility. But once I start to try and gain a life it was hard to balance work and my personal life... essentially I had NO personal because of the crazy hours I had to work."
good,"Like any career you decide it all depends on what you make of it. Macy's can be an amazing opportunity for someone who is truly passionate about retail and is willing to put in the hours. One of the exciting things about my job is the associates who work for me.  As a manager I am only as good as the people who I have hired, trained and coached with in my departments.  One of the hardest parts of the job is to find ways to keep your team motivated and inspired to reach their goals.  If you are able to standout and make a impression with your VPSM as well as your DVP you can write your own ticket to do anything with in the company.  You tend to get promoted faster in smaller markets."
good,"Depending on which store you work at, Macy's can be a great experience or a tiresome one. I worked at a flagship store, and my typical day consisted of a quick chat with my manager, recovering the sales floor, assisting customers and ringing up sales, and closing down registers. My manager was excellent; definitely a one of a kind man. He was very aggressive but was tactful and made you feel as if you were a part of something great every time he spoke with you. Some of the co-workers in one department were a little cut-throat: stealing each others sales, standing guard at the registers on sales days instead of assisting customers on the sales floor. While these departments were not commission, it did affect your employee scorecard if you weren't achieve your daily sales goals. Other departments in the store were not as competitive and the co-workers worked together as a team. The hardest part was to achieve the required credit account applications, as the metric for account openings was not based on penetration, but based on hours worked. The metric was one new account application per week for part time, and two for full time. If you rang up 10 customers who all used their Macy's account, you were still expected to come up with a new account application somehow. What I enjoyed most about working at Macy's was the fact that as a sales associate I got to do just that: focus on the customers. I didn't have to put up signs, stock merchandise, or really multitask. All I had to do was spend time with a customer and help them select the best product for their needs. I really enjoyed"
good,A typical day at Macy's is very fast pace for what I have to do in 3 hours. Learning the department floor weekly because we get new clothing shipped in two days before the weekend starts. I respect the management at Macy's but their management turn over is very high. I am happy to work with my co-workers in our department. The hardest part my job is when I can not satify customers with the product what we don't have in-stock. The most enjoyable part of my job is when customers ask me how I can fix an outfit for their special day/night out. And to see customers leave happy with what they purchase
good,A typical day at Macy's is very fast pace for what I have to do in 3 hours. Learning the department floor weekly because we get new clothing shipped in two days before the weekend starts. I respect the management at Macy's but their management turn over is very high. I am happy to work with my co-workers in our department. The hardest part my job is when I can not satify customers with the product what we don't have in-stock. The most enjoyable part of my job is when customers ask me how I can fix an outfit for their special day/night out. And to see customers leave happy with what they purchase.
good,"Working in the impulse department, I learned about premium denim and designers available only at Macys. Greeting customers and informing them of various sales and assisting them with specific requests was part of the typical work day. Sorting and maintaining the department organized was also part of the job description.  "
good,"Could not tell much since it was just for the season. At first it was difficult not knowing where certain departments were since I was knew and Macy's is a very big three story department store. However working in men's department toward the end of my time there was better. Simple job, minimal wage like the other retail jobs. "
good,Descent... just ok.. pay needs to improve. a great about this job is the professional dress code. it sure does look like you have money when have on a macys dress code uniform.
good,The Store that I work at presently could use some repairs. The employees work hard.
good,"On a typical day at Macy's I checked in trucks and watched cameras. What I learned wasn't much. I was just there to check in trucks. The management was always around. My co workers were constantly trying to get people fired or force them to quit. The hardest part of my job was just being there, and the best part of my job was leaving."
good,"work and life, there is no balance there...you use to be able to make your own hours, which was cool, once they start putting you on the schedule, then you have to hope there are more hours available to grab so you can have over 30hrs.....there are days they expect soooo many things to be done and it is impossible to do it all in a day!!"
good,"When I first applied here I thought it wouldve been a fun & great place to work . I was wrong, the associates were disrespectful. very unorganized"
good,Fun environment that requires a thick skin and the ability to handle difficult situations with grace
good,Good on balancing work and school. I've learned to how to deal with customers and my co workers.
good,"Every day we got lists of customer orders and had to put them together. While the workers were efficient, the management was unorganized and not clear in direction. Hardest part of the job would have had to be loading very heavy boxes without help. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing my responsibilities and getting my job done"
good,"At Macy's I was a Selling Supervisor responsible for the Juniors Department. My typical day included scheduling of the selling floor, coaching my employees to selling behaviors and providing them with corrective feedback, assist with hiring for department and store needs, and provide assistance throughout the store. Working as a Selling Supervisor I learned how to manage multiple deadlines, strengthen my skills as a manager,and provide coaching conversations. The management team at Macy's always provided help to me and other managers when needed. We definitely focused a lot on teamwork. The most enjoyable part of the job was being responsible for a team and showing how successful my team could be."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"enjoyed working at macys work there as a seasonal , they did offer me a job but not what I could work"
good,"It was strenuous. Three days straight working 12+ hours each day, getting hammered with work. Always on our feet, having to move quickly and keep our production up yet there were so many untrained seasonal people asking questions. I enjoyed it while I was there. Good pay, great job atmosphere, just 12 hour shifts aren't for everyone."
good,I worked in the State Street Macy's Store location. The people were very nice and I learned a lot.
good,Macy's is an average place to work. It really depends on who you work with. The Executive Development Program does not provide many responsibilities. It is mostly about working under your mentor and waiting to become a full-time sales manager.
good,"Open the register, help customers with purchases, help customers find products they want, order what we didn't have, open credits with customers. Learned to be patience with people and management"
good,Working at macys was a step in a a progressive direction. i learned to deal with a variety of cultures. management was helpful. co-workers made each work day filled with a different experience. The most enjoyable part was having a job.
good,Helping people is what I love to do. Working with other to set a goal is important to me.
good,Macy's is a good store to shop. Being working in a big company like Macy's is very challenging specially in Florida because the tourist came from all around the world.
good,Working at Macy's as a Sales Associate is very much interesting from my colleagues to the customers I interact with on a day to day basis. During my time here I have definitely strengthened my interpersonal skills and gained more insight on how people tend to operate outside of the institutions that I was accustomed to.
good,"My position at macys was in the stock rooms as a merchandiser, my job was to scan items, pricing and replenishmnet as well as placing the products on the sales floor in a appealing way."
good,its was an ok place to work. discounts were great but overall not the best job in the world
good,One of the best things was that I had a lot of control in my area. One of the worst things was that I didn't get paid for it. Dealing with friendly and not to friendly customers is a good thing but good luck on balancing your work and personal life
good,i really didnt mind working this company i had a great time and if they were to take me back i would go back and work for them in a heart beat i enjoyed working with the people i had worked with when i was there at that time the money was great and so where the people that i work for at that time
good,"I would only recomend this job seasonal. The hours fluctuate way to much, and most of the managment are stuck up. There are not alot of opertunities to go up in the world here"
good,Come in unload the delivery truck soon as i get that done im off to stock the floor.I learned how to deal with all kinds of people and how to work in a very fast pace environment.I liked my managers they always had motivation meetings in the morning to get us going.co-workers were great we all had respect for eachother and cared about one another. The hardest thing was the comute on the weekends.The most enjoyable was my co-workers i loved those guys
good,"It used to be fun to work there, then it became all about numbers, and not about people. People who cause problems are praised while the good workers are scrutinized."
good,"A job that definitely keeps your mind occupied ... I learned how to work a cash register from customer payments to opening and closing a register ... It is a physical job which can be demanding but keeps the mind pretty sharp ... The most enjoyable part of this job is the people that I work next too and the customers that I had helped, management can be very helpful when you have and show you have a good work ethic."
good,I was a retail salesperson. I worked in women's clothes. I worked nights and closed out all registars in my department.
good,"Customer Service on daily basis, sales / counter events, call customers (sales, pre-sell ), data entry customer records, marketing and advertise new products in store and outside."
good,"Starting my day at Macys I would clock in and put my things in my locker. My duties included cashier and putting items back on the shelf and racks. My co-workers were fun to work with, they always kept it interesting. I dont think there was anything that was hard about this job."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Fast paced environment
good,processing sales and co workers were nice and friendly
good,"I've worked here for almost 2 years and I am finally quitting. The schedule became after the system change ridiculous. I'm a full time student and have a social life. After working almost every weekend and every night shift throughout the week, I'm done. If you need more than 3 days off a month- too bad! Even if you only work 6 to 9 on some nights- you have to put in for a full day off. It's the most demanding and least rewarding job I have ever held. Coworkers are hit and miss. There are several people I adore working with and some that are just in it for themselves. The evaluation for employees is based on how well you can stand behind a register and ring up transactions. It's a joke. The Christmas hours are even worse. In a rural area, staying open until midnight two or three weeks before Christmas is pointless. The store is losing money for paying for the light bill for those extended hours. I received one 45 cent raise in my time being here. I do not get paid enough for the all the other jobs I had to do because other people did not do them."
good,Was a good temporary job. Customers were a little out of line at times. Managers were not too direct with tasks given to employees.
good,In an effort for the company to be more productive they have made several personal cuts that impacted me on my job. I felt like I wore too many hats to feel like I was doing a good job in any one category.
good,"Not that Macy's is not a good company to work for but I personally think it was very uncomfortable how much they don't want you to be yourself, when you try to make people act nothing like themselves it comes off very forced to customers and vendors. I was hired to do customer service department and they threw me in the cash office as well and only paid me what a customer service Rep. would get instead of giving me the compensation I was really deserved. I was also shorted on a pay check and was told it would be awhile until they could get it to me. The hours were very long and the work was very unstimulating. Over all I did not have a good experience working for them."
good,opening up register
good,Its a fun place to work if your use to retail and the discount is great.
good,Full time employee. I am Levis Specicalist i handle the levis part of the men store for Macys. Management are okay there when u need them.
good,a typical day at work would have me opening up cash register and putting clothes away before I went home.
good,"Management is nice, but they do stress opening a credit app too often. I learned a great deal of product knowledge due to my flexibilty as an associate and met many interesting customers. The hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable are both your co-workers: at times the competition gets to people, but otherwise they are great."
good,a day at work is bascilly assitant the customers as they walk into the department and greeting them and makin sure they fine everything they are look for and ringing them up in a timely matter with a smile. my co workers wwe try to work as a team to assist the customers in what they are looking for and the meangement is there to guide us in the right way so we can help the cumerters the most enjoyble day about my job is seeing the customers leaves with a smile knowing that i did my job correct.
good,i felt unappreciated at times and felt like i was over worked but had no real hours given
good,"Fun place to work.I like meeting new people,but the hours are not enough. You can't live off of 15 hours a week."
good,i learned customer skills & satisfaction.i also learned to work the register and be responsible around large amount of money
good,"A typical day at work would consist of opening an closing cash registers ,customer service allday,folding and straigtening clothes also making a required daily goal. What i've learned from the job is how to work as a team and that i do well in a fasted paced invironment.I like to stay busy, I worked with great people my coworkers were very friendly an helpful i think that was the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job was puttin back clothes an jewelry, etc that the customers left in the fitting rooms or just thrown around. Management was ok but really the associates had to resolve complaints an deal with the customers to the best of our ability."
good,Start the day checking all messages and emails. Go to the morning meeting to set the plan for the day. Meet with your team to coach them on goals and expectations of the day. the management team must be very at ease with muti-tasking. The co-workers must be ready to take on new projects quickly. The hardest part of the job is it is fast paced so you must be very detailed and organized. Working in such a busy store the day goes quickly.
good,"I scan clothing to make sure the signs are right. If they are not right I fix them. We have two or three sales a week. My co-workers are great, they work hard and we all help each other. Management is good. This job is easy and I love doing it. But I need more hours."
good,"Macy's typical day of work depending on your position could be very fun and fast paced, or very slow. My co-workers some were friendly. I learned what hard work feels like."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"As a Visual merchandiser at Macy's I did creative merchandise presentations, seasonal fashion trend statements, three-dimensional visual presentations, promotional events, and also created corporate shop concepts and shop setups."
good,non stop wprk grat customers and emplyees great mangment and good work ethic
good,I enjoy working with customers and helping them find what they are looking for. Most managment personnel is very easy to get along with. My co-workers for the most part are nice and friendly. The hardest part of the job is the long hours and the demands to maintain a certain level of sales. The most rewarding part of the job is when you find that perfact something the customer was looking for and they walk away happy. I liked working for Macy's until all the scheduling changes. Now I spend more time at Macy's than I do my family.
good,no human element taken into cosideration regarding job security. Although I was ranked one of the highest in sales goals and all score card requirements. There was no consideration to my efforts and desire to be at work on time
good,Never a dull moment. Constantly on your feet moving around cleaning up after customers.
good,"I worked in the shoe department, so on a daily basis, we were in charge of cleaning and fixing our assigned stations on the sales floor, as well as organizing our stock room and adding new inventory. The management and co-workers were around the same age group, so we were all able to get along with each other. It was a fun environment."
good,"Communication is the most valuable tool in any situation. Communication makes it possible for us to be successful in business & all of life's moments. Whether we're training new team members or coaching seasoned ones, discussing product placement or negotiating for new jobs, greater budgets or higher price pointed merchandise. We must be able to communicate effectively & efficiently to create an enjoyable & prosperous environment."
good,"I feel like Macy's doesn't live up to their name. The managers are good people. But they have ""small man syndrome"" which is they think they are so influential in the world but they are just a manager at macys. macys doesn't pay to well either. If customers return to many items that you sold to them you will get a pay cut even though you did your job by selling the merchandise. Macys is a big name but they could be a great company if only they cared more about their employees instead of only corporates personal gain."
good,learned lots from that company i learned how to fix shipping labels and ship out packages
good,a typical day at work is very slow nnot a lot of traffic unless its a weekend one day sale or holiday. I learned how to deal wit aggrivated customers. Management is ok depending on the manager you get. The co-workers are nice i keep my relationship with them professional.The enjoyable part is the interraction with people
good,"Retail. Not much chance for advancement, just a fun place to work. Management has a great attitude and work ethic and passes that on to the crew."
good,High Sales Goals for a very slow store.
good,in the morning a inventory is done to know how many shoe's are on the selling floor.then a shipment of shoe's are placed infront of the stockroom to unpack.after we find new items we make tickets for the items to make a floor model.we also make sure all make down shoe's are out on the seeling floor.
good,This company considers the employees as disposable income. They look at you as a number not an employee.
good,"Macys is an fast pace work place when work is prepared. working at macys warehouse was a good experience and kept you busy most times patrolling orders, checking upc numbers, packing orders and picking orders. All items handle with went straight to online customers of macys."
good,"While a position at Macy's wasn't my main focus in careers, i had the privilege to gain a little experience a field besides sports and the people that work along side of you were great co-workers."
good,Fair place to work as a part time job I has no benefits
good,"It was fine until the new policy kicked in, now it's about the company making money, not about the employees"
good,I feel that I give 110 to The company and the customers.   I am very pleasant with customers and associates.  I will help as much as possible to the associates and customers.  I do non congurant transfers and troubleshooting with customers
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Great place to work, They care about their employee a lot, very friendly ambiance. Great perks. Physically tiring sometimes. Pay could be a little higher for the amount of work"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was working the big ticket which meant I got to load and unload furniture.  Constant movement throughout the working hours.  The hardest part of the position was management communications were poor.
good,"Working at Macy’s definitely gave me most of my retail experience. I learned lots during my time at Macy’s about customer service, as sales associates were  constantly encouraged to provide customers a positive experience."
good,Schedule flexibility in case you have another job or are in school or seeking to attend school. The associates are nice to work with and helps you get through the work day.
good,Management at Macy's is a great place to start. They do have great perks to the job but your work / life balance is difficult. I traveled a lot for the job and was never home. Difficult to get everything accomplished due to the understaffed stores. Very challenging to keep up the morale in your team.
good,"This is a good company to work for as you begin your career. There are many departments to work in and you can apply to transfer to different departments and roles. However, the call center is very compartmentalized and you will rarely work cross functionally. Instead, you will have to apply to positions in other departments. Working in the call center can become redundant and even boring. If you are customer facing, the customers can become abusive, the interactions are stressful, and lengthy shifts on the phone can become mentally exhausting. There is also low job security as Macy's has no problem eliminating positions or entire departments or teams and if you can't find a position in another department, you will be let go. The call center tries to balance these factors with fun activities and events, as well as Employee Resource Groups. However, if you have large career aspirations, you will most likely have to move on from this company once you have gained the experience they have to offer. You may have a better experience if you earn your degree first and then enter the company as part of their Executive Development Program."
good,Macys is all about satisfying the customer at all times. Making sure the customer has a great shopping experience at every visit. Keeping the customer happy with perks and sales are the priorities of Macys
good,"Coworkers and managers were friendly and supportive, but there were still quite a few who were looking for nothing but your downfall. Would be berated in front of customers even if it were a situation where you did nothing wrong, gave customers what they wanted just so that they wouldn't have to deal with trouble. Coworkers/some managers talked about you instead of to you, even in circumstances where they thought one thing when it was actually the complete opposite (aka shopping on the job when in actuality a replacement tag for an item was being searched for.) Would give you the chance to do better in work and would train you, but then never talk about it again and would stop the training without saying anything. Prioritization and communication were also a very big problem. There were also a few cases of sabotage as well as favoritism. Would tell them the restrictions I had on working (due to them being a little farther away and having to rely on bus scheduling) and they would ignore what I would tell them and give whatever hours they wanted whether I could do it or not. Website (online schedule) is not always reliable and neither is written schedule. Had a assistant manager (lead) that would take advantage of the fact that manager wasn't working for two months and would constantly leave early and would leave projects unfinished."
good,Its okay to work. Pro is flexible hours and employee discounts. Con dealing with lots of customers. Cleaning of lots of clothes and shoes. Your basic retail store.
good,"If you okay with working with the public, long hours, and no weekends off then this job is for you. I didn't enjoy any work-life balance, which really sucked."
good,I’m sure that the job would have gone more smoothly had there been a counter manager and the executive for my region visited the store to help with visual improvements and to help with sales goals. I never met the executive for my region despite having reached out to her multiple times for help. Lancôme and Macy’s were supposed to work together but it felt like only Macy’s was working with me and I was getting no help from Lancôme.
good,"Not what I expected ..."
good,The management wasn't great they treated me unfairly and blaimed me for many of the things that happened.  But overall i like to work hard and push myself to the limits to make a customer satisfied.
good,"If you need a job, go for it. It's not to bad, but it is retail. Upper management is always looking to move on up some sort of corporate ladder so they'll stop the presses if it means they have a chance to make themselves look good. Upper management would come up with some sort of project for the support team to do on the store floor, and most often than not we would only have till the end of the shift, even if we had our hands full with stocking, pricing, truck loading and unloading, all the logistical stuff that actually made the store run. Many times this caused issues when there wasn't enough man power on shift to handle all that needed to be done, and it wasn't a case of not having enough employees, it was a case of The company not wanting to give out more hours to have the other employees come in. The issues would arise when the support team would get split and there wasn't enough employees left in the back to handle priority support team responsibilities efficiently, and of of course when prompted why the trucks, or something wasn't finished, the support team was always the scapegoat. All in all, it really wasn't too bad, the co workers made some days go by in a blink. If you're ok with the pay, working in a fast paced environment, and need a job, it's not bad."
good,It is a little behind the times when it to everything. I did meet some great people there.There is very little advancement to supervisor and even less to management.
good,"You learn a lot here in the company, about the position. Management usually has goals and deadlines to meet. Management is also a little bit hard on workers to make sure they meet certain criteria, so it depends on how your availability is."
good,"I really liked working at Macy's but had a serious reaction to a new medication. I nearly passed out in the shoe dept and told associate I felt funny. Within an hour I was exhibiting signs of what could have been a stroke---could not speak, words I said were not what I meant, and I was confused, feverish, nauseous. The assistant store manager was called and instead of calling 911, let me leave on my own. I went to my car, called my friend, who could not understand most of what I was saying and called 911. The hospital did an immediate workup, admitted me and after 3 days I was discharged. I had a very serious allergic reaction to the medication and could have had brain damage if my friend hadn't called 911. I went back and spoke to the store manager, HR manager, my supervisor and a regional manager about what happened. They all agreed it was handled badly and instituted an in-service for every employee on assessing and reacting to illnesses.  They offered me my job back with a raise and a bonus., but I declined because I did not feel safe in that environment where my coworkers were apathetic. "
good,Going to work at 5 pm and stacking boxes in a trailer then having to breaks as lunch of 30 minutes and going back to work again and leaving at 3 am in the morning
good,"For the most part most associates are rude in general, never helps anyone staff or guests while on the floor opposite of “teamwork” every other manager doesn’t seem to care about their staff or want to solve any floor issues."
good,I just started but am already impressed with the over all atmosphere. The other sales associates are very friendly and welcoming. The starting pay is a little low. They hired part time so I won’t be receiving benefits.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"- Poor upper level management"
good,"Macy’s is a fun laid back day pave to work.There is a lot of diversity and inclusion.And your left alone to do your job without micromanaging.And your given days off if requested.One thing that Macy’s lacks is consistency and loyalty.As a collections agent you go through so much up and downs with getting cursed out and you don’t make enough to go through what you go through."
good,"Quality location with quality customers and management. Certain customers will try to swindle/finesse extra discounts however, but they are kind people. Management was very supportive and caring. If you are pursuing higher education they will  encourage you to maintain and excel in your studies. They also care about you as an individual. If you are performing well, they do not hesitate to acknowledge your effort and success. Morning huddles were slightly cheesy. The most laborous aspect is removing items from the fitting rooms and placing them out on the floor, definitely will get your exercise. Working in a variety of depts can be refreshing, particularly when your in the area alone. Some employees can be catty/manipulative.  Good general experience/summer job"
good,The hours and areas of work are extremely flexible. Though it can be somewhat stressful when a work goal is set before you and you struggle to meet it.
good,Other than that he's a pretty good place to work I love feeling a man chooses a great time never had a bad day I just wish I was at a better location.
good,"The position had constant turnover (which means we were VERY understaffed with reliable employees), and we were underpaid for the amount of work that was required. My shifts would start at 5 or 6am and could last until 10am or 2pm. The store management and retail associates would blame the merchandising team for anything done wrong in the store & complained to us if they didn’t like what we did in their areas. I was part time, but I’d have 30-40 hour weeks despite constantly telling my manager I needed more days off. Merchandising management was very nice, but super overwhelmed with trying to find people that were reliable. There are good people who worked there but others were just lazy. It’s a job that could very easily burn you out."
good,"Discounts were great, the company culture was great, and the peers were great! The downside was the pay is low compared to other top retailers and executives aren't as experienced. They promote based on the time at the company rather than qualifications."
good,Macy's had cliques and judged you on everything. There was no relief from the scandal last summer at the call center and people make you feel like worthless.
good,"My experience overall working at Macy's was the ability to provide complete customer satisfaction. The work place was fun and energetic on Saturdays. And i enjoyed seeing our customers happy and satisfied with the service that was provided at the events. The most exciting part was the customers awe at the store set up, prices, and merchandise. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and sharing about macy's backstage. I have got several feedbacks where the customer greatly appreciated backstage being a part of Macy's and that they would gladly return and how they enjoyed their shopping experience. It was a pleasure being a part of the Macy's Backstage Team."
good,The role has you collaborate with many different segments of the business which can be a challenge in a work day - some groups start of 6 am and others do not begin until 2pm
good,"Bust your butt day in and day out with little to no recognition whatsoever. You are expected to take on multiple tasks and have them done in a timely fashion with little to no help from upper management. Short staffed, large trucks and too much merchandise to process and have out to floor in 24hrs. The people are like family but the management moral is a joke. You are given so many tasks and when you ask for help, management is always busy. Low budget on hours during peak season and not enough staff or time to get things done in a day."
good,Every day is different and there is always something to learn. The most enjoyable part about the job is being able to help others learn and grow and the interaction with the customers. It is also a good company to work for if you want to be involved in the community.
good,"I was told once i became a CPP(Career progression program) I would be able to advance into being a lead.  Instead Macy's hired outside and I, like many others, were not even given the chance to apply."
good,"Wasn’t prepared for the type of work I had applied. I don’t recommend working here if you don’t like sweating or freezing. Had to work holidays, and weekends."
good,"At the start of my shift, I go to the Sign Shop to discuss details of the upcoming sale's event with my People Leader. Then, I grab my scanner and sign cart. Afterwards, I proceed to my designated signing area to start prepping for a sale the day before the sale's event. The next day I set the sale."
good,Huge company. Lots of areas to move to but must take your development into your own hands. Can be difficult to get promoted depending on the area that you're in.
good,"Macy's is hard because of the customers. I worked at the Beverly Center and the customers were mean and seemed to feel that they were above everyone, but were always haggling with coupons. (not all of the customers but a lot of them)"
good,"Absolutely loved it. Just know that customers are very demanding and can be very rude. Not a job for nice sweet people. Customers will get in your face. "
good,"I was only there for seasonal part time work, hours were less than 25 hrs per week & they weren’t able to give me the evening shifts that I asked for being that I had no babysitter during the day! I ended up having to resign just after only 2 months there."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I enjoyed working at Macy’s because im into clothing and shoes . . I loved the fact I worked in my own department on my own and I enjoyed using the employee discounts .
good,Was hired for part time 15/18 hours per week. First two weeks were good by 3 rd week only 12 hours. $ 60 .00 per month to use parking garage or $9.00 for 5/6 hours. Never in 3 weeks given 15 or 20 minutes break and worked 5 to 6 hours each day.
good,The environment in merchandising is the complete opposite of environment in receiving. Merchandising puts too much pressure on employees and feels like every function is micromanaged. Receiving has a good team and reasonable expectations for employees.
good,"Management was harsh and demanding of employees, work environment was stressful and tense, as well as being in a non-environmentally controlled section of the building for 10+ hours a day."
good,The job itself is easy. The training period only takes a few hours but it is paid. You will most likley stay in one department so you onlu need to familiarize yourself in that area.
good,it is an ok environment to work in but if you have a high school mentality you will succeed at state street. or a sorority on drugs. or is it always like this in retail ?
good,I enjoyed working with my direct reports very much. I enjoyed the time training and developing them and then watching as they moved to the next level. I enjoyed working closely with store management to bu8ld a culture of trust with the LP department.
good,"This job required a lot of hands on work, and the pay didn't really compensate for everything that we did. The hours were never steady, either they were longer than what was told or a lot shorter."
good,This is an ok place to work. The scheduling is flexible. Although they don’t have many hours in off peak season. They just increased pay to reflect market which is a plus.
good,"management too often takes the credit, but I suppose that may not be uncommon.  Concerns are typically addressed, but it will take a long time to do to."
good,Great Supervisor so my tasks and commitments were very easy to accomplish. Daily operation handled in a collaborative manner to ensure team communication and efficiency. I love a fast paced needing problem solving. I like when I can use my brain to solve and implement operations to help ensure daily flow.
good,"It’s a good company to work for if you work really hard and show that you care for the business. This will get you more advancement in the company. Didn’t really enjoy the scheduling for managers and didn’t like the salary pay. They will make you work 40+ hours and you won’t see overtime. If you don’t mind working through all the holidays and giving up your weekends, then you will fit right in!"
good,"Like most public retail companies, Macy's will tell you what they think you want to hear but rarely follow through.  They love to dangle the carrot to make you think you will advance if you do this or that, but there is always one more thing before you finally get promoted.  Upper management was often deceitful.  There is no such thing as job stability.  Employees from all areas were laid off every year just to make their bottom line look better.  The vacation time is generous, but you can't use it when you want.  Pay was competitive for a retail company.  The people that I worked with through the years were the best part of the job."
good,Management really didn’t take the time to train for any advancement. Was looking for a place to grow and the potential just wasn’t there. I would rather have been paid more at least than it wouldn’t have been such a waste of time.
good,It was a good place to work for the time that I was there and the environment was fast paced but relaxed enough to get the hang of process there. Training is fairly simple.
good,i was offered a position at 9.25 per hour. I was scheduled orientation for two days which equal 8 hours. After I got to orientation I found out the orientation pay was 7.25.  Of the 8 hour orientation event I spent 45 minutes on the floor with an associate. I did the training for the cash register on a computer in orientation lol. Next I was told I can go online and pick up some shifts but in my head I was like I don’t know what I’m doing or anything about the departments or how to log in. The manager said she was going to call and add me to the schedule well 2 weeks go by not a word lol. On the 3rd week after orientation on a Thursday the manager call and say can you close Friday night in Int DEPT I said what’s that lol then she said come to last act I said where that’s at lol she said just meet me in HR I said ok but after I hung up the phone I decided this is not the place for me lol
good,"I love Macy's, but the compensation is not very desirable. The job is easy as long as you put in the time and effort. You learn a lot about the retail world as a Sales Manager and must give weekly presentations to VPs."
good,I had fantastic managers and work for great people for 11 years. They gave me an opportunity to move up with the company and at one point in time gave me the opportunity to relocate to Indiana
good,"Macy's is a decent job if you're in college and looking for extra pocket change like me, but the management is trash there always short on staff on busy days, they do not pay enough people for all the extra work they make you do 9.00$ and scheduling part timers only 20 hours or less isn't gonna help pay any bills, I think 24-26 hours minimum will help."
good,"I hired on as a flex member part time, but Fine jewelry was my main"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The work for the most part was not stressful, management was the stressful part. Working with customers was the great part of the whole job..........."
good,"I enjoyed working here for the time being. The pay was great and the work was easy but sometime stressful."
good,Management was not very professional at all. I don't know how a lot of the managers got into their positions. More training for management roles are necessary.
good,"Great opportunity for success but only if you play your cards right.  Very smart company and I’m sure they will continue to be successful. However, at the core, the entire company is controlled by politics. Results and integrity won’t matter unless you can gain support from a higher up. Watch your back at all times. It’s very hard to feel comfortable in a work environment where you can’t trust the people you’re working for. The competitive nature surrounding recognition and advancement can get very nasty. Everyone is out to make a name for themselves."
good,"I was hired in as a flex associate and was not informed that there was a minimum amount of hours I had to attain in order to remain employed.  Had this position been listed as full or part time, that wouldn’t have been a problem.  But the job description stated that I was only responsible for picking up shifts that I wanted to pick up.  On top of that, they schedule you for shifts that are outside of your listed availability (and without your consent) and do not give you the option to advertise the shift or call off."
good,"While I love my job, I and most of my associates are feeling micromanaged. Most associates are seasoned employees with 5-30 years of experience and know the requirements of the position. We are treated like entry level employees who can not be trusted to use good judgment on what to do and when to do it. Pretty much need a “hall pass” to go to the bathroom."
good,See for yourself. Don't take my word for anything. They do offer company benefits. Moral can be low. Mangers aren't motivated and detached. Friendships are formed and the bond between associates are wonderful.
good,"Los horarios no son estables, y es falso que tienes oportunidad de escogerlos, ellos los programan por ti. Hay semanas full horas y otras escasamente te asignan"
good,i like macy's but the pay was minimum wage at the time.  i didn't like my position at the time and it was a seasonal position that lasted until janurary.
good,My manager at Boca Raton was cool. Always looked out for the staff. I also noticed managers in other departments did as well. Very flexible hours if your going to school.
good,"My direct supervisor, manager is very hands on and I appreciate that."
good,Pay sucks but working loss prevention was fun the staff would like to gossip a lot not a bad place to work the money isn’t there though it’s more of temporary gig
good,I really need to live there for a better pay and that was how I left there for something better in life  and manager are really trying to save money for there boss
good,"Macy's is a great experience to expand and gain knowledgeable skills. However, my passion is finance and I am seeking a career in the business industry. "
good,"Worked closely with store and executive management, learned  store operation procedures and Human Resources functions.  Trained new colleagues, and managed HRM systems (Taleo, Peoplesoft)."
good,"I worked at multiple stores. First store I worked many hours, so there was not much work/life balance. Once I was promoted to a different location, the culture was much better."
good,"working at macy's has it's up and downs, very busy store, sales goals are insane, you will work hard to make the sales goal, the most enjoyable work are the few people you work with."
good,"it is what you make of it as it is at any work place "
good,A good retail job and working environment. The staff were really nice.Good employee discounts and rewards.A great opportunity to grow within the company.Flexible work Hours.
good,"Macy’s is struggling, and it shows in the decisions made by upper management. I started at Macy’s.com, and it was a great place to work. Then the cost cutting mentality took over. Macy’s.com was merged with the corporate systems & technology division with the intention of increasing efficiency and reducing duplication of effort. It turned into looking for the lowest cost answer for any problem. Layoffs, troubled corporate system deployments, and reorganizations led to too much work for too few people."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"This job is not that bad honestly. At times it can be boring but also fast paced. Customers of course can be rude but not often from my experience. Managment was not the best but other than that, job wasn't horrible."
good,"I liked the people I worked with, and the people I worked under; the company seems in financial straits, and we could feel the pressure.  The computer system for ordering supplies based on the last years' shipping load was not very realistic or efficient."
good,"FULFILLMENT ASSOCIATE, November 2017 to Present"
good,"place has not grown and i have a drive to learn more and take more risk and learn new thing, i feel like the pace has slowed down a tad and looking for a new opportunity to grow."
good,Had a great system for scheduling hours.  Employees in Human Resources very helpful.  Everybody there tried to get to know you by name.  Would go back
good,Good job to work for if you need fast income. Hours can be slow but you can pick up hours also. A lot of talkative employees in the  work place. Maybe some favorites in some departments when it comes to hours.
good,"Slowly adapting to the ever changing cut throat world of retail. Depending on your position, it can be extremely stressful due to lack of employees and/or employees that have very little motivation to drive results. If you do succeed in your position, there are plenty of opportunities to advance in a managerial role, however these roles also come with added pressures."
good,"okay for the beginners and people who like drama. Management is the worst. pay is good, coworkers are fun. Not a long-term job, but there is a room for growth"
good,The managers micro manage. Reaching personal goals is a big part of the job but is not always as easy as managers may make it seem and sometimes they talk down on you for not doing so. Employees are disposable since the company is so big and there is little compassion for what people have going on. I enjoyed my job at first but after seeing the ins and outs of the company it began to make me sad and dread coming to work. The only good part about the job was the extremely flexible schedule however this does not apply to holiday season.You are basically their SLAVE during Christmas and Thanks Giving months.
good,"Working at Macy's has helped me to grow as a person and worker as it has given me the opportunity to interact and assist customers, giving me experience in customer service and work ethic. The job has also helped me learn to work with a variety of people from different backgrounds who do not all have the same mindset or view in life. "
good,The hardest part of the job was unloading trucks in sub-zero weather. It could take up to five to seven hours to unload and I be frozen by the end of the day.
good,"Was a ok first job. The managers were pretty cool. The pay was definitely not good at all. Had to stand all day. The worst was the Christmas music or the music in general, it was supper loud for no reason."
good,The job can be enjoyable at times however with cuts in staff and unpredictable busy periods can make job unbearable. Always being asked to come in on day off or stay later on shift.
good,"Enjoyed the people, but the pay and career advancement were lacking."
good,"This  company is very big, so the people on the front lines don’t matter very much. Employee discount is good but pay and raises could be better. Management has their own agenda"
good,"The typical day called for opening registers, putting away merchandise onto the sales floor and then ringing up customers. When not busy, I would help customers on the sales floor.  The hardest part of the job was not getting a break, because it was so busy and there was no one to relive us for a long time. The best part was dealing with appreciative customers and the discounts we got on the merchandise."
good,"Managers of many years are into routines that make them blind to deteriorating conditions in the departments. One's initiatives to improve department's sales is encouraged and rewarded. As a regional manager I improved merchandising and display techniques, hired and trained sales people and increased sales in most of the eleven departments under my supervision."
good,"Greeting customers, responding to questions, improving engagement with merchandise and providing outstanding customer service. Operating cash registers, managing financial transactions, and balancing drawers. Achieving established goals."
good,"In the role I hold at macys, I believe that there are to many tiers of management without enough communication between each. The expectation is to have a point of view and to be employed for a specialty but this expectation is constantly undermined by the subjective directive of middle and upper management. The compensation for the visual team is not competitive with other department stores. The size of our team continues to shrink with the same execution expectation. The turn over is high with little to no training except for the shadowing of the entry level trimmers. There is an expectation to  be upward mobile although the management has been in place in the same capacity for years.Feed back for problems is always met with ""band-aid solutions"" and tend to go back to the same way that was wrong in the first place."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Very fast pace makes the day go by fast. Employees got along for the most part. Managers are ok most of the time. Environment is ok but its every person for themselves.
good,"Managers of different departments were knowledgeable and helpful. I was able to pick up shifts in different departments, so I learned a lot. Only left so I could work closer to home."
good,"the salary is terrible"
good,"Macy's is all about the numbers.  Staff is all about relationships."
good,"Need to pay the colleagues better"
good,"Working @ Macys' was not all bad, it was like family, love doing the Macy's thanksgiving parade,  love working with my coworkers we were a good team when we're all there, some management were really good to work with some not so much."
good,Never a dull moment.  Always had work to do.  The management understood the daily processes and were available when needed.  Not very many opportunities for advancement.
good,Macy's first large layoff of 2500 people in 2014 included 10 full timers at the MLO. I was the one supervisor that was laid off because I had the least tenure. Upper management did not assist me in my endeavors to be promoted within the company after my one year of eligibility.
good,"Management team won't help you to advance within the company, and room for advancement is very limited and it goes to favorite employees, although unqualified but managers are biased."
good,"It's a very corporate structure, and not easy to develop or be promoted. The culture is different around the company. The places where I've been placed had a bad environment. People really only cared about how they looked and weren't truly interested in making Macy's a more successful company."
good,"At the beginning working here was OK, a typical day was greeting customers, inviting them to the bay I worked in and having them try my product, explain the benefits, tell them how becoming a client is beneficial, then ringing up the sale, and following up with them,in a few weeks when its convenient for them, if they wanted something else from another dept, walk them to it and introduce the associate there who could help, I would return to my area where if I didn't have a customer or client, I had other responsibilities to take care of. It was very peaceful back then, only had to worry about my area, if someone needed help, close by to where my counter was, find some one who could help them, or I would do so my self. I learned a lot about skincare products and fragrances then cosmetics, how to sell them and apply them to the customer or client. The Management has been intermittent over the years, I worked with the best and the worst ever. The workplace culture was the best part, you meet associates from different countries, and religions.It is a Multicultural Place, this and the flexibility of the schedule(even though you work holidays,very normal in retail) was what stood out the most as a Company.  The hardest part of this job for me was dealing with the pressure of sales being that now Online Sales, and the most recent program of Buy Online and pick up in store is another option customers have to shop and this does not give the associate any credit or commission, along with a few years ago they added to work the evening and night of Thanksgiving Day, a Holiday that no one"
good,"A tipical day ay work at macys is all about helping costumers in need of help and ckecking clothing racks,  making sure eveythung is in line and looks neat for the next day."
good,It was an alright job. I mostly had to keep up with the many trucks coming in. Though recently they literally put me as the weekend guy even after the manger saying I wouldn't be doing it all the time.
good,"When I first started, was a job. A paycheck.  made a career of it for over 20+ years but when I left, the atmosphere had changed as there were several layoffs, high turnover, and lots of discord."
good,I was with the company for 6 years. During that time I did not receive the opportunity for advancement.  I was recognized for being a top performer several times. The store manager catered to a specific few and their needs were met and they also advanced.
good,"Macy's Herald Square is a large company with many opportunities.It can become busy during holiday season which is expected. One of the perks as an employee is making a few extra dollars from opening credit accounts. In addition, working in this area is great."
good,"Hours are exactly what you sign up for-you can always give away or pick up shifts. Depending on your section, sales can be commission based however sales are stolen,"
good,"I love working for Macy's at the South Park location, the staff and management were very professional. But: I believe no one told them about the increase in minimum wage."
good,"Never a dull moment at Macy's. With the constant sales, and incoming merchandise things always flowed. The mark downs, getting rid of old mechandise, and getting the products prepared to ship in between stores made working for macy's active. I found it exciting because i never knew what my work day would entail. I enjoyed working at Macys for that reason. It was productive and busy, my days went by quickly"
good,"Customer service oriented professional interested in applying within an environment that consist of analytical and client management skills within a banking facility. Provided exceptionally levels of customer service and process accurate and time efficient transactions for customers. Have the ability to manage multiple tasks, while interacting with people from diverse professional and cultural background in courteous manner."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"low paying, but if you need a job it’s fine until you find something better. Part time, has no benefits and not many hours but you can pick up shifts."
good,I only worked here for a few months before getting hired on somewhere else. The manager could not manage and it was irritating. You only got hours if someone called off.
good,"i really enjoy my coworkers and working the early mornings were nice and easy. i was able to get my work done with no distractions. my manager is really great and very understanding,and is always there for support when you need it. i only wish the hours were a bit better."
good,"The company offers many perks but the pay is not all that great nor are the hours. You are able to pick up hours if need be, but those hours might be in a different area or department of the store."
good,I learned a lot of things while working at Macy's but that was thanks to my dock manager due to not being trained and just thrown in there like I knew what i was doing.
good,"Productive, good place to work.  A lot of hard work, standing and walking. good co workers, very relaxed atmosphere. A lot of Positive people. Good time shifts."
good,Doesnt seem to be a solid store anymore from what i see and store closing. Same old 1980s cash register and culture seems old and boring. Too much work for less money
good,"The management is very inconsistent with their scheduling. Sometimes you work 3 days a week, sometimes you don't get scheduled for like 2 weeks. Some days they are understaffed and you are swamped with work and some days they have so many people on that work is slow.  When you do work, the breaks are short and you must stay on your feet for 10 hours."
good,Macy's is a world renown company. Working under commission is difficult but if you have school or a life outside of work this company can give that to you.
good,Un organized management. Poor communication between departments. Decent pay for pretty easy work. Will hire anyone causing in poor employee relationships.
good,"So my over all experience was OK. I enjoyed working with my co workers and the work itself wasn't too demanding. Good place to earn some cash while I attended school. One or two managers were good, but in my experience, some will throw you under the bus when something goes wrong and aren't afraid to deflect blame from themselves to the associates so that they continue to look good. You get the feeling that they don't got your back."
good,Days go very slow. not much room for advancement and pay doesnt change much even if you advance or stick around. Breaks are nice and sometimes you get free lunches
good,"Can be some of the best people and the worst people you may ever work with. A lot of culture changes in the company. Mostly for the better, but your experience is directly related to whether your management follows the old culture or the new. Work life balance is definitely a challenge. Vacation package does not compare if you can find the time to use it."
good,"This is an OK job to have, say for a high school student, or a part time college student w/ a set schedule. I dont feel like any postion pays enough for the amount of hard work and effort its workers put in to meet their daily goals. This job did however teach me patience because Lord knows, between the employees and the customers................................."
good,"I had an overall great experience during the time I was there but during the last year things started going downhill after changes to store management, corporate policies, staffing level changes, employee website overhaul, and hiring about half the store positions over the phone instead of in person."
good,"Open registers and make sure floor is ready for customers. Flexible schedule which is great.  The hardest part is getting credits.  The most enjoyable part is the customers, especially when you get the repeat customers who knows you and how you can make their shopping experience enjoyable."
good,"Very fast paced place to work.  There are certain goals that they want a person to maintain and some of those goals are unrealistic.  During peak seasons you can make your goals, but in the off season it is very hard and then they cut your hours."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The place is very competitive. You have to sell so much to make commission which was very hard. The holidays were very busy and i was global so i just wondered the whole store to help customers.
good,"I enjoyed some aspects of my experience at Macy's.  My last half a year with the company was not pleasant.  The human resource dept."
good,"The managers suck big time. They dont care about the employees only about sales goals, they fired me for no reason. They scheduled while I was on vacstion made it look like I abndon ,y job. Never work at westshore location. Managers suck big time. Everyone was getting fired. Everyone went to work for dillards"
good,"I find the culture very stressful with too much pressure to get to metrics. The hours are excessively long. Longer that other retailers in the mall. I must say, I have a great manager so that helps!"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the people interaction. You  needed to out on the floor having a positive attitude not only for your workers but for the people that enter the store. You were the motivating force for your team to make sure they interacted with each customer and made their experience unforgettable. You were there coach, mentor and friend."
good,I felt too pushed to try to sell things to customers that they did not want. There was practically no chance of getting a raise and the raises were minimal.
good,"Its a good first job, they dont pay enough for the amount of work employees do. And its definitely not enough to live off of. Also, there isn't much opportunity to move up."
good,"I found my coworkers mostly very helpful and I was lucky enough to be positioned into advvancement. There's a lot of competition in the sales floor and job security which makes it hard to get along with some coworkers. The hardest part was meeting sales goals because it gets harder every year. The most enjoyable part was working with makeup which I love to do, interacting with customers and making friendships with my coworkers."
good,"Overall, the staff was great to work with. Their organization skills were not the best. Management could have been better. The atmosphere was great though. The only negative was being on your feet all day."
good,"Had to make sure the racks were fixed properly, help customers with any questions and concerns they had and had to keep our folding sections as neat as possible."
good,Work days were very busy and long.  I learned how to use the registers and the different products.  I was able to go to special trainings for new products.  The hardest part was busy workdays with numerous customers but not enough staffing.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with the choices of items available to them for their outfits.
good,"Typical day depends on your job function.  A lot of various work descriptions going on throughout the company.  I worked for many years both in store and behind the scenes.  A challenge to ensure that all are on the same page.  Yearly restructuring is nerve racking, never knowing if your department is up for a change."
good,"I love my coworkers, they always make going to work fun and enjoyable. A typical day at work is watching registers, recovery if the store, markdowns or putting merchandise away that we get in from the truck. Once it gets very busy is stressful and when it slows down it’s relaxing."
good,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers in the Women's Ready-to-Wear"
good,You have to learn quickly because there are tons of customers to cater to especial from out of town. Work can be fun at times. Alot of sales and hands on labor is required. Lively atmosphere.
good,"I only worked there for less than a year due to the fact that the store was closing. My time was brief and sometimes frustrating because I was hoping to get more hours, but didn't. My immediate boss was decent to work with."
good,"Store management was excellent and worked very hard to make it a decent place to work, however their hands are often tied by corporate. Low wages, no work-life balance, and a lack of follow through"
good,"personally i felt my manager lie and gave me the run around  so because of that i'm not very fond of the person but i did enjoy working for Macy's, Macy's was great the people who work alongside you are great"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Extremely cut throat associates for sales. Good discount for associates and decient pay. Hardest part of the job is cleaning up all the clothes left on the floor in dressing rooms.
good,I joined Macys for extra income. I enjoy the retail atmosphere. I worked in the shoe department so I was commission based. Some of the older associates were very territorial. Management at this location were not professional.
good,Management in my experience has been great. The downfall no guaranteed hours as far amount per week. The pay is minimum wage which is 10.40 an hour-after tax not even enough for gas.
good,I had to be there early in the morning and the hours were long and the pay was not great. I liked my coworkers but I was there before opening and they did not not turn the aircordinting
good,"When working at any department store your schedule is ever changing, which makes it difficult to plan things out far in advance. You do have quota's to meet that can make it difficult when the store isn't busy."
good,"I was in retail it’s fast paced can be fun, but it can also not be fast paced and not be fun. It’s fornthe right type of worker to be in the field of work"
good,"I enjoyed my 13+ years at Macys, I met many people from all walks of life that even today I still maintain communications with. "
good,I loved working at Macy’s I was very sad when I was laid off . A cut back on the amount of sales managers per store. I enjoyed going to work almost every day. But after all was said and done it worked out for me.
good,"Well probably the least paying retail company. Some of the managers were biased, some needed training on delegation and some were just abusing power. The sales associates create a great environment to work in. Most are helpful."
good,Fast Pace Environment that is customer service driven.  Schedule changes is something you'll need to look out for here.  You'll have great coworkers that make up for the short comings.
good,"The work environment is a fast paced environment, where sudden changes and adjustments need to be done. Overall management is not necessarily the best, but my team manager is one of the best, makes my job easier and doesn't add the stress on the team. This manager has helped me improved on my leadership skills, communications skills, and work ethic. Overall, this manager has helped make Macy's a better place to work at."
good,I enjoyed my job at Macy's. The managers in the store that were there when I started were nice to work with but some of the new ones aren't so pleasant.  I experienced numerous major changes in different processes - it was hard to keep up. The numerous sales and coupon programs were confusing and there is a high expectation for sales people to really push credit cards on their customers.
good,"My typical day at MACY'S was to either pick or pack items that needed to be shipped out to the customers. I established a good repertoire with employees and staff that worked there. I enjoyed working with people, and I got to know new people as well. The job is a diverse place and with different age range.The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude people, and disrespect at times."
good,Its fun but stressful they dont care how tired you are but you can take a bunch of breaks and the good part is your in the mall so you can shop or get coffee or and lunch options are alot.
good,"I work as a Sales Associate on the Flex Team.  Flex allows me to pick up hours when I want to work.  It is more enjoyable than full time.  Full time Sales Associates  have many responsibilities.  Long hours on your feet, can put a toll on the body.  Responsibilities include but are not limited to,  assisting customers in selecting products."
good,"I was unemployed ... Marcy's was a temporary fix ... I walked in a loop for eight hours."
good,"The other associates are friendly and helpful, when it comes to working together. But whenever there is an issue, your questions aren't answered. But it is fun."
good,Work day typically went by fast and Macy's did want their employee's to succeed however it was difficult working for retail company in this day and age with the current trends of how people shop and see profits drop.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Start the day with having a meeting with my team.  Replenish any missing stock and reorganize floor.  Design and set up floor plan.  Create weekly goals for associates to make.  Train new employees on merchandise and company procedures.
good,"I lost my job due to elimination of my position. I loved the people I worked with, but unfortunately the retail world (Brick and Mortar) is getting hit hard. Although I am thankful for my time at Macy's, I can't say I'd go back anytime soon. The retail world is changing and I don't believe there's 100% job security with any position right now."
good,"My coworkers is what makes going there fun other than that its a very irritating place to work. First off, they don't have nearly enough people working there. they expect you to do the job of at least 3 people in a 8 hour shift when they schedule you by yourself the entire time. Also, they've been telling people that they start off making more than what it actually is."
good,"Macy's is a fast pace place to work. customers are friendly staff help each other.i enjoyed my time there,good place to start in your retail career.slow advancement  is the only problem."
good,I don't care to review these places. this was a temporary job I have nothing to say about it. it was fine I guess. I cant think of anything else to say about it.
good,I liked working here. Very fast paced. Time definitely goes by fast working here. I got 3 breaks for a 10 hour shift. Management was ok I didn’t really deal with them much.
good,Retail for the most part is the same everywhere Macy's is no different. They are open all holidays except for Christmas and Easter for now so you can't plan family time let alone trips on holidays. Considering how much you pay for your health insurance benefits the pay is low.  The store managers control the atmosphere of the store if they're poor and are inconsistent in their ways the rest of the management team is the same or worse which can make for a disengaging environment.  The majority of the associates are helpful with one another and pleasant to work with.
good,It was okay working there but it was under staffed on busy days. The fitting room go backs were too much.Some very rude customers but always got to smile and be kind.
good,It was a great experience. The customers are kind of rude and it's nothing I can say back to them unless I want to get fired. It's a pretty chilled location.
good,"En typisk arbetsdag var att se till att det fanns kläder, prata med kunder och hjälpa dem att välja ut plagg. Se till att butiken var ren."
good,Week days were rather slow and were spent recovering the department. Weekends were hectic and it wasn't always possible to recover at all during those days.
good,"Great business structure, but I can't say much for the employees that fit into that structure...management was always very lax about giving direction and often wanted to pass the buck to the employees directly, in a sense, didn't actually manage at all....."
good,"Pretty much designed as starting point for retail career. you learn a lot about customer service, cashier jobs and retail in general. Customers can be tricky and work time changes all the time. Pay is poor and you would be able to make a living out of it unless you gain enough experience."
good,"I would interact with different customers, assisting them with their shopping needs. I would explain to them the new collections that would arrive at the store.I would offer them an opportunity to open up a store credit card for savings on their purchases. I enjoyed the staff members that I worked with at my department. Management was very informative and encouraging. The hardest and challenging part of the job was trying to meet the daily sales goals."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Macy's but retail is headed in a direction to employ fewer and fewer people in stores. Unfortunately that meant cutting positions that were essential to the company, in my opinion, and I no longer agreed with the future outlook."
good,"Its macys everyone knows it not much to say, big corporation no love for the low employment line. CAnnot really make a living here unless you are some sort of management."
good,A great job to get into if looking for an easy steady job that is laid back. there is always something to do weather is a heady work load or organizing carts.
good,"Poor management at most levels of the organization.  Turnover in management is high and at the associate level even higher.  Inconsistent in their adherence to policies and procedures and the training is the worst, especially for incoming managers."
good,"not a gre employer sucky hours and holiday cut off dur to slow business hired 1000s only tol layoff later on"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Clinique is an awesome brand to work for, not only do they give you many perks  for working for them, such as gratis every 6 months, awesome seminars with more gratis and of course a Christmas gift. It’s an awesome brand to work for who really invest time and money on their coworkerd. Sadly working in a Macy’s was not the best, maybe it was the store I worked at but it didn’t make the experience working for such a good brand that great."
good,Macy's Inc was a quality job that allowed you the fundamentals of customer service and the experience that you learn from the company will last a lifetime.
good,I had liked working for Macy's Warehouse. However I was employed only on a seasonal basis. I would like very much to go back(Be recalled for Employment for Macy's Warehouse.
good,"Worked hard and a lot of hours. Pay was low and culture was harsh. "
good,Macy's fulfillment and distribution was a exciting job. Tiring at the same time. You might walk 10 to 15 miles per day. Very energizing. You might stand in one spot for 30 minutes so it's very surprising at what you're going to get out of a day's work.!
good,"First day, fresh out of training, was a Sale's Day on the weekend and it was terrible method to force new hires into the fast pace, cut throat  workplace culture."
good,"Wear good shoes and comfortable clothes.  Schedule is inconsistent and not when I'm available. However, if you have flexibility and want to make extra cash, it could work well for you."
good,"It ways a very productive environment, there was always something to  do. There was always multiple managers on the sales floor in case you had a question."
good,Met a different array of people with unique shopping habits and taste. It is an ok place to work just to watch people buy new clothes the way it made them was thrilling.
good,When I went to macys they trained me with somebody not that good and i didnt learn everything in my training days and it got very irritating because i didnt know everything and the customers were getting irritated with me aswell and it just wasnt a pretty picture but the employees are nice .. the age range is either 18-25 or 45-70 macys is a nice place to work if you have no bills .. and even though the long shifts are good .. who wants to do that every day just so there check can look decent .
good,"putting alarms on clothing"
good,"Working here is a fantastic way to gain some work experience. It teaches you a lot about customer service, cash handling, and team work. If you do great, and have the right people on your side, you'll see somewhat of a future."
good,"Working at Macy's is your typical retail experience, long hours, low wage, clean store, take care of customers, put clothes back on rack, wash rinse repeat."
good,"A typical day would be getting report in the morning, getting prepared for the customers to come in. You had some managers that were nice and easy to work for  and some that needed a communication class. The hardest part was the excessive amount of hours you had to stand. The best part of Macy's was the percentage of we got when we purchase something. The enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,"Can be a good place to work with the right team.  The work life balance is non-existent.  They claim its important, yet its frowned upon to take time away and often puts co-workers in a tough spot.  The holiday season is incredibly stressful.  Large disconnect between corporate, region, district, and store teams."
good,"Macy's was a fast paced. There were free lunches and plenty of fun around every corner. It was a mad house on black Friday. I loved working there, great place."
good,Macy's is a good job for someone in school or just as a second part time. For a single parent with bills Macy's is not a reliable source. Although as an employee you sometimes have access to great deals and advances on sales. The management team is mostly poor and can definitely use some improvement.
good,"The managers are over worked. The commutation is poor. You benefits when you retire are poor. The is not enough help to learn, "
good,"First part of the day, was to come in open registers. Make sure all merchandise was nice and neat. Greet everyone that came through your department. Offer assistance in cosmetic counters. Depending on what time of the year there was secondary tasks. Learned about how to interact with customers, learning to listen to their needs.When management came around, it was to coach you, check if you were ok, and see how your sales were going. Hardest part of the job is not being able to reach your sales goal because of the lack of business in the store as a whole. Happened most of the year, if it there wasn't a holiday. Most enjoyable part was the commission during peak times, and gratis from vendors."
good,"I did not like a schedule and pay. But working with my customers was enjoyable. It was very fast pace and many more hours during Christmas Season, which made it very difficult to navigate through family life."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,management has changed with the past year I have worked here. unfair and shows a lot of favoritism. employees don't get paid enough with all the stuff dealt with through out the day
good,There is always a sale going on and the need to be present all the time can get draining when the supervisors don't appreciate your hard work.  My son had to go to the hospital and they asked if someone else could take him so I could work.
good,"The Macy's credit department was a great place to work temporarily. I enjoyed my time with the company and would recommend it to anyone wishing to get their feet wet. However, I found there to be a lack of career advancement opportunities."
good,My manager at the time was not a great leader and did not set a good example for some employees. This particular manager favorited only certain employees and talked down to others.
good,"In this job, I work with wonderful people. I currently have a very supportive manager and my coworkers are great. I love interacting with the customers and helping them achieve their desired look . Retail has become a very challenging industry. Sales are down all across the area and are not forecasted to change in the near future. Therefore. commission checks are reduced and overall salary is down."
good,"Learned how to keep the place, clean,safe and fun. The workplace is very friendly and outgoing. The management needs a little help but overall great team."
good,"Macy's is the most busiest retail place as it is a destination known to many from Miracle on 34th Street.  Enjoyed every bit of Macy's as they have a great HR and wonderful managers.   Though hours are crazy and the place is never slow, the company makes it fun for the employees and appreciate their associates"
good,"There are a lot of opportunities for advancement but outside candidates are valued more than internal candidates. They will give you a lot of great training that will help you be successful in whatever you do. Great benefits, overall great company to work for but it's if your aren't in the executive development program it's harder to get recognized and paid for your contributions."
good,"Dealing With Difficult Customers Can Be VERY Stressful But If You Have The Patience, Then Apply. Things Might've CHANGED Since I Worked There As Far As Pay & Benefits But It DOES DEPEND On Which Store & Department You Work In As Far As The Treatment From Other Employees & Management. You Might Get LUCKY. Overall, It Wasn't A Bad Place To Work."
good,"You meet different people everyday. You learn how to communicate and build relationships with customers, everyday was something new. I was a seasonal worker so we didn't interact with the manager's on a daily basis. It was a very easy and fun job."
good,I love working for Macy's.  The company has great values and moral is great. I love meeting new and interesting people everyday.  I would recommend this job.
good,nice managers. i did not like how my hours vary throughout the the week. and very short breaks. i learned to work with various people of various personalities.
good,very boring job and didn't get a lot of hours. They wouldn't give me more hours even if I asked them for it. I wanted to do a lot more. It was way way too slow paced.
good,"I worked for Macy's for about 4 years. It was a great first job and advancement opportunities are rampant, however it gets too stressful after awhile and there is too much pressure in management positions to make sales goals. There is not much work life balance because of working retail hours. Upper management is on and off okay but you can tell they are receiving a lot of pressure too and it is passed down onto you. So in all not a bad job but when moving up the ladder it gets more stressful."
good,"Pay need to be better. Growth in the company is the worst."
good,"Is very stressing in holidays hours,the management don't have respect to the associate,the salary and commission is low ,so inside everything is horrible,,but the management is terrible."
good,"Good place to work but has been going through layoffs since past 2 years. Every 4-6months there is a new round of layoffs."
good,"Retail is hard work but Macy's has a lot that's good about the way they do business. Yes, during ""Holiday Time"" there are more hours, but if you can cope, it's good."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"They are now in panic mode and making stupid decisions to correct things.  They often do not even use common sense in making these decisions!!"
good,"Management could be improved."
good,The job itself was very easy. It is retail so it does have the stereotypical drama. Overall the staff I worked with was exceptional. The Company is not doing well financially and unfortunately that means my job has been eliminated
good,"I did not enjoy this job.  It was a Christmas temporary job.  The regular employees seemed to resent us even though any commission from our sales went to them (yep).   Management was never seen.   If you had a problem, help took a long time to arrive."
good,"I took payments over the phone via check, credit or debit cards."
good,"Cashier, stock floor, attend dressing rooms, and provide excellent customer service. Employee relationships are fair, and you get to choose your schedule which is a plus."
good,You are less desirable the older you get. Hard to advance in the company. Great culture and co-workers. good work life balance. Pay and benefits are okay.
good,"Macy's is just like any other low paying retail job, unless you work in a UNION store, then your hourly pay will be much higher. "
good,"the hours are long and busy but the break room has massage chairs and tv, bathrooms located on top floor and is constantly busy on weekends and sale events."
good,"I assisted customer at register, provided product knowledge. Maintained department standards including go back standards. "
good,Didn't like waking up at 4am to be at work so early but the employees made the day go by fast. Some of the clients can be really snobby and there's nothing you can do about it.
good,The hours are better than most I go in at a time when my kids are in school and get out just in time when they get home I'm never tired and the day goes by quick
good,I like the discount I get and flexibility of hours.Although I get so stressed with opening credit cards. I like working there because my coworkers are nice too.
good,I worked at a macy's that was closing so there were not a whole lot of hours. everyone kinda checked out. i was just working there as a weekend job so it wasn't bad for the pay and hours i worked
good,"I worked very hard to gain a sale.  Sales were difficult to maintain because of the pricing and competitiveness, but the commission was decent.  Overall a good experience with customer service."
good,"Estuve fenomenal y aprendi mucho con ellos"
good,"It's retail, everyday I different. Usually a lot is expected out of you especially during the holiday season. There is room for advancement some of the time but no guarantee."
good,Nice job ..but not good at retail really..but was a nice place an good coworkers..not good hours .learned how to sales an be able to stock an unstock old an new items..
good,Macys is a fun place to work because of the scheduling flexibility and people there. Store manager is not a good guy and the managers aren't the best. The environment is fun because of the people not the work.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"My review was good.  I was hired immediately.  I started within a few days,  My most enjoyable part of the job is when you make your quota, I liked when I had a busy day."
good,Lo que más me gusto fue la diversidad étnica y que pude prácticar el ingles.
good,It was an okay job. Not a lot of hours and your always on your feet. My manager at that time was a cool person. The benefits are great. It just wasn't the job for me.
good,"It was an ok place to work. I enjoyed selling the cosmetics and products but felt like selling the credit card was ""too pushy"". You get a decent discount."
good,Macy's is a retail chain that sometimes can be a challenge to be a part of. You must be available pretty much throughout the day being that you never really have a set amount of days or hours that you have to work
good,The hardest part of the job is when not in season it would get very slow and boring!! Other than that I enjoyed working for Macy's at that time and would love to have the chance again.
good,Being that I worked in 2 locations 34th street and Valley Stream there was a difference between the 2. With 34th street being fast paced especially around holiday time valley stream had it's moments of calmness. Depending on locations really can depict the level of business that you have on a day to day. Also working in women's shoe dept it was commission and will be very cut throat at times.
good,"Working at Macys as a sales associate is possibly the most standard retail job in the world. Nothing extraordinary whatsoever. Your experience in a store setting will vary wildly based upon store management, as well as geographic location and customer demographics."
good,"overall ok place to work, great lunch area, hr is helpful, parking good, traffic horrible, building is huge, lots off walking, climate controlled, mostly friendly people"
good,"Not much room for growth. Otherwise the company is good. Also, most job titles do not receive benefits, which are necessary in large companies. Especially when you offer them but not all employees can receive"
good,They do not know what they are doing as a company that is losing ground but customers do come for good customer service we strive to find what they need but we can't provide what we used to provide at first the stores need to seperatetgemsdlves from the online business by making the stores more desirable to shop
good,"It was a stressful environment. Very high pressure sales job. Management was fine, but I couldn't handle the job. I voluntarily quit because of this.."
good,"Macy's is going through a lot of tough times as many retailers are. However, the store was consistently understaffed in many areas. In January, February, and March of 2017 all the managers were laid off except two. When I left we had been without a store manager for a couple of months."
good,"Store shut down,among many others,  not much to say other than if you decide to work for Macy's I wouldn't remortgage your house.   People were decent, and there was opportunity for advancement, I did."
good,"Macy's is great in the beginning, after a while it takes a toll... Health insurance is horrible. I was given 5 vacation days until i reached my 2nd year in the company along with a 50 cent raise. Working at macys is definitely exhausting and can make you feel like the workload isn't worth it the long hours spent day in and day out."
good,"Am meeting, open procedures."
good,I think some of the most impolite customers I have ever met were at Macy's. It's not a very team-friendly work environment either. Competition among coworkers ends up leading to a bad work environment there.
good,"Encourage team work behavior among employees. Strong customer friendly environment, that ensures customer satisfaction. Main focus is always customers."
good,"this job allowed for me to grow in my costumer service skills. i had an experience where i was given a fake gift card, and i was taught how to assess the situation in the most professional way possible. i was taught the difference between costumer service and hospitality"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The only thing I can say about this company is they hire everyone, everyone! They can have criminal records or be doped up. Then treat the decent employees like criminals. My supervisor was the best and did see a difference in workers. But other supervisors did not. I thank Macy's for hiring me but with them being unorganized I had to leave."
good,how to explain mmm well at first it was fun and great place to work but after shuffling different managers it became less fun and unfair no opportunities
good,"There is a constant weight over your shoulders working here at Macy's. The management can be kind and understanding however ultimately their only goal is looking out for themselves and their own image. As a sales associate you will be nagged on a daily, hourly, basis to sell credit. These managers can find the littlest fault in what you're doing. It's a constant critiquing job, high pressure to sell the merchandise (especially in a commission based area) and it gets even worse during holiday season when we are forced to sell credit, holiday programs (Thanks For Sharing), presells for events, AND Plenti sign ups. If you want to get paid minimum wage to do extra work not in your job description, disappoint your managers when you can't open up credit cards, and listen to the same horrible corporate music on loop every single day, then this is the job for you. But if you're an individual with integrity, who just wants to help customers without forcing credit down their throats I say find another place to apply to. Also, the customer base at Macy's is a lot of older folk who are very picky, needy, and use associates as verbal punching bags."
good,Fun place to be especially when its crazy hectic.The fourth quarter makes or breaks you in retail. Typical day to day is always something different never mundane keeps you active
good,Enjoyed co-workers and management. Fast paced atmosphere during the holidays. Customer oriented and great discounts. Flexible hours so you could work as much as you wanted.
good,Some of the managers had favorites in employees. It was hard to actually get to know managers. Very demanding in getting customers to sign up for credit cards.
good,"During an regular day at Macy's I would restock shelves, work on the P.O.S system, assist customer's with selecting the proper purchase, and provide excellent customer service."
good,"I liked working for macys, northridge. People there are friendly. Only part was being demoted from one department fragrances . to demoted to the smallest cosmetic line in the store. And i was givin the explanation that corp. decsion.."
good,"Customers are the worse. They can get away with everything and anything. It's always a mess, but the discount is great!"
good,Loved helping customers with shopping for their loved ones and or children. Also loved helping others with their fashion needs. Great job for someone looking for a little extra cash.
good,"Being a Sales Associate for Macy's Ala Moana meant--unfortunately--long hours sometimes without any interaction with customers. This job was fairly lenient and there were many opportunities to practice and display good customer service. While management is very family-oriented, the disconnect with the continental US makes for an awful experience with relaying any kind of information to and from Hawaii."
good,"A good standard type training for retail sales.  You will actually learn more once you start working at whatever job you get at Macy's"
good,"I had this job out of college to earn and save money, and I was able to do that. I enjoyed working with my fellow coworker. Very typical retail experience."
good,"Fast pace to environment , Very hands on work. Not enough resources to train and develop associates. I learned to be able to problem solve solution with little or no help.  The best part about working for this company is people coming together to try and accomplish daily  & weekly goals."
good,"Great guest assist, counting money, filing inventory lists, cross selling, providing information on different products professionalism are some of the things we did on a day to day basis."
good,I have no desire to have to review my former employers.  I have no desire to say good bad or indifferent things about anyone affiliated with the company
good,"my coworkers were the best part of this job; theyre the reason i stayed as long as did. pay was decent for a second job, however for the amount of work we had to do, please macy's dont count yourself as competitive. most customers were friendly, yet for the ones who weren't, oh boy. you needed to have extended knowledge about products you probably never wondered about before and while i did learn quite a bit, customers were never satisfied and i blame the company for not having a good enough training program. it's retail though, and most of them are like that--thrust you into the job unprepared. yet its no wonder why, everyone there is constantly moving and too busy to even take breaks. of the entire 6 months i was there i took possibly 11 breaks total of the 2 they give you for every 7 hours you work. i was one of the harder working ones, although maybe thats not saying much because a lot of fellow cashiers either totally slacked or didn't show up at all. they had a huge under-staffed issue and maybe its cause what they ask of you versus what they gave you was ridiculous. maybe the picture im painting is worse than it actually was and there were quite a few times i enjoyed myself there; overall this was my honest impression. like I said, it was a few close coworkers, one manager, and one store manager that convinced me to stay there as long as i did, and my last manager was my decision for leaving. as many of the customers loved to tell me, ""there's a reason macy's is closing""."
good,"Despite the long hours, the place was bearable. The people I worked with and under were a joy to be around. Managers actually tried to help both us and the customers. It is a definite if you need experience in customer service."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Things have changed a lot in the company. When I started in the company I thought I would be able to build my carrier here but every year there are so many budget cuts don't know what the company's future is. I know everything is changing in the retail business and elsewhere, so you need to change with the changing times."
good,"My job assignments required completion of building maintenance projects, including painting, and general store maintenance.  I routinely was responsible for buying supplies needed for the projects.  "
good,"You can make your own schedule, but be prepared to be shifted to another department if the Department manager needs you somewhere else. Some of the permanent staff are very hard to get along with, especially if they know you're seasonal or feel if you've broken a rule."
good,So i can't say it was all bad. I like work in in customer service. But at this location specifically you get no help employee or customer. Feel lucky if u have an employee help u out. People are always clocking a nd then there not even there. Basically not to much leadership with few exceptions or help at this location.
good,"Most of my coworkers are very caring and hard working people, I believe for all the work that we do we are being underpaid.  Keeping  the floors and fitting rooms clean and free of clothes lying around is sometimes difficult when you have a continuous line of customers that we need to keep happy by keeping the lines moving. We treat/help our customers in the very best way that we can and most are very appreciative, especially when we go above and beyond for them.  My favorite part is being able to help the customer find exactly what they need and conversing with them.  They become sort of family. I believe if most of the management would chip in to help instead of just giving orders, and also if they also desperately need to hire more sales associates/cashiers things would run much more smoothly."
good,"Fairly easy tasks, moderate management. The most enjoyable part of working there is meeting new people and building relationships with customers. Worst part is the pay."
good,"Very good environment really liked working there. The store managers were very helpful. My coworkers were pleasant, dependable and had very good attitudes ."
good,Whilst some of the co-workers have been great I will say that some of them weren't exactly at a maturity level I would associate with a crowd that is at least in their mid to late twenties. Managers were alright but feel my experience could've been better working there.
good,"Heavy workload, little annual compensation. Associates are difficult to manage regardless of management capabilities. Way too many tasks for associates to be responsible for, creates an overwhelming work environment. Future of brick and mortar not promising for future career growth"
good,"A typical day at Macy's is filled with challenges and expectations, but also with a team filled with optimism. Many hours of my workload is spent lifting difficult and sometimes heavy pieces of merchandise and supplies. "
good,I worked for the Christmas holiday and it was a nice environment but not very organized. Hardest part of the job is remembering each fragrance. It was nice that they give you a course to take before you start so you learn what you need to know and you don't feel so overwhelmed.
good,"Management tends to be over worked, therefore cannot adequately cater to the needs of their employees, general daily questions, training, touch bases. This trickles down to the employees by example and everyone feels stressed. The most enjoyable part of the job is the personal selling successes with the customers."
good,My job is varied as do different things on different days and at different times of the day.  I have met a lot of new friends.  It is a good place for a retired person to work.  I do think the pay could be better.
good,"As a member on the replenishment team, work is always on the move. It's our job to make sure all of our newly-arrived products are unloaded, categorized, and ready for the sales floor. Once they are ready, these products are to be distributed out into the sales floor, where they are to be presented and up for sale."
good,I worked here for almost a year. They had possibly some of the worst management I've ever seen as an employee. The managers are very selfish and don't care about employees. HR is no where to be found.
good,There were good benefits. A good discount and perks. The schedule changes too much last minute though. The management and judgmental attitudes aren't good though. I found that to be the biggest problem.
good,"Typical day was 8 hours, wait on customers, try to upsell including Macys credit cards and other promotions. "
good,"Macy's isn't a job recommended for people with no work experience. However, if you have no problem talking and engaging in conversation, then go for it."
good,"Working for Macy's was a pleasant experience, I learned alot and met alot of great people that have help me grow as an individual. Enjoyed my co workers which is helpful in assisting multiple customers."
good,"As a merchandiser we always promote specific products and services and increase sales.Our duties include arranging neatly on shelves,building aisle display,placing orders,ensuring shelf tags and prices are accurate."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"4-wall brick-n-mortar is changing... e-commerce driving business, therefore the reductions within stores. In order to drive sales, there must be associates present- with cuts, the future looks very bleak for department stores"
good,Macy's was very important in my development as an employee. I learned basic tools to take in any place I work from now on. The hardest part of the Job depends on you.
good,its was a good experience for people skills. learn to deal with different can of class and education. the client is always right. the long hours were the worst part of the job
good,"I really do love the people I get to work with at Macys, but I dont like how they do scheduling and how managment does a few things such as attendance and picking current employees for higher positions. "
good,The work environment at my location is great very good store managers and management team is excellent. the district managers and company policies are terrible don't care about employees at all not happy with that
good,The hardest part was just standing guard at the door for 9 hours. I have learned that you have to stay focused at all times on the job. The management is not good at all. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with are very friendly.
good,"Sick time and paid time off is earned relatively easily, but finding coverage is a little trickier. Management works hard, but sometimes causes associates to look poorly in front of customers."
good,The company as a good relationship to its employees. They have a a weekly and monthly review of our performance as a site. They give freebies every time we hit our targets and they cheer us when the score going south.
good,When customers are rude managers dont do anything. They still try to please the customer instead of having their eployees back. Not much of a team work place. Dont give set hours. No future in this for anyone but an okay job i guess.
good,"I felt as if this job wasn't much of a challenge, maybe it was the position, I felt like their was no room for advancement.  I was in Support Team, where I would basically just pick up the clothes that customers dropped or put in the wrong dept. I am a people person and would have liked to interact with the customers more."
good,"This job is fast-paced and full engagement. My day involved helping many customers simultaneously and through out the day. The hard part of the job was the competition between co-workers. The sales goals were difficult to achieve on slow days. My most enjoyable aspect was being able to dress in my fashion sense while still meeting job requirements, aslo being able to show and wear my tattoos/piercings."
good,"When I was hired on to the dock for seasonal it was very busy we had 18-20 people working on the dock."
good,"A typical day consisted of  assisting several customers, maintain the sales floor and meeting and executing sales goals.  I learned time management, customer service skills, how to build a relationship with each customer to ensure they come back and ask for me. The management was laid back yet firm with goals and needs day to day. The hardest part f the job was the constant demand for sales with little to no foot traffic often. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with wonderful people meeting different people everyday, assisting each guest ad having fun along the way."
good,The first year I worked at Macy's as a seasonal sales associate I loved it. I would clock in at a register and make my way to my assigned department for the day. It was incredibly busy due to the time of year but I liked the fast pace of the job. Some days I would be on the register for my entire shift. Some days I would float back and forth between working the register and doing go backs on the selling floor. I liked dressing up for work. It made the job seem a little more glamorous. Most of the managers were really nice and encouraging. On occasion I would have a manager who gave more orders than direction. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers but I made sure to keep a polite and positive attitude even during these times. The most enjoyable part of the job was the discount.
good,In the beginning it was fun but after a while it didn't work with my schedule so I had to quit .I learned a lot on what it pertains to have an a retail store and what it takes to get the sale ready before the store opened
good,"I learned about different products and met new people (co-workers and customers), and the paid training was very helpful. A typical day involves signing in, counting the money that's in the register,  putting merchandise in the appropriate places and interacting with customers. Then you take 2 15-minute breaks and an hour and 45 minutes lunch break. Then returning to work, counting the cash register at the end of the day, and signing out. Management was very encouraging and very involved with the employees. The most difficult part of the job was knowing all of the products and percentages of the sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was the themes of the day such as ""Ugly Christmas Sweater Day"" and "" Wear your Jeans to work Day""."
good,"Every morning we were required to do the cash office first thing before the store was open up for the day. In the cash office I prepared the bank deposits, ensured the vault was balanced then proceeded to the sales floor to ensure that each register had the proper amount of change needed per the printed report.  Associate interviews and training. Associate scheduling. Assist with minor payroll issues and HR issues. Print reports for store manager and department supervisors. Assist with several other odds and ends things."
good,I really loved my job but I could not grow there. Management wasn't the best support but I made it work. My actual job being a makeup artist was very enjoyable.
good,I worked at Macy's as a seasonal employee. During my time at Macy's I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The management staff always came up with ways to motivate the staff to reach our sales goal.
good,"I had a good Manager and my co-employees are also wonderful.  I love the Employee Lounge.  Since I work overnight, that is very important for me. It helps me get my needed rest even for an hour"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I've worked there never had problems except w some managers who are pretty rude but not that bad and the people there aren't that bad either work place is fine and usually never boring
good,"Working at Macys is a pretty self-explanitory job. Management at my particular store isn't that great, could use some improvement. However I have wonderful coworkers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unruly customers. The most enjoyable part of the job are the usual sweet customers and the great trust you build between them."
good,retail does not pay very well!! you work a lot and don't get paid what you deserve!! hours are not good!! discount is okay but you have to have there credit card in order to get your discount to shop in there store!!
good,"You will learn a lot but it is mostly trial by fire. Must be able to learn quickly, delegate well and move on when mistakes are made. Very cross functional"
good,A typical day at work was hard working and fast pace. A few things I learned while working for Macys was I learned dependency and time management. Management was great. The work place culture was equal and diverse. The hardest part of the job was constantly standing on my feet for long hours. The most joyble part of the job would have to be clocking out for the day.
good,"Needed to work on communication and support of associates. Managers needed to be more involved with their staff. "
good,"Macy's has a strong focus on opening Macy's cards. Almost invariably any discourse with store managers pertains to Macys credit cards. If you do a good job of getting customers to open Macy's then you will be spared the heartache from the managers. That being said, do not be apprehensive about  working for Macy's. It isn't a requirement to open a certain amount of cards; rather it is just annoying the way the company prioritizes the cards. Overall it is satisfactory."
good,"The Associates that work for this company are some of the greatest people. Although it is a commission based job, the environment (for the most part) is helpful and friendly. Customer Service is everything in Macy's. Put on a big smile and you will get far."
good,I worked as a seasonal hire during the Christmas holidays.  A typical day had loads of customers ranging from different levels of difficulty in pleasing them.  Lots of recovery aka putting things back where they belong.
good,I have gone 5 weeks without work and every time I call nobody will get back to me on why this is.Coworkers are very nice and pricing isn't difficult.Only downside is the lack of hours.
good,"Enjoyed my coworkers and job duties. Management, benefits, and pay could have been better. However I Learned alot in visual and am grateful for the opportunity."
good,"I was hired on as a Seasonal employee during the holiday season. It was fast paced since the store was extremely busy. I loved working with my co-workers, just wished it wasn't just a temp job."
good,Daily tasks were clearly outlined. Learned how to prioritize and maximize productivity with limited resources. My supervisor wasn't able to support me to do my job to my full potential. It all depends on your role and the size of your location.
good,Working as sales support kept me very busy. I was able to work different areas of the store on different days so basically i wasnt in just one area for hours
good,"-Life/work balance good for professionals with families"
good,"You get paid fairly well and Macy's knows how to keep you busy. Whether it is with just folding clothes all around the department they put you in for your shift, or ringing people up all day."
good,there should at least be more employees working for the stock area.. there are too many tasks for just a couple people especially around the holidays.
good,I was seasonal. you get company employee discounts at their store and online. You can pick up overtime hours if available on the company site. You  can get a credit card. As seasonal worker I was dismissed without proper notice. I thought that was an unfair company move.
good,"It was a fun enviroment but the constant sales every week are annoying. The employees discount is no discount, we get the same precentage as card holders! With Macys being such a huge company they should take a look at employee pay scales. It's a great place to get sales experience and meet new people but I don't know about long term."
good,"I was seasonal Associate, Not that much fun at work because it is massive schedule. work environment is so so and ok ok.  But some departments are good. Management is not that good."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I loved working here for their discounts. "
good,"A typical day consists of marking down merchandise that has been scheduled by corporate.  Goal is set to have in the 90% completion by Wednesday of each week."
good,seasonal employess do not get a lot of hours so I wouldn't expect a lot from macys only if your a permanent hire. you have to pick up shifts on your own and theres hardly none
good,"overall I was supposed to come in to work and open up the registers in my department. i am the sales associate and the cashier, and most of the time the stock associate."
good,"Great place to grow if your career is going to be in retail. Have to have lots of people skills. Have to be able to service customer with magic, and give each client the best overall experience that she will want to come back again."
good,Busy work environment with plenty room to grow within the company. Within two months I was offered a full time posituon working in womens shoes. I mostly enjoyed the comission and competing with my colleague's for sells. Over all macys is like one huge family of goal driven sales associate s.
good,"A great day at work would consist of: positive attitude from customers,  management and coworkers.  If you're having a bad day the last place you want to feel worst is at work. The atmosphere and overall enjoyment was moderate, just depends on everyone around you and their vibes. The work there was simple and easy, kind of a no brainer. Simple tasks include: handling money during opening and closing, sensor clothing, damaging clothing, organize areas, helping customers, and maintain a positive attitude while doing so. Management was somewhat complicated to deal with at times only because half of them do not know what their talking about, so if you do something wrong it's because you're misinformed. Coworkers on the other hand, some of them at least, I find them to be simple minded people who just work to get by. The best part of the job was the learning experience and meeting new customers which you also get to help style every so often if they ask."
good,Macy's is a great company but with the rapid store closings it makes job security seem less likely to obtain. They do promote from within the company if you're looking to advance. I just wish they would stop closing so many stores
good,"Steady paced for seasonal hires, sometimes there are extremely busy moments. "
good,"OK place to work. Customer where my first priority and I had fun serving them. professional, not many opportunities came my way when I was employed."
good,"On a daily basis my responsibilities include, to check the fulfillment for the items that need to be shipped from the store to our customers, open the registers and help on the floor in case that we have to do some signing for a special sale. In some days I help the vendor to organize the floor with the new merchandise, and to put on the floor the clearance items. "
good,It was a fun work place for what retail can be. However very little room for advancement. Have to be there for years in order to advance even a little bit.
good,"great temporary place to work, if you like working holidays and weekends. great way to get retail experience. work with all types of people. I learned a lot about different products that macys offers."
good,Really fun time working there a lot of girls worked there so there was always gossip only about 4 of us guys working night crew which was alright
good,Working at Macy's was like a dream for me since i graduated High School but working there was bit challenging because it is not as easy has i thought it was going to be but i have learn how to talk to customer even when they're being rude and impossible to handle at times.
good,"Exceptional work and life balance"
good,I worked here only for the Holiday Season in the women's shoe department.  The regular employees were paid on commission and the seasonal employees were not.
good,"Slow days"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"if u need job experience this is the place to go, good resume filler , friendly people , busy atmosphere, can be a career if u want it to be"
good,"- got to interact with different people everyday"
good,Some days are better than others depending on the flow of customers. Some co-workers work really hard others tend to slack off. Management is okay if you don't plan on advancing. Learned to always keep a positive attitude even in the busiest of days.
good,"Challenging and fun. You are required to work with the general public so you must be comfortable with helping others. However, a few  customers could be having a bad day while others are having a great time at the stores."
good,Performed​ with a high level of focus on results in a high stress fast paced environment. Responsible for proper placement of categorized products and how their placement affected the remaining products. Repackaged specific personalized customer orders for prompt shipment.
good,"Co workers were amazing. Management was great. Worked on floor, in stock room, and as cashier. There were always a lot of hours to give very flexible scheduling."
good,"Hours weren't guaranteed it was always an uncertain how much you would get. Whenever a lead position would open up they fill it with someone from a different department that had no clue how things worked, it was the blind leading the blind."
good,A typical day at Macys consisted of watching the 20+ CC TV's looking for shop lifters.  My team and I would have to constantly survey the multiple floors and departments for shoplifters.  The hardest part of the job was chasing down the thieves in the parking lot once they left the store. But it was alright because I had an amazing amount of co-workers. It was enjoyable knowing that we were able to save the company lots of money by apprehending the criminals.
good,My Typical day at work is learning the daily sale results from the day before and leading a team to process merchandise. Personally I love my co-workers and the management team. The hardest part of my Job is not knowing if I will still be employed with Macy's and the most enjoyable part of my job is working with a great team.
good,"Though very low collateral for the work you do, this job gives you a sense of professionalism, also has some aspects that need to be improved"
good,For a high end retailer they do not pay their people what they are worth. I had no problem selling their merchandise an frequently hit over 400% of my quota. This was my only retail experience. They pay and incentives did not match my abilities. Seniority took precedence over abilities.
good,"Great place where innovation and learning go hand in hand but implementation takes a U Turn."
good,"Each day was exciting very busy, Adaptability is a very good trait to possess in the Macy's sales environment Customer service is the main objective. For the most part management is fair with training, recognition and promoting deserving employees. all of the aspects that I love about retail exist in Macy's. The fashion, the merchandise, the customers with needs and the solutions available to please."
good,Managment doesn't know how to let you have a blance between work and life. They expect Macy's to be your frist priority. My co-workers are great you kinda end up like a mini family while you work there and they make my work days enjoyable. You also deal with difficult customer and the managment does not always have you back.
good,My coworkers were a very friendly and productive group. The company was pushing for a young management team. Heavy emphasis on advancing younger workers.
good,I have enjoyed working for Macys but am looking for more work/life balance. I do not see a lot of growth opportunity without relocation
good,"Managers treat employees like children, asset protection constantly trying to find something to pin on associates to gain bonus, extremely low pay with tiny raises, rarely have weekends off, very few PTO days unless there five plus years. Loved the cosmetic counter I worked for and the gratis but ultimately did not like the company."
good,"A typical day at work included organizing merchandise and assisting customers with sales. Management was mildly disorganized due to there not being enough managers at any given time. I enjoyed interacting with customers and my fellow sales associates. The hardest part of the job was the sheer fact that management was pretty insistent and pushy about opening new Macy's credit cards. At times management was quite disrespectful of sales associate, which made the environment questionable at times. While working here, I learned a lot about customer service and how to better effectively communicate. I also enjoyed the fact that I was able to somewhat set my own schedule."
good,I stocked merchandise and tested products on customers. I had to meet the numbers for the Dior counter along with credits for Macy's. Helping the customers/clients feel more confident and comfortable with themselves after enhancing their beauty.
good,"The first job I did was put out new fashion jewelry and watches in cases.  restock women's and men's clothing on tables and racks. Display new Merchandise.  "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Fun place to work. Very fast paced, and you stayed busy. Team members were nice and the customers were normally friendly. Day went by quickly"
good,Not what I expected. Not well managed. Co-workers can be mean and not willing to cooperate. Sometimes you are not given enough hours a week. It was not fun at all and had to be able to get up around 4am and 5am depending on your position. Can be very frustrating if you do not like it
good,"not the job for me, was not willing to work around my school schedule. was unable to alter work schedule for any reason. breaks were very short and some managers weren't helpful"
good,Fast paced environment where I had to interact with many individuals to provide for their needs and expectations. Every day was volatile so I had to adapt and use all of my resources to do the best that I could do.
good,"This employment was seasonal and required very early morning hours which are not conducive to having children who get up and go to school in the morning.  The shifts were very short and twenty weekly hours was often split up among four or even five days.  In the end, the cost of travel to and from sometimes negated the hours worked."
good,"I was a seasonal associate from October up until the end of February. The work wasn't hard at all, and I really enjoyed working with the customers. The management was okay."
good,Nothing really special. Basic run of the mill retail job. Good experience in terms of dealing with customers and customer service/sales. Most employees are civil. Management is caring to employees though during holiday seasons. Free breakfasts and lunch/dinners certain nights.
good,"greeting customers,helping them with what they are looking for"
good,"High paced environment with a diverse work force, Cross trained in many parts of business. Excellent schedule and flexibility of management to help their associate. I learned a great deal of information about the credit world and many important databases."
good,My co-workers and customers were my favorite part of the job. The hardest part of the job was keeping the fitting rooms clean at the same time as trying to help customers.
good,"It was an overall great place to work. The pay was nice and I loved my job responsibilities. The counter managers were all wonderful, but had poor store managers."
good,"Very task oriented , there was always something to do and if there was something I was unclear of, either the managers or one of my co-workers were more than willing to help out. Very friendly people. Most enjoyable part of the job were the people there."
good,"nice people to work with for the most part, compensation terrible, hard work."
good,"part time"
good,"A typical work day was busy and eventful. "
good,"High turnover, limited benefits, and high pressure sales managers. Was a top performer and earned a lot of commission and bonuses."
good,"There is a lack of work and home life balance. The ability to change your schedule with other workers is nice. But there is a lack of consistent scheduling which makes it tuff to have good quality of life. "
good,"Very competitive environment, lots of work and no benefits. BUT when I worked for them the best thing almost like gold was the Macy Bucks!!! Macy bucks for me made my efforts sort of worth while!! I believe every location and management is different, so everyone's experience will vary."
good,Very fast paced environment that requires a lot of flexibility. The tide is always changing so you much have an open mind.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The discount was most definitely the best part. The management seems to be unwilling to work around life itself. I witnessed students who were basically told, ""its class today or your job."" They tell employees to set their own availability online, but that still has quite a few restraints, and when the system makes an error they aren't willing to fix it. I had issues during my mothers battle with cancer, they weren't willing to adjust my schedule (way in advance) for her major surgeries. Definitely felt disposable, there is a revolving door of new employees, and they made sure we were aware of that fact. Don't seem to respect employees as hard working humans who want a life outside of work, a thanksgiving dinner with family, or a Christmas that isn't spent in bed (recuperating from the 24hr stint on Christmas Eve), or in bed super early (to prepare for work at 12am the day after Christmas)"
good,"I bet Macy's is a great place to work however with seasonal associate's being hired the emphasis should be more about training the temporary employee's properly.  Our trainer was so fast he hit one of the girls in the head by accident with the gun they use to computerize everything.  He snapped at one woman  who must have gotten upset cause she didn't return after lunch.  He acted as if we should know what we're doing after the first 3 hours.  Impossible.  It was humilating at times and degrading.  I guess it depends on what department you are in.  It made us nervous!  It was very confusing for many of us in our group.  We had no clue what was happening and our trainer was a bit impatient with us. But keep in mind, factory work is a different culture of people.  It doesn't matter if you have a college degree.  Work is work in a factory.  It pays the bills.  No one cares if you are smart or talented.  Just do the job.  And fast.  It's hard work."
good,Learned a lot about the retail industry and got a chance to work with experienced buyers on a regular basis. Not much room to advance in terms of career at Macy's. Most recent company restructure raised a lot of unanswered questions.
good,"The management had favorite employees that he would tend to, often leaving others to work out very difficult situations on their own. Very improfessional and continously made questionable decisions which usually resulted in hindered progress."
good,"I did enjoy working here as a server , met new people and learned about different cultures. I enjoyed the events that happend thereat weekends and also came across friendly colleagues.  It is closed !"
good,"Macy's is kind of an odd company to work for. If you're full-time then (I hear) the benefits are exceptional, but part-time workers are not eligible for anything but a paycheck and there are few full-time positions available."
good,"In cosmetics, its basically like getting a glimpse of running your own business....with the management team down your throat about credit cards, my client program and various other coupons and point systems that they want you to sign clients up for. I learned that if you aren't an aggressive type, and aren't genuine, this is NOT the job for you. Commission, commission, COMMISSION is what the people in fragrances and cosmetics are really cutting your throat for. If you are a genuine person starting out as a GOOD makeup artist, that may be the only part that you enjoy and can easily build your portfolio...trust me, it makes the day go by so much faster."
good,"Many personalities. Upper management has a vision but, it really does not come across through store level associates. Too many people who have a sense of entitlement. Therefore, making it unfair for others."
good,"Would have stayed longer, but there was NO MANAGEMENT.  Mis-communication all of the time.  Great co-workers to work with. Most personalities mixed well."
good,if you're looking for a temporary part-time job Macy's is very flexible but they underpay their sales associates. Holiday season is the hardest part because you don't get to be with your family.
good,"Visual Merchandiser. There was a lot of freedom visually, which was fun. Always a lot of work to do."
good,"Its not so bad if you like cleaning a lot and are a great seller. I don't know about now but when I was there, there was little to no management in my department. I was basically my own manager but I wouldn't choose this company for a career more like a high school part-time job."
good,"This company needs to become less individual store driven. That is..."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty busy. I've learned great customer service skills and got cash handling experience. The management is ok. The co workers are great and very helpful to the newer employees. The hardest part of the job is closing, it's a lot to clean up and usually you stay past your shift. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people. It's a good job however because the hours are flexible."
good,"No room to move up. Very political, and very catty. Don't trust upper management. My co workers are wonderful and I have learned a lot about the industry. The hardest part of this job is constantly having upper management changes, along with new initiatives because each one of them has a different opinion."
good,While working at Macys I was able to perform basic retail duties along with light administrative tasks. Macys was a great early career decision.
good,"Good environment to work in overall. Decent management, The hardest part was dealing with unsatisfied customers and having to turn their negative feelings into positive. Most enjoyable was working with a team of good, hardworking associates."
good,"My overall experience there was average.  At my store location, I felt unappreciated and used.  I question the methods used to keep track of associate performance."
good,"A typical day here is always productive as we deal within an aggressive timeline with projects. This is actually the most enjoyable part of the job for me as I like the rush and thrill of working to complete an assignment! "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Fun workplace with many hardworking employees. No room for growth unless you are willing to travel great distance or you know how to pull some strings.
good,"Ringing up customers and helping them look for outfits for their kids, grand kids, baby shower gifts, etc. I worked in the children's department. There were a lot of returning and new customers I would see everyday. Working at Macy's I got a chance to meet and help a lot of people which is my overall goal in life!"
good,"Macy's is a decent place to work if you like to interact with different people.  The work is not rigorous.  My hours have been light, as I am a part time worker (8 hours/week).  Compensation could be better, as there is not a good commission rate on sales."
good,"Again you learn in a corporate setting with training, and follow protocols of the company. The daily work schedule was always changing ,and at times the place was very busy with customers."
good,"For someone looking for a career such as myself, I would not recommend this place to work. However, the  supervisors and coworkers are wonderful people."
good,"A day at work consisted of checking and security all distribution departments.  Taking inventory of merchandise.  Some of the co-workers were a little disrespectful.  The hardest part of the job was doing inventory.  The most enjoyable part was working in the security office working with the security cameras and logging visitors in and out, and making sure the building was secure."
good,"Great retail establishment , lots to learn and great employee ethic ."
good,"A fun,fast-paced environment with great co-workers and ideal fringe benefits such as the employee discount and flexible work schedules."
good,A typical day at work would be greeting and helping customers with merchandise. I learned that the customer needs and wants are very important and to take note of that.  The hardest part of the job was recovering the floors because it was a lot to do in so little time.  The most enjoyable job is when we get recognition from our supervisors of our achievements.
good,"When I started work with Macy's, I was told this was a straight commission position (draw vs commission, but still). Since that time, the company has asked for more and more duties from me, as a commission associate, that take away from my ability to generate sales. For example, fulfilling online orders from the store inventory, which not only takes my time and attention away from live customers, but also removes stock from my inventory to sell that I am not compensated for in any way. In fact, since it takes away from my ability to sell, it actually costs me doubly in that I don't get anything for doing it, and it removes stock from inventory for me to sell. Not pleased with your ethics, Macy's."
good,Busy work days and lots of foreign customers. Having to stand all work hours is tuff. Managers get upset for sitting 5 minutes.
good,The job is ok i just need something better to provide for my family.. Its not enough money to live at all. I want more for my family and i know i want be able to give them that at macys. Its a good company
good,"This being second job, I didn't really care too much about sales goals. I watched full time employees steal each other's customers and secretly be angry at each for taking each others' customers because the only thing that seem to matter was reaching your sales goals for the day. Saw people constantly checking register to see how much more they needed to reach goal and eventually found myself doing the same. For non-commission sales, this was unnecessarily stressful."
good,"Macy's has had good service, but lags customer relations and strong management with others, as well as the best value for the dollar."
good,It's hard to make a consistent decent wage when it is total commission with no base pay.  It's too cut throat. Management doesn't place you where you are specialized to be.
good,Excellent for retirees who wish to stay active. Great for college students and as a second job. management works well with employees.
good,"Just on the sales floor picking out the customers orders,"
good,Very competitive work environment with strict sales goals to meet. Not very team oriented. Everyone works on their own. Focus on individual goals.
good,The best part of working there was the discount. Management was not very flexible. Poor work and personal balance. Ey busy durin holidays and not enough staff.
good,"The Hardest Part of this Job was Receiving Hours, i was given 3-4 Hour Shifts twice a Week.Very Fast Paced Work enviorment."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,You will learn so much about retail. The good the bad and the ugly. Lots of room for growth. Thankful to have worked for the biggest department store in the world. Workload is huge and unfortunately  not realistic.
good,"I felt a little hostility from my co-workers, I could tell they weren't too fond of the seasonal employees. I didn't make too many friends, but the pay was good since we worked on commission."
good,It was very hectic working during the holiday season but that's what kept the job interesting never a dull moment and always stayed busy
good,Macy's is a very well known company and a great job for charismatic people with a flexible schedule. The hardest part of the job is that it is difficult to receive full time hours. The most enjoyable part are the customers and the mall environment.
good,"As someone who worked at Macy's for over a year I can say it was an enjoyable place to work. At least until you do good at your job and they notice. It is then you are given more and more tasks, if you say yes in this work environment the management team will ask you a series of things to complete."
good,"Typical work day consisted of prepping and cooking food. Everyone was a team player. Management was just ok. Hardest part was not having product available on several occasions. Most enjoyable part was the fact that ""I love what I do."""
good,"Nothing at Macy's makes it great or horrible. The day to day is just trying to get sales. They do offer good insensitive to meet your sales goal, and they will praise you if you meet quota."
good,"Not a company that is organized, I would love to leave this company and put my skills to better use, with a better work family, that will grow."
good,I was responsible for accurately processing and packaging the customers order.  I had to verify all items on the invoice to the items to be shipped.
good,"Macy's works their employees pretty hard for the few benefits that they offer.  Employees only get benefits on clothes that they can wear to work.  Employees must wear black to work and can only wear another color underneath a black jacket or vest."
good,"Help customers at registers and on the floor, put clothes away where they go, organize racks, keep back stock rooms organized, push credit cards and sales, work as many hours as you want. Retail does not pay very well."
good,"it is reasonable for an overnight job. the only problem is that, some of the employees have childish behaviors which causes issues in macy's for a lot of people."
good,Good for part-time job. Ideal for college students and people who already have another job. Flexible scheduling. AWFUL PAY!!!
good,My Customers are my drive to excellence and celebrating the sell.  Cosmetic co-workers work as a team. Proper training for counters are provided.
good,"Working at a LARGE Macy's in Kahului Mau I was supported and mentored   by management. Our Store Manager, Debbie Chukus was instrumental in making our days productive and overall welcomed and wanted. The store was kept in neat and working order at all times, upholding Macy's high standards. Transferring to Macy's in Boise I took a $4/hr pay cut as I was now classified as Holiday Hire.  I continued to demonstrate Macy's high standards of Customer Service and worked extremely hard to keep the department I was working in (varied daily) cleaned up and in order. I did NOT see any support from management here in Boise ID Macy's store, nor did management follow M.A.G.I.C which is Macy's pillar of sales and service. The store was filthy and usually items were not put where they belonged. Very sad and awful work environment."
good,"Printing of reports to distribute to executives and sales associate within the store every morning including money counts and deposits that need to be made. Throughout the day, any information posted on the portal will need to be distributed. My co-workers and I along with Management staff would try their best to help each other especially when dealing with customer service issues. Hardest part about the job is maintaining a stable work environment best suited to everyone's wants or needs. Most enjoyable part about the job is we were constantly busy, there was always work that needed to be done and new projects coming along."
good,A great place to work as you get to meet a diversity of individuals from different backgrounds. Great team work and support from management.  The constant standing as an associate takes a toll on the back and legs.
good,"All learning was done on a computer and not being taught by an actual person made things much harder and monotonous. Management was strict and often wanted unreasonable hours, or constantly moved associates throughout the store. (which is ok, but sometimes the manager you were assigned to didn't know where you were in the store because there was failed communication between all managers) "
good,When working with great co workers your job is quite easy and very enjoyable. They offer great discounts for employees.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Despite working worth employees that I didn't quite agree with, It was a tolerable experience working with women and women shoes."
good,"Learned many exciting things about working with diamonds, precious, and semi-precious stones. Worked with various brands of designer watches such as Movado and Gucci. We had many contests on selling various pieces which gave you more incentive to sale particular pieces."
good,Working at Macy's was good for gaining some practical work experience at my young age. I did not have many responsibilities at first but was able to get more responsibility and confidence in speaking to customers. I was in school at the time and the hours were flexible enough to allow me to study and go to class without sacrificing hours.
good,"Opening and closing of cash registers "
good,"A typical work day would be to handle escalated calls, presentations and meetings.   I learned to overcome my weakness of speaking in front of others with the presentations we do weekly.  Management seems only concerned with their daily numbers. The benefits(medical,dental)are expensive. Co-workers are the reason I stayed so long and the hardest part of the job is the hours(12-9pm,2-11pm.)  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping others, the people you get to work with and the rallies and events we have."
good,"Responsible for managing 60-70 associates. Was in charge of driving business, maximizing customer experiences, staffing, and keeping the department up to standard."
good,"Seasonal workers get put anywhere with out hardly any guidance. Most managers are acting up, take their power for granted. Human Resource one of them has a nasty attitude for their fellow employees.."
good,"working  in retail environment you meet   people from all around the world."
good,"I would usually have random hours to come  in for shifts but I feel in the mornings management would be on top of things. My co-workers and I were pretty diligent workers and were always tasking when the need be. Sometimes certain associates would be fooling around and the managers would pay no mind to it. The hardest part of the job was trying to do the store clean-up at the end of the day, it would get very messy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the extended breaks."
good,"My first few months in macy's were amazing. My manager was absolutely encoureging to move up in the company, but after my first promotion things went downhill. If you don't have any work experience I'll encourage you to work here but if you have work experience you should apply somewhere else."
good,"Pay wasn't that great but environment was pleasant.  Co workers could be pushy and possessive if you're new they would try to divert your attention to other aspects of the job making it hard to meet the preset goal for sales.  Not commission in non cosmetic jewelry or handbag depts. but co workers were concerned with making goals and would make it difficult to achieve your sales goals by hogging the register and insisting you do go backs until the end of their shifts.  "
good,"A typical day was hardly never, every day I was at a different department. But fun"
good,Macy's is a good company to work for there understanding the working atmosphere is fast but fun. the hours are long but worth it.
good,"A typical work day is preparing the sales floor, working as a cashier in addition to customer service of clients. What i learned was that Macy's gives the workers the change to make the customer happy. The management culture is very laid back but they have a clear goal."
good,fast pace job which i love  there are always great opportunities for learning there and the management was ok as well all my co-worker was very helpfull there was never a hard part to this job i enjoyed it very much getting to work with great people i love it
good,I didn't work here very long but it was an okay job to be at. Company Christmas parties where nice. No one really cared who you were as if they were all expecting you to leave at any moment. I didn't feel very welcome there. Some times we had nice pot lucks.
good,This was my first job and I'm so glad I'm done with it. The people in charge with scheduling are so out of line with the rest of the world. Frequently has people call out of work and have scheduling do nothing to bring someone else in. Had my hours changed without my consent. My availability times were ignored on more than one occasion.
good,Value the learning I have had from the different experiences but managers lack understanding of how to connect and communicate respectfully with employees. Very little training and development
good,"Good employee discount, but high turnover rate. Good for a second job."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macys is ok job to have. not the best but it somewhat gets the job done
good,"I really liked my coworkers, and managers at Macy's. They really made me feel at home, but I wasn't confident selling things, because my favorite brands for their style would fall to bits rather quickly. Also, full-time hours are 32, and one can technically pick up hours to 35. It's not enough."
good,"did not learn too much. the job environment is okay, but they did not respect my school hours."
good,"Night, weekend and holiday hours"
good,It is more about who you know than what you do most of the time. It is also very difficult to achieve a work/life balance as a manager. You are required to do a lot without being given enough time to do it. Micro-managing is rampant. It can be fun since there are a lot of great people there and its a fast pace environment which can be a rush.
good,It's a place to work. My manager didn't know what she was doing.
good,Energetic company to work for. Increased amount of training before working on the floor. Flexible work hours.
good,"So many tasks to do, not enough time.  As a manager I managed the Men's Department and Home Store.  Employees never had enough time in the day to clean up their areas, and put things back in a timely manner.  Macy's has a good selling culture when employees have the time to provide quality customer service, As a manager I was always helping the employees with their tasks because they never had enough time in the day to complete them all."
good,Good for a seasonal part-time job. Pay is about average and management is nice.
good,"this was a friendly place to work, just not much opportunities . also not much people to talk to on how to more up withing company."
good,"As a visual merchandising, I make down, old clothes and stock out new clothes. I helped decorating the area with new items for the customers."
good,"I worked 10 years and take me 2 years for they let me drive a forklift, because any women drive..... I live de experience to see how del let go employees after 15 to 20 years because they can not be faster like the new young people. ,"
good,"Loss Prevention work was fun, but the pay was awful.  It was a good environment where I learned a lot about security, CCTV, dispute resolution, interviews, report writing, etc.  I'd recommend it to anyone starting out, but the pay only starts around $9.50-10/hour.  Macy's does pay better than most other stores, though."
good,management mostly cared about getting sales and credit applications. co worker would constantly call out and there's no coverage. was a lone for my whole shift 8hrs. customers were rude if they didn't get it their way.
good,"My time at Macy's was short lived because I needed to go back to school and my work schedule clashed. But, from what I remember, the employees were hospitable to new faces and helped me when I wasn't sure of what was doing."
good,"Met great people but they ask a lot for what little they pay."
good,"had to keep constant contact with the managers such a high volume of customers and there is three floors to the store , i did pricing and signing, merchandising sales support"
good,"The job position of Sales Associate was to be on the floor and away from the cash register at all times. We were to greet and assist every customer that came into our department, keep the department clutter free and organized, and the dressing rooms free from clothing. We needed to know our products and sell credit cards and promotions to our customers. We had sales goals that we needed to reach daily, weekly, and monthly. The best part of the job were my co-workers and the worst part was having to push items onto customers even after they say no."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was working with some amazingly talented people.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Ability to multi-task, while being attentive and remaining flexible to the needs of the business.  Ability to work as part of a team and take initiative independent of direct supervision."
good,"meet new guest"
good,loading trailers 5 at a time had a little trouble with this since it was done all by hand
good,Working at Macy's was a fun experience. Interacting with customers was the most enjoyable part. I learned a lot about customer service during my time at this company.
good,"In morning, given work for the day,very time oriented, no time to breathe."
good,This place will work you harder than you suppose to work. They do not pay you enough for you hard work. They put too much on one person.
good,"Macys is a good company to work for but not a place I could work my entire life for. Yes Macys does get busy and because I work on commission you do have a possibility to make good money. The downside is that where I work at least, during the months of March- August there is no people therefore the money you make is garbage compared to October - December."
good,"The typical work day at Macy's as a picker started with grabbing your clipboard and supplies for the day. Then the entire shift would have a meeting to discuss what absolutely needs to be done and what we were doing right and wrong in the previous days. Throughout the day, it was mostly individual work where you were pulling orders for the packers to wrap up and get ready to send out. At the end of the day, we turned in our paperwork and had a long walk out of the building."
good,"Long and tedious. I've learned product assessment, hardest part of the job was prolonged standing and disgruntled co-workers."
good,"worked for the christmas season, was busy and lots to do, long hours and with chance of picking up more hours"
good,"Opening of the working area i.e (register, light dusting, lights), greeting acknowledgement of bypassing customers 95% of the day. Helping shoppers as needed. Opening of credit cards and adding each customers to you call list. I have learned better customer service skills. Meeting new people would be the most enjoyable part of my job; hardest part would be credit cards for customer given the economy."
good,"• Pricing, re-pricing and inventory audit of merchandise. "
good,"Really great atmosphere very fast pace and sale quotas. The schedules are not very great, but if you don't mind retail hours then this a great place to work"
good,"Process sale transaction"
good,"A typical day at Macys would include 7 hours of phone Customer Service.I have,however,had an opportunity to work or cross train in multiple departments such as billing adjustments, assisting with managment duties,retail services,online purches and issues,Q/A (questions and answers)Assisting four regions of customer service repersentatives with any questions or concern to enhance job knowledge and empowerment which eventually turned to the CSS (Customer Service Specialist) dept taking on Bloomingdales customer or assoc concerns as well.Last but not least or limited to,I was specially requested for through managment to assist with the New Hire Screening for the midwest business office location which required me to contact potential candidates of employment and thorogh my standard of professionalism and their answers to questions asked,this determined the second interview with managment.My concern is there was never a sufficient pay available to sustain me and my household."
good,"The work day usually consists of several meetings and working on several ongoing projects with business partners. I've mainly learned some PC break/fix techniques along with Excel, SQL queries, and Access database information. Management varies and goes from good to heavily inconsistent. Co-workers are about the best part of the job. The hardest pieces usually come down to balancing the ongoing workload and being able to delegate work to others in the group or my own associates. The best is interacting with my co-workers."
good,"A typical day consists of - Monitoring the sales floor to identify the needs of my team (such as filling or adding fixtures, and making sure the signage is correct). - Creating the team schedules according to the daily work load. - Working with management. - Working with the staff to produce results, and to ensure that deadlines are met."
good,"This is just your average sales associate job, But the people you encounter daily come from all walks of life."
good,"flexible schedule and you meet great people "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Love to sale shoes to woman of all ages.  I made the job fun along with the help of my coworkers and manager.
good,"Macy's is not a great place to advanced in. They are contradicting, in themselves and in the store itself. Hourly pay is great. The atmosphere is heavy, customers can be a drag, and the management sucks in itself. Even though all of this is true, I still find myself enjoying the work experience. I enjoy my fellow sells associates, we are really the magic behind Macy's. Even though the same situation may not be for every Macy's at the location I work at I believe strongly, that new management is needed."
good,"Decent enough job, it involves more physical stress than anything. I worked on the loading dock mostly, which involves unloading, moving, and unpacking boxes, as well as pushing racks/shelves pull of product around. I almost never had to deal with customers, but decent physical condition is definitely recommended. The actual facility was nothing special; It was a cozy enough place, but offered nothing in house, you had to leave the store to actually get anything to eat or drink on breaks or lunches and the break area was very small and relatively empty."
good,A great company to get customer service skills under your belt
good,I do an equal amount of ringing on the register as well as on the floor. I put items back in their correct areas and make sure everything in my area looks clean and organized. I've worked in almost every area in the store but my main area is men’s dress shirts and ties. I help customers find ties to go with suits and shirts every day. Almost every customer I help leaves happy and satisfied with their purchase. I always get compliments on how well I can put things together. What I enjoyed most about this job was all of the customer interaction I encountered every day.
good,"- Meet sales goals by catering to customer's needs, while upselling and cleaning. Customers do disgusting things in the fitting rooms, damage clothes on a regular basis from being careless, are very demanding, and difficult to sell to"
good,"My typical day at work was stocking housewares and linens,  taking care of customers needs , and finding them the best product that suited they're needs and wants. I loved most of the management. Never had a problem with any co workers most are still my very good friends to this day. Hardest part of job was rearranging entire sections of housewares from one end of the floor to other and making sure that the design spread met the overall approval of the Big guys in coorporate This was one of my fave jobs"
good,"The job in its self was OK, but the work environment could have been better."
good,"My typical day as a sales associate at Macy's will start off by checking the department and making sure it's presentable for the customers. Next will open up the cash register. Then prepare to greet customer and ask if they need any assistance. Opening credit cards and making high sales was always the two main tasks focus on while on the job."
good,Not enough hours. Low pay still enjoy working for this company just need something related to my career field
good,"Not the best pay for the work you do. Management expects too much, for they pay."
good,I learned a lot as a seasonal worker and meet many interesting people
good,"I would go to work and clock in. Then I would walk around the department I was working in and organize racks and help customers. Once I finished organizing racks I would help out at the register. I learned how to work the register and help the public find what they wanted. The store was not very organized. I was working alone on my first day. I had to find someone to help me. My co-workers were very nice. I was working during the holiday season, so I had to manage my time and help everyone the best I could. The magic of Macy's made it a fun place to work."
good,"The managers are pushy and arrogant. I learned that manager's will do their best to manipulate you into working a shift that you are unable to work. The employees are more helpful than management even though the job was fairly easy in itself. The joy of assisting customers and having them leave grateful and happy is the best part of the job. The hardest part was dealing with customers that will argue with you until the end of time, and make you call a manager so that the manager can repeat everything that you said."
good,its a decent part-time job if you are looking for work. the hours are 0-40 hrs. theirs no set scheduling and the pay starts at minimum wage. Also the more you learn the more opportunities you have to get hours.
good,"My experience at Macy's was good because of my customers and extraordinary customer service skills, but the managers don't communicate with their employees enough. Most of my employees were very helpful when managers weren't around."
good,"you have to do so much, cashier, clean up,  help guest with all needs, check fitting rooms, fix  clearance area,,,"
good,"Macy's prides itself on making magic for their customers, and most of the time it is true. "
good,"Not much job growth and security.learned how to deal with customers on a very busy, hectic environment."
good,"Macy's is a great place to hone in on your customer service skills. With extensive training and lots of coaching, I learned how to handle a customer in any situation, how to make a sale based on a customer's needs by asking them open ended questions, and how to sell products that I normally would not know how to sell. This was also a great experience in cash handling, especially during the busy holiday season."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"It's an okay job for anyone looking for part-time work, in a fast-paced environment."
good,Macy's has a great work/life balance and great job culture.
good,Working at Macy's for a year I learned the up and downs of the stores. While the down time wasn't too low when it gets hectic it gets hectic and you have to learn to be fast paced and productive as well as multitask.
good,Great place to learn about sales management. The most enjoyable part was the customers. The day to to day interactions were great!
good,"It was based on all customer service and it was worth the exposure. "
good,"The Loss Prevention career is very rewarding in the fact that you are making an impact on the bottom line of a company. You can feel like you are walking away and making a difference. Hardest part of the job is the work life balance for managers. We are constantly on call weather it involoves detectives catching internal or externals, alarm calls, store issues, operation issues, etc."
good,As A Seasonal Security Guard Macy's Basically Wants you to be anti-social. Most Of The Associates are pretty friendly but it doesn't   matter because the store and Loss Prevention Managers Will Stay on your case about socializing. Store Management Barely does any work at all.
good,"I worked in the Women’s Shoe Department. Duties included helping customers find the right product and ringing sales up. Job duties also included opening and closing registers, operating registers for customer transactions, and providing useful insight into the products being sold."
good,"I have great co-workers that really helped me when i first started now that i learned i have the power to help new employees."
good,"Needs more team building in the organization. The most difficult part is working in an environment in which everyone is not in sync. The most enjoyable part of the job was striving to make an impact on sale through Support  via merchandise presentation, analyzing reports, and working with my team"
good,"Because Macy's is such a big company, it is not hard to be overlooked and underpaid. Although I felt my pay was enough to help me through during college, I had co-workers who have been there for over 5-10 years and have not advance nor received much of a pay raise. That's sad because you give more than you receive at Macy's... That's for most retail jobs anyways"
good,A typical day at work would include controlling premises for any suspicious activity. You tend to talk to employees and customers just to see what they are up to to get anything to be suspicious about.
good,"management ist all that great, the work is simple, the staff would have to be the best thing about macy's."
good,"Macys was my first experience in retail.  It was fast paced atmosphere.  Co-workers and managers were flexible and wonderful to work with.  Most enjoyable part of the job was getting the work"
good,Its only ok because The job sercuity is bad. If your trying get a few dollars before the before the hoildays
good,"low pay but very flexible with schedule, collecting payments, greeting customers,"
good,"open register, cleaned, checked in, costumer service, upgrade sales, put away items and help costumers find items, answer sales calls, close register and do drop off of money bags"
good,Nothing more to say except it's like any other retail job. Hours vary and customers are rude.
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the public. great way to start for a high school student or college student
good,Overall it is a pretty easy job. It's great as a part time job or as a second job to make extra money. Pay is pretty mediocre. No opportunity for advancement. Dead end job.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A typical day working at Macy's was fast pace and hands on, from helping a customer find an item online, ringing up a purchase, putting back items that were returned back onto the floor. What I learned from working at Macy's was socialize more with the customers, starting up the conversation to try and help them feel more relax about shopping, especially when it comes to the holidays. The management was good they explained the task and rules we had to follow very clear. My co-workers were hard workers they helped me if I had any questions or concerns about an item. The hardest part of the job black Friday. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the satisfaction look on the customers face when I have helped them with what they were looking for."
good,"A typical day at work would be to clock in, set up display pieces, clean out cologne shelves, restock and wait for a customer to help."
good,I was in charge of making the store merchandise look the standard of the department that was in at the time. whether it was mens nike or women lingerie. There isnt much time to talk and or have much conversations with co workers. I really didnt get to know anyone there except for my manager. The hardest part of this job was dealing with cleaning up after people threw the merchandise around and making sure everything was stocked after a rush.
good,Its a good place to do a lot of shopping some customers are nice and some are very rude. Co workers try they hardest to get to all the customers first just to meet they goal that was set for that day
good,The Macy's corporation recognizes excellence in their team members and is willing to promote those that show promise.  The management team is professional.
good,"Work around the wrap-stand/registers, keep the sales floor and area around registers clean and organized. Clean and check fitting rooms every hour. Sort clothes into their home department, put away clothes, organize and size cloths on racks and tables. Greet customers and help them locate their size or recommend merchandise that may be of their interest. Answer calls, make online orders over the phone and in store. Help customers make their Macy's card payments, purchases and returns on merchandise. "
good,"Well at my time there i never knew who the supervisor was. I can remember the company hiring people but not giving out enough hours for the workers they had. "
good,"Customer Service involving maintaining inventory that was seasonal, continually changing every six weeks.  Thanksgiving through Christmas was the busiest and most fun time of year to step in when summoned to this on-call position.  My next favorite time of year was graduation through Labor Day, when we would receive foreign visitors."
good,"The retail environment is not for the faint of heart. The team is solid and supportive, but job placement relies too heavily on numbers rather than where actual associate strengths lie. The hardest part of this job is working with the public, and meeting living costs."
good,"A typical work day at Macy's largely consists of provided exceptional customer service, helping each customer who comes into the department find what she is looking for, and presenting her with options and well as her first choice. I am a specialist on most innerwear and I know how to properly measure for bra fitting. "
good,I learned the basics of retail and gained great customer service skills. I also had to clean the dressing rooms check on them and service customers.
good,"A typical day at work, Is good customer service and provide the best service to the guess and sell. The most enjoyable part is went the customer leave happy."
good,"A typical day at work would involve a lot of insane, demanding customers with few staff and other days would run smoothly with jokes and connections made between the customers and staff.  What I've learned at Macy's was the basics and in and outs of customer service. I also learned how to work in a busy , fast-paced and demanding environment. When you first start at Macy's, they train you on the basics such as how to use the cash register but the first day that you start they ""throw you into the lion pit"". They don't train you on how to do certain things on the register and most managers just tell you what to do for the day such as clean this area and then they leave. Some managers are well prepared and offer the most of help while others are not so much. Overall store management needs work but Macy's morals and values such as ""Be The Magic"" can help you during your day in sales.  When receiving my promotion, I received a raise of a 50 cents with no hours. My position was supposed to be switched from part-time to full-time but I was told there were no full-time positions in my department. Two months later, two full-time positions opened in my department but instead of them changing my position to full-time due to my new promotion and seniority, they hired two new people. Macy's scheduling procedure is a fail. They fail to schedule multiple personal on busy days, when we need it the most. Instead, there are multiple people scheduled in the morning when it is usually slow and only 1-2 people closing the department. Those two people have to clean the floor, be available at checkout,"
good,"Overall Macy's is a good place to work.  The other associates and mangers are very nice, but it seems like some of the management doesn't take things seriously.  Telling someone about problems around the store or from other customers never got solved.  Not enough hours, or steady hours per week which is a financial problem."
good,For the most part days here are nice regardless of where you are working. I am unfortunately not going to be here that much longer even though I would like to have seen myself working here long-term.
good,who would not want the experience of working for one of the tope retail store on the east side. Macys has everything and more.
good,"A typical work day at Macys would be putting away shoes if the manager would need me to come in early, bring shoes out to customers, i was also flexible to work in other areas of the store when needed. i learned organization skills that could be put in any type of setting, even medical settings, i worked with managers  in what they might need even working extra shifts. the hardest part of the job was the lifting of boxes when shoes had to be put away and the most enjoyable was working with the customers to find what they needed."
good,"A typical day at work would be come in , sit for a group meeting and then go to your floor and get ready to sell . The managers were always up your butt about being on the floor ready to sell . When you would try and look at your goals they would complain about you being in the stock room or where ever they had the goal chart up . One lady was very disrespectful and i felt as if she did not care about her employers . My co workers were a gift from god and i still keep up with them and talk to them on a weekly basis . The hardest part of my job was dealing with the managers . The most enjoyable part was building a relationship with my customers"
good,All associates must be in tune with using the computer systems. We are always learning how to improve the quality of the store for our customers. Co-workers are friendly and always helpful to each other and also to the customers.
good,"A typical day at work is straighten handbags dealing with vairous people all walks of life.  I learned not to take things personal when dealing with customers help them to be help when the are leaving our store. My coworkers, are very pleasant and energetic and I havent experince a hard part of my job.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to see a customer help as they leave my area."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"always something to do never a dull moment. dont like all the clothing put aways though, but very easy job no chanages."
good,It was great when i started and had no bills. One job you are not allowed to have car insurance nor a cell phone bill.
good,Parts counter and machine shop manager. The hardest part answering 5 phone lines and helping customers
good,"usually a fun working environment, sometimes tough to meet all expectations in current economy."
good,"Providing excellent customer service"
good,"The hardest part of my job is the lack of direction day to day, but over all my job is very creative and fast paced which makes it fun and makes me passionate."
good,"A typical day would either be working in the deli or being a cashier.I learned how to multitask at a fast pace.Management was unprofessional,not understandable at all nor were they flexible.You really don't get to interact with co-workers.Because your in a small area by yourself.There wasn't anything hard about it.The most enjoyable part was working downtown."
good,"I was only here through Christmas. I enjoyed being in the hustle and bustle of the Christmas crowds and because of my location in the store, I was always busy, which I loved. I was alone a lot of the time, which I did not really care for."
good,good place for part time work they are a great proving round for your selling skills 
good,"go into work get started on my day right away whether it be in the stock room, folding clothes or at the register. working well in a fast pace environment was something i learned how to do. with the help of my manager i learned how to do most of the register work she was always willing to help out. had a great work relationship with my work team. adjusting to the customers personality and having patience for some of the customers was a bit of a challenge that i learned how to deal with. the plus of working in such a big store was getting to meet the most interesting and cool people."
good,"I love people and making people smile and Macy definitely allowed me to do that...to an extent. I definitely felt the pressure from upper management which was not fun.  I loved the people I worked with. In a sense, my co-workers and I all suffered together which made it bearable. We did get opportunities to participate in great events within the company and other organizations. That was definitely fun. Of course, people this is retail it isn't for everyone. So this would kind of be the same really for most retailers you go to. It's constantly changing. "
good,"A typical day at macy's would be my team and I to start cleaning up whatever section we were given that day and have it done by the time our shift was over, I mean I didn't learn too much from macys, just how to do an inventory there, but that was some what easy, the management seemed productive but they didn't seem to care if I was a worker there or not, and I got along with my coworkers very well, the hardest part of the job was not getting that many hours and I also had asked for a full time position it was promised but never given to me, and the most enjoyable was getting along with my coworkers and helping customers as much I could."
good,I have learned a lot about how to be a better leader in my position at Macy's. The compensation however is not what it should be though.
good,"A typical day would include, returning calls and email. Registering couples, opening registers, cash wraps clean, assisting customers on the sales floor. Working towards achieving sales goals and bridal goals. working on any upcoming events in store."
good,"I love that you can pick the hours you want to work. Bad thing about macys is the lack of training you get. You find out the do's and don'ts from employees that have got written up for certain things or even fired for. Managers always seem like you are bothering them. Only reason I like macys is I pick up shifts when I want to, hours aren't always scheduled. You don't really deal with managers to pick up hours or to give hours away. All done online."
good,"The kids floor is the worst. Avoid at all cost.  Management are hard to work with they talk down on you, some training are redundant, and customers are horrid. co-workers are ok, unless you get the ones that dont want to work or the ones who suck up to get easier assignments."
good,As a Macy's Merchandiser we were responsible for the visual setup of certain departments. We were also responsible for updating markdowns of the merchandise daily.
good,"no job security for seasonal employees and pay was only minimum wage"
good,I love working at Macys but the pay isn't getting me by I can't continue working there and not getting a raise
good,"It is okay to work at Macy's. However, in my personal opinion, from experience a day at Macy's can drag if there are barely any customers. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I felt that the pay was good, but the management was not very helpful with making a flexible schedule."
good,"The training wasn't great, nor were most of the employees and managers that worked there. They were all there for themselves, would not help the seasonal employees and when they had to, they did it rudely.  Management was too stressed and didn't look towards any of your concerns.  Not a great environment and is very hectic. Pay isn't great and advancement isn't really an option. Scheduling, especially if you are a college student, is great."
good,"Enjoyed co-workers, steady work, inconsistent schedule, low pay, great customers"
good,I worked on the dock part time for a few months. The work was repetitive and my direct supervisor seemed pretty cold. I was sent to help at the furniture store a few times and the experience there was much better. Upper management seemed very nice and professional. So did the sales people and some of the dock workers.
good,I enjoyed working for Macy's the first time when I was a seasonal employee. but when I became permanent I saw a lot of things that I did not like. there was no room for advancement and no great benefits
good,"A typical day at work is far from typical, my hours are not set and my schedule can change at anytime without my notice unless i were to check daily online what the schedule was, but i would either be at one extreme or the other opening most days or closing. Commission based sales are just not my thing, i would've rather worked in clothes or jewelry and i told them that based on the snobbery and stealing of customers that goes on in the work place. When i was hired i was requesting that a week from March 30th to April 7th was the only week i needed off for awhile to pursue my college experience and have the ability to know what i needed so that i could go. Not only did they fight me for it but they hired me knowing that date as well as cut off the length of the week off and have an opening shift waiting for me the next day knowing a three hour drive was in that vacation time to come and go. Management in that area wasn't very good as well. My co workers on the other hand seem to enjoy taking customers from each other and yet the manager sees this hears this and thinks nothing is happening. The hardest part about the job was the whole mess of problems i mentioned as well as the lack of communication with customers. either we didnt speak their language or they didnt speak ours and we have employees who speak three languages. the most enjoyable part of this job has yet to happen, other than the customers being satisfied with the purchases i see no reason to stay if its not something i like."
good,The jewelry and accessories department was a large area to cover.Long term co-workers refused to share in overall responsibilities. Department manager was never seen in the department. I enjoyed being busy and helping customers but was often overwhelmed due to lack of support.
good,Great as a part-time job - greet customers and make a connection offering advice and inspirations to buy. Management is fun; co-workers nice. Can be difficult to meet some of the loftier sales goals - scorecards are used to track performance.
good,macys is a very busy place but once you have the right friends that do they work it make it fun.
good,A typical day at work would be to clock in and out and find out my tasks for the day.
good,"the people are pretty nice but it gets pretty boring and irritating quickly, not much room to grow and the schedule and hours suck unless you play favorites."
good,"Understaffed, expected to train self, job threatened due to weak leadership."
good,Working with the customers is the most enjoyable part of the job...
good,"rotating working hours,not enough and permanent control on schedule,hard to get out of unwanted shifts,wages are minimum,coworkers are mean,environment is mostly stressful.management is good"
good,Woman shoes sales person is typically very flexible. My typical day was to attend to an average of 3-5 ladies per a 15 minute interval. I learned that you must be attentive each and all customers.
good,I worked in many different departments (floater)
good,"Dealing with the customers was a great, I also enjoyed working with my co-workers, everyone worked as a team to get things done. Management (manager and store manager) did not know how to communicate well with their employers, often rude and sarcastic. They did not really care about their employers, but working with the customers and fellow co-workers made it more comfortable for my time i have spent there. Management didn't know why sales weren't adding up, we had a lot of people returning non Macys items due to our return anything policy. The pay was not good at all"
good,A typical day at work would usually start off when I walk into work I see a huge pile of clothes that need to be put up. If I am alone I have to call a manager to have them bring someone over to help me. My managers are kind and when you call them for help they get to you as fast as possible. My co-workers are friendly and willing to help me finish my duties that I sometimes cannot finish on my own. I learned to be nice to customers even when they are rude and uncooperative. The hardest part of my job would be trying to keep up with keeping fitting rooms cleaned out and all the clothes put away before I leave. The most enjoyable part would be working with some of my friends because they help me put all my things away and we have a good time doing it.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A typical day at work for me would be: I clock in, and start right away doing recovery with the clothes, putting them back in the right places or where they belong, ive learned atthis job that no matter what kind of day you have that you always have to be polite, speak and keep a smile on your face. My manager isn't that very good at managing she doesnt speak with us on regular, she does her own thing, never takes time to evauate us, or help us grow in the company. Co-workers are nice very sweet and easy to get along with."
good,"its a good place to work out of high school, not a good career, and the management sucks, all they care about is you opening up cards and there is no room for advancement."
good,They make you work late n lil pay no hours... This job sucked... The place do not value customer service at all. the supervision talks about each other behind their back...
good,keeping you department neat may be the only hardest part of working here.
good,"very low pay and very low quality in jewelry and designers . Good work schedule flexible, benefits not very good. Bad management!"
good,"Working at Macy's was enjoyable, majority of the time. Any job is going to have it's ups and downs but it is really up to the employe to be the bigger person in some situations. I learned to have more patience with people that can sometimes be misunderstood. Management was not that great at the place I worked at, they were not fair in when it comes to some situations. The wasn't a hard part really when it comes to working retail besides having to deal with hard customers, but as long as you get what needs to be done I was okay. Enjoyable part my job was making people happy with the things I help them find, even when they weren't looking for that exact thing."
good,"I loved working at Macy's. The customers and the employees were so pleasant. The work environment is definitely top class, it was an overall great experience"
good,"Macys was an okay place to work however, it was boring at times. i did like the location in Herald Square because you got to meet many different people."
good,It is hard to get along with the office management. Very political office.
good,"it is a busy time in seasonal, be a cashier just must have a patience with the customers, help customers, credit card sales"
good,"Busy working with customers and talking to them. my co-workers were very helpful and fun to work with, The hardest part of the job was when it was slow, and we had nothing to do,"
good,"I loved working at Macys because I am a frequent shopper there. Once I started working there, I was instantly in a fast pace environment. But It was fun because you seen famous people come in and shop."
good,Meeting new people
good,"When the holidays come around, they don't care if you have a job or not. They are so quick to let you go for reasons that was beyond your control."
good,A seasonal position. Learned cashiering and customer service.
good,Great place to meet people
good,loved the people that i worked with but it was not worth the money
good,"Macys is a great company to work for, I have learned many things about products and services from a business and consumer aspect. A typical day at work is fun and exciting because you never know what your day is going to be about working in retail. The hardest part of my job is not being able to assist a consumer when it is a important engagement happening, and I may not have what the consumer is looking for."
good,"A typical day at work I go in & revise the Coach section of handbags and restock what was sold the previous day. I've learned how to help costumers more and help them with choices that they make. Some of the management could use a bit more help in the communication area. My co-workers are all nice people, we always try to help one another as much as possible. The hardest part of the job is when the department is short of staff on a busy day. Accommodating the costumers is the first priority & also trying to keep the department fixed so it is easier for the costumers to shop. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get new stock and i get to see all the new items we have gotten. Also when i get to redo the displays for the Coach department."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Assisting customers and completing transactions.
good,Macy's is a great Company for me to if I would explain a typical day was okay. The only bad experience my general manager is hard to understood responsability family. most of the manarger understand better.
good,Worked during the holiday. it was great experience great co workers
good,A typical day consists of producing results of sales and credit through coaching sales associates.
good,I enjoyed my stay as a seasonal sales associate because I made a lot of friends there. I really like the associate discount that you can use even on sale items. I had a good time ringing up customers and directing them to other areas of the store. I did not like that there was no opportunity for advancement or permanent hire. I also didnt not like that I had to give my hard earned sales to the permanent employees. The hardest part was standing all day when it was slow and when I had to work in other departments I was very unfamiliar with. I also would have just appreciated one manager instead of several telling me to do different things all day that sometimes contradicted each other.
good,Very busy during the holiday's. Can get a bit unorganized. But you can meet some great people there.
good,"Macy's is always more busier than other retail stores. I have learned so many things over here specially customer assistance. The management is also good. But the best attraction over here is my co workers , who are very helpful and supportive. It feels like a family when we come to workplace and it will encourage everyone to give their best. Even though the hardest part of the job is to maintain balance between customers and management's expectation. It's hard to make the sales goal every time which effects individuals' scorecard. Also the pay rate is really not that good. But most enjoyable part of this job is making customer happy and their appreciation."
good,cause of schedule that make it not a great place . every week is a new schedule can not manage your life .
good,Typical day: busy and messy during a sale event...What I learned: women consider buying high-heeled shoes extremely critical...Management: inconsistent decision-making amongst them...The hardest part: being yelled at by customers through no fault of my own...The most enjoyable part: being with my co-workers and making my customers smile everyday.
good,Assisted customers with their selections in the woman department. Process sales completion transactions for customers. Restock inventory on racks and replace out of place items back to their original racks
good,My day at work always depends on the customers. Ive learned that you can't please everyone but I still enjoy my job for the simple fact that I'm surrounded by a lot of people who share the same common interest. My co-workers are very competitive but I don't let that bother me since we all have a goal to make. The most enjoyable part of the job is the discounts and not being tied down.
good,-Typical day was a short shift
good,"A great fun fast paced enviorment,can be challenging. Ilearned how to be patient and provide great customer service."
good,"I've worked here for two years now and I'd say its overall enjoyable working here, but I do not get enough hours."
good,Great place to start working. What i did learn here was how to communicate with people.
good,"I come in a start my day as as cashier. I was a assistant customer sales assistant. My co-workers were easily to get along with most of the time, The hardest part of my job was finding a balance between home and my job, There is a lot of stress. I enjoyed working with people, especially the older people who came in to shop."
good,"Worked in ladies shoes stock room, on merch. team, and in mens department"
good,"had good hours, no benefits were offered. the staff was good and friendly and fun. the manager was ok. the organization and communication could have been better."
good,"A typical day at work would be a daily reminder to open up a macys credit account, make your sales goal and always greet the customer."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macy's is a Great Company to work for, I didn't really have any problem's with Macy's, My only reason for leaving is, mine and other workers hours were cut, other then that, Macy's is a great Company to work for."
good,In the retail industry in the condition of online ordering - brick mortar for Macy’s is in a permanent restructuring and constant movement or displacement of jobs in a continuous fashion!!
good,"No cuentan con suficiente personal para cumplir a cabalidad con las actividades designadas. Pago mínimo y sin incremento, al menos que la ley laboral así lo indique."
good,"This job is demanding. Overworked and underpaid. Discount is the same as anyone with a Macy’s credit card. Management sucks. The hours are crazy, if you are flex, then just quit, no benefits or respect for flex associates."
good,"fact paced commission based environment. Unrealistic goals, and peers competitive and aggressive when it comes to upselling due to commission based environment."
good,Nice place to work. Great coworkers. They are the hardest working team players I've ever known.  The hours are lousy. No benefits whatsoever unless you are full time.
good,If management work with their associate as a team and handle customers with care and understanding this company can be great . if we work as a team there are no limits to where this campany can go
good,"some coworkers are great, they make it easy for you to enjoy your shift but management sucks! too much favoritism. some off the managers are so lazy and disrespectful."
good,"I didn't work there long.  Only a year and a half.  The pay was very low per hour, but I did learn an new industry.  I only took the job to get experience in sales, not for the pay, because this was a second job for me at the time."
good,The pay is not great for the amount of work you put in. The hours for regular employees are hard to come by. It took me a while to start getting hours.
good,It started out great but after a year of busting my butt and learning everything i can so i can work anywhere. I still have a hard time getting hours in the off seasons.
good,"Typical day would be cleaning the floor of clothes, checking fitting rooms, replacing clothes, fulfillment, and getting credit card sales."
good,Macy's was fun to work for. Had my hands on everything in the store. But Macy's is more concerned about the customers and not on there employees. They have benefits and flexible hours
good,"Macys as a whole, doesn't pay that well. As manager to executive roles, there's less work-life balance. As an associate, scheduling is more flexible and they receive comission."
good,I dont feel they give ample opportunity for more seasonal to become fulltime. The inadequate training for departments when work slows down in regular department..
good,"Macy's is like a revolving door. people come in and get some work experience and then they leave or are fired. Depending on the type of job you get, you'll have to above and beyond to please everyone."
good,They dont really have a lot of hours to give. Good job if you want to work 10 hours every other week. Management is good. Co workers are easy to get along with.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The job is good for someone who is looking for a flexible job, but the pay is low. There is not a lot of benefits for the position I was in, which was a Flex for the Cosmetic department"
good,Have favoritism to some of there employees on over time. An organized in certain Departments. Scheduling employees time to work without letting them know that their schedule have changed.
good,Well working at Macy’s I was also still in school being a cashier at Macy’s was a bit difficult only because we were so low on employee’s the mangers weren’t very helpful or organized
good,My time working at Macy’s I worked many hours and quickly learned the many responsibilities of working in a retail environment with the help of managers.
good,The pay wasn’t satisfactory. The management wasn’t aware of the schedules that they set. They continuously mess up my work schedule and pay at time. The customer service wasn’t always good. But I made it good with my customer service.
good,I enjoyed working at Macys as a first job. I gained a lot of experience and the job taught me a lot of patience. It definitely taught me a great deal about the fashion world and how to provide outstanding customer service.
good,I worked there for 2 months and it was far away and after school started I stopped working there. I was helping people find what they needed for wearing and than sold it .
good,Executive Office staff is minimal so there is no one available to onboard/train new EO employees although responsibilities are numerous and time sensitive.
good,"Macy's is a very fast faced environment to work at and can be very rewarding for a self-driven and motivated individual. The hours can be flexible depending on your role and ranking. "
good,It was a long time standing up and when you did get a break it felt like it went by so fast but the 11 hour shifts were probably the worst part of it all
good,"Manage large amounts of inbound and outbound calls in a timely manner"
good,"Macy's can be a bit disorganized at times. they are really only interested in getting credit cards and sales, but i worked with some really nice people, but also with some not so great people."
good,Its not bad for something part time. Nice coworkers sometimes . Every weekpay pretty jice depending what department! Nice hours. Mangers ok. Clean working environment
good,"If you don't mind working weekends and holidays, then this is the job for you. That is about the only part I did not enjoy, working holidays and weekends."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the work I did, however, the hours got rough (started at 3am) after awhile (plus I was working another full time job)."
good,"To competitive and to"
good,"a typical day at work , your team member is very annoyed of each other. I learned that most customers have a different noise for men fragrance , and people do not give you a chance to give their interest , Management was actually the BEST part of work (my onion) but HR and supervisors does not give you a chance as a African american , unless your homosexual .Most enjoyable part of Macy's men fragrance are opening Women mind to purchasing the right scent for their Husband"
good,"Most of the managers were very nice and understanding. However, there was one manager that was very stressful to work with. Not the best experience of management in that work space."
good,Felt good to work here and help customers and loved how they didn’t worry about overtime but management was not what I expected. I felt out of place and too many bosses and less time to know people at work. Just didn’t feel like I belonged.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Retail job. Nothing special. Managers acted like they were in high school social club. They once told us they were going to be giving us dinner for working on thanksgiving and it was seriously “make your own grilled cheese” with like the cheapest American singles and Costco white bead.
good,"It is ok to work here. The only thing I like about it is the discounts, paid training and paid time off. I really don't have anything else to say. It is and ok place of work."
good,Macy's was my first job and they thought me how to be responsible and consistent on doing a good job at work. I learned many skills from different people who work there.
good,Good job for gap year and for high school and college students. The Job had weird hours and had little human contact. It almost feels like this job can be done more efficient by machines and with fewer people.
good,i started as a seasonal receiver but i was lucky to get 3 or 4 hours a hour. my boss was very nice and friendly but i didnt get enough hours to make the drive work it
good,"I am a recieving associate its quick paced , and lots of different tasks to do. Such as putting boxes on the line when unloading trucks, or tagging items of great value. Not much hours though because you only work when there is a truck."
good,Macy's is a great company to jump start your career or if you are a student looking for temporary to short term employment. the hours are retail hours so expect to work weekends and holidays.
good,"Management is reliable sometimes. The coworkers are great it can be a stressful environment dealing with customers and your daily tasks, just learn to be flexible and you’ll adapt. It can be slow so be prepared for anything."
good,"Working in the Receiving Department becomes stressful after a long period of time being there, a lot of different packages comes in for Macy's Backstage making the department look and become unorganized to work around."
good,"Merchandising is fun for the early birds who like to get to work at 5 in the am, management is great. The team leads or supervisors were not as wonderful, unfortunately. Maybe they had too much to complete and took it out on the workers who didn't work fast enough. Expect to work weird hours during the holiday season (that's retail for you). Employee discounts are alright and as a merchandiser, you know what items go on sale that day and purchase right after your shift."
good,"Nothing fantastic to write home about. There is no accountability,  no consequences for not abiding  by the rules, policies and procedures. Some of the supervisors and trainers are consistent in what they say and do. But there is so much they cannot do as well."
good,"Management at the Macy's that I worked in Quakerbridge Mall was the worst, they are only for you when you can fill their schedule as need to cover their hours, they were a bunch of temperamental jerks, who only cared about looking good to their bosses, they never really cared about the employees that would busy there butts to help them look good, the most horrible banbunch.b of"
good,The managers were respectful. The pay isn’t that great. There are no good benefits. You have daily goals to meet. But the work environment is pretty good
good,I enjoyed my time at Macy's learned a lot. I leaned about online shopping/shipping.  Loved being there during the holiday season.  Loved shopping there as well.
good,It’s a ok place to work. Has high turnover rates. It’s hard to tell how far you are able to move up with this company. Would tell anyone it can be stressful at times but still a great entry level job.
good,"It is an amazing experience at may's and  you will get to know what is real customer services and you can learning through wile your working and best place to work with different kind of people ."
good,"( I worked at cosmetics, first 3 months Lancôme, the other last 3 months CLINIQUE) You love sales and are great at it , go for it. You goof working more people for most of your shift, at least 2 more co-workers.  You don’t mind culture diversity , at work  , and with customers. ( I worked at cosmetics department)  i only work there 6 months, they paid was very low for me.  I asked for raise , but no luck."
good,"Fast-paced, management really pushes to make sure you meet goals and offers overtime if needed but is optional. Coworkers are nice, a lot is expected of leads and must make sure floor is up to par when Upper Management does walk thru."
good,"I would choose Macy's again if personal circumstances had been different. Excellent benefits, opportunity for growth, however workplace culture really needs change. Most enjoyable part of job was helping customers find that perfect piece of jewelry that would compliment any outfit and occasion and making suggestions accordingly."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Overall, Macy's is a good  place to start and the schedule is verrrrry flexible. Also if you are a good sales person, you get rewarded with incentives to encourage you to do more."
good,"I worked at a Macy's in a small town mall and it was run horribly, the machines used for training were in better condition than the ones on floor, many even had pieces missing or broken. Each department was in need of major assistance and had minimal amount of accessible staff on call, managers would go home early and not respond when onsite until a situation has escalated.  The only saving grace for that workplace was the fellow coworkers who were personable and kind hearted."
good,"They'll hire you with a base salary. If you are assigned a commission area, there is a daily sales quota given for the day. If you do not meet your sales quota remainder is carried over to next day along with new quota. If an item is returned you're in the negatives. Is given on what is sold after you meet unreasonable quotas of 2,045 shoes a day. If quotas not met, difference will come out of your paycheck. Technically you pay them to work there."
good,"A typical day at Macy’s will start at 9:30am non stop selling, cashing out customers, cleaning the fitting room, looking for online orders, fixing clothing racks ,answering and helping customers, bringing out merchandises on the floor and measuring customers for alterations with one hour break. Management is very demanding. The hardest part is standing all day. I don’t like the fact that I have to work every weekend and with customers purchasing mostly online ther is no hours and eve thing changed in the store"
good,"It seems they restructure everything once a year and it usually involves making one person do the job of 20 and calling it a challenge for growth.  The people are all great and support you as much as they can, however all matters seem to be urgent and as important as the next so everything is very stressful"
good,"When I submitted my online application to Macy’s through a somewhat confusing process, I was contacted within the week and was told to come on in for an interview and I was able to pick the times I was available. With an underwhelming interview in which I was dressed almost too perfect for, I got the job after being asked two questions and was prepared to start as soon as possible which was the same day. I trained that day then the next day I trained a little more even though I’d completed all of it the day prior since I stayed late. Once I was on the floor after being hired the day before, I was nervous but confident none the less since there were two superiors at my station with great knowledge of everything fragrance wise. Little did I know that I was walking into a storm of drama and treachery and childish and motivated actions at the expense of me and my coworkers since our section was looked down on the most. No where else in the store was there any problems. I worked in the men’s section and that was the quietest day at work I’d ever seen. But I still miss it, my bosses were the best and they deserve nothing short of the best in life."
good,I loved the table top assistant manager-I enjoyed the customers and doing display work-I went back to my field when I was told I was going to manager Juniors department
good,"Good for a few hours but inconsistent with hours available. It is a large company so the bigs at the top don’t care about you.  The local management can be nice and the staff can be friendly but as far as rules and policies go, there is no wiggle room. The raises and reviews don’t actually reflect your personal contribution so even if you work Hard, you can still get a poor raise while a lazy person might get a better raise. Just the way it goes. When you need hours, they may have none for you. When they need shifts filled, you are expected to be there."
good,"It was a nice job, just tireding and slightly boring doing the same thing over and over but I would not mind working there again. There's very nice people and its laid back."
good,"The store I work at is poorly managed. Lack of communication. Managers are trying to get the more experienced hard working employees out and replacing them with employees who do next to nothing, and wonder why the stores a mess."
good,"I enjoyed working at Macys in the Vintage Fair Mall in Modesto, CA because I've never worked in Retail before and it was a new and entertaining experience."
good,Great place for a part time job. Would not suggest career building here. Didn't seem like the long time employees were very happy. I did enjoy my freedom working here.
good,the job as a whole is good because you get to make your own hours online so its kinda like u make your own check pay was ok but certain workers in different areas wasn't following rules whenit came to there station then when you report to hr... theres always one that just likes to sit and eat all day .. one that cant stay out the mirror and they act as if they are better then you..
good,"i love how easy my job is and how the managers do not over work you. i do deal with social anxiety so some days can be tough for me to just simply communicate with people but i do push myself to communicate. the workplace is very welcoming and gives off positive vibes. i believe the security is needed more and i believe we need to have more than 3 associates working on one floor (mens,kids and home) one weekends which are the busiest. i do not like the fact that i am obligated to work every single weekend because i am busy on weekends and most of the time i will not be available."
good,"Supervise operations of cosmetic line, recruit, train, coach, and develop new associates. Department productivity and  sales goals are met on a daily basis. Communicate with vendors and distributors."
good,"The most enjoyable part about working at macy's is the scheduling. It was very convenient when I was going to school. They also pay a little bit higher minimum wage where I'm from. As for cons, i felt that it was hard to advance or get promoted at macy's, coming from someone who has been with the company for 6+ years."
good,If your a fresh new teen wanting to start a job and don’t understand what to do in the sales associate field this is the job for you. Focus on your goal and get your money.
good,My hours were based on how many online orders or when the delivery truck was scheduled to stop by the store. Some weeks I would work a decent set of hours such as 20ish but other weeks I would work around 12 hours give or take. Majority of my time I questioned what I was doing and felt like I was not doing the job the way they wanted to even though I followed instructions. The days felt long and unorganized.
good,Hit the ground running to get the new merchandise to the floor with a time limit set per rack.  Move fixtures and merchandise to make room for new merchandise.  The hardest thing about this job is the time limits when you need to make a substantial amount of room for new merchandise and floor moves that are physically demanding that usually take place overnight.  The best part is getting off in the late morning or early afternoon.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I really did not like pushing Credit Cards on people and felt that the company pushed far to hard and the pay left me stressed out about my finances all the time.  Health insurance was great.
good,"I started working at the warehouse as a seasonal worker and I was told that if I performed well I would be awarded more hours and a possible full-time position. "
good,"Co-workers are fun, the environment not so much. Over time I think that you start seeing the actual truth behind the managers and it is not so great. I thank Macy's because it helped me out a lot, but will not miss it. I will miss my co-workers."
good,"not bad, not great. all depending on the team you work for."
good,"Coming from Europe I see the US has a lot less benefits from a corporate point of view.  In the UK, most companies offer employees as standard 20 days of paid annual leave.  "
good,"Decent part-time job when student looking for some extra money and a place to gain customer service experience. Management emphasized Macy's cards and other promotions so it could get overwhelming for both sales associate and customer. Hardest part of job was keeping up with cleaning and organizing the floor, clearing the dressing rooms and register."
good,There were many narratives in the store that were far beyond work that made me feel like I was back in school. I also could feel the pressure management was feeling daily through the morning routines & debriefing.
good,"its kinda a meh place to work. It's good if your trying to change up your outfits due to the discount, but other then that, it is nothing special. my issue is that the job gets stale very quickly. Most of the people are good. Management is overworked, but competent. not a bad job, just don't use it for a career."
good,co workers were pleasant to work with. managers were constantly asking employees about credit and sales. one issue I felt was managers trying to talk to employees on the sales floor about concerns instead of in private. enjoyable customers and great energy from co workers
good,I love my job at Macys in the MCCS center. However it seems that there are many good employees who never get a chance to move up in the company. There are some managers not many who show favoritism and the people who often get promoted are their favorites.
good,"I had a good work experience with the company. It only "
good,"As much as I loved my coworkers I had to leave Macy's. They do not pay well for the average employee and I had worked there for almost 5 years and was still not in the double digits and I was a very hard worker. Also, sometimes the coupons can cause conflict between associate, managers, and customers."
good,At first I enjoyed working there but it seems that the managers couldn't control the employees and the employees had problems amongst each other that conflicted with the word so it made working hard to get done
good,There is no room for growth and the sales are attainable but the credit card goals are not. They push open credit cards so much that they forget customer service is important.
good,"Clock in, star talk (5-10 minute meetings), work, break, work, clock out. Learned a lot because I paid attention. Management is good but could be better at getting things done (procrastination). Workplace culture can get real toxic real fast if you make friends. Tough work, decent break times."
good,N/A I didn't work with the company long enough to give much feed back. I worked there as a seasonal worker. I enjoyed working there and meeting different kind of customers from around the world. I didn't like that they had a daily sales gold and if there was a return the next day you where in a negative for you gold. as well as you had to fight for you schedule it might be different now.
good,"Working at Macy's was both a great and bad experience. Great by learning more about yourself and advancing yourself with better customer service, knowledge on products, and learning new skills in makeup/skincare application. However, management is very demanding and goals that are set are usually unrealistic. Work environment becomes negative with certain employees complaining or gossiping majority of the time. Coworkers are bias on customers' outside appearance whether they look ""rich"" or ""poor."" Making phone calls to customers for pre-orders, ""gift season"" was probably the worst and most stressful part of the job."
good,It is a very fun exciting place to work. I learned about improving customer service skills. Culture through meeting coworkers from all over the world taught me more about making a better shopping experience.
good,i would not let others know about this company they don't work with you on hours.the job is very stressful and demanding.don't really train you very good
good,not a bad company to work for but it's retail so the hours were long and the pay was poor. There were no benefits either. The best perk was the employee discount
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I call Macy’s a DIY job because when I worked here I really felt like no one helps you out. It’s basically a do it yourself / figure it out job lol . Sure they train you in the back for a few hours but they called me in to work about a week after training so I kind of had to figure it out all over again on my own. The communication is terrible as well, I would have customers get angry with me because I was unaware of the sales we had that day but these aren’t things we get told when we walk in to our shifts.  Managers were rude and quick to complain about employees but would never help deparments out where it’s needed. I was also told I could pick up more hours if I wanted to using their online system but when I tried to do so I was unable to do so! After I got the job and logged in to Macy’s online system, they had only scheduled me 6 shifts for the span of 3 months and if I wanted any more I would have to hope they call me in or try  to see if anyone was advertising a shift online which was rare."
good,I had some really good days and enjoyed the job and then there was definitely some days I didn’t want to be there because it was back to back calls and complaints.
good,"I worked as a cashier for the holiday. I was not stated clearly how long my contract was for. I just knew I would be there for the holiday season. In addition to that, the store had poor management."
good,"Macy's is great stepping stone, but not a place I could see myself working for longer than 5 years. I don't believe they give you enough opportunities to become part of the management team, nor do they offer many opportunities to foster different talents by giving you the chance to try different departments. There's not much floor support and unfortunately the stores become understaffed once the holiday season is passed and it becomes difficult to assist your coworkers or for your coworkers to assist you. I like how they set up the schedules and that you can give away shifts or pick up shifts in other departments (within certain parameters). Overall, if you're looking for retail experience, or extra income, I believe Macy's is an ok place to work."
good,"It was a good first job. The schedule was flexible. My usual routine consisted of me packaging items and shipping them out to the customers. At times, I was required to go to the front of the store to help out."
good,I enjoyed my seasonal job at Macy's.  I did not enjoy the other departments that would frown on you if you assisted a guest with a purchase that they felt they should get commission for since the item was from their department.  I did really like assisting guests with their purchases.
good,"cool place to work especially at herald square. fast paced, exciting. stressful with tourists and rude customers. other locations are slower.  ok pay. retail sucks during the holidays."
good,"This role has taught me the importance of management style in my everyday work. I currently have a boss that does not support career development and is very hard to personally vibe with. I would say my role is half Assistant buyer (reporting, financial management, assortment management and cross-functional collaboration) and the other half is team psychology (i.e. learning how to move with a manager that has an inconsistent and poor attitude). The culture at Macy's is very easy going, but also hard-working and pointed. The work hours are consistent (9am-5/6pm), but we have a lot of options to be flexible with that or work from home."
good,Scheduling was days and nights mixed so was somewhat tough for work life balance.  Management is was always very friendly and there are management programs also.
good,"Macys was a great environment to work in. The pay was low but once the new parking lot was built, everyone's hours went down. Jobs were cut down and employees were terminated."
good,"This is my second job and it is okay for now. "
good,typical day would be meeting your metrics coaching you associates to meet them daily. giving recognition is big part celebrating the associate is a must. dealing with customers needs and issues daily so more easy then others. making the environment a great customer experience. meetings daily about twice a day going over metrics and goals and coming up with a game plan if not meeting goals
good,i only worked seasonal here for the holidays so on that time there were no benefits for part time employees i do not know now. the fun thing there is only something to do there
good,I enjoy the people that work here.  It does get really hot in the warehouse and cold too.  Tough work.  Have to have the ability to keep moving and lift over 50lbs
good,You had to be very competitive with sales when it came to making sales vs. other employees. Many of the associates that worked there a long time would be very rude in order to reach their goals even though it is no longer commission based. The pay was decent when I started but the lack of raises made me realize I needed to move on to a more permanent career.
good,working there was fun because the other employees made it a great place to work. Management was poor. not engaging. No room for growth or   promotion.
good,"Macy's offered a computerized system to maintain clientele, this made it easier to identify customer needs.  There were few opportunities to cross sell,  which often made for slow paced days other than at holiday time.  I felt they could improve on cleanliness at the cosmetic counters."
good,i  liked working  there cute it was easy didn't  have to deal with  anyone i  enjoy working  over there i  loved it  there was  nothing hard working  over
good,I liked working with different types of people and customers. Always upsale items to make higher commission. Although I didn't like when I was asked to lie about a price tag being on sale when the night before they raised the prices and pretended to be on sale next day.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,It was seasonal work for the holidays. Fun working environment and staff. But felt management wasn't all that great at times.Would like to have been able work longer hours.
good,They'er  unstable right now so you never know when your job will get eliminated so you always wondering because every year for the last five years they been cutting jobs .
good,"Overall in terms of training and advancement Macy's is a great place to be at, although it depends of what store you work at and your management. There is your occasional favoritism when it come to promotions and just your everyday life at work."
good,Great work environment very flexible and the culture is great> I love interacting with customers and learning new departments.  great place to work...
good,"Fine for a summer job. Short hours but once they start calling you, they don't stop so there is plenty of opportunity to make extra cash. Be prepared to do a lot of walking."
good,The job I had was getting the sales signed - usually 2-3 days and usually needs to be done before the store opens. A typical shift was 5am-9-am. The hardest part of this job was getting the signs done on time when the scanner would go offline. Also a very repetitive job as you usually only work in one area.
good,"Steady place to work at, with slow paced rhythm. A lot of customer interactions an engagements. Great customer intend. Attend fitting rooms and lead with great customer service. Although not enough career advancement."
good,"Don't get me wrong. Working with laid back and upbeat managers/employees made working there a blast. But then the hours started getting shorter and shorter. Even though It's up to us to pick up the shifts, When I get on their website to pick up shifts... There weren't any hours. Now I'm practicly getting nothing/ hearing nothing from them"
good,Working here was thought because I wasn’t use to waking up so early in the morning so that made it difficult and the managers wasn’t always realistic which made being a supervisor difficult
good,i was on my feet all day but felt like break time wasn't enough especially because i worked for 10 hours and was on my feet all day. Its not fair that we only get 8 days off sick time per year
good,"I go to work and people are cranky from getting to work so early. There is barely any one that speaks English at the plant, so it is hard to communicate with people. I found some friends that speak English and are friendly, so it makes the 12 hour shift go by quickly. It is not an enjoyable place to work."
good,macys was was okay job but it made me want to go back to school and become something more with my life. so i went to school to become a phlebotomist thankyou Macys for the oppurtunity and experience
good,I liked working as a mercandise manger for years at Macy's.  I worked 50 hours minimum a week for years and it as not a good life/work balance.  Overall I think it's a goodcompany.
good,"Could have been better if the managers hadn't switched around. In the end you must remember you are just an asset so if you do not help the company they will cut you loose. If you have any questions or doubts get the manager or supervisor to do something, especially with discounts and harder to handle customers. Don't lost your job over those things."
good,It was definitely a fast-paced job that required to learn quickly. The pay was rather good and easy to pick your hours and shifts. The program they have is very efficient and modern.
good,"even though i felt mistreated it’s not a bad job at all besides management the coworkers were all very nice and team oriented, and the customers were most of the time cooperative"
good,I like interacting with the customers and working with other team members. It can be very stressful at times when it is extremely busy. Their benefits are great but their management can be better.
good,"Most hiring for seasonal work. Mgmt wont learn your name. All about numbers. Lack of training progam. Cant bring in your own bags. High turnover rate. Lots of repetition. Don't get paid for staying 10min late or clocking in early. Some departments are better than others. Only 10 hour shifts available. I felt I was given an unfair opportunity and had to change shifts. Way too much security. Must know the right people to get a good department."
good,"Don't expect to pay a bill with Macy's but you can eat , the hours are varied, so you can work around your schedule if you have better things to do. You will enjoy and hate your job in the same hour, just depends on you."
good,Macys gives their managers a lot of training . They have online courses that you can take to improve your management skills. The hardest part of the job is that Macys does not give Holidays off to be with family.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I've worked with Macy's over 4 years. I worked there while in school. It has its ups, but mainly downs. Pay, raises, promotions and management went down hill every year. The only good thing about working there was meeting some good people."
good,"The job was extremely competitive with other sales associates."
good,"I was a shoes sales person. It was a okay job while in college doing my undergrad. I learned to be more approachable, honest and aware of myself when helping others. The culture of Macy's was okay, wasn't a place that I seen myself long-term. Some of the most enjoyable times interacting with customers."
good,"It was always busy plus being a loud environment to get use too. I Learned how to interact  with people from different countries, even when hard to understand. I believe that part was mainly the toughest thing about Macy's."
good,"I was hired as a seasonal employee and made the cut to come on permanently. It's Been 7 months since the season ended in December. Overtime has opened one time this year. I've learned that this is a cheap company, with an Extremely high turn over rate. It almost seems like it's a company policy to push the employees to their limits so they can hire new people and pay them less. Macys offers discounts and plenty of benefits however actually receiving them is the problem. The rest goes on depending of the managers. In this warehouse advancement goes off who you know versus what you can actually accomplish as an employee. Every once in a while Macys will pay for our lunches, and hold events which are great. Macys shifts are great day shift (7am - 5:30 PM M-Th) weekend (6am - 6pm F-Sun) and nights (7pm -5:30 am Sun-Thu) Most employees have 2 jobs. Macys is a great company during the season but coming on permanently you learn a little more about this place. I recommend to come into this company and learn EVERYTHING you can to take with you to a better job."
good,"During my time at Macy's it was a very busy workflow. Always had something to do, there was never a slow day. Although there was a period I was injured on the job and I reported it as soon as it happened. I was sent home and was told to see a doctor and get there opinion. I did as they said and the doctor said not to return to work for a week. I communicated this with Macy's and upon my return to work I was informed that I was receiving points on my record for my days off which was against there policy. Points on your record leads to termination."
good,My regular day at work was that I clock in and get straight to work. We would get 30 min breaks and we go back to work. My co-workers were fun people .
good,"as I said...I havent worked there for several years...things have probably changed one way or another..."
good,"not bad overall, just apply for a diff positionn if  alot of constant physical labor is not for you. I did not mind so much, it helps keep in shape too"
good,I worked in the retail department. It was a typical retailer with sales goals and the constant pressure to have customers open credit cards. There were no real rewards unless you were willing to steal sales from other employees to constantly surpass your sales goals.
good,"Managers are rude. "
good,"only worked when they needed me.  worked in multiple departments, with alot of wonderful people.  sales are fun,  coupons are great,  work the coupons for the customer."
good,When I worked there it was a temporary job during the holiday season. Work was fast paced and if you are needed elsewhere then the supervisor will send you to another department but then don't really explain how to do the new job
good,When i first started the job it was fun and overall nice place to work. over time new management came in and just basically got rid of the people that came in and did their jobs to save money
good,"Great learning experience would not work there again, helped get me ready for future jobs and strengthen customer service experience. As well as allowing me to work in many different areas of merchandise."
good,Macy's is good at over promising and underdelivering....my position of cosmetics manager did not receive commission due to a complicated situation with someone who previously held my position. Upper management promised to rectify the situation but did not which led to my leaving.
good,Ladies shoes need a class on how commission works employees are talked down to by other higher up employees management sometimes if not all the time doesn't step in when a fellow manager is wrong
good,I worked in beauty and fragrance department. The Chanel offered very prestige cosmetic and perfum for higher class    I provided information about the products and help them to apply all beauty products.
good,"If you like to volunteer, this is the place to work. This is a very enjoyable part of my job and I feel Macy's offers several opportunities through different groups for opportunities."
good,"This is a good place to work if you're looking to grow in to upper management. Good place to gain customer service skills and experience. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The company is losing focus and direction.  It can work better with having consistent and strong leadership in the Executive levels and Store environments.
good,"Most training is completed on a computer upon being hired. Any additional training or desire to learn anything else, it 's best to just ask someone who has been there for a while. When it comes to career advancement it can take some time and afterwards it sometimes just isn't worth it. You have the opportunity to build great relationships with some great people. Management needs a lot of work. There is a major lack in communication and that can hinder your progress when it comes to completing tasks."
good,"I was with this company for many years and given many opportunities to grow. Scheduling used to be easy to do and flexible, however that change dramatically in the last couple years I was there."
good,"I didn't really care for the managers but the coworkers for the most part were good to work with. Work days were set a month before hand, Not very flexible with work hours."
good,"Company undergoes major restructuring yearly, resulting in loss of jobs and change of responsibilities."
good,"Wide assortment of very moderate priced merchandise. Extremely promotional, yet very good values for the customer. Considering the size of the company, fairly good technology."
good,"I worked at the makeup counter and I was ""on-call"" but I got a decent amount of hours because it was summer and people were taking time off. I was pretty young when I started there, it was my first real job, and I worked with a lot of middle-aged women and a couple of girls my age. It was fun to apply makeup to the ladies that would stop by. Management was ok, didn't leave a huge impression on me. The hardest part was probably the long hours of just waiting for customers. It got kind of boring sometimes because most people don't like to approach makeup counters. But overall it was good."
good,It was fun to work with diverse people. Workers were friendly and patient. My manager was great that why I stayed for 6 years. I could work more or devote my life but they didn't raised my salary.
good,"Was responsible for opening and closing store on certain days,also responsible for maintaining store appearance while dealing with customers.Supervisors always came to me for certain jobs because they knew it would be done. Best part of the job was meeting great people."
good,"typical day for .there is not much that I have to say about macys the job was ok but I need more for my life and I want to advance .Macys is down sizing every year , how much advancement is there in a company always downsizing and cutting jobs."
good,didn't enjoy working there plus in the department I work in a commission area always had an fight with one of the associate always want to take your customer when you already took care of them even on his lunch time he wanna help
good,"- poor management "
good,was not fair when it was time for lay offs.  did not take into consideration my time served or my job performance. I went above and beyond to my customers happy and to keep coming back
good,"It was an okay job for it only being a seasonal job, I was working during Christmas so it was kind of crazy busy but it was okay"
good,"selling suits "
good,"I enjoyed meeting some real great people, interacting and conversating. That made my day next to assisting them with what they were looking for.  Knowing what we had and truly listening to what they were seeking, making that match. Perfect."
good,"the Management is good, i would love to stay with Macy's but the pay isn't good for the kind stress involved."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy's is an awesome company to work for. In my location we didn't have very good management so sometimes that can be hard but it was pretty good to people who had been there a long time. Macy's closed when I had only been working there a short time so its hard for me to say whether it was worth working there or not. But I had some pretty amazing co-workers
good,"Really enjoyed Macys, was a pleasure working as a sales associate there whilst going to school. My manager was absolutely terrific. Only several managers whom I knwo I did not like nor did they probably like me either but who cares. Um I feel like Macys was a fun place to work it was never strict or competitive just laid back chill, relaxed type of job. The discounts were insane was really fun to get credits just for the macys money and special discounts on stuff. I still have a watch I got for just $24 and it was a 140 dollar watch just from the discounts and macys money also employee discount. Couldnt beat that. Personally macys was just minimum wage job so id give a con for the pay. But overall experience exciting and fun. Met alot of new people and the men that walked by Lol. Always room for more and fun. Wont mention the horrible customers that do come in though."
good,The store is very productive but management is very clumsy in the store and there is no professionalism shown. Management needs to get their act together before this store runs out of business.
good,"Depending on your status and who you report to.  There are amazing talented leaders that you will be willing to give 200% every day of the week.  Others, not so much.  "
good,"A typical day at Macy's is full of constantly shifting priorities and goals. While the business plan at Macy's is solid, I enjoyed that I knew what needed to be done and how to do it. However, the atmosphere at my store was highly political, and success depended on whether or not you were liked. I had wanted to make Macy's a career, however the powers that be decided not to back me, and I had to go to outside options."
good,"When I worked here as a merchandiser the hours were limited because I was on-call. As a result, I worked less than 10 hrs. a week and at some point I didn't work at all for 3 weeks. The workers are nice and friendly but working here is not the best in terms of hours."
good,The job was fun and fast pace. The job was very interested. Working on sales floor was great especially with cool coworkers. Some members management were pretty cool to work with also.
good,"I was a part time sales associate. I started off with 20 hours per week, ending with 3-4 hours shifts for one or two days. No idea how that all happened. I asked my manager why did this happen, their response was that that's how it is and how i'm not allowed more hours and if i wanted more i had to pick up hours online. I stopped working because i was not making any kind of money and being a student, this did not help at all. My experience was not good here. although i learned a lot, I felt it wasn't fair. I do not think all Macy's are like this, being that they switched my hours drastically without letting me know anything and acted as if nothing happened and did nothing to fix it. I got ridiculous hours, i would have a closing shift and then a morning shift back to back. it's like they did not care about me as an employee while everyone else had the hours they wanted and i was left with making at least 6 hours a week."
good,"Macy's is a great company, but you can tell that leadership positions are taken by people who aren't quiet qualified. "
good,"I've worked in several stores and management is a hit or miss, sometimes you get great people and sometimes they're horrible and the work culture definitely reflects that. Staffing is never very good, a lot of times you end up all alone for half the day on busy days. With all the restructuring going on they have added a lot more responsibilities to the individual associate so being able to multi task is a must. The discount is pretty great though and they're pretty flexible with your schedule so it's beneficial if you're juggling a family or school unless it's during the holidays than they get really strict about people being there."
good,"I like the busy and enthusiastic environment at Macys but management doesn't appreciate and acknowledge good performance, it used too. For 27 years of service I've given my very best ever time I walk inside that store.  "
good,Management isnt very involved. Taughe me the basics of retail and cosmetics. helped me develop my customer service and track my daily progress in sales and goals.
good,"Macy's was a hard working place where everyone needed to know everything. If you didn't, they wouldn't help you and you would be yelled at. Great for part-time, but not good for long time."
good,"A friendly, social environment is promoted. However, inadequate staffing makes it difficult at best to perform at one's fullest potential. Most are overworked and in turn underpaid. Job cuts continue to increase the workload of those still employed. This applies to management as well as sales & support staff. The people are generally happy &  friendly but the lack of support as to policies etc create an environment of workers feeling disenfranchised. Companies cutting from the bottom can not expect a business to thrive when it is not nurtured at the root."
good,The job was normal for any retail job during the holidays most of the managers are lazy but they do have a few great managers. I worked in management and that did become stressful but any entry-level job was normal for the industry.
good,"Fast paced,  ever changing environment. At times expectations felt unrealistic within the staffing levels. Challenging balance with the switch to a more online purchasing climate."
good,Worked with a mix of experienced and constantly overturning new employees. Enjoyed working face to face with customers very much. 
good,employees are all friendly and helpful makes a good work environment. breaks are good u get a short unpaid lunch which i do not like. managers are great they do acknowledged employees and host rallies
good,A typical day at work is almost always the same. Sometimes it is very busy and sometimes very slow. But usually it is in the middle. I have lunch at around noon. But sometimes I don't even get to eat lunch because there is no one to switch with me at the register. I haven't learned that much but I did learn that there will always be nice and mean customers. And I have to be careful about what I say to them. The management is okay. My manager is nice to me. And I am good friends with my co-workers. The culture is meet and greet everyone friendly and professionally
good,Seasonal position. Could be worse. Pay was horrible. schedule was too but it worked for me. Usually worked less than five hours. Lots of walking and lifting.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I used to ring up customers, help them on the sales floor.  the hardest part was when it got really busy.  I like working with people sometimes it can be stressful but not impossible to handle."
good,"I have friendly co-workers. We get a good discount. Sometimes we get more discounts on certain days, and we also get points if we're platinum members."
good,"Focused on improving stock price.  New principal management does not appear to want to listen to current employees on what needs to be changed.  Continual staffing and executive reductions force current employees to be stretched beyond what is considered a reasonable workload.  Change is needed, company has gone away from their focus on people.  Continual staffing reductions leave very little opportunities for advancement.  There are Great, hard-working people that work and support the stores population, but they are unfortunately treated like the red-headed step child.  Hopeful that new management will take notice and listen to ""reality"" and will  create a culture of no BS."
good,I really enjoyed my experience working there but as a single mom need my weekends and Holidays with my kids. And having these days off was really difficult. Retail hours are hard.
good,"I enjoyed working with the public, but some of the managers where very unprofessional.  Christmas time it was very hectic , but was fun to be around all those last minute shoppers"
good,Working here definitely gives you respect for people who work in retail. Fun work environment. During shopping seasons (October- December) lots of hours to work.
good,Macy's Logistics was a good temporary job. They treated their workers with respect and helped them when they needed it. The pay was fair and the starting pay was fair. You had an opportunity to advance up into a manger.
good,"I like to work everywhere evan it`s hard, because I have a interess to learn more things, i`m always happy, and enjoy of everything.I whould like now to start work in differents places  to learn more, to make more expirience"
good,Macy's offered a lot of customer and retail service. They did not however thoroughly over go teaching some of things you needed to know. It was difficult to make hours to work.
good,Great experience. Loved the enviorment and developed great customer service skills. Management could be more sensitive towards seasonal workers but besides that I have no complaints.Served its purpose.
good,Poor team-building. Certain team member help other out and some don't. However good with working productively with in the shifts. Also not a lot of hours and the management is bad.
good,"Every year they cut more and more positions. I was there for exactly a year, and worked in 5 different positions due to them each being cut because of the budget and low sales. It's very stressful and sales driven, and they push that credit card like crazy. I loved the discount though, and my pay was pretty nice for retail."
good,"Great for someone who recently graduated college to gain experience. Hard work is typically rewarded, during the holiday season expect to work long hours."
good,Working for Macys was great.  The other associates were fun to work with.  Management was not fair at all.  The Union was not fair.  Overall it was just a learning experience and time to move on.
good,"(Beauty Department) It was definitely a challenge working in such big company. The team I got to work with was wonderful. Over time, you get to know other associates from different counters or department. Very competitive."
good,"The culture is one of fun and a relaxed setting. On most days this is possible, but during various store events there's generally high tension at all levels."
good,"I met a lot of new people who I became good friends with. Management was okay, there was poor communication. Easy for a first job but it is quick paced."
good,Great staff and i learned so much the first company to give me a chance to advance in it and i learn so much from them macys will always be a great place to start.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Depending on your supervisor, they look out for some and railroad the others. Always cover yourself and don't be so trusting of every one that smiles and comes across friendly."
good,"The people are what make Macy's. Great collaborators, kind, hardworking, and innovative. Expect changes to keep up with the fast paced retail industry. Very fast paced, never not busy."
good,If I was fully compensated financially paid enough to pay rent I would have never left Macy's.  I wasn't to afford rent on my own. At the time I was living with my sister her landlord would not accept a new tenant. I became homeless because Macy's didn't pay me have of what I earned for them on a weekly basis.
good,"Store has an older clientele who have shopped at Macy's and before that The Broadway so are very customer service oriented.  Macy's has very limited staffing and cutbacks every year, so ability to help customers is also limited.  This is a deterrent to giving good customer service and emphasis is on signing up customers for credit cards more than sales."
good,"The workplace was always understaffed. On a weekly basis, more customers had complaints about long lines than being unable to find a merchandise. The employees also lacked motivation"
good,"need to advance systems / technology "
good,This is a okay place to begin your working career but there is not much chance of advancement. Can be very slow at times as a lot of shopping is moving to online.
good,"It wasn't that bad working here as far as the customers an he work goes. I liked the first Macy's I worked at better, simply because there was better communication."
good,"If opening I'm usually by myself for at least 2 hours, and the same thing happens if closing.  I'm watching over 2 departments daily.  Management is not the best.  There are a few managers that really don't do anything except walk around and give orders.  The culture is very Filipino oriented.  The hardest part of the job is trying to take care of two departments with no help and some of the customers.  The most part I love about the job are some of my co-workers."
good,"A work day involved customer interaction, maintaining the sales floor,and learning about product features. It was a very diverse work environment which was most enjoyable, this environment gave you the opportunity to be creative, interact with and meet new people.It was also at times challenging due to the pressure of individual sales goals which cause tension between coworkers and management."
good,"Clientele ,Making goals, Restocking, customer service, calling/texting clients. Updates on new product knowledge with the company. Planned events for new products."
good,"I enjoy working at Macy's overall. The friendliness of the staff and many of the customers was great. However, they just had big job cuts at my store. I wasn't let go but most of my staff was. I will now have to do the same amount of work with a lot fewer people. Other locations are going through the same situation."
good,At first its frustrating because there isn't much training or help but once you get the hang of it its a fun job only problem i had was the hours i wanted more.
good,I left Macy's due to the lack of opportunities to advance as a sales person. Customer service was too impersonal for me. My manager at the time was very friendly and supportive.
good,"typical day at work - everyday is different. there is always drama between employee and management."
good,"Macys is a very fast past environment. Getting in touch with customer is a priory.  Insite is a good way of keeping loyal customer.  In the computer you will have a inventory of all the customer that you assisted. You only help people by providing magic with the power of your hands, but you also are helping customer feel  better."
good,"I enjoy working here, fast pace moving environment, great sales, you get to learn about all the different kind of companies that they carry in there store."
good,"Not sure where the company is going to with job cuts and stores closing., Each store is different. On a personal note, I enjoyed working in the store where I was."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The daily grin was always very hectic and the office staff was not appreciated by the sales staff nor the customers who came into the office or call about either problems with their purchases or with their credit card account.
good,The Macys environment focuses on results and accountability.  The support roles offer a variety of tasks but need to be completed with minimal resources.
good,"Working for Macy's, a company that has been around for so long has been extremely eye opening. Business has not been the greatest for Macy's and it shows in the lack of staff. But I can say that the people  that I work with love their job. We work with what we have. We still make our sales goals even though we don't have the coverage the customers might want. We still makes connections with customers and give them a one on one experience."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, however the management there wasn't so appealing. They need to learn how to communicate with employees and handle the scheduling much better"
good,When I was there I was 8 months pregnant. They were extremely insensitive to that. They wanted me to work my entire shift on my feet. The managers were messy and talk behind employees backs. It was never about me but I heard it.
good,"While I enjoyed the other associates and my work was easy enough, they went through way too many managers and supervisors in my 7 years with them.  They have had a reduction in workforce for every year for the last few years.  Many couldn't make their quota so they just left while others just couldn't get enough hours to pay their bills."
good,I learned how to measure ladies for undergarments. I also learned how to mark garments for alterations. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers.
good,A lot of the time I had to tell people how to do their own job. Workplace cultures made it easy to come to work but management is very easy to dislike.
good,"It was very busy during the holidays , customers fighting,lines around the corners, and clothes everywhere. It was a lot of work working there, plus the pay did not amount up to the amount of work that we had to do ."
good,Always short staffed in the department we worked in due to people quitting/not putting in two weeks. Some managers avoided the department (typically) leaving the employees to fend for their own. The nice customers out weighed the negative. Macy's screwed themselves with the coupon policy leaving the employees to pick up the pieces. Managers were nice enough and some really did care. Felt upper management cared more about looks than practicality.
good,"Macy's was okay for the most part, but work could be inconsistent and when it was available it was overwhelming. They had great benefits and if you got a good manager it was the best. But the managers would be worked into the ground and move on quickly. The roles I was most attached to had limited hours and high expectations so it was hard to stay motivated to climb within the company."
good,Weekly hours would fluctuate due to store needs. Wages were low and raises often based on fluctuating metrics. Health insurance premiums were too high to use for low paid wages. The best assets were the wonderful people I worked with. The product vendors were great educators and my direct Sales Manager was inspiring and insightful.
good,"it was fun "
good,The associates I work with are really fun and laid lack for the most part. I honestly have a good time while working. The only thing I could complain about is 28 hours a week is considered full-time and the starting pay rate being $9.00/hour for seasonal sales associates.
good,"Macy's is a huge retail business and I understand that there will be customers whom can't accustom with the employees but some of the customers are flat out rude. Some employees aren't on their schedule as well. Sometimes the place is a mess, especially the Women's Shoe Department, and it's not the employees fault. Constantly, there are people there trying their best to clean but people still feel the need to dirty up place. The hours are flexible, especially if you're in school. Sometimes the place gets so busy that you need more than one manager in a department and some managers don't want to assist with aid."
good,"I worked at Macy's right out of high school until I was almost done with college. I enjoyed the first year, but after a while it got very boring. There isn't really any career advancement and I felt that I wasn't being challenged. Also, the hours are long and customers can be very difficult at times, which started to make me dread going into work. Macy's also pushes credit cards on customers and the managers are constantly asking about credit cards. I ended up leaving Macy's because the hours started to conflict with my school hours. Overall, it is a laid back job for college students but, it can get stressful at times."
good,"0.20 cent raises annually lmfao this job is relaxed and flexible its just that the pay sucks for the work you do, and the managers at this particular store, is basically how my co-worker put it: The blind leading the blind."
good,"I worked as support staff and while the job itself was great, the hours were horrible. I never knew when I'd be working and it was quite frustrating. The managers I did have were great and they'd reward our hard work from time to time."
good,"Helping customers with their daily cosmetic choices. Helping cash customers in and out, also taking in payments for in store credit cards. Also helping with inventory."
good,"Opened your register, checked to see items on sale, became familiar with products. Communicated with other Sales Associates regarding items to sell. Held monthly meetings. Boosting sales. Working on the counter to be presentable to customers. Made cold calls and follow-up calls to return customers. Received gratis from Lancome for selling so many products. I enjoyed selling to customers, talking with them about their skin care and types of products to use. It was fun work."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Working at Macy's isn't by far the worst place possible to work. They are however very understaffed and also high demanding. They will often call you in on your off days, and ask you to stay later than your scheduled shift and come in early. They are experiencing budget cuts  and seem to have tried to force 3-4 different departments/ positions into 1. Other than these things and some scheduling issues they are an overall OK company."
good,A typical day at work was very face-paced and stressful. I learned to move very quickly and in a timely fashion. The management was very fair in situations but a lot of favoritism.
good,Great company to work for. Hardest part was if you are the only person in that dept. you hardly got any help unless u require assistance thru manager.
good,"I've only been there for about a month and in that little bit of time being there ive noticed so many drug addicts, coming to work like that and doing it righr in the parking lot. I dont wish to work in that type of enviroment."
good,"It is'nt bad if you just looking for extra money,but if your looking for full time dont bother.I do love the schedule you can put your shift up to see if anyone else wants to work it without recieving a point."
good,Macy's is a customer-oriented business.  Always striving to increase my customer base with excellent selling skills and makeup and skin care knowledge.
good,each day can be different as business is dictated by traffic flow as well as customer issues and concerns. The hardest part is finding time to accomplish everything with limited resources and help.
good,The merchandising team that I worked with was Awesome!! Inspite of how under staffed and overwhelming the work load begin to get the team always stepped in to help one another to get the job done. The management team was divided a few of the managers was like working with a fun parent not much productivity during their shift and there was always a ton of things to do. The amazing managers that were left were overworked to compensate for their counterparts which eventually caused them to move on elsewhere. More of the issues came from corporate such as ridiculous money saving tactics such as limiting hot running water throughout the store except with the restaurant. Refusal to turn on the heating system until just before the store opened for customers during winter months even though employees were scheduled to work at 5 am and the location of the store is in Michigan.
good,"Some of the managers and above were very good where they were hard workers, positive and tried to mentor, but there also were just as many, sometimes more, that were not very engaged. The pay was okay, but it was not competitive with other call centers. The good thing about working at Macy's is that they want to utilize you as much as possible, so you learn a lot and do more than anyone else would do in your position at any other company. This sometimes led to high stress levels and no work-life balance. But the rest of the time, it can be very slow paced if you don't have projects or classes to teach. The people can be the best and the worst part of the job. You make a lot of good friends and family there, but you also will have the normal competitive, catty behavior that occurs with backline/non-frontline employees. Overall, it is okay to work there, but if you want to get promoted, it is very hard to do so unless you are friends with the right individuals."
good,"Working for Macy's was a very good experience. I really enjoyed to work with cosmetics and fragrances but fragrances is my passion. Unfortunately  there is a lack of time work. I am the type of person that likes to learn about everything so I can help anybody and make the company to have the best customer service as possible, and it can happen only when the company invest in training the employees  to work as a time. I like to speak up about how to improve the working enviroment but the managers need to be on the same page for things to be changed  for better. Overall it is a good company to get some experience."
good,"Alot of work in merchandising always on the run doing tasks, also learned to interact with customers while working for macy's. A good job for someone who is in high school, college, or older just looking to get out the house. Otherwise it is retail and there is hardly any place for advancement unless management likes you."
good,"Most of the people at Macy's are very nice and hard workers. It is the few that do not take pride in their job, and just view it as a paycheck that make the atmosphere difficult."
good,"If you are young and want a job to get cool stuff and discounts this place is for you. In reality there is SO MUCH going on inside Macys. Hardest part of your job is basically ""go backs"" and dealing with the others who choose not to work. The most enjoyable part if the job would be serving customers and being friendly."
good,Macy's was a great company to work at and is highly reputable in the industry. The one strong negative is that there's a constant feeling of insecurity because lay-off's happened numerous times while I was there.
good,"Customers are horrible. Get ready for returns, impatient self- entitiled customers, there are a few managers that deserve the title....friendly coworkers and discounts are good incentives and make it worth while"
good,Nice environment and changing and innovative brands. Needs better communication between employers and managers. Great customers who are pretty loyal to Macys.
good,"Macy is a fast paced working environment, nothing extra, just the typical sales environment. Always want the employees to sign customer up for store rewards."
good,Worked there during the holiday season. Pretty fast paced environment to work in. Management was okay. Hours not as stable as one would like. Minimal wage job.
good,I was a seasonal part-timer at Macys but still enjoyed my experience. I worked as a sales associate and would assist people with their shopping. Management was not the best as for some days I was not always directed to the right area. But still not a bad place to work.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macys is a great place to work and most of the managers value the employees. There are some issues with regards to fairness in the workplace but overall it is a great place to work.
good,I love the discounts at Macys. Sales is hard when the store doesn't have much traffic and management expects you to meet sales quota. Theres really no work life balance shifts constantly changes and days off.
good,"i learned how to use cashier. they taught me that all jobs is different, i learned how to have an good conversations with others. the hardest part of the job was knowing if i was gonna keep it cause i was temporary. i meet alot great people there."
good,I enjoyed the customers I worked with and the other staff members.  I did not feel we were paid enough for the stress we had to deal with due to the lack of staffing and the management.
good,"Macy is a large corporation however, is very limited in the ability to move up. Due to several corporate restructures the company has limited the opportunities for growth with the company."
good,"great part time job, flexible scheduling, the hardest part of the job is maintaining the dressing room, for the most part its pretty easy going, it is a great seasonal job"
good,I learned very valuable lessons on both good leadership and poor leadership. Every Region/District/Store has a different personality. There are some very knowledgeable and versatile leaders who can teach quite well.
good,"I love my part-time job at Macy's, mainly because I work with a great crew of people who really love their jobs. Top-notch customer service is the most important thing we sell. The customers expect it and appreciate it. Our merchandise is excellent, and I really enjoy helping customer's find what they came in for and hopefully something more."
good,"At times, the management is unprofessional. The management team does not follow policies and procedures which makes it difficult for the associates when trying to do his/her job properly. It is very obvious that  management has their ""favorite"" employees and  do not hold those employees to the same standards as the other employees.  Favoritism is also shown to the ""favorite"" employees when extra hours are available. Extra hours are not given to the hardest working employees. Management needs to give credit when credit is due to the employees that work hard and truly try to make a difference."
good,This isn't a job to consider working for long for me I didn't get enough hours and didn't get paid much and my job title was to work in the different beauty bays
good,"This is  very demanding job, especially on weekends, when they have a one-day sale or temporary specials. Take in mind, it is both a retail job and in a upper class neighborhood, so the clients are very demanding."
good,"Everything was awesome I enjoyed being a cashier and assisting customer with their purchase as far as picking the right product  for them. The only thing I really hated is how unprofessional, on edge and territorial  the people who were working there for a long time are. This women was arguing with me in front of a customer because I was checking is merchandise out and she knew him. And there's this are of the store supposedly they marked as their territory... I was excited to work there but their harassment became overwhelming"
good,A typical day at work would start with looking at sales numbers. seeing where I'm at within my departments and if there are any issues I should attend too. I also would respond to phone and emails from guests complaints or praises. From there I would catch up with my associates and make sure they were taken care of. From that point it was just managing the store with my peers. I learned a lot as far as what I wanted and didn't want and also how to manage.
good,coworkers were fine to work with however the pay was not very good and I personally had to leave for my own reasons but the if you are late you're fired policy was just rediculous
good,"no review at this time I have no response at this time"
good,"Macy's is a good place to work with solid management and great work/life balance.  However, opportunities for advancement and compensation/benefits are poor."
good,"Working here has given me so much great experience with brands, customers, retail, and a multicultural environment. I have learned basic Portuguese, made new friends and had great experiences here. But in the long run as a sales associate I haven't had much room to grow, and want to branch out to grow with a company."
good,"good benefit, flexible work-hour  "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I worked in the men's shoe dept. worked for commission and a base of minimum wage.  Fast paced job - tourist always coming in an and patience needed in order to communicate with the customers.
good,"Was a fun, competitive place to work. Especially, around the holidays. Wonderful discounts, sales & coupons. It just really didn't benefit me much, financially."
good,"I'm still at Macy's but looking for another job   The support team is just getting hired again   There was a lay off and us,  the cashiers are doing both jobs  One must have a lot of energy and stamina  to get through the day or night"
good,"Working here wasn't that bad. advancing in position was near impossible, people were basically every man/woman for themselves.there was a huge lack of teamwork at this location."
good,The company has been on a downward business cycle for some time. Job security is at the worst level that it has ever been. The workplace culture is declining and the company is going in too many directions at once. The best part of the job is that they do offer a great benefits package.
good,You can work here it is not bad.  Though you may be let go after the busy Christmas season.  Air  Quality good.  Safety is practiced well here.  you could make full time.
good,"People were friendly, management took continuous vacations which made it difficult to build new employee relationships/rapport. "
good,Macy's was a good place to work but advancement was difficult. I was the Intimate Apparels Specialist which meant I had a lot of work to do but not properly compensated for it. I sized ladies undergarments and helped them choose what was best for them. My responsibilities were many as explained on my resume. The workplace culture was great and I enjoyed my job. I was just having a difficult time standing so long on my feet.
good,Working with the ladies that are behind the scenes of Macy's was a truly wonderful experience to have had. I learned so much in the short amount of time I worked there. Great place to work. Only problem is management.
good,"always something to do multi tasking was a typical day, learned how to train new employees, managment seemed to be fair, workplace culture was very diverse, many different individuals, hardest part was the workplace in the office was a small area, but made the best of it. most enjoyable was being able to help someone in need."
good,This job can be pretty amazing at times. It pays pretty well and the people you work with are usually great. The problem most people have is the amount of hours you put in without much support. It becomes very draining.
good,"Macys culture is about the customers. The starts out of counting the drawers before store opening. I learned all about products knowledge and cross selling. The hardest part was they never have enough coverage and lack of communication. I enjoy interacting with the customer, whether its positive or negative. It gives insight on how to improve communication skills."
good,get into work and clock into the same computers they had since 1999 then walk around look for things that the late night shift missed to face. After that you would wait around or search for customers to help.
good,Macy's was a nice place to work and the commute was short.  The salary was very low (minimum wage) and there weren't very many opportunities for advancement
good,Good for a first job. They expect too much with little pay. There are many opportunities for advancement. To get promoted  of course you will need to be very friendly with manager.
good,Macy's is a great place to work if your just looking for short term employment. I really enjoy my co-workers because your a team and this really makes difference when we work together on one accord. I need to be in a career where I can feel valued by management and have a potential to move up. The hardest part of my job is working with management because they are not very personal only professional.
good,"It was fun working at Macy's but boring at the same time, over all great team management and consistency. It is a clean place to and you get benefits working as a working and discounts on clothes"
good,"This company will teach everything there is to know about retail, but fails to put in effective leaders to guide to the next step. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The management team had the insight to hire a team that work well together and assisted each other when necessary.  However, there were many times store management hands were tied and was unable to provide many of the associates scheduling desires which cause a lot of uncomfortable situations."
good,N/a..................n/a  I just like working and meeting people it's a ok place to work so days it all fun in sell and seeing people happy and want to come back for more thing because all was have something new to buy and at good low price
good,"I loved working at Macys, it was during the Burdines changeover.  The management was great except all the decisions were made by computers in the NY office.  The management is not even in control of their own store the computers are.  I was late a few times because i lived 45 minutes away and the computer cut my hours even though the manager loved my sales which were higher than everyone else."
good,Decent work environment but due I don't believe the compensation is equivalent to what th associates do. Aside from that though the work area is fair and polite
good,"The jobs was nice, you meet all type of people from all over. The hours they give you are horrible and doesn't help much with your living arrangements."
good,"Great work place, flexable hours, communication and management needs a little bit of working on, nice employee lounge and break room, customers are a work of art."
good,"Store manager could be a little more observant and honest. It could be more of a friendly  work place environment but sadly its not, it is okay for a seasonal job."
good,"Working in visual merchandising can be rewarding because there is quite a bit of room for your own creative expression. And you don't have to deal with customers. The visual people I worked with were really great and friendly and my manager was really reasonable and great too. Others in the store I can't say the same about, most of the associates are plain miserable. Also the company is changing a lot and they are taking shortcuts everywhere to save money and it shows in everything. So much has changed just in the three years I was there and it's just being more and more degraded, sadly. I wouldn't recommend working at Macy's because of the negative working environment and there is just a feeling of hopelessness when you walk through the doors."
good,"Enjoyed working in the retail environment.  Great team work and people in my location. Always busy and the day flew by. I learned to be flexible, turn on a dime, and to let it go!"
good,Decent hours the pay is low.  Great part time job or entry level job for high school kids to enter the workforce. Get really busy during holiday seasons best time to work.
good,"Not enough hours given there given to the favorites"
good,Very slow paced job with random tasks being given every 30 minutes. Management was rude and very demanding when it came to giving tasks. Job was simple and gained more customer service experience.
good,In a typical work day we are under staffed from the start. We get our devices as soon as the store the sales associate order shoes for the customer and as a shoe Expeditor we deliver the shoes to the selling floor. We organize the shoe bins. Return missing shoes into the bins.
good,Point system is ridiculous and the managers aren't on top of things all the time. Macy's credit cards are also ridiculous. Most people have them but you're required to open 5 everyday
good,"From my experience I have been working three pees jobs during peak times with assistance occasionally from others. My manager expects similar if not better sales goals made on my own in comparison to a full team last year. I do not find them very fair, I received very little area training and have had to teach myself much or suffer the consequences of not knowing what to do in unique situations. I love the girls I work with and the other managers but in my case I feel as though the ball has been dropped many times.."
good,its a good place to start but management isn't all that great and you perform many tasks but only get paid very little. I loved certain tasks because I learned to become a leader.
good,"Lots of foot traffic, large selling teams, many personalities to deal with. Can be fun but careful with professionalism. HR will back a sales associate before a manager, so always dot Is and cross Ts."
good,"Great hours during peak season."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,It was my first job and I will not want to be employed here again due to the competitive nature and poor wages. Having to make a quota with card memberships as well as commission is something I do not miss.
good,"I worked during the busiest time of the year, in the biggest Macy's in the world. The advancement opportunities are slim, however, much personal growth can come from working on 34th street. I came with new interpersonal skills, and with the ability to deal with a lot of pressure."
good,"Macy's puts it self a part from other retailers with their customer service culture. Loyalty, Integrity, results oriented company. "
good,"It's a good Retail store that allows you to improve your skills if your a sale associate. helps you become a good team worker, an organizer, a problem resolver."
good,not my first place I would recommend someone to work unless they enjoy competitive and cut throat work ethic. everyone was at each others throats to make commission or get a sale. if you didn't make your sales goal each day you'd fall into deficient which basically meant you owed the company and until you made your deficient you didn't make commission.
good,In my time there the management was only out for themselves. Developing others is not a strong suit.  I would say as a seasonal job for extra money it is a good way to go.
good,"I worked as part of the basic Customer Service call center, so clients would call in regarding their bill or any questions and we would help them out. QA was very difficult to maintain a high score, as they expected you to be super cheery on every call, and I felt that was just fake. Nice, I can do, but not fake."
good,"Overall, I would recommend this company for someone with a need for flexibility. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers. The hardest part of the job was not being able to stay on as a permanent employee."
good,"Some of the supervisors weren't too professional, and sometimes didn't work. The job was super easy, and basically didn't require much thinking. Twelve hour shifts can be a lot, and it physically tiering, but all of this is coming from a person that would prefer working in an office.  You can advertise or swap shifts, which was really convenient."
good,"I was on the signing and markdown team. My experience was good overall, but I found that the environment wasn't something I wanted personally. I believe that the construction that was going on in the store affected the employees moods at times. However, if you scratched certain peoples backs and did what you had to do, there was plenty of room for advancement. You just have to make it known and make sure that all of your tasks are completed in a timely manner."
good,"management was a bit rude at times but besides that I created a lot of long lasting friendships, and with those friendships they made my workdays there much more fun"
good,The experience I received working as an executive at Macy's helped expand my knowledge in dealing with difficult situations and making the customer the number one priority.
good,Not a fan of working for big companies like this where it's hard to grow and your work isn't recognized. A lot of pressure to open cards and to sell during certain times of the year.
good,I love the benefits I got here but the manager thinks you have no social life outside of work and will want to work you as much as possible. they think you have nothing else to do.
good,"Macy's was so diverse and really good Co-workers to get one job done only, Everyone works together to complete one task at the end of the day and that was to reach our Sales goal for the day, More like a competitive competition but an enjoyable one."
good,"It's a good company to work for. great work environement. and work life balance. they ahave a very energetic and vibrant sales people, the comany values its employees and its customers as well"
good,I met a lot of great people there we always stayed busy they were long days but it was worth it. What i disnt like is that i was only call and i was sent home before lunch or after lunch everyday.
good,At the MCCS Cental Cal center as a .com rep they'll pay you good money for not alot of work. However the management sends very confusing mesages on policy and has no set in stone ways to deal with consistent customer problems and at times it can be very frustrating. But there amazing with job flexibility when hired.
good,"Macy's is a pretty good store. It treats it's employees with dignity and respect."
good,"Macy's can be a nice place to work if you choose the right department. The discount is nice at 20% and you can use it on anything in the store in addition to coupons. I do feel that the pay should be increased in order to compete with other stores. Everything is pretty much self-service online in terms of switching shifts, checking your schedule, pay, time-card, etc. so you never really have to come in contact with HR, even though there is a physical HR located in the store. They are pretty flexible with hours."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Employees remained happy and well compensated which was a great reflection of customer service. Management appreciated employees and were well compensated.  Great product knowledge and service always a great shopping atmosphere.
good,The store is more like a family. Management takes care of their associates and provides associates with the tools and training necessary to advance in job
good,Average retail work experience.  Long hours and various shifts and holidays required.  Enjoyed the work I did and the customers I worked with.  Great family environment within the store associates.
good,"Macys is a challenging environment due to market conditions and changes in the retail space.  While the customers are evolving, Macys continues to strive to identify the new customers and identifying new shopping strategies. Macys however does honor job work/life balance."
good,"My days started at 5am and gave me the ability to work on my different tasks at the store. I was able to work as a sales associate, work in receiving, on merchandising, on the signing team and as the markdowns lead. I truly enjoyed the people I worked with and the job that I did. I also loved being able to learn as many job duties there as possible and being able to step into whatever was needed."
good,Macys was my first job so it will always have a place in my heart. There are sales goals that aren't impossible. The job is very straightforward and simple great for teaching customer service skills.
good,"Working for Macy*s was a great place to start a career. Many opportunities to grow. I learned how operations works, schedules, hiring process. Working with a higher end clients and products. Outstanding customer service."
good,"Macy's is like any other department store. Nothing amazing happened while I was here, everything was pretty basic. I worked every department, learned a lot about customer service, and department/sales work environment. If you like sales then this is the perfect job for you!"
good,Everything I know about retail I learned from Macy's.  Was able to have a functional role in the key positions.  If you are starting out in industry - may want to consider.
good,Dealing with the day to day floor operation. Managing employee break times. dealing with customers issues. cashing out registers making sure section are properly stocked
good,"The job is only good for part time, or to suppliment your income. Besides that, this place has no other reason to work here. Mangement is okay, but they will not think twice to stab you in the back."
good,The environment was a little too frantic and unstable for me. I wanted to be able to work in an environment that allowed me to do what I was trained to do there. Instead I felt a lot of micromanagement.
good,With the current job eliminations it makes it very uncomfortable to work for a company that your not sure your job is the next to go. The way they treated the last group of people to be let go was unfair and insensitive.
good,Management needs to be actually involved.  They all focus on making money and not the actual needs of the employee. The company as a whole needs to be revamped.  The job was not hard and flexible for some positions.
good,"if u need extra income this is great, very flexible, fun, and u get to try products on your lunch brake lol, but if this is ur main source of income you're either amazing at sales and shouldn't be working there or you just will be miserable"
good,My Stylist at Macy's provides an opportunity to work 1:1 with clients who are looking for personal shopping service and taking it to the next level.  The ability to shop and find wardrobe solutions for my clientele was a rewarding experience for the client and myself as well.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Customers decides to purchase their items. Some customers are patient and kind; some are irate, rude, and impatient.  I learned to handle different personalities kinds of people by just smiling and speak in a normal soft tone.  Management sometimes check on their employees and information that was given was not clear many times.  Some knew about the sales and coupons, some did not.  Training was not consistent.   Because I was a seasonal employee, the managers were a little bit lenient and patient with me. The workplace set up was comfortable."
good,Working here was alright I wished they treated the employees with respect nice company they just dont care about the employees you working hard for less than 9.00 hour
good,"not bad. it is a good start for your career "
good,"The culture is diverse and the associates are great to work with."
good,i worked as a  seasonal . not much experience. enjoy working with people. greeting customers.management is good. nothing much to say.
good,"Love the customers, however team members are extremely competitive and combative. Also rare chances for advancement. No benefits until full time employment. Gruelling and demanding but lots of education."
good,"Great and helpful Co-workers, but week management."
good,My experience at Macys was fun. The people I worked with were great and very helpful. Everyone seemed to get along just fine. The managers were rarely on our backs.
good,"I had no problems with Macy's. Long hours,expected in retail."
good,"Been working for this company for 4 years started as part time and went to full time. Part time was great less stress and you can work your schedule according to what's best for you. they give you the options to give away shifts swap shifts with your fellow co workers as well. Sometime management can be stressful about opening macy's cards and you may be asked to do way more than you're suppose to do. Always lack of staff company is too cheap to hire enough people for each dept. Everyone is always overworked especially managers and underpaid, the raise is a complete joke so don't think when review time comes around you will be getting a decent amount. Job is honestly great for part time but as for a full time job to have for the next 5 to 10 yrs don't think about it, Especially when it comes to pay rate."
good,"Working at Macys was a great experience."
good,No comment.  Retail concerns more about numbers than common sense. Don't know what else to say but everybody should work in retail once in their life and hopefully gain a respect for their fellow humans.
good,I knew going into Macys I wouldnt be there long.It is a great place to gain skills and meet new people but I dont see it as a long term job.
good,was a very nice establishment. Managers were very nice. Staff were were very helpful to guest and were always doing something productive. I loved how well the team worked together.
good,"There is no typical work day. Your responsibilities could range from coaching sales associates, diffusing customer issues, re-merchandising the floor, or analyzing reports. I really enjoy my coworkers, but with all of the news about the company's performance and the lack of work/life balance (you'll work weekends, late nights, and holidays) it can be a challenging job."
good,"I worked as a beauty consultant and my job was very easy. Just focus on sales. People who work there can be cut throat, everyone fights over sales. That's the only down fall"
good,They pay well for the position of RFID. The manager at this store could have been better. The job is pretty easy. The co-workers were all nice. Except for the females that worked in receiving.
good,macys was a pretty good job for my first job. i learned a lot. many people to work with and many positions to work on. anyways it was very beneficial to me until i had to leave to Texas.
good,"Worked here for many years, good and bad times, I loved the holiday season! The point system sucked! when someone would get promoted they would act like their better than everyone else."
good,"Ring and bag clients clothes "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I would give macy's a 6/10 for consistency. The lack of support that is given to associates is horrific. The hours are extremely limited, and commission fluctuates. Management seemingly cares, but they lack integrity when it comes to honoring the wishes of associates."
good,he hardest part of my job is the work load with very little store support and at the end of the week the pay does not match the amount of hard work and hours you invested in the company.
good,I have worked a lot of retail and customer service jobs. In Macy's I worked mostly in the back and it was a nice change of pace.
good,"Working at Macy's although seasonal was a great experience. I interacted with a lot of great people and it was a very high energy store. My co- workers were very helpful when I needed it and they showed the up most respect for each other. My title was a sales associate and my duties included, working the cash register, changing sale signs for holidays and up coming events and assistant customers with their purchases."
good,"If you are looking for a retail job like any other retail store, it's quite similar. Nothing fancy about it, you are required to work a lot and not get paid for much of what you have to do."
good,"I worked at Macy's for about a year. It really is a great company with really great people in the LP department. We were like family. Decent benefits, awesome people. The hardest part of the job is interacting with the youth who seemingly already headed down the wrong path."
good,"The company is very flexible with hours and will work with you if you need them to. Works with employees in making sure everyone has adeqaute hous. The coworkers are all very friendly and the managers are easy to talk to . A typical day at Macy's is busy with filling online orders by a certain time of the day. Includes packing the items, scanning and taking them to be shipped out to the customers."
good,"The flexibility of their hours were the most beneficial to me, being that I'm a full-time student in college. Majority of our managers were friendly, yet stern when it comes to work. I would usually prefer to open up, because all of my coworkers and managers are more at ease, which makes for a more relaxed environment. But when we have our One Day Sales and holiday sales, it gets pretty chaotic because of all the customers and sales associates. What I've learned while working here was that it takes a lot of patience to communicate effectively with customers and some coworkers, but as long as I continue to ensure that the customer is satisfied, everything will end well."
good,The typical day starts well whenever you were scheduled to work it could have been 6 AM it could have 6 PM who knows. I learned alot while working was put into situations I have never been put into before and learned the harsh realities of what it's like to not be a professional. It could have been a horrible experience but my co-workers were very nice to me and my superior was a very nice lady that I wish I could have saved her number but I wasn't thinking about staying anyways. All in all it was a seasonal and that's probably why it was like that I would have loved to stay because a Job is a Job. Sadly my phone was having problems in the last few weeks of work and even tho my Manager said they wanted to keep me I guess the company decided we don't need extra workers or whatever. It's the time again for seasonals but I don't want to work with a uncertain schedule again.
good,I worked at two different Macys and they both were fairly differently. Macys is not the best company. Pay sucks and most managers didn't know what they were doing including the store manager.
good,"Typical day at work was serving customers hot and cold prepped foods."
good,Was not a fan working at Macys. They have a certain snobbish way about them that Many customers would complain about.
good,"good people, big company, management needs to improve on employee satisfaction and make salary more competitive. hardest part of the job was lack of communication from top level executives"
good,"Overall average experience, management had a hard time trying to keep up when store got busy. Management would also argue with each other about which department needed help more when store was overwhelmed with customers."
good,"helping customers with purchases, i learned customer service working here and how to better assist  people. i have great co workers we all use team work to get the job done."
good,If you can get a management position in this company go for it. they work you hard but but the end result is worth it. The hours are long and holidays sucks but it is a good company all together.
good,The co-workers and pay is nice ($12/hr) but the organization and management of our schedules is awful especially when they try to not give you days off or don't tell you anything about the work flow
good,the pay was great easy going great co workers very friendly environment keeps you busy the day can go by fast work is productive and can get you thru the day.
good,"You never know what will pop up in the day, but you set your workload day to day. I learned a lot about my leadership and how to hold people accountable. some store managers micro manage some let you be autonomous. Most co workers are fun and great to around, like anywhere there are the ones you don't get along with. I have made many friends on the executive level. Hardest part of the job is finding the time and resources to get everything done. Best part of the job is interacting will all the different people that come into your tore."
good,Macy's offers a fast paced environment to quickly grow and develop your sales and leadership skills while on the job.  There is endless room for growth and I always found comfort in my job security.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Store manager for 113 is a doer. He cleans and is visible on the floor whereas many hide in their office. "
good,"The people who work there are great, the customers can be what makes the experience a great one or not. Retail schedule makes it seem as though you live there."
good,I felt as if they didn't care so much for the employees that was giving them their full time schedules. I feel as if the managers only cared about the employee's when they open a macy's account. Overall very sad.
good,"I averaged 7 to 10 hours a week. My manager wasn't reliable nor communicative. A typical day consisted of just completing transactions, opening credit cards, and maintaining the visual appearance of the merchandise and displays."
good,"The Human Resources training ground is immeasurable. It is a company that is about the Magic of the ""AND""...being able to juggle more than one task at a time, meeting all required deadlines."
good,"Macy's offers ample amounts of opportunities to grow and expand as a professional. Employees can change positions and locations within the company with much ease. The company invests in its employees, especially in the managerial/executive levels."
good,"Nice company. Respectable, friendly environment. Nice working with customers/ consumers. Mostly hires candidates for just temporary positions.  Provides little healthcare coverage, provides no union benefits."
good,"I cannot give much of a review of this company for I was only seasonal and I only worked two weeks. I can say this, while I was there I did enjoy my time although it was short. From HR to the supervisory team members I dealt with, all were very nice people."
good,"Depending on the area you get into, the relationship you have with your coworkers and management is a toss up. Management is either rarely seen and can hardly get themselves on the floor to help, or is riding you for credit applications and performance. Coworkers can be sweet and helpful, or turn on you, take sales and customers right out from under your nose."
good,excellent work environment. acceptation workers. always had something to do during graveyard shifts. supervisors were pretty flexible with family and school.
good,"Super flexible with great hours for a part -timer, good for working families, the job is stable, helped me pay my way through college!"
good,"I personally didn't like working for the company because I'm used to a more fast-paced working environment. I purchased plane tickets for Thanksgiving to go visit my family and they didn't wanna give me the days off. For this reason I resigned, it was unfair. If you want to work for this company, you must know that your social life has to be over."
good,Our Management team were just amazing and always there to help us in any way.  We were a small store and it was our family.  Our customers were mostly repeat and helped us build a great customer base.
good,Enjoyed working with people.  Fine place to work.  I do not have any information to report about working at Macy's.  My position was eliminated in no fault of my own.
good,Macys has a flexible user friendly scheduling system. It made it easy for work - life balance. I enjoyed working here and gained a lot of customer service experience
good,"disliked working for macys, the managers were unprofessional and the pay was close to none. the environment was also very unorganized"
good,The location I worked wasn't as friendly as I wanted it to be. I am happy I got along with few employees that really had my back at the end of the day.
good,"a typical day was managing the cash register and taking care of customers, customer service was above all the most important. worked very well with co-workers.  the job in my opinion wasn't hard we do have to stand for long periods of time but i got used to that ."
good,Some managers were great to work with and others were jerks.  Pay is awful do not expect a large increase no matter how hard you work.
good,"The job requires a percentage of sales daily per sales associate. The amount for the department needs to exceed the prior year amounts. The goal is to meet your daily goal. Management is only concern with the sales totals and the credit account opened.Most associates were not able to open the required amount of accounts per month that was required (1-3 under 30 hrs and 3-5 over 30 hrs or more).I enjoyed the sales and interaction with the customers."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I really enjoyed my job here. The discounts you can get are amazing. But sometimes its just not worth it. You will grow with the company and want to uphold there policies but the management will throw policy out the window for just about anyone so its very frustrating.
good,"In my opinion, the workers are the only thing that made me want to go to work at Macy's. Only the social part I enjoyed. You have so many responsibilities and no compensation for it. They acknowledge you. They say they have incentives for working hard but it is always a competition among the workers. It's like everyone cannot be rewarded at the same time. Which is something I don't like about the job."
good,"Macy's is a good place to work at. You learn about different merchandise and fashion tips. A day at work consists of sizing and folding the clothes, cleaning out the fitting rooms, and helping guests find what they were looking for."
good,"In my own personal experience, working at Macy's was more trouble than it was worth. The pay was good and employees get an extra discount but my co workers and the management made if very hard for me to want to come to work"
good,while i worked at Macy's Logistics and Operations i found that the work was very self-explanatory with maintaining a clean and productive work environment. much of what i would do was either off-load product from incoming trailers or wrapping and then loading returned product that customers had no desire for. i would also at times be placed in recycling where we had to compact and separate trash from recyclables.
good,The employees were all hard workers and fun to work with. However the hours that were given and the way the point system was handled was very disorderly and not beneficial to either the employers or the employees.
good,"This job has taught me a lot about customer service and what it means to work on a team. As of recently, there were alot more cons than pros to the job, and it became just a means of living. Coworkers were often not held accountable for not contributing to the goal of the team, favoritism ran rampant, and feelings of hostility were often an issue. The job itself was fine, and had there been more support and team work, it would have been much more enjoyable. The hardest part of going into work was feeling that after working 10+ hours the day before, it could all be undone because your coworkers who came in after you wouldn't maintain your work and would undermine you."
good,"Working at Macys Herald Square has its up and downs. First being the store is always somewhat busy, its hard to maneuver and deliver shoes when its probably +1000 customers looking for their destination. My Co workers and Managers make my job very enjoyable. There are people from all different backgrounds and places. Everybody treats each other with tons of respect no matter the age difference and i really love that about Macys. My Managers are really understanding and somewhat strict but we all have a job to maintain. The only dislike is the rate of pay, im currently making less that $10 a hour and during the holidays i would work 40+ hours a week. I feel like i deserve more since im putting my all into the job. Another dislike i have is that their seems to be no growth in the stockroom. For instance, one of my co workers has been working in the same Macys Herald Square for 30+ years and is about to retire in the same stockroom he started in. 30+ years i would at least be a manager of some sort but everybody is different."
good,"This job is a great workplace, the employees are very helpful; friendly and they also make sure they get the job done. Its a very fast paced evironment with lots of energy."
good,i have a love-hate relationship with Macy's. My store is pretty unorganized from the store to management. I'm also work support so maybe it's different for sales associates.
good,"The pay was low, however the work was fairly simple to learn, except for the forklift which took some time. The management was good enough, considering it was seasonal, however when the time came to let the seasonal folks go, they didn't really tell us, more let us find out ourselves by looking at our schedules on the computer."
good,"Your day was forever changing because of flow of business and "
good,"Almost everyone that I met while working at Macy's was fun and interesting. The job is easy, so alot of conversing takes place among coworkers. The supervisors are a bit unorganized though. And they play favorites without trying to hide it. The favorites they play are not appropriate even for favorites. The supervisors tend to talk to only the people they are most physically attracted to, and will give those people more hours, even when there are harder working people asking for hours. It is very unprofessional."
good,"In this position you were basically your own manager. We pulled our own directives and implemented them as required. We were always challenged to take the designs to the next level since we were a top door store. Many times my designs were featured on the visual website. In seeing a project through from beginning to end, we were able to learn all the aspects of visual design. From the floor moves, to lettering, to merchandising, there was nothing we did not have our hands in. Reading a planogram and implementing the changes were part of our every day duties. I left this position with a lot of gained knowledge."
good,"Work life balance is difficult there is no consistency to the schedule, very hard to work another job if need be. Each manager will try to accommodate your needs, but this is a store to store experience. "
good,"It was overall a good company to work for.  It depended upon the location you were at, and the culture was very loyal to one another and the company."
good,i really had a nice experience to work in macys.it got the good job envirinment in macys.The supervisors were really very helpful for us
good,I worked in the women's clothing area as a cashier and had to put the clothes back on the racks.The co-workers were pleasant to work with but once the original manager for my section left it all became a hot mess. I also worked in the jewelry area which to me was the best.
good,"Fun environment to work in, but little room for advancing within the company. Consistently short staffed on sale days when extra employees are needed. Macy's uses a online website to schedule their employees and there are complications with scheduling."
good,I was lucky to have a really great manager and really liked working with my colleagues.  Good lines/furniture/mattresses to sell.  Furniture department and sales could be more competitive with stand alone furniture and mattress stores.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Great opportunity to gain retail experience as a sales or stock associate. Slow working environment with friendly employees
good,"Sell, upsell, provide service."
good,"It's like working for any other retailer, Hours suck and pay isn't great. Your voice will never be heard by upper management and if it is  nothing will happen. The CEO makes easily 7 figures + while your making $8.00 per hour or so. I liked my manager I worked for however. I worked in the Loss Prevention side of the company. I will say the LP side is the better side and it's alot of fun to work in, but you will be ""on call"" 24/7 and your regular work hours will typically be until 9pm or so. Coworkers really don't talk to Loss Prevention because they think we are out to get them which isn't true. Macy's is open 364 days a year so that sucks alot, and if you want a raise or advancement on the LP side its virtually non existent for awhile at least or you have to move. The management in my store was pretty nice and fun to be around, the job can get boring at times but can be very fun to catch shoplifters."
good,"This was my first job, didn't work much as a seasonal sales associate. My fellow employees were extremely kind to me and helpful on my first day."
good,"The associates are easy to get along with. They really make coming to work a better experience. The company is decent with policies, but that is expected. Numbers play a big part of the work day, because of sales. The most enjoyable part of the job is realizing your colleagues are understandable and are willing to work you and help you grow as a person."
good,"Fun place to work, with supportive management. Not all roses, kinda can be a pain to work. It has its perks and it is kinda a pain to work for at Christmas time."
good,"A great company to try to grow with, depending on if you really want to learn you can grasp a lot. Pay isn't that amazing and not all the managers are great, but that's with many jobs. It's a huge company"
good,management trys to ensure pleasent work environment. management is supportive and assists with any challenging situations that may arise.
good,"Working at the cash register, sorting clothes in the dressing room and on the floor, making sure the customers are satisfied with their purchases. The hardest part about this job was probably trying to help customers while also working as a cashier. Most of the time I would be working in sections alone which makes my job much harder and requires me to work extra hard to make sure my job is done."
good,If you are not a people person retail isn't for you. this job is good if you like working with others and helping them pick out what they need. the hours are flexible and you can manage your time. the only downside is that sometimes they demand a lot compared to the pay.
good,I really enjoyed working for Macys. I worked 6am to 3pm with a great manager and staff. For holidays they would treat the staff to breakfast or lunch which not all companies would do. Hardest part of the job was around Christmas time stores were packed and we had a lot to do in a small amount of time.
good,Processed customer transactions in fast paced environment. I learned to juggle different tasks and work independently as well as with a group of people.
good,I enjoyed working for Benefit Cosmetics every days a party. We play music and play in makeup all day. I always look forward to seeing my weekend clients and showing them new make up techniques. The best part is they leave feeling confident and with the knowledge to replicate the same look themselves.
good,Fun work place but not much room for advancement unless you play the game. The benefits are not that great and managers are overloaded with work.
good,great company to learn the industry. The training program  provided me with a lot of knowledge to be able to grow in my position.
good,Unwilling to work around school schedule.  Often times understaffed with too many tasks to complete.  Manager would call last minute to ask to cover shifts and be upset if you couldn't.
good,"There will be clashing with management. In a fast-paced, culturally mixed environment, you have to know how to navigate through all forms of personalities. Focus is mainly on customers so put the merchandise down to service!"
good,Frequent openings for internal and new hire positions. Overall friendliness and compatibility with coworkers is very good.  Communication between departments and teams could be improved. Jobs responsibilities could be defined and implemented better.
good,"easy fun place to work never run out of work my co-workers was friendly and helpful, but it just wasn't enough hours and could not make a living with the pay."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Its a good job in where I had my learning experiences and aquired my techniques in the customer service area. Good job to start and learn. But when greater opportunities appeared I took it.
good,A typical day is helping customers with fittings and locating clothing and ringing up the purchase. Fun place with supportive Management. I work in all departments because I also give breaks and lunches daily.
good,"Cuadre de caja registradora, diferentes transacciones que incluían cobro, devoluciones, pagos de tarjeta de crédito, etc. Aprendi amanejar la caja registradora,a lidiar con distintos tipos de clientes. La parte mas fuerte del trabajo era complacer a todos los clientes al mismo tiempo ya que demanda mucho de los asociados y hay que saber manejarlos."
good,"Great part-time job for a college student. Not a career type of job. I also did not receive commission. I got ""macys bucks"" Basically coupons to use in the store."
good,"This is was good when the project first started, but there was new management and it got more out of hand. The work is not as hard."
good,Macy's is a great starter/ fluff job. They are in the middle of major transition and trying to keep up with internet shopping. There is little room for advancement unless you already have a business degree and start in management programs.
good,"Macy's is a great place to start your career. Lots of connections, resource groups and training is offered to entry level to mid level employees. Macy's lacks a career path plan for Senior level employees."
good,"This was a fun job working with the Public.  It was a temporary position, as it required a person with a very aggressive personality."
good,"I opened so I would open all of the registers in my section. Turn all the lights on. I would also do last-minute cleaning, check the fitting rooms, make sure all the clothes are folded and wait for the managers to open the doors."
good,"Not about the numbers, is about people.  You drive your own development, recognition and advancement opportunities from within the company based on your results: both quantitative and qualitative.  You are successful if you embrace their initiatives and drive your business with passion and commitment, engage with your direct reports and lead by example using all the coaching tools available to you.  Likewise, engage with your store and district team, and your customers!!!."
good,It was a high pace job that would demand for you to work in different areas of the warehouse its priority was customers first we all worked as a team to complete task on every customers order
good,"A typical day at work starts at 5:00 am, often earlier during holidays. During summer had to start at 1:00 am due to construction, -  until ""Completion"" which is whenever the store is done usually 12:00pm - 1:45 pm, but at one point was 1:00am to 5:00pm, or a 16 hour shift, WITHOUT BREAKS, during holidays for Sale Prep until completion, we had a team of 5. Currently short-handed. The management, however, seems fit to not employ other people for the position, and will berate employee for not being ""fast enough."" A Signing team should be a team of 12 for a store of this size, but is really 2, excluding immediate manager, who prefers to do other things aside from sign the store. Current signing manager also seems fine with working off the clock. Also enjoys talking a lot. Carrot stick attitude. Current co-worker on workman's comp for injuries sustained on the job. Previous employees quit because of various complaints about worker retention, and management."
good,"Macys was a great seasonal job! Flexible schedules was a plus. I love interacting the customers. Helping them wit last minutes shopping, around the busy holiday seasonal."
good,Work consists of no sitting and 9-10 hours of standing with tons of sales over your head. Learned to not work a secondary job before Macy's or you will get written up for coming in late a few minutes. Management was lazy but some were pretty cool. Co-workers were in their teens and sometimes in the 30's. Everyone was chill except a few that kept to themselves. Hardest part of the job was during the seasons and the mess that came along with it. The most enjoyable part was lunch time.
good,I feel like I wasted 3 years of work experience at Macy's. There were great people there to work with but no room for advancement.
good,"good place to start, pleasant people, good experience, hours not very flexible though, worked as a seasonal employee, customers can be challenging"
good,"Macy's is an OK place to work. The best thing about working there is the discount. Otherwise, there's not very much else to like about it. You don't get paid good enough considering all of the strenuous work that you have to do and the managers are not very considerate of your life outside of Macy's. They expect way too much from you."
good,Cherry hill location was closed due to economy and everyone in company was laid off very few upper management was transfer to another location
good,"Large International Company with great customers around the world,flexibility in the schedules,unprofessional management.Very stressful place to work"
good,I came to the United States and this was the place I found my first job at.  Macy's helped acclimate to the diversity of personalities and to develop my customer service skills.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy's is a great place to work if you enjoy being busy all the time and love the aspect of retail. Everyone is pretty nice and the employee discount is great because it covers clearance items. The only thing is that they tend the switch the schedule frequently through out the week so it messes up with plans.
good,worked for 4 years did inventory worked different departments markdowns floor moves co works were awesome hours were crazy not steady  change of management to many times even after all the craziness I loved that job
good,"Bad hours unless during the winter season. They won't ""fire"" you, but you'll quit yourself because of lack of hours. Long shifts in the winter but struggle to get at least 4 in the normal season. Demand you to open A large amount of Macy's cards, but 85% of shoppers already have Macy's cards, 10% don't want to open an account, and 5% of the people who are willing to open an account don't qualify for one."
good,"Friendly staff and management, flexible scheduling...but poor communication between staff and management at times."
good,"The staff makes the job worth while. Management is not very helpful, and the company tends to overwork their employees."
good,no training was provided at this job. I sat in a back room on a fake register for hours and was put on the sales floor with no training.
good,i had a good time working there but at times i felt like they were over staffed to the point where sometimes there would  be nothing to do but if we didnt do anything we would get in trouble
good,I didn't mind waking up in the at 4 in the morning to get to work. What I did mind was that it was so hot in the store so early in the morning. It was muggy and hot all the time.
good,"running a $3 million dollar department with 20 employees created a lot of obstacles and tasks, yet allowed us to have fun as a team. I coached the team to meet our different metrics that would allow them to have a raise or stay at their current pay. Another large factor was customer resolutions. My main goal was to make our customer happy, while still having the best interest for our company."
good,I enjoyed working the stock positions when i get the chance although i wsnt to fond of the sales position. Managment was okay but wasnt really around every day. I got along with most of my co-workers.
good,Very good mid-management to work for . Working conditions for the most part very pleasant. There is however a large gap in communication  between Corporate and Local management often putting sales associates in awkward positions with their customers.
good,"super busy, high expectations, learn as you go, co-workers keep to themselves, very strict formal dress code, must have great customer service skills."
good,"Working for macy's was well alright. Nothing great came out of it, but maybe that was because of my job placement in the store. Overall it was okay just okay."
good,"A lot of the day is spent cleaning up after shoppers.  So much of the shift is spent doing so, it is difficult to do what it is that you're supposed to be doing.  Along with cleaning up sections, you are to ring or help ring up any shoppers that come to your area to check out.  Some management seem to forgot how hard it is being on the front line sometimes and some coworkers aren't very friendly.  The hardest part is finding a good time to go on your break in the midst of ringing up customers.  An enjoyable part is the mall itself which you can hang out in before or after your shift."
good,"I only have about 4 to 6 months working at Macy's and every experience is a good experience. Everyday is a good day, I get to meet different people each day, learn little by little new things and about other jobs through my co-workers. Very easy for me to get along with everyone. Hardest part of the job would be the lack on concern towards others. I'd love to explain more but I think it's good enough."
good,"I really don't know what to give them, BUT the best thing about working at macy's is the flexibility. You can choose the days you can work and the shift. If you can't work on a certain day, you can advertise that shift and someone usually always picks it up. Only good for someone who is a student and just wants some extra cash in their pocket."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macy's expects a lot from Management employees.  It's unreasonable to get it all done in 45-50 hours a week and continue to have a good work life balance.
good,"Its a fun job. However, you have to push to sale macy's credit cards to customers which is not fun."
good,"In a typical day of work I would do some of the following tasks: Recovery of the floor, fulfillment, RTV (Return to Vendor). Management is good in general."
good,"Macy's is great with scheduling when it comes to your availability, PTO, calling out, etc. It can all be done by the click of a button without the hassle of going to your manager. Although I would not consider Macy's as a career unless you enjoy providing customer service and helping people. Unless you're great a sales and opening up credit accounts, you won't advance much in the company. The pay is not great, but certainly can be better than other areas of work. You just can't live off of the salary if you're living alone. "
good,"I started as part-time recovery, folding and hanging clothes, putting them back where they belong.  Ended in sales, helping people with selections and recovering my area."
good,I like that the schedule is flexible. I got along with my managers and my team member. Learned alot in retail and the fashion industry about quality and product knowledge.
good,"Working during the holiday season may have been the most stressful experience I've ever had. However, it did help me learn how to communicate with people under pressure. Putting stress aside, I  enjoyed meeting new people and helping customers to have a smooth shopping experience and making sure they left with the products they were looking for."
good,The people I have met here are nice and friendly but quickly move on to other opportunities or keep Macy's simply for the discount and work other jobs for income.The sales associates in the Hicksville store are paid minimum wage and don't get to hone any sales or leadership skills because they are always cleaning up a dirty and unorganized store.
good,"There's not much I can say, The supervisors and co-workers were the best I've had the chance to work with in a long time, they really helped me realize that the right job and environment could make the difference between my daily attitude and kept my anxiety from becoming a risk factor."
good,I worked at a tourist area. Met many wonderful people through out the years. During the holidays it's a very fast pace environment. Worked with a very good sales team. Some of the managers are very questionable however (having unprofessional relationships with employees).The most enjoyable part of the job? If you're a people person than retail is for you! Hardest part of the job? It's not hard except maybe the annoyance of management harassing to open accounts.
good,"hard work"
good,When i worked at Macys i did enjoy the fact that the environment was friendly. I always got along great with my co-workers as well as management. The hardest part of the job was meeting the sales requirements. the most enjoyable part of my job was getting to help the customers find what they were looking for.
good,"on a typical day at work, i will time in check with my manager and see what has to be done for the day. as usually i got to see what has to be put out for certain areas and process merchandise."
good,"I love shopping, so the discounts and sales would be the only thing I would say I missed about the job. The discount was only 15%, you would think it being Macy's it would better. They hound you to constantly make sales goals but put you in an area, where its extremely slow and no one ever comes there."
good,"Always something different to do, no two days are alike. Also the flexibility of the schedule is a definite plus. Got to see parts of the building that no one would ever see or history."
good,Everyday at Macy's is fast and different because we have different goals and projects to complete. I have learned on-boarding computer programs such as Taleo and Peoplesoft which helps us let management know when a applicant is coming in for an interview and to see what requisitions we have so the manager can fit the applicant with a good position in the store. The hardest part of the job is not having consistent hours in my job position. I am part time but I have about 27-35 hours a week scheduled. I enjoy working with a team because we work together to get the job done at a timely basis.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"This job requires you to build relationships with customers and specialize in make up and skin care to treat customer needs.  There is always something to do, even if it is cleaning, stocking, or helping a client.  The hardest part of the job is to keep track and update client history and transactions because you meet so many people in  a day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making a client feel better about themselves through make up and skin care."
good,"Working at the Macy's Fulfillment Center in Goodyear, Arizona is just like any other warehouse job.  During peak season, work becomes stressful and rigorous, but you become like family with your hardworking peers."
good,The best part of the job is my coworkers because we are like a big family. I enjoy working there most of the time. But retail is not something i want to do for the rest of my life.
good,Good place to get customer service and retail experience. Only thing is needed is for management personnel to have a more patience for students. Employee discount is also a plus.
good,"Macy's corporate office prides themselves on having good work-life balance. While for the most part this is true, it definitely depends on the team. Some areas are consistently more busy than others, and some functions within the same area are more busy than others. The culture prides themselves on having a ""teams win"" mentality, but there are also key ""star"" employees that they like to promote quickly throughout the ranks, sometimes with less than one year of experience in each position."
good,I worked at Macys during the holiday season when I first started college for extra money. Its was a great experience and prepared me to handle last minute changes. I was in a new department everyday and working with different co-workers and customers everyday. I learned how to deal with new things and deal with great pressures.
good,"A typical day at work required greeting customers, interacting with them, give them information, answer their questions, answer/transfer calls, cashier, and keep environment clean. Management was okay, they do not show much appreciation until you put in your 2 weeks. Hardest part is making managers happy because they all wanted different things. I learned so much about management, Despite the down sides, I enjoyed interacting with the people and coworkers."
good,not really informative  in whats going for sales. co workers where nice and friendly and helped out  when needed. management  sucked never really sure how that expected you to know something they never thought. hardest part of the job  not being able to help a customer at all times.most enjoyable part lunch time  and taking a breaks some days it was really needed
good,I enjoyed the merchandise.  I didn't have to place any inventory on the floor.  They had a night team that did that.  I also didn't have to tidy the floor.  They had a team that specialized in that.
good,I really liked all the co workers I had that trained me in shoes and how to deal with potentially crazy customers.the hardest part of the job is being prepared for one day sales
good,"working here was very stressful they put alot on new workers"
good,"	Delivered exceptional service selling and assisting 50-100 customers daily at the Clinique counter. "
good,the typical work day starts with a morning rally where you would hear from the stores manager where they wold tell you about the coming events and promotions for the day and coming days. then right after  that you must rush to your stations to open the registers  for your actually day to stars while constantly being watch over by your managers where they constantly pull off the floor to either commend you on your job or  u on a job they deem as in aducate
good,"Fast moving, physical position with a creative base. I have learned a great deal about fashion execution, in large scale retail design atmosphere both visually and through merchandising."
good,"A typical day at work can be very busy generating applications , cash office and meeting compliance with associates with company guidelines"
good,it was alright but I couldn't see myself staying for long customers was snooty and the pay was bad
good,was an amazing experience. my first time working retail job. though seasonal i did enjoy my time there
good,"everyday is a wonderful for work, I learned to be net and curious, focus to my work and the company, my co- workers are especial persons and we have a good environment work. "
good,Normal retail work experience. Nothing horrible or great to really review about.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"customer service"
good,"my work with macys was enjoyable because it was friendly and fun,, i learned several new things and met new people. although parts of the job was stressful it was productive and hard work"
good,"It's a good job for side money or for people whose other work schedules won't conflict. But be wary if you're a student."
good,"Macy's is one of my favorite stores and also has an exciting working environment. The only thing i did not like about the job is that they barley gave me any hours and did not accomodate my school schedule like they said they were. I was hired to be a fragrence cahier, but instead i found myself working in other departments as recovery, which i wasn't to excited about that either. I was basically cleaning up everything and doing the labor nobody else wanted to do. That did ruin my experience in retail but other coworkers and getting to interact with many customers daily is what made me enjoy the job."
good,"Macy's Logistics and Distribution wasn't a bad place to work, but the organization made as little sense as possible, and at best was actually counterproductive. Gift wrap orders would come down the line to packing randomly mixed in with non-gift wrap orders, but all of the gift wrappers were located at one end of the building, so all gift wrap orders had to be taken to them, instead of coming off the line to them directly (which was entirely possible)."
good,"Very organized company. Did a good job keeping employees informed of product knowledge. Hours could get very crazy, especially during holidays, but that is expected in retail."
good,Like the fact that was able to set schedule normally they selected 2-3 days and the rest of week could work or not depending on what you had planned.  Didnt like the draw vs commission since never earned a commission check since you have to at least twice the amount of sales goals.  Stressed a lot on the charity program and credit program.  If the draw pay was better and if it was draw+commission it would be a better company to work for. Also the discount was not the greatest.
good,"I want to start off by saying Macys is a great company to work for, especially for part-timers who is in school or have another occupation."
good,"Macy's  was a great experience, meeting new people and building a clientele list was a bonus. on the other hand, there was terrible management and it is very obvious that the managers had bad taste for one another and played favorites to the sales accommodates.  i believe in an equal balance and personal issues of another shouldn't impact the work place."
good,Noisy and busy but very peaceful at the same time. Sometimes too peaceful and uneventful.
good,"My typical day at work would be, Brow mapping clients,ringing up customers. overall a great work environment. I learn great customer service, management could have been a little better. I got along with one of my co-workers it was more of a family unit."
good,"Long work, especially during the holiday season and the time leading up to it. May have to work weekends, even in the office. Need to know how to deal with internal and external customers."
good,Good environments and fun to work . Not enough space grow .............................
good,"My typical day at Macys is different every day, attend to different types of clients, from age to cultures, their needs are varied and different."
good,"Doing this type of work is what my third party logistics team did for me daily. It's like stepping into their shoes for a few hours during the work week. There's nothing hard about the position. We just unload the trucks for the day, sort products by floor, sort y departments, put on security tags and stage everything in the evenings. Once all the sorting is done we load all, pallets, recyclables, damaged products, miscellaneous materials on the truck to be shipped to the distribution facility.  The management sees that I'm beyond capable of handling daily operations, but this is not full time."
good,I loved working at Macy's but couldn't provide for myself and child on such low compensation.
good,"Not the worst company to work for, but certainly not the best. Scheduling makes no sense and has a hierarchal feel to it. Management is not very visible but have plenty of expectations. Very boring. Guests can be rude and confrontational Certainly wouldn't reapply or work here again."
good,While working with Macy's I learned how to be an outstanding sales specialist.
good,I loved my job but when ready to move up they prefer to promote outside the company in the department i was in.
good,Fun Place to work . Pay is awful for the amount work that is required
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"My typical day at work was always make a connection to any customers and greet them.  I learned the there's going to be days that are very busy and it might be out of control but the managers always their to support you. The management were very friendly and always has meetings and checking on us to make sure we build a connection or open a card. The co-workers were very sweet and helpful, they always there if i need any help or a question. The hardest part of the job was when your missing something by your register and you call the manager they come late and the customers get very upset about it. The most enjoyable part of the job was i was welcome to the family ."
good,"It is very easy but you are not paid that much and there is almost no room for advancement.  However, my manager is very nice and can usually lets me have days that I request off."
good,"I enjoyed working at Macys with other co workers, but the pay and commission was horrible. It was pretty much non-existent."
good,"Productive company to work for, advanced from asst dept manager to dept manager and then staffing planner"
good,"as an overnight processor ateam of about 25 people received merchandise from New Jersey on pallets, we broke the pallets down into like merchandise (baby clothes, juniors,etc) and assigned them to different table where a team of 4-5 opened the seal and boxes, unwrapped the merchandise and affixed alarm codes to the merchandse.  We placed the merchandise in the appropriate bins and transferred the merchandse to the appropriate floors.  I kept the inventory and movement of said merchandise while performing the taks mentioned."
good,"A typical day at work for me was I was either working the morning which I had to clean the dock and prepare for when my coworkers came in to unload the trucks. What I also had to do is when UPS or FedEx came in to deliver their package I had to log it into our documents while also delivering it to the recipients. I also did salvages. And if ever needed I help out the floor associates with what was needed. And if something needed to be done specific I would have done before my co-workers came in to do their shift. I also worked during the evening. I usually worked in the truck or the line. What I learned is I could do more than one thing at a time, I am a quick learner and also I can be a leader if given the chance. The management was good. My co-workers were cool and amazing people. The hardest part of the job is my most enjoyable part of the job, the hard work."
good,Hours were consistent and the employee discount was cool but management at this Macy's were sloppy.
good,It's retail. You expect the kind of work you see other people doing when you walk into a department store.
good,If you are working in retail its not the worst place to work as a whole I like working for the company but the in store managers tend to be yes than great.
good,"I start my day by printing out the calendars for the conference rooms, doing my rounds which include checking printers, pantries, coffee machines and making sure the facilities are clean. Once i complete my rounds, i touch base with my supervisor for any last minute projects."
good,"Greet customers, patrons, or visitors. Assist with duties in other areas of the store, such as monitoring fitting rooms or bagging and carrying out customers’ items. Compute sales prices, total purchases and receive and process cash or credit payment. Answer questions regarding the store and its merchandise. Answer customer questions about goods or services. Bag or package purchases, and wrap gifts. Clean shelves, counters, and tables. Clean work areas"
good,"I loved the employees I worked with and most of the managers."
good,"There is always something to do when you come in. Whether it be helping customers, cleaning your area, calling clients, or preparing for an upcoming event, you will almost always be busy. However the program they have to train interns into becoming managers is frustrating as it means less people are promoted from within and even if you are a hard worker you may never be promoted at all."
good,"Macy's was a great company to work for as far as what you were being recognized for , but as far as company advancement it was scarce and far between"
good,"It was a good job, i was a floater .. i got to choose my own schedule from the in-site page ... managers sucked and most had attitudes thought they were better than everyone else. They do not play with the points if you lose your points you will get hired on the spot- you are disposable to them  they don't care if you have 10+ years working for them"
good,"A typical day of work consisted of opening & closing duties, customer service, keeping work stations clean, loss prevention logging, ringing"
good,At first it was fun but then after a while you realize that is not work it.
good,"Macys is not a bad place to work if you like working with people. Most employee are Friendly to work with but know as a person you must take on a lot of leadership action because you can feel as if your the only one working/ organzing by yourself( as far as the women shoes department). a typical day is cleaning, selling, opening credits, and understading sales. I've learning how to be consistant,productive, exploring new ways to sell, and mostly how to be a leader. the hardest part of the job is pre-selling goals at the same time making sales goal of the day but it is reachable. The most enjoyable part is working with customers, making sales, co- workers and meetings about training and updates on the store."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,This was my first job; it was seasonal. I do not remember much from a job that I had as a junior in high school.
good,"Job duties included customer service, cashier and keeping the merchandise organized. I was always kept busy because of the holidays."
good,"a typical day at work-WAS PRETTY FUN IN I DID ENJOY BEING A PART OF THE COMPANY."
good,"I loved this job, it was exciting meeting new people from around the whole world.   It was great interacting with customers, helping each with products, whether it was a gift, or just a special occasion.  "
good,"I start my shift with opening up registers counting the money and making sure its the correct amount if not request cash, I then move on to make sure my area is nice and clean. Working here has helped me open up and make it easier to converse with people. Management is good they're always pushing you to try to do your best and to reach your goals. Co-workers are alright there's good and there's bad hence we get a lot of new hires often where we constantly have to train them. The hardest part of our job is the pressure were under when it comes to opening up macys credit card accounts its not easy but it isn't unattainable either. The most enjoyable aspect of my job is the customers we have our regulars and we of course have new ones. It's very interesting to meet new people and even new friends."
good,"open and/or close register"
good,Macy's is a great place to work in general but there are a few things that make it difficult to justify staying there.  The pay is significantly lower than even other retail jobs of a similar nature and the commission rates that associates make on the jewelry they sell is a joke! 1%! The hours are inconsistent and it is hard to schedule your life around the work schedule.
good,"I have been a manager going on close to 14 years and Macy's is one of the toughest extablishments I've ever worked for.  The expecatations of a sales manager are very very high.  We get pushed to the brink by the senior management team.  I'm not saying it's a bad place to work but I work very very hard and I don't have much work life balance.  You are required to meet all leadership metrics including star rewards, search and send, MyClient.  You are also required to coach the associates to meet these quotas."
good,"I worked in a commission based area and pay was never great.  The associates, though friendly, are very cut-throat when it comes to sales.  This is due to the ""draw"". The draw is essentially negative commission that is created when your goal is not met.  The draw will deduct from future commission and only $100 is forgiven every quarter.   The schedule is a joke, it is a variable based schedule so from week to week you have no idea what days you can work, and to make matters worse you only have 3 days to request off a month, and that has to be submitted a month in advance.  In addition to a pathetic scheduling system, no managers seem to know what exactly is going on when it comes to medical leave or other issues that actually pertain to the employee, this is due in part to the high turnover rate of employees and managers at the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is the 20% discount.  To summarize Macy's is a great place to work if you are the type of person who is very stable and won't have much that will interfere with the schedule.  If you have any disability, school, or high octane social life I suggest to avoid this position."
good,"I help set up the store before it opens and assist coworkers in getting the product put up. Additionally, I help customers solve any problems they may have. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you made a person day by resloving their issues."
good,I was very excited to get the job at Macy's. I was hired the same day I applied.  I chose this particular job for the life work balance.  At the time my son was small and I wanted a job that that afforded a life work balance so that I would be able to pick him up from school and take him to little league games. I learned a lot about merchandising and the people that I worked with were great. The most difficult part of the job were the early mornings.  A normal day was from 6 am to 10 am.  We are sometimes gone before the store opened. The compensation was the worst part of the job. Some jobs may have commission salary but overall the pay was poor.
good,Punch in and go straight to your responsibilities for the day. Very laid back and great work environment. Can get hectic with heavy traffic of customers but still fun nevertheless. Managers were very polite and responsible.
good,A typical day at work is to assist customers with product. Keep the sales floor and the stock room clean and organized. Enjoy the people I work with. Managers push getting accounts too much.
good,Workers are friendly and  create a great workplace to work at. Job is iffy for the sense of hours though.
good,I have learned about how to provide excellence customer services through magic training classes and by working with the customers every day.
good,"At Macy's I had to document everything that I do.  select using the necessary equipment needed to get the job done.  I learned how to  manually change batteries, change strap for the strap machine, also fix it, operate a walkie-rider cherry picker, and reach truck.  A manager was always there when there was any problems that needed to be resolved.  Next made sure everything on a day to day basis ran smoothly.  Next I got along with my co-workers.  Never had a problem with anyone.  The hardest part of the job was multitasking; selecting on a cherry-picker and also working safe, making sure that I sound the horn when going down, entering and exiting an aisle.  The most enjoyable part of the job is going to the packing department and packing the items.  I'm not getting timed for packing, and I don't have to rush and possibly making mistakes."
good,"If I really start talking about this place it will eventually all turn bad.  The lack of people who actually want to do their jobs in this place is astounding. My job should have been relatively straightforward, however when you get no support from management or associates, it's difficult to get your job done.  The pay was great, the hours were ok.  Not everyone was a lazy sack, and I appreciated everyone who wasn't. I quit this job because I just couldn't take it anymore."
good,I love the associates I work with but the pay is not so good for all the work you do!
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,confusing your basically on your own. very easy work however it will get you dizzy from how boring it is
good,It's a fun and fast-paced working environment but the lack of benefits makes it not a very optimal place to work.
good,"Come in sign in the contruction worker, walk the floors of the contruction site."
good,"it is very flexible, you can control your own schedule and days you want off, discount is good but they only give you a raise once  a year and it is only a few cents."
good,"In this position I worked as a flyer, which meant that I received hours based on if someone else didn't come to work and when there were extra hours available. This position taught me to stay on my toes because I had to be able to work in any department in the store."
good,Administrative and human resources professional looking for a company to continue to learn and grow.
good,Good for extra money and friendly people who are enthusiastic and eager to help you
good,working in retail provides a good experience into the customer service industry.
good,"flexible hrs are great."
good,conduct routine surveillance to detect and apprehend shoplifter. doing daily and monthly audits. my coworker were great we work and acted like a team. The hardest part of the job was terminating employees but the job had to be done.
good,A typical day at Macys usually kind of slow but enjoyable. Customers always confided in me for advice and much more. I loved working there I just hated the slow days.
good,"My typical day includes providing assistance to customers with their purchases, offering  an opportunity to join our Macy's reward programs, listening to customers to best serve their needs, and providing the best personal shopping experience to all I encounter."
good,". Read e-mails, walk the stores for any concerning maintenance problem, conference calls daily, fix any register problems, always checking safety concerns, taking surveys and follow up with stores."
good,"Didn't really like working her to much, because their wasn't enough pay."
good,"The day begins with going over where we are to plan and what needs to be done to make our day goals. "
good,"This was one of the largest macy's store that I've worked for so you didn't get to know management well. I never even seen the store manager and I worked from November to February. I was an employee for Macy's for 3 years, but this store was very different than others. I did work a lot with my dept manager, but it was odd that I never seen the store Manager. They kinda do their own thing, and they don't care much about employees. It was a very disorganized store. My typical day would be opening the fine jewelry dept by unlocking all safes and counting jewelry. When the store opened I enjoyed working with co-workers and customers. The best thing about working for this store would have to be meeting so many different people from all around the world."
good,"I learned a lot of things, but the management could have been better. I like how you can pick the days you want to work. I met a lot of different people and I enjoyed interacting with the customers."
good,"Macy's was good in some areas. They were good at rewarding employees and recongizing them.  Like all places the less strong employees (less sales) got overlooked.  They have a pretty cool scheduling system, but the hours were non existence for some PT or Flex people.  Overall, not a bad place to work and opportunity to advance."
good,"Is a high traffic store, where there are tons of customers during rush hours."
good,"Most days managers would criticize they way you work, and not allow you to speak with other store members. It was not a friendly place to work, and the managers would sometimes only tell you something to get what they want."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I been working in retail for a while, but Macy's is not just an ordinary type of retail. In this company you have to be able to act with a little more charm and choose your words wisely if you want to sale."
good,Always something going on to improve employee moral and fun days in the company.
good,"The amount of product is fun to work with and it's great meeting different and influential people every day."
good,"The worker moral sucks, ppl are not happy.. But being on the visual team, i have the best job in the building."
good,"My team has all young people, so every day is something new to learn. The work place training is minimal so you manage to learn something new everyday. Job task is not limited so I had opportunity to learn more than my assign task work."
good,A great place for a family to spend quality time with each other.
good,"Work too much for no reward, I work in Handbags and I sell a lot, yet, i receive no type of commission. I wouldn't mind it if the wage was better but for all the work and benefits i put into my job, it's not truly worth it."
good,"A typical day at work requires ringing up clothing items at the register, cleaning the fitting room and maintaining the floor, while giving excellent customer service. Managers are always easy to call for when further assistance is needed with customers. My co-workers are very friendly, helpful and caring. The hardest part of the job is to maintain the floor and keeping everything clean. The most enjoyable part is having amazing people to work with and getting good clothes on sale."
good,"Always have something to do, never get bored. There are groups of people that you should stay away from to avoid drama. Hardest part of the job is getting along with people that don't like you because they are judgmental. I enjoyed working on clothes and helping customers, because i knew my way around the store very well and the managers loved me."
good,"This is a retail job, fast paced, low pay but the managers I worked with were great! I enjoyed my time at Macy's inc but needed to have more time with my wife."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting with different people and the hardest part was working during holidays
good,"Some good, some bad. My co - workers made it enjoyable. I learned bra fitting. My manager was and is the most disliked person in the store. Most of management is very disrespectful."
good,Depends if you are on the floor or in the back of house. I loved working as an AST; partly because I loved the HR side of it. I learned a lot about HR polices and state labor policies.
good,"fast paced, techno challenged, no varification process to assure accuracy of product warehoused"
good,"Ensure that each customer receives outstanding service by providing a friendly environment "
good,"It was fun, and enjoyed working there very much the people I worked with were friendly, I do miss it . I also enjoyed helping customers I Learned that there were  a lot of different kinds of customers you know the ones looking for deals. Managers were knowledgeable but there were some who would always come around there's a customer when we had already approached them I just didn't want to make them feel pressured or as if I was bothering them. And the way we had to sell seem really competitive where people would argue sometimes in front of the costumer."
good,"Enjoy working for the company,good group of people to work with."
good,"A typical day at work begins at 6a.m. and ends at 3p.m. "
good,The best part about working for Macy's was the people I worked with.  The worst part is the backstabbing and the condescending attitude of the upper management.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"working at macy's was very interesting. I learned many new things like working with wms, creating move tickets, operating a pallet jack and a forklift. Management was ok, my co workers were good and bad, too much drama for a work place. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the rude supervisors that were over my department. The most enjoyable part of my job was, always making production no matter what department I was working in."
good,"If you like retail, its a good place to work.  Up to date technology.  Fast pace."
good,It was multi-cultural. I learned a lot about customer service.
good,"A typical day at Macys required checking for floor space to fill your merchandise, check for markdowns and any advertisements. I've learned to maintaining my time to set the floor because that is what the consumer is looking for when they are shopping around. The management have taught us to get us focused on knowing your area and taking ownership at all times. My co workers loves to help whener they are done with working on their job. The hardest part is waking up early arorund 4am to get ready for a 6am shift. I love my job and what makes it enjoyable is interacting with the customers and helping them celebrate their sales."
good,"My employment with Macy's taught me valuable skills including; customer service, sales, leadership, problem-solving, and training fellow associates. As an appointed Captain, I was responsible for leading my department by directing employees daily tasks, scheduling breaks and lunches, and assisting other associates with challenging customer issues. The greatest challenge I had at Macy's was getting full time hours, due to scheduling being completely automated. I really enjoyed assisting customers, and doing everything within my power to make their shopping experience more pleasurable."
good,i learned to be patient with other. Management is a hard working team. My most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customer.
good,"My experience working at macys was a good one. My co-workers were great to work with, and i enjoyed the customers. My shift would very day to day and i am always on my feet which I dont mind at all. Management was ok, they tried to help you as much as they could. The part that I didnt like about the job was the different hours, the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers"
good,"Coworkers weren't always the most helpful or quick to give advice, but supervisors always had constructive criticism and took time to point out ways to be better. Customers were polite and had a very relaxed sense about them."
good,"Macy's is a great place to work in the retail field. The store features great products and great coworkers make it a fun place to work. If your manager is good, the work environment can be pleasant and fun. The best part of the job is helping customers. You learn a lot about the retail business and how to deal with people. The job can be difficult if your schedule is constantly changing and management is not helpful."
good,"I held a position as a commission sales associate in men's shoes/suits.  My main goal as a sales associate was to make sure customers had an enjoyable experience while shopping.  I offered my assistance and engaged customers.   "
good,"great people to work"
good,"You are reviewed with a scorecard."
good,Not a bad place to work but it depends on what department & manager.
good,"A typical day at work consists of; Customer Service, Stock work, merchandising"
good,"great incentives, great people to work with nice work environment."
good,It can be a very fun place to work if you are completely fashion savvy and competitive. Part time is good for students as full time is not promised as well. I personally enjoyed working there.
good,No complaints for this company. Managers were very professional and hours were always available
good,it was a challenge to reach our sales quotas for the day while working as a night short didnt have much time that late at night to reach them.
good,"I was only seasonal but, the time that I was there it was great all the employee's got along. I had fun with whatever I was doing. "
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The best thing about my job the ability to help customers find the perfect item for that special event, or finally finding something after of hours of nos. "
good,I worked in the ladies shoe department. The job was fun I got to work with people I really enjoyed.
good,I worked for Macy's for a short time due to a store closure.  Upper management was non-existent at the time with little to no guidance on HR closure procedures.  
good,Worked in almost every department in the store. Most of the time I worked in the women shoes department.
good,"I started out doing recovery and I was on call. I didn't have a department to work in at all. They finally put in a department with good pay and they kept me pass the holiday season which I was happy about. My hours were great and so was the money but, as soon as the summer kicked in gear my hours started getting less and less to eventually I didn't have any at all. For the whole fall season, I had no hours at all. I found another job and they gave me hours for the next holiday season but, it was too little too late. The only thing good I can say is that the employees there are terrific. They treat you like you're family."
good,"I don't like sales, I don't like being dishonest. I was disappointed working for macy's."
good,"overworked, learned that many co-workers do not work as hard as they should, management was disorganized, hardest part of the job was the on-hands training- no one was willing to help me,but I did enjoy interacting with customers"
good,"Early morning shift the audit for the shoes has to be completed by eleven o clock. All the registers has to be counted and opened. If money is needed in the registers you have to request to add money to it. Store usually opens at nine or ten, customers are ready to shop. Whatever shoe they may want you have to send a order for them to the back of the stock room using our scanners. Once the shoes are ready you bring the shoes to the customer for them to try on. If the customer likes the shoes and wants to buy them, you lead them to the register to complete the sale. Thank them for shopping Macy's, and politely invite them back to the store with a smile."
good,I think company is not a welcoming company and does not appreciate their employees. Compensation very low
good,I do not understand how people can work there full time and expect to feed themselves or their families. The work system is not set up for honest folks- it's built upon theft from other employees clients and lying to customers.
good,"Working here I learn that being able to work in a team is must for things to get done .On time and at a quick pace .Also I learned that processing orders on time and accurate is very necessary , and learning  as much as you can on the job with train can take you far .If the company has room for growth ..  "
good,"physical labor"
good,"The Sr Graphics person was GREAT to work with- the rest not so much"
good,This job was very busy and it took a lot of energy. But I liked it because of all the nice things it had to offer. And there was a nice discount for the employees. So my wardrobe was eclectic which is what I like and of course the home goods where wonderful. I did learn a lot about opening credit accounts and being able to show people how to put things together and make it work for them.
good,A day at work consist of  making each customer feel like their apart of your family or friend basically make them feel comfortable. Always being alert at all times because you never know what type of situation you'll be in. Coming into the environment you fell intimidated   because your coming into a big space that's fast pace at all time. Overall seeing the same people everyday you developed friendships and became a big family.
good,A lot of customer service and making sales.
good,I loved waking up and knowing i am going to a job that i wouldnt mind working at. I learned how to deal with certain situations with customers from my managers.
good,"The position is interesting if you are young and willing to work on holidays. The job becomes difficult for family oriented individuals due primarily to time constraints. For a young professional, this job is allows you to learn essential skills that will be the foundation for future growth."
good,OK place to work. Management abilities leaves a lot to be desired.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time working for Macy's. It is very fast paced. I learned so much about magic selling, closing a sale, and how to keep organized. The management and staff are all very pleasant. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be the the holiday season. A lot of energetic employees getting hyped for the sales!"
good,i help customers find the items they need. it's an ok job but not for me a place i would like to spend the rest of my work life in
good,good place to work balance with life and work. Management needs more training.
good,"My experience at Macy's was very tedious. The process was so methodical that it almost seemed obsessive. Very little variation in terms of associates workload. You clean items off the floor, put merchandise in their proper place, assist customers constantly with whatever inquiry they have despite how trivial. You are expected to have a certain sales goal. The specific amount is contingent on your department. You're expected to make 2 credit card applications per every 30 customers. In order to do that you must aggressively push the credit cards."
good,"Learned basic functions of a department store, such as how to operate a register, and how to open and close one. Also opening and closing procedures for the store. A typical day involved helping customers while maintaining upkeep of the store. A lot of emphasis put on making your sales goal and opening credit accounts, with some co-workers taking it more seriously than others. I liked most of the people I worked with, really liked my manager and most of the other managers."
good,Meeting and serving customer on a daily basis is fun and interesting. I learned how to work in a fast pace environment and my co-workers are very cooperative as a team.
good,"Typical day cashiering, meeting new people and trying to reach my daily goals. I learn how to open credit card, management was helpfull. My co-workers made my day. The hardest part was adjusting to a face pace environment."
good,"A typical day working at Macy's begins in the morning , around 9 am. My work is typically done on the dock area, or shipping and receiving area of Macy's. Opening procedures includes picking up of hangers from sales floor to ensure a clean work environment for the sales team, retrieving damages, salvages, and products to be shipped to the distribution center. If there is product to be processed, it arrives on a freight truck , I inbound the truck removing lock and coded seal for tracking and security purposes then proceed to unload the truck. Removing of items from truck, proper sensor and removal of plastic is required for most items not all. Then items are delivered to merchandising team to be placed onto the sales floor or stock room. I've learned about the process of shipping and receiving the logistics behind running a business. How to properly ration supplies needed to run the store and ensure successful maintenance of lighting on the premises . I've learned to log and deliver packages from mail courier services such as FedEx and UPS."
good,its productive when its busy when it isnt its boring
good,"Good compensation, many advancement opportunities, does a lot for the environment.Task was easy, making sure invoices are paid on time.. and documents are complete so Payable could process payment on time. Excellent, loved the people."
good,"Macys is a great place to work if your looking for some extra cash as a part time job or a recent high school graduate, they work around school and work schedule. Great discounts and awesome customers, lots of clothes to put back and straighten but overall a descent place to work."
good,"My co-workers and managers were all extremely kind and understanding and helpful. The work load tended to become hectic during busy sale specials and the holidays but this benefit me because the busier I was, the quicker the work day felt. The difficult part was having to stay after hours on many occasions to clean and organize the ravaged clearance racks after customers would carelessly tear through the clothes and often leaving them strewn about messily all over the floor."
good,"I enjoyed working there, just too much work for little pay. There was so much to do in one day and I would work almost every day of the week and meet sales quota and then get my check that friday and only have $300."
good,In my current job I enjoy the people I work with and most of the customers. I have learned a lot about being patient with people and how to turn bad situations into good ones. The hardest part is multitasking to make sure that the customers are satisfied with the service they are receiving because you have to know how to manage your time with each person and not allow people to take up more time than is needed.
good,In the workplace was okay. The job was a very competitive environment because we were based somewhat on commission. Great team but wasnt very flexible when it came to fair scheduling or working nights.
good, Promote and sell retail products to customers
good,Assisted ladies shoes associates with the sell of shoes to customers.
good,Greeting everybody. I learned how to manage money. My co workers were great to work with like family.hardest things was coming in and the business was slow cant make any money I was on commission. Meeting different people was always a plus.
good,"A typical day at work at Macy's included setting up registers, maintaining cleanliness on the floor, and greeting and assisting customers with questions."
good,"It was like I was just a numbr, and they could get other people to work there easily if they wanted to"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Busy store, sometimes we were not that busy, cleaned and did other peoples jobs and responsibility"
good,if u love retail and you are looking for some extra cash then this is an ideal second job
good,I worked during the holiday season so it would get really hectic and you never had a moment to relax for a second. Management was good but didnt pay to much attention to their staff unless there was a goal to be made. the money was good and they did let you work over time if needed which was a plus during the holidays.
good,work is fast paced and my day gos vary quickly i love it but the managers are vary bad at posting our schedules online so im never really sure when i have to work again unless i call as ask every day which i feel like im being a pest but hey i got to work to pay bills
good,great job i just don't like to be judged off of what I sale i'm not a sales type of person
good,"the pay for loss prevention is very low at this site.I learned alot about police procedures while working as a detective at Macy's. I also learned interviewing skills,investigative techniques. The most difficult part of this job was apprehending shoplifters and dealing wiht confrontation. That was also an enjoyable and learnign experience.My co-workers were very knowlagable and experienced detectives and taught me alot."
good,"Working at Macys was an unexpected opportunity. Although I was promoted fairly quickly in the company, I am looking to work in the non-profit, social services, admin, collegiate and customer service related fields. I initially was working in non-profit and decided to leave my employer to focus all of my attention on school. In that process I decided to obtain a few hours at Macys for the holidays. I was immediately hired as a customer service supervisor and promoted to a Macys Executive Manager within three months which is the current position I hold. A typical day at Macys would be to manage your current clientele which includes personalized sales and corporate sales accounts. This also includes to create new clientele in various creative ways."
good,"My typical day at work involves alot of walking. I help keep the fitting rooms clean and return merchandise back to sales racks. I help customers in the store. Some need help finding a certain item and some ladies want my opion on a out fit they had chosen. When necessary, I help the sales clerk ring up a customer's purchase on the cash register. I can take cash or process a credit card. I work with nice people. When I need help, I know whom I can count on as well as they can count on me. Me and my co-workers has fun each day at work. Some times the customer gets in on the fun. The hardest part of the job is that its a never end one. I'm on my feet the whole time constantly moving."
good,i just loved working with my co-workers the job itself was ok but after being asked to step down to a lower postion and asked to train someone else to do the job i already knew how to do and did it fast and effeciant i was pretty much done with the company
good,"A typical day at work for me is easy-going for the most part, it gets hectic sometimes, but it makes me preapred to take on anything. I've learned how to handle situations. Management is ok, but needs a lot of improvement. The most enjoyable part is interacting with customers."
good,Store now closed down.
good,I learned to handle money and interaction with clients have patience and also be convincing to sell them a great item.
good,"Fast-paced environment that uses minimal hours as possible, trying to create the most productivity. I have learned management skills and using technology in a retail work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is creating a fun, active work environment with my employees resulting in great productivity results."
good,Overall Macy's can be a fun place to work. I have learned to stay open to other things because loyalty isn't always the most important thing to some companies. Management does the best with the resources they are given. The hardest part of my job are the sale days and weekends AND HOLIDAYS. The most enjoyable part of my job is when customers walk away satisfied!
good,A typical workday would be running around in the store helping customers find the products.
good,"Constant Interaction with customers, Providing outstanding customer service. Management gives you the opportunity to earn. My co-workers were fun and friendly. The job was not hard , although the most challenging part was taking care of several customers at once. The most enjoyable part was the incentives."
good,"Living in New York, and working in the retail industry was a dream come true."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I work 7.5 hr. I have to prepare the merchandise to be sold on the selling floor. I first receive it, start processing it, putting all the different skus or upcs together. Put it on their respective shelves. Go down for an order list to bring it down. I`m in charge of returns etc.."
good,"Very Busy - reports,customer service, challenging, employee issues. Work very well with management and co-workers."
good,nice and outgoing people to work with
good,Macy's is a comfortable place to work but that is not always a good thing. Macy's is a great place to gain skills since they really allow mobility. The con to Macy's is that the compensation is not as impressive when compared to doing the same job some place else. But sometimes getting a lower pay but stability is good.
good,"Worked with Management team to meet and surpass last year to date numbers. Helped custermers with cosmetic purchases. Trained, managed, and supervised employees. Booked phone orders and special events. As well as keeping track of presell goals, numbers and all client relations."
good,"work at macys is similar to any other retail job with the same routine, open/close register, greet and assist customers, keep work area intact and clean. i learned how to mult-task better and to limit the amount of customers i could handle at moment than taking on more than what i can do."
good,"Macy's welcomed me with open arms and it is a great place to work. I love the environment and the co-workers are great. So long as there is work to be done, the team is just that- a team that enjoys working."
good,I like the fact that you can make your own hours. I learned to stay to myself. Some managers are cool to work with. The hardest part is working with people who don't work. The best part is being able to make your own schedule!
good,This was my first job were I actually had to wear a suit in and tie. I also encoutered conversations with some the towns successful and productive business men/women. It made me feel important working in that type of environment.
good,Change prices and also put out new merchandise into the floor.
good,I enjoyed the structure of Macy's but wished there was more opportunity for job advancement and placement. I also feel that some of the job policies were very stringent and should be considered by the personnel working in the HR division.
good,"Organization of merchandise, selling, assisting customers."
good,"Nice place to work your always busy,because there are always so many tourist."
good,I was on call so my typical day would start off with finding out where I was placed. I met different people with each department I was moved to. I also go to learn about the merchandise in each department so I became a merchandise connoisseur. Management was decent. That was the first place I actually witnessed the management siding with the employees instead of the customers. They never backed down from a decision and I respected that. The hardest part was not getting aggravated from constantly repeat what items don't qualify for coupons. The most enjoyable was working with my coworker. We were all young and it was just a ball.
good,Macys is relaxed place with relaxed managers depending on your department.I've learned new alteration tools and skills even though i was sale's i figured out i should know some just incase of a emergency which there were many.I spent alot of time correcting my co-workers mistakes and miss leading information given to customers causing them to be upset by the time they got to me.But most of them wound up being happy returning to me.It was hard but turned out to be great in the end i gained loyal customers.The most enjoyable part was the compliments the customers gave me on my style and praises as well.
good,"Sales, customer service and loyalities is the main part of the job. Hands on, very easy and out going."
good,"A typical day at work is fast pace with continous interactions with customers. What I have learned from jobs is respect for all people both managers, co-workers and cutstomers. All jobs have their ups and downs you just have to remember that customers always come first no matter what the issue, its just a matter of finding a better way to approach. The most enjpyable part of a job is interacting with people and making them feel important."
good,Typical Day is very busy. Learn to deal with irate customers. Management is great. Co-workers work hard. Hardest part of job is staying confined to a chair for hours.
good,An internet customer service representative answers calls from Macy's internet shoppers. Typicals calls can consist of placing orders to having questions about the shipment of your order as well as merchandise you see online which may not be availale in the size or color you desire. Most supervisors are lazy and the management is clueless. They do have loads of events from blood drives to support the American Red Cross as well as free mamagrams for females & cultural events. The call center also consists of credt customer service representatives & collection representatives.
good,I folded clothing and assisted customers with their needs.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Provide customer service, Co workers was a great group of people. Some of the management was very unprofessional. Most enjoyable part of the job was the smile on the customers face."
good,"Everyday, I was responsible of fixing the merchandise on the sales floor. I learned how to deal with different types of customers and how to help each one of them find what they wanted. The managers were kind, and always treated me with respect. I loved interacting with the different customers we had everyday and it was a pleasure to help them in whatever they needed."
good,"I worked before the store opened, so it was mostly working without any interruptions.."
good,Macys has many shifts to fit anyone schedule. There is plenty of overtime around the holidays.
good,"May work longer hours than the usual, and multi-tasking, which I felt completely fine with. Enjoyed working with my color team except for immediate manager, as she was condescending and unprofessional. Worked alongside with Production and Buying teams."
good,Working at Macy's has been fun. It has enabled me to work in a fast paced professional environment. It has also assisted me in developing better retail skills.
good,"Go in and have tasks to keep you busy throughout your day, I learned how to take your time with each customer, no comment on management, coworkers were the best and the nicest people ever, meeting new people"
good,"I knew I went for the season, and I also knew from my college background I would fit in well with management. This job is great for people making extra money but the advancement atleast in my two years of working seasonally is terrible!"
good,"After working for them for 3 years, I would have thought that by then I would have a full time job with them after the seasonal position was over. I would still go back to work for them, because i had a great experience."
good,it was extremely hot and they barely wanted to pay us anything for the heat we sat in. The pay did not match the work req.
good,Worked here for 6 months and honestly it was ok except for some of the managers. Loved meeting new people and being able to know i made someone happy just by helping them pick out an outfit.
good,"Great place to work, in a Customer Service enviroment. Policy's in coupons and discounts are very confusing. Hard to get a manager for Customer questions or concerns."
good,"really demanding with opening credit, no incentives, no benefits for part timers. Would call last minute to give you a day"
good,"Good company to work for, however; p/t benefits none. Flexible hours program is good."
good,"management really works to accommodate associates, phone customers can be hostile"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,It was a nice job for the exception of having an issue with many different managers giving diffrent direrctions as to confuse the workers as to who they are to follow
good,"My review is based on my experience from working at Macy's for over a year. While working there I learned some more skills  and made friends with a few coworkers, over all Macys is a good company to work for ,the problem was in management it's very poor management there"
good,"The good:  Work can be fun, especially if you like working with the public and are a people person.  Plenty of opportunity to move up, although the higher you go, the more mandatory hours - which leaves little room for work/life balance."
good,"Not the worse place to work, but needs improvement in company culture. Pay is on the lower scale, and sales goals take precedent. That being said the people you work with are caring and make the job worthwhile."
good,Diversity is a huge core value and customers always come first! The company is always trying to grow with new ideas and innovative! Love how involved in helping the community and charities!
good,"working at macys helped me develop a lot of leadership skills. My manager was very helpful, respectful, and supportive of me at all times. Working here, you need to be prepared to work hard."
good,"The people are nice. Working 4x10 would be nice if I was actually scheduled for that. One day a week is not adequate. There are plenty of hours during Christmas, which is a window of 3 weeks."
good,I feel that many of the managers are hypocritical when it comes to their policies. They tend to use the rules whenever it suites them the best.... Abuse of authority.
good,"Great experience working with Macy’s , the experience was very good , the people working there are very nice ,always answers any questions about the job"
good,Typical warehouse work.  The only thing that counts are your speed and numbers. Long hours on your feet. Pay is ok.....................................
good,full time would be nice not just seasonal employment .  It was a good place to work if there were more hours available.  The work is very tedious especially when you had to get up early and get off early.
good,I like coworkers. However the hours are not always good times. I am hard working and I enjoy working with people. I have made great friends at Macy's..
good,Would be a good place to work for someone who lives in the area. I was driving an hour and a half to get there just wasnt worth the drive for me. The work was very easy.
good,Hired in seasonal No hrs to offer employees Very unorganized Very disappointed a waste of my time.......................................................
good,The good was having a job. The bad was doing work when they need you then if they didn't they say you are stealing time you can go home. Working in the kitchen was difficult at time it depends on the preparation I had to do
good,I liked my time there. As a seasonal employee finding hours after the holidays is very difficult. Its a great work environment. it can be disorganized at times but that rarely effected my work.
good,The company always looks out for the best in us. They treat us fairly and I enjoy going into work every day. The company is definitely moving in the right direction.
good,every person gets a part time position for you to get full time you have to be there longer than 2 years and you m must be a monster at your job description you have to always be on time never late never absent
good,It is good that this company provides you with seasonal work but it would be nicer if the wages was a little higher providing that you have to be on your feet for 10 to 12 hours
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"this job its a place where i learn a lot and i enjoyed working with clothes, fragrance and makeup station to the making sure the customer are satisfied   when i got to ring them out"
good,Great clothes great place to shops but work wouldn’t recommend it people there will not like you for no reason Terrible experience it was a fast pace job but full of drama wasn’t a healthy environment
good,Macys warehouse was a nice job. the environment was professional and very businesslike. they treated their employees well and encouraged productivity for rewards
good,"To pick up the slack of non-productive performers and no recognition, appreciation or compensation for additional workload.  Not enough staffing to ensure all aspects of store operations complete in a timely fashion."
good,"Macy's is a fun environment, co-workers were fun to be around with, schedules are flexible, I really loved working there. Managers were easy and made it more fun to work there."
good,"Work culture is great"
good,Culture and management at Macy's is admirable.  Staffing is very insufficient which makes the job very hard.  Love my customers.  You need to have a very high work ethic to endure.
good,Sometimes you can do up to so much but it’s still not good enough for them. I wish management could be a little more understanding to how hard it can be to reach the standards they set.
good,Im a good worker and i stay to myself i dont bother nobody and im at people person as well. Im a very hard worker i can work with amy and everybody. I always come to work on time.
good,"I've seen Macys at Redding, Ca decline over the past 14 years. We were all about customer service in the beginning, now it's hard to be there for our customers because there are so few associates to give our customers the quality service they deserve and need. I wish Macys was the way the company use to be."
good,My experience with this company overall was not very diverse. It consisted of very simple tasks with not much room for advancement in any field or department.
good,"Department culture does not truly sign with over company culture. Company culture is great, but individual department cultures are heavily dependent on the tone at the top and there seems to be minimal accountability at the higher levels of management like VP and Director."
good,Macy's is a good job I'm just looking for something with better hours the pay is good and for the most part they take care of their employees the main thing is they can do their training a little better
good,"I worked in the home department and it was nice. It wasn't busy at all only on black Friday. Very relaxed place to work, downside was the dress code was all black, pretty boring."
good,I neither love nor hated my job. I like fashion and being able to help customers find something that made them feel and look good but there never seemed to be enough coverage on the floor or time to get a full 40 hours.
good,I like it here at macys great job and it's a friendly environmental place to work...I would be happy at times that I'm going to work because it's fun and you can make good money there
good,"Season employment. Good job to have for the winter. It was very busy during the holidays, as you would expect. The managers were able to keep the store calm as business picked up."
good,I learned a lot about working in a retail environment.  I enjoyed working with the staff and customers.  I did not like the retail hours.  The store was open for long hours during the holidays.  I enjoy interacting with the customers.
good,"Working there was fun because it was something new every day "
good,Great job I just could not afford the commute back and forth it was too expensive on the gas. Yet I would stilll recommend this job for anyone seeking seasonal part time employment
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Employer keeps popular non productive personnel around for far to long before the are released from employ. While those who work are given the additional workload. The non productive personnel are usually moved up to management positions, to keep them occupied.  If you work hard you will earn better wages, if your manager is paying attention. If not you burn out and seek employment elsewhere. It is easy to hit a dead end at Macy`s. Health insurance is a joke and a waste of money. Also Macy`s sells employees information. You have no say in that practice. If you want to work at Macy`s then you agree to it. Welcome to spam heck."
good,"I have worked with this company for short term. It was nice job and interesting. All the time meeting new people it is not pouring job at all. "
good,"help customer build that ideal look for back to school, interview, ext. "
good,"It was very hard to get hours into my schedule, because the scheduling system was very ""Cut throat"" people would always hold on to a schedule that they know someone will want, and switch with them; at the same time not allowing other people to get their hours in. And if you were to get hours from your manager/supervisor, it would always be a full 8hr shift to closing, and very hard to balance. "
good,You would really be productive at work. You will feel a bit pressured in passing yoour KPI's and when you do it's really going to be self-rewarding and you will feel appreciated.
good,It’s an okay job to start out with if you are looking for a first job and have never worked before. Management it’s decent and scheduling is flexible which is nice
good,"The job was one that I enjoyed as we fold clothes and if a customer had any questions as to where something was located, we answered them and showed them what they needed or where they needed to go."
good,It was a good place that start as a first job. Learned a lot about fulfillment and floor planing and seasonal sells . However is not a place where you grow up professionally.
good,I like it there. They have a good discount. I like helping customers. I work in the at your service department. You can buy online and pick up in store. And I process returns
good,Kept me full of life esspecially since I was their retention guard for the holiday season. I wouldn't mind working for the company for the Long haul. I try to work as many hours as I can to the extent that too much is taking from me. I wish I could have as many hours as I want but I'm limited to a health condition. Hopefully I get the chance t shine once again.
good,"You come in and make sure the registers are open."
good,Fast paced environment and enjoyed working with the public. I enjoyed my interactions with my clients and coworkers. It is exciting to make people happy and give them what they need.
good,"Just like any retail job, Management is a weak spot but overall a good job to get experience in the retail field especially during the holiday season."
good,"A typical day would consist of reviewing metrics and business acumen from the previous day, store opening procedures, touch base with Vice President/Store Manager, touch base with Executive Team. Morning rally with sales associates to update daily sales goals, credit goals and give motivational speeches. Customer satisfaction, hourly sales, daily employee coaching, sales meetings, and daily goals. Banking procedures and daily security and closing procedures."
good,The job was too demanding for too little pay.You are very underpaid for too much work on top of that it was a very stressful work environment..........
good,"I usually walked about 10 miles a day. Good supervisor, manager as of 2019 in active dept. Not so good. Learned job fast, pretty easy. Standing or walking all day. Need to match Amazon's wages"
good,"Es importante dar buen servicio al cliente y mantener una buena relación de trabajo con todos los empleados. Recibir incentivos y reconocimiento es importante para el trabajo que hace bien su trabajo. Trabajar en equipo es importante, seguir las reglas y entrenamiento de trabajo es importante para brindar un mejor servicio al cliente"
good,"The people can be rude, most of the time my co-workers and I tried to follow policy the managers wouldn't back us up so they could make the customer happy and the store could lose money."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,stressful place to work out during the holidays. Customers can be very rude so bare with them. Also patience is crucial when working at a fast-paced location such as Macy's.
good,"Ya know, after being there for almost 3 years now it's not great. Management is always bad. they never hire good counter managers.They dont care about anything except Macys Cards. They been promising to promote so many on call but never did cuz they were too lazy to do the paperwork. Idk man"
good,"My job here was always different even I was in picking,or I was in packing,or they had me in different sections there I was always doing something, I even went and worked with the pallets loading or unloading"
good,"It is indeed a good first job for anyone who wants to get started in the Retail industry, especially with department stores. I just wish there is plenty of room for growth and development."
good,"Since I've worked during the holidays, the workload was pretty heavy. I had to serve about 50 - 100 customers per day, assisting them with their purchase, getting their online orders, or doing the refunds."
good,Macy's is an ok place to work. It offers health insurance if you work full time. It also offers 401k which is great. The managers are easy to get a lone with.
good,"This was an average retail experience."
good,The work enviroment was fast paced and required detailed work performance. The most enjoyable part of the job was the breaks as we stood up long hours.
good,Great if you want to work in customer service and have a lot of patience especially during the holidays. Would recommend for young adults and those who need flexible scheduling.
good,My experience at Macy's was good and my co workers were very helpful.i like working there because it's easy fo catch on to the job and basic skills and training of the job itself
good,"I learned, being patient with customers. I also learned i pick up things uite fast learn fast. I would also say it could be a fun environment to work in, if you're friendly i had no issues."
good,Work expectations are clear and goals are set to encourage employees to work hard to achieve the set goals. Management and HR need reminders to follow agency protocols and procedures for investigating and reporting to employees.
good,It really depends on the location of where you work. For a seasonal job it's really good. You learn a lot. I worked both at Glendale and Eagle Rock. Glendale was super busy and would demote people. Eagle Rock was easy and people were there for a long time.
good,"Workplace culture varies on store and location. Some locations are sheer joy to work at...others more challenging. It all based on the team and management. The customers are the best part of Macy's, build your relationships with your customers and you will always enjoy it."
good,it was a great job..great people.managers that listen and care.. i learned many skills that i took with me into other jobs..the hard part was just keeping up with the orders
good,Everyone was nice which made me feel comfortable. I worked the 5am shifts which was cool because then I had the rest of the day to do whatever I needed to.
good,"i was a contractor my experience with the Macy's office that i worked at does not reflect on the company as a whole."
good,"If you do not mind the typical retail hours and mandatory holiday work schedule, it is not a bad place to work. Room for growth, fair pay, great discounts."
good,"Overall environment was upbeat-Holiday musi always playing. The managers really tried to keep peace between all employees, however, most of the ladies I worked with were not so nice-very cut-throat atmosphere for commission. The full-timers seemed to resent the seasonal helpers. Most enjoyable part was my customers -finding the perfect outfit for that special occasion was very gratifying."
good,Not very fun sometimes. Most team members were good to work with others didn't so their jobs. Always had at least one customer come in and yell about something.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"great place to shop wen they have sales or lots of clearance . clothing are great and shoes are awesome and don't forget the makeup , purses and perfumes. good employee discount and many departments to work"
good,Maintained accurate records of inventory levels in the warehouse. Picking items from shelves and taking them to packers to be shipped off to customer.
good,"This work is very physically demanding, and does not provide many opportunities for rest. Management was usually accommodating when possible, but would speak address when your work was less than stellar."
good,I worked at Macys for 10+ years. I had many different positions. Met a lot of wonderful people there. Most of the time management was very helpful. I think if I liked most about working for Macys with a flexible schedule
good,"I do not remember my work in Macys very much because it wasn't very exciting. All that I remember doing is folding clothes, and helping customers find clothes and checking them out once they are ready."
good,"The roles within the store are very separated within the hierarchy, however there is a certain level of collaboration. Minimal stress of commission or goals. Most store executives uphold company standards."
good,Macy's was a very fast paced and competitive workplace. I came in early a lot of days and stayed overnight just as many in order to prepare the store for holiday sales.
good,Need to cross train employees in different depts. Need to try to hold on to the more dedicated employees. Most days coverage is light. Spend a lot of time doing recovery in most popular depts. Need to partner up new employees to train. Too quick to turn new employees loose. Too many call outs. Breakroom and restrooms are awful need total makeovers!
good,"You can work there if this is your first job experience. I learnt how to multitask. The hardest part of the job is, communicate with people nicely. Working behind a register is the most enjoyable part."
good,"I was hired on for the Peak season in the pick department. I was excited at first because the job was very close to where I live ( ~ 5 minutes ) and the pay and schedule was pretty good. That feeling quickly went away a few hours into my first night, because holy mother of god is this job boring. Nights, or days, whichever you're on, will just drag on forever."
good,"The warehouse provided a good working system and a good working environment . A typical day entailed getting a brief direction into the area and tasked to be performed, from that point on work was executed."
good,"Maintain the office"
good,Stay far away from store manager not the nicest person you will meet other then the the job is lovely you will enjoy it there and the customer are wonderful so are the employees
good,"Productive and Fun workplace"
good,It’s okay to work here. Managers are very uncooperative but Pay is good and work is easy to do. Shifts are perfect. Macy’s workers are awesome people to work with always !
good,"Building relations with customers, stocking departments with product and maintaining neat and orderly appearance, great management teams willing to assist."
good,Macy' is a fine place to work but could do more to compensate employees. They're having a hard time retaining top talent due to lack of desire to keep employees.
good,"Never a dull moment working in Loss Prevention, always busy and exciting. Being, I came into Macy's with experience, I did like my job and considered to be an asset to the Company. Although, like most retail chains, there are always more Chiefs then Indians. I just happened to work under a great Manager, and was also blessed with a great Store Manager. But, then you had a Manager from each individual department in the store, and a Lead who was second in charge. Then, you have a Marketing Manager, Operation Manager, then outside Managers who oversaw the other Managers, and so forth. Working in Loss Prevention, everyone is watching you like a hawk. If you make a tiniest mistake, or look at someone the wrong way, or say something that wasn't appropriate at that particular moment, everything gets noted, and then questioned, even if there was no wrong doing or intent, then reviewed by yet another Manager from Cooperate who hasn't even seen the inside of a retail store and making judgment on your character and behavior. Unfortunately, once you leave the company for whatever reason it may of been, the company makes it very difficult for you to return back.  After, 9 months of employment, never missed a single day, and saved the company thousands of dollars, I asked to take off two weeks, as I was not entitled for a vacation, they said 'NO', forcing me to resign, and  left on good terms, After the two weeks I tried to return back to work and reapplied to get my old job back but, Macy's made every effort to deny me that opportunity. I did eventually, submit another application, and was"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Working at Macy’s was stressful because the company wants you to get credit cards application at any cost. They only way you would  qualify for health insurance is if you were a full time associate and if you were part time you would only receive dental.
good,"Job support, guidance and teamwork varies per store location.  There is varying levels of in store management involvement. HR contact process not timely or convenient - none in stores."
good,"pros: Employee discount, fun job if you like working with customers, management is OK, satisfactory Health Insurance if you work full time"
good,"I enjoyed working there. Helping my customers. Making a connection with them. Love the discounts"
good,"A typical day was greeting customers, help with finding merchandise, ringing up purchases, and opening new credit card accounts."
good,"It's an OK place to work, but there are certainly better jobs. They have a system in place called Reliability. It's a bit unfair asking you to came to without fail even if there's a problem in your family or have a tendency to get very ill."
good,"I enjoyed the projects I would do and the people who worked at Macy's but the hours were really bad I want a full time job."
good,"Traditionally known for having poor customer service, but everyone works hard. I liked the management and people I worked with. It’s very difficult managing labor, especially with online shopping."
good,"This job pays you well because the nature of the work is menial, stressful, and the most repetitive work you'll ever do. Opportunity for advancement is present but the amount of positions off the phone lines are practically non-existent."
good,Could’ve been a better experience. The management wasn’t bad but the back of the house was very dirty. Rodents were everywhere. Leaks and old cardboard hanging around.
good,"My seasonal job at Macy’s overt the holidays was one of the most fast-paced, multi-faceted, challenging and engaging experiences I’ve had throughout my professional life. I believe it prepared me well to deal with the public in a polite but confident way, to juggle multiple demands and be a flexible and adept problem solver. I think my experience there served me well for any future service positions I may enter."
good,"Great people to work with. The workload can be quite demanding for the facilities department. We have s lot of autonomy, but a lot of expectations as well."
good,"I have worked for this company before, and the process and attitudes keep changing. Before, you could go in, interview, and be offered a job on the spot. Now, if you do not have open availability you will rarely be offered a position. I am a college student and decided to try anyways. I was given a phone interview, and then offered the job through a call center. I let the center know my exact schedule, and asked if this would work. They said yes, evenings and weekends were ideal for their college students. I was offered a seasonal position. When I went in to onboard, it felt like I was very unwanted by management.  I got the impression because this person in particular chose not to hire me for a previous position, they had an attitude that I was hired over the phone and not by them. When I went in to enter my availability, it would not let me put in availability until 6 weeks out. When I tried to call the office to sort this out because I was getting scheduled during class times, they told me there was nothing they could do and I needed to talk to my manager, who only needed me for early mornings. Call center and store need to TALK."
good,Everything here was fast paced and easy to do. Very simple work just cleaning after customers and helping them with whatever they might need. Longer hours were a downside though.
good,It gave me the opportunity to advance early into a leadership position. My skills that obtained from outside of work were sharpened and fine tuned.Skills that i can take farther moving on in life.
good,"Working at Macy's is not 100% bad but if you are not getting credit cards on a regular basis get ready to get lectured every other day. You have your average customer and a few regulars and the many angry customers that are upset for many reasons but mostly because they are impatient. When plan is not made there will be less hours. Work environment with coworkers are great and if you are a generally friendly person you would have a great time working starting out. You can not help it when the days are slow. Customers are not buying $100's worth of stuff all the time when it is slow. Also again when plan is not made then there will be less hours but some people get more hours than others and it's not fair. if I'm a person that's working part time there is no reason for that person to get 8 hours for the week, at least give them a minimum of 12 hours a week. Lastly I understand that it is part of our job to get credit cards but if you can tell that person does not need another credit card or clearly does not want another card it's not fair to bug the mess out of them to get one. In the end they would leave a bad customer service review for the fact that you kept going on and on about the card as if that changes the situation."
good,"In my experience, after leaving cosmetics, there was no proper training for the different floor dynamic. It was a trial by fire and extremely anxiety inducing. They were also not accommodating to those with mental disorders, absolutely did not acknowledge anyone who tried asking for accommodating."
good,Working at macys is not hard all you have to do is follow the companies policies and try no to lose your mind. Work is easy but the scheduling is always a pain in the butt.
good,"It was okay working there, most of the tomes work was slow trucks wouldn’t come in, pay was decent could’ve been higher. It was a seasonal macys warehouse job"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"It was alright their to work, just sometimes I feel like when you need the help they wouldn't really help. but other then that its ok, I worked their during the seasonal time so maybe that's why."
good,Its a busy day at Macys where we make magic to our customers. We greet them with a smile and pleasing manner . We ask them for their requirements and do the very best to make them happy.
good,This job was at the Macy's Distribution Center and not Macy's the store. Here I mostly worked in an assembly line and it was teamwork but we also work alone at the same time.
good,Stressful when busy. Most people were nice. Push getting customers to open credit cards.Lots of clothes to put away all the time. Customers throw clothes on the floor and leave fitting rooms a mess.
good,"A lot of the workers were running around with their heads chopped off. Very disorganized and not a friendly management environment. Made some good friends, but I wouldn't recommend."
good,"The work is pretty bland and easy once you learn everything, which only takes about a month; however, the workplace was always enjoyable. Everyone there is really nice, and I did learn a lot while I was there."
good,Macy’s was alright to work with to begin with. It became a little strenuous on the body over time due to the demands of the higher ups. The numbers were all that mattered.
good,"It was an ok place to work . I loved my co workers and the managers. Everyone was so nice and friendly but I got screwed by someone I once knew, no details ."
good,I love to challenge  myself with any task and  work hard. I feel that  when Im working I can   learn new and challenging opportunities from. everyone.
good,It's not much too say because my experience could of been way better and the hours were all over the place especially since it was never a set schedule you could only pick up hours or be called in if necessary
good,"my duties are to maintain and organize merchandise , greet customer with a smile and provided assistance with locating and purchasing items , styling mannequins, maintaining a clean and organized work space"
good,"Most employees are only paid minimum wage while having to do multiple job positions at the same time. There needs to be a surplus of employees in order to give customers a pleasant shopping experience. The lack of staff makes it harder for employees to focus on their primary jobs. Eventually, employees end up leaving due to financial stress and being overworked."
good,"Overall good community, the people that work there are always nice. The workload is pretty easy. I would recommend if you are looking to work retail. Hours are fairly flexible."
good,"In Macys I provided customer services (helping customers with their needs and wants), i also learned how to interact with people and make them have an enjoyable and memorable experience while they were at macys"
good,Working there was okay kinda stressful at times . Having to do the job of 3 people in a 6-8 hour shift was not fun.  I did manage to meet a lot of people.
good,I worked in the shoe department. Macy's provides training for new hires which was very helpful. I enjoyed the flexible work hours and chance to work in different departments.
good,"If you are someone who is interested in working in retail/or at a department store than Macy's for you."
good,Normal retail work environment; some are cool some are messy most are just there for a paycheck and a discount. Nice discounts and Macy’s has some of the best quality merchandise; customers are on the higher end of spending so the level of ratchet flow through the store is lower than other retail stores.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I loved all the people I worked with. Each manager was helpful. The customers you build relationships with are loyal. Great Security members. The associates are welcoming.
good,pay is not great will not pay the bills coworkers are sneaky and catty feels like high school not much organization some benefits but not worth it thats
good,Working there was stress full they were not organized as  fair as shifts and hours. Breaks and lunches you never got off on time poor management in some sections.
good,"Huge Corporation with philosophy of pleasing and satisfying customers. Liberal return policies "
good,"some managers dont know how to talk to sale associate"
good,I really love the warwhouse.i especially like the scheduling. I was always able to schedule days off that were important to me when I needed them. Overall it was a food experience.
good,"I'm a former Federal Government employee and Macy was my second job some of the managers are out of control, some would follow employee in the parking lot and some are very disrespectful and they need help I would recommend Macy for young people to work there but you must have thick skin to deal with the managers and the customers,"
good,"Worked in Women's Shoes. It's a job where there is a pretty good amount of training, but once you're done with that, you're literally on your own. Never had meetings, discussed our sales or anything. Would walk in and see a sign with 30% off, and that's how I'd figure out there was a sale. Still, the commission was worth it. Plus, it can get super hectic and fast-paced during the holiday season."
good,did not like that we had to ask customer to open credit cards and that the other employees was not nice due to the sales comp. It was a cut throat work envoriment.
good,"No hours, you don’t even know who the manager is or who to ask for hours how to even call off or who to tell"
good,The work schedule was ok. Willing to schedule me around my regular job.  Always changes assistant managers and high turnover rate for sales associates.
good,"Before the store opens make sure no clothes are on the floor, make sure clothes on the table is folded.  Make sure fitting room is clean and a clothing rod so by the fitting room door so customers may hang up the clothes that they don't want to purchase. The hardest thing to do is to keep the fitting room clean when a sales is advertised and ringing customers purchases up."
good,"the company is good but the managers talk to you any kind of way. I liked working at macys the experience was good but the customers was nasty, the hardest part was getting the customers to opening a macys card"
good,"Macys is okay, it would be more worth it if they didn’t pay so little. Pay is little and raises barely come . The incentives we get every couple months are helpful but not much."
good,Macy’s was a fun new journey for me working with people that was interested in teaching me new things and the attire was uniform based but due to security reasons
good,I enjoyed working with the public and loved working for the company.  Management was never satisfied with your work performance. They always expected more than you accomplished even if you met your goals.  Stressful sometimes.
good,A job that depends heavily on who you work with and how well they can be depended upon.  Depending on the store you could be extremely busy or bored out of your mind.
good,"Rate this company"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The should have better security for people items they get stolen and don't nothing happen to the people who be taking people things they should have to pay the people back somebody stole from me there
good,Typical day consisted of assisting customers with products and promoting of products. I learned how to work with the public and how to read people.  Management was easy to get along with.  Sometimes hitting my sales goals could be difficult.  the best part of my job was my coworkers.
good,"Loved working as a team to accomplish individual goals. My managers were awesome, always there when I had a question or concern. Daily morning meeting to know where we stood as a company/store."
good,"You could get hired on full time but only if you were in ""good"" with the bosses. I worked 3 12s +. Also I didn't think the pay was enough for the work."
good,The job was amazing yes I wounld work there again and it's good money everyone is friendly around the workplace gets along great and do your job and everything will go smooth and easy
good,"My experience of Macy's was ok. I worked Dadeland Mall, kendall. It was fun experience. I only worked for Christmas season. It's not a bad company to work for."
good,"0 advancement opportunity no matter how hard you work. People get clique like and band together. Asking for help is a crime, and they change the way things work month over month"
good,"Good first job, for students, or retirement job. I was part-time My co-workers and managers were helpful. HR point system is not great. Discount benefits are very good. The hardest part of the job was pushing credit card applications."
good,"Depending on the department, you have the opportunity to learn a lot in your role that you can ultimately carry over into another position or company."
good,Great part time position to gain extra money. Flexible with scheduling. Short hours available. Gain great customer service skills. Quick and easy to learn.
good,It was hard work standing on legs for long periods of time. I liked dealing with customers though. The Christmas spirit was everywhere. The managers were not that strict.
good,"1% comission lol, customers get wild when you don't bring shoe early or can't find pair. Fun job since you see alot of pretty women. The amount of work doesn't match the pay."
good,"Honestly, I think Macy's is a great place to work at. I love how you are under the union so you are protected of getting fired if you didn't do anything wrong/get laid off. I would recommend Macy's to people who are great at sales, because if you excel in sales you have an opportunity for management as a seasonal manager, only downside I have is that if you work for Macy's full time you cannot have 2 specific days off/ have your school schedule honored. Having certain days off specifically is only for part time employees according to the union."
good,"Its an okay place to work. You are part of a union so you definitely"
good,"The job has good hours the people there are professional. Management is a bit hard on the workers at times but thats because they have high expectations. Since I started working at Macy's Ive learned signing, markdowns, and planogramming"
good,"Everyone’s competitive... very weird ... team work doesn’t very much apply to my location. I learned from this location, on more customer service skills, how to deal with all types of concerns and customers from all over the world. A typical day at work for me is helping customers, cleaning, and adding clients to my book. The most enjoyable part of the job is the wonderful customers that we get and the amazing stories and personalities I have met."
good,I enjoyed working with the people I worked with. Management tried their best and held everyone responsible for their own share of job requirements. Sometimes with their goals it was a bit unrealistic.
good,My boss was great.  The pay was not good at all and the hours were minimal.  I picked up Loss Prevention to get more hours and more pay. I loved the Loss Prevention part of the job.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I worked in the cosmetics department for a few years and it was nice interacting with customers making them feel beautiful and helping them make purchases.
good,I worked as a Signer at Macy's for two months before starting college. I worked early hours before the store opened to the public and ended usually before noon.
good,Not my cup of tea. I believe that the management was poor at the King of Prussia location. It was still good customer experience for myself at the age of 17.
good,"I had an amazing manager. I worked in the handbags section. i learned how to properly use a cash register. I learned how to do inventory. Learned how to organize the stockroom. I had an amazing time greeting, helping and getting to know customers and their preferences. I learned how to process returns. Basically, I learned a whole lot of thing being that it was my first official job."
good,A typical day at Macy's is running around trying to help customers and make their visit as good as possible. Working together is a source we use a lot in our store we enjoy helping each other and making other happy.
good,"The management is the biggest problem. The store was being renovated and such so that's a plus, and most other employees were ok, but the management of Macys was horrid."
good,"Fair employment "
good,"I work with alot of great people, but the pay is very low in non management positions. This is an idea position for a college student or retiree, but hard to provide for a family otherwise."
good,Though I enjoyed this job a lot of times I felt overworked because of the fact that I always closed and always worked weekends which we were always under staffed.
good,"it was nice experience to work in ,dealing with customers ,customers service and more .good team to work with ,helpful ,friendly teem , week management"
good,"Very fast-paced work environment. Great benefits, nice co-workers.. Low pay, merchandise returns are very high, is very difficult to get any commission."
good,I wish Macys was more involved in their employees lives. It’s very sales driven and competitive space. Overall it’s a good place to work. The people that work for the company are really good people
good,"It was a pleasant place to work. Fast paced and structured. "
good,Macy's is a great place to work.  I loved everything about Macy's I still do.  The hours were unrealistic for a full time mother of 2.  All in all it was fun
good,"Mirco mangement at the work place. Very few space for growth and improvement. individuals were very helpful, however, management was not. Negative place to work."
good,Macy's pay periods are great. You get paid every week. I didn't like short breaks after very long time period of working. I liked the schedule system. You can swap schedules or have a fellow employee pick up your day with just a click of a button through the Macy's employee website.
good,"I had a few good managers, I was happy to be under them but when they left things changed a lot. It was ofent hard to find the right people for the job."
good,"They work you like slaves especially in the knotter drive building. Management  can be very disrespectful at times, more so when it gets a little busier then usual. They hire every and anybody.. Not a good thing at all!"
good,A lot of favoritism and pay was average and not alot of overtime only when they see fit. No real team or work ethics and most people there are negative. Work was average done days and sometimes not there at all. But u are forced to be there.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Everyone at macys thinks they're saving lives... they think every single decision is either going to get them promoted or fired."
good,"Hours and work is not always guaranteed, gladiators always freezes and work comes in slow, managers always disappearing, everybody so worried about who dates who..some so unprofessional!"
good,You work so hard the customers don’t take care of what they try on. They don’t care. The company expects the Sales associate to do everything and you don’t get any commission. People that get hired after the first day go to lunch and don’t come back.
good,This is a good first job to start out but not if you want to advance up the company they do not give their employees very many hours. If you are part time or flex other than the discounts there's not a lot of benefits.
good,"To work for Macy's, you must be a self-starter and be willing to learn on the job.  Training is given but is primarily computer based.  In order to enjoy this job, you must be fashion-oriented."
good,"the job was probably the easiest job ever. the way i could pick my own shfts was great because i can pick whenever i want to work. the co workers were alright, so many people changing places you cant really form a relationship"
good,I have been with Macys for 10 years and I loved my job but in the last 2 years the dynamic of the company is changing. They are counting the hours of the support team and expecting them to do the same amount of work but in less then 5 hours. And there is no support for us.
good,"The company ideals are there, however, they all fall short. There's zero work life balance and you are often expected/urged  to work longer shifts, I think we can do a lot more to support our colleagues  and make us more competitive."
good,"I worked in jewelry which was easiest department, small crew. Easy job but low paying. All you had to do was show up on time and had no problems. Almost fell asleep while standing so boring."
good,"Macy is way below other companies including Bloomingdales they pay better than Macys. Also the promotion within sucks. Manager don't care for their employees all they want is numbers result, nothing else."
good,"Fun, and intersting enivroment for workers proper pay and very friendly enviroment customers are nice and managment is up to the task and willing to give proper instructions"
good,"This job is fine to have as your first job in NYC, but I'm 8 months in and am trying to get out asap. I can't believe how employees are treated and have gotten to see the real ""magic of macy's"" aka trying to fire people by accusing them of stealing, not getting a pay check and having to go through heck to try to obtain it, etc. Some of the managers will talk down to you and treat you like you're stupid, some people won't talk to you unless you bow down to them, few people will have your back. Customers expect you to be a robot that poops rainbows. Just another retail job you'll end up hating."
good,"Nice place to work most of the time. Good customers make the job, and supportive managers. As a sales associate you will work--- hard.    Opening credit is essential as a job requirement, and you're given a small to medium bonus everytime."
good,"Typical work day you come in and start a fulfillment list. Fulfillment are online orders you have to pull each day. You work on sales and credit goals. You have to open 4 credits a week. Management is really hands on and we have great team work. Macy's has a great workplace culture mangers provide coaching and tips on sales credits and customer service. Hardest part is not have items customers are looking for, most enjoyable is work with my team and co workers."
good,It requires customer service skill and helping people to fine a right item that they're looking for and also learning about fashion design industry...
good,"The workplace culture was very diverse. I was able to meet all kinds of different people , which was my absolute favorite part about the job. My customer service skills grew from Macy’s because every situation you come across everyday is different."
good,"The Work Culture Was Nice, There Was Lots of Help When Needed . Depending On The Position You're Working It Can Be Slow Sometimes Or You'll Find Yourself Being The Only One In An Area."
good,Working in the office at Macy's was not always the best. Its challenging and sometimes super busy but if you have a good team of people working with you the job get's done.
good,"It ok to work on, I will recommend to some people I know. And a good place, hour is ok, I always get my 40hour a week, get along with the employee and manager."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"CLOSED/No Longer Open"
good,There were many times when there were not enough associates on the floor which made working efficiently hard but managers would help when they could..
good,They provided me with a great opportunity when no one else did. Great team environment. Scheduling was very flexible. You where able to give up shifts pick up shifts. Work at your on pace.
good,I only work here part time don't know what they offer as a full time employees. it was ok at the time when I was young and didn't have as much responsibilities as I do now
good,Enjoyed working there. Was moved when needed to different departments. Meet some amazing people. Very friendly and welcoming coworkers. Discounts were awesome.
good,"I honestly LOVED working at Macy’s and I want to work there AGAIN but they sucked at training. They just THREW me out there , only training I had was on the register."
good,Better management and a huge lack of communication. To big of a turn over because of the management. My favorite part is the walking and order picking.
good,"Competitive, productivity driven culture with customer relations paramount and sales education role critical. Scheduling, vendor relations, sales promotion important."
good,Work extraordinary bookseller magnificent bland boring helpful overwhelming management. Tough intense. Unorganized. Tread lightly. Don't do it. Not good.
good,"Managers don't really help you out and they've got a lot of funny business going on. They do talk bad about seasonals but don't offer to help or give any advice/feedback. Many of the coworkers don't treat you so great if you are a seasonal. Getting to work in different areas in the store is great and makes you more a confident worker. Ive heard how the managers talk about their employees to others. Definitely cannot count on them to teach you or help with any advice. Go backs are a hassle when you think you know where something is but people change it around in the morning. Some customers are very rude so patience and working under pressure is definitely needed. I do feel as seasonal and part/full time workers are separate groups but getting to know coworkers and making friends is great.  Overall great experience because and almost friendly workers make it worth it. Flexible hours are great, you just need to talk to management. They do help with that."
good,I loved macys the hours were great i like my work enviorment and the people around me my employers help me alot tgru my begining process so i had the best traing
good,"What can i say, it was a place to learn from.  People are nerve wrecking.  Management is clueless, not able to have a conversation with anyone.  Felt like just a paycheck."
good,Little work life balance but you will get one weekend off a month. Good vacation but hard to use it because a lot of months are blacked out. It is a plus they pay weekly.
good,If you work in a top 50 door then you have all the things you need if not then your store team has to figure it out.... it all looks amazing on paper and the videos are so encouraging but applying it in reality to the work environment that is another story.
good,"Loved the job, but not a good place to work.  No room to grow in the company. Not appreciated for the work you do. Pay is good, and the benefits are good. Many good supervisors and managers, but there is favoritism. Lots of drama."
good,Standing a lot. They give you pretty flexible hours and breaks. There isn't a lot of down time. Somtimes they bring donuts. it's pretty okay. nothing too cool. Free clear bags though.
good,"You will meet good people and that will make your experience at macys worth while. Even if you do not make it a career path, you will still enjoy all the exciting adventures that it will bring you."
good,This job is good for people who have high tolerance for standing for long periods of time. There were days where I just stood there and organized the racks.
good,It started off really good (my 1st manager was so good she got promoted and moved away) and it went downhill really quickly after that. Its very long hours on your feet. The Manager and store manager that I had towards the end were horrible but dont worry they are no longer there..................................
good,"Cashier, floor duties, fitting room duties to assist customers in returning clothes.  Learned a little more about customer service. Management was very understanding and open door policy was good.  How to handle Irate customers."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,If it weren’t for the lasting friendships i made at macys id have given it an even lower score. Macys inly cares about the dollar signs. Ive seen so many people laid off because they’re not doing well as a company. Long time employees let go and less qualified less paid employees taking their place. Besides making your goals macys forces you to sign people up for credits. Poor management along with not valuing their employees makes it not a safe or warm environment.
good,"The typical Macy's Sales Supervisor salary is $15. Sales Supervisor salaries at Macy's can range from $11 - $21. When factoring in bonuses and additional compensation, a Sales Supervisor at Macy's can expect to make an average total pay of $31,500 to $45,000 or more based on your experience."
good,good for students to work and learn basic job skills. hours a flex-able to students. easy and laid back work. easy to get along with co-workers and customers.
good,"Logged in, answered calls, logged out. Great opportunity to learn in's and out's of HR. Managers are very flexible. Hardest part is being tied to a phone all day."
good,"When i was working there, i enjoyed showing the various items on  display for the holiday season, some nice dresses, nice shoes, and nice winter coats to go along with the outfit and things of that nature.  i like recommending my opinion as to wether or not an outfit was flattering to the customer's liking."
good,"Learned a lot here, managers were relatively decent, customers were the norm, holidays were crazy, pay was great.  Commission was better!  Overall decent job"
good,I worked in Sacramento.. great staff.. good room for advancement.. i worked in multiple departments.. great team meetings... loved to dress to impress.
good,Good atmosphere. Always had something to do. Always got along with my co-workers. They helped with the training right now and everything I needed or if i had any questions they would always be very cordial and help me very quick.
good,Working at Macy's was my first job and it really set my vision for any jobs I wanted to have in the future. In that sense it aloud me to see how I should be treated by others (including management) and what it's really like to work as a team to meet deadlines. The only problem I had with working with Macy's is that the wages are low and I wasn't given enough hours for it to make an impact on my life.
good,Only worked there seasonally (November-April). Worked in the fragrance department as a cashier. My coworkers barely acknowledged me unless I was talking to customers. They worked on commission and were very competitive with each other.
good,I wouldn't mind working here again if I needed to. Its a great place for students or a starter job as they teach you how to be responsible and take care of business.
good,"For the few months that I worked for the company,  it was bad, a bit hectic at times, something I'm used to, lol the pay & overtime was great. I met tones of awesome people I even got a few appreciation cards from My fellow coworkers."
good,"you'll learn as well as your trainer is. "
good,"Fun place to work but no real chance for advancing. Part time is great if you dont need money or benefits. "
good,macys was a god learning experiance and I enjoyed it. I was the shift lead in Mens dept. They lost me ue to low pay. I would have stayed had they paid me mor money.
good,"I think managers need to be more aware that some parts of the store are not as busy, therefore, it makes it very difficult to make your commission. I wish they let me work more at different areas that were busier."
good,"On my very first day the employees were very rude and did not seek to my need to my assistant when the manager was not around. If there are negative people around the store the energy is not positive. Furthermore, I would say that a few employers from the management team are productive and helpful."
good,"Best of the company gave great family environment."
good,Working in a factory you can either sort orders or pack orders. U can pick the items there are a lot of employees and constantly on your feet and working in a fast paced environment.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"arrive at work and start working right away,  lunch and then more work after that it was more work and then more work on top of more work i need to fill in the 150 charters"
good,"Its was my first job but it really opened my eyes ,Working at macys is not for everyone you have to deal with alot of incompetence from everyone. And if you're a seasonal worker nobody really takes you seriously it feels like they assume that whatever you do will be mediocre and not up to their standards. The training is paid but its horrible, you get thrown onto the floor and are expected to survive and you sit on a computer for 10 hours in a cramp little room, goodluck"
good,"Great team to work with, flexible hours. Great discounts and benefits for staff members. Overall good part time job, nice and knowledgeable team members."
good,My time there was an okay one. They started me out with 40 Hours a week and it stayed like that my whole time there. The Management was good. I learned to we shipped merchandise to customers.
good,Extreme micro managing of store level executives results in a competitive yet hostile environment for a career path.  Company has been on a youth mission and has been selectively removing and or pressuring older managers to resign.
good,"I dressed windows, put up signage, promotions, events, decorated store for Christmas, rearranged furniture in their furniture department,  dressed manikins, set up new fixtures, did all displays."
good,"The coworkers and management were very nice people. It was fast paced, there were chances to work different departments as well as training for them and it increased your value."
good,It was a good work environment safe and the people were very nice. I was taught how to drive a cherry picker also how to how to pick at a fast pace.Overall it was a nice experience.
good,"Begin work on time"
good,"Magic selling to customers is an acquired skill. Works for some customers. Enjoyed training with many managers, good experience leading to better career. Great starter job for College kids, not so accommodating for more seasoned adults. Career growth prevails if you work hard, but higher ups are often ""catty."""
good,"Nice place to work, good environment,nice mangers and nice people to work,very beautiful store and very nice customers.working on weekends were really busy and I got to meet people from all walks of life."
good,"Assist customers in all aspects of service fulfillment and qualify customer needs."
good,Macy's has really good management and they are really flexible with your schedule especially when you're in school. The hardest part about the job was customers being disrespectful and rude.
good,"This was a seasonal job so the first 2 weeks were for training on how to use the designated computer program. The workplace culture was good, management was encouraging and friendly."
good,"It's a retail job, not great just a typical job with stupid bone headed managers that are always nagging you and will make you do tediuous waste of time jobs."
good,Not guaranteed hours they say part time but then schedule for 40 hrs plus. No benefits required to work 32-40 hours even though your only part time with no benefits only sick days.
good,"As soon as I arrived to work, an assignment was always given to me . Whenever I finished one assignment, management would immediately start me on another assignment. Some managers were willing to listen to the feedback that was given, while others abused their power and treated me as the help and belittled me."
good,"Sales driven for sure, you have to be able to allow sales to drive your day it is super pushy and numbers is the mail focus even though it should be the customer"
good,"the hardest part of the job is when to make apprehension are the is no one to help."
good,Very fast passed for the environment. The staff was pushy and wanted everything done super fast. Customers are also very rude and don't care about you.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"You must work most holidays, a lot of nights, better as a part time job then full time job. Never enough people working on the busiest days. The pay was decent but employee turnover was high."
good,Its been a while but I remember it being like a everyone for themselves type of job I would love for managment  to care more it's like they only care when it benefits them or the company
good,"Co-workers or Customers you have to interact with everyone. Even if you're a recovery worker you're expected to answer the customer's questions, if you can't then show them to a co-worker you know who does(if they're not busy and can help you out). Knowing the layout to the story will help you greatly in any position. The Macy's dress code is flexible enough to allow sneakers as long as they're black if you're uncomfortable in dress shoes, as long as your outfit is black on black, you're good. Co-workers are friendly and the break room is nice place to relax or go on break."
good,It helped me in learning what I wanted to do with my career.  I have had the opportunity to work in different departments and learn more about the company.
good,Future is uncertain.  Amazon is big competition for them.  Can be fun interacting with customers at times.  Fairly easy hiring process.  Make sure you get all of the work hours possible.
good,It was a good temporary job. But I don't think I would have liked to stay there as a full timer.
good,"It's a good job for peak seasonal work, but after it does not provide any hours. The people I worked with were kind and helpful. Most of the time I was very busy taking care of customers and preforming other tasks simultaneously."
good,"Learned a lot skills , communication, visual, hands on , and great customer service skills , learned about merchandise. Learned about stocking and placement."
good,It was a good place to work for but they really lack in help during the busier hours of the day. My typical day was cleaning the fitting rooms organizing the racks and helping customers check out there items or do returns.
good,"great location to work."
good,A typical day would be standing by the cash register and helping customers with anything that they needed from the store.  Folding and restocking are also duties that I had to complete during my shift.
good,i enjoyed working at macys as a seasonal worker and if i dont have a job at christmas time i know i can always work at macys and 14 days srtaight if you want and that i did they are nice checks
good,At times can be very boring and slow. It is only interesting when a customer is in your department. You can talk to them see what you can do to help..
good,The coworkers I met became such wonderful life long friends. Management on the other hand were not focused on ensuring the employees were taken care of.
good,Trying to always be open for your customer is what Macys is trying to do.  Just added cheaper options to try and stay relevant.  Brands are not what they used it be
good,A typical day at macys was very fast paced and busy. Your numbers reflected how hard you worked and your ability to keep up with the work flow. Very friendly people
good,You can’t use your phones so if you love your phone you won’t want to work there and if you have leg problems then you will be walking and on your feet a lot
good,i love to meet different people. working with a team was the best part working there. We work together to get things done. I love helping customers who are not familial with the store.
good,"The hours for someone in school, which is myself isn't fair I would say. They would schedule me from 6 AM to 12 pm even though I have school then there would be weeks where they wouldn't schedule me at all. I would have to pick up shifts but none of them fit my school schedule. There was no working around the hours for certain shifts."
good,"good and fun place to work in, good environment, good place to start your carrier, enjoyable job , good workplace culture, good management and good staff to deal and work with"
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,it was ok. told id get raise in 1 year. did not so i quit. other employees were nice. Management was ok. Had to start shift at 4 or 430 in the am which was not fun and was forced to work black friday.
good,"Sometimes it’s very slow , sometimes it’s not. It was a seasonal job ... 9/10 They made us ”vto” Voluntary Time Out ! People have bills and other things to do with their money !"
good,"It was a seasonal job, so hard work and intense hours are to be expected. My supervisor was very nice and checked in to see how I was doing whenever I could. One thing I did find strange was how the new job orientation included an entire video discouraging workers from joining a union. It made me more suspicious of the management, to say the least."
good,"I had a good time working here. They hired me even though I was pregnant because I was qualified. Everyone was super nice. I always looked forward to going to work because I was never bored.  I worked in all the softline departments. "
good,"way to long ago but a fun place to work always something new and exciting going on.  very busy store due to the location, exciting place to meet people from all over the world and assist them in their shopping experience."
good,"A typical day at work as a shoe expeditor lead would be to check the workload calendar to see what projects need to be done. This is communicated to you by your Manager. Performing a daily audit to ensure that all shoe displays are out on the floor, executing shippable fulfilment and then when the store opens, expediting shoes requested by sales associates, who would then deliver it to the customers. There are plenty of different projects that I would delegate and assign a team member to perform such as markdowns, inventory scan, mismates, stock, and deadwood."
good,"worked during the holidays, so it was ethic when helping the customers. liked that i can choose my own schedule and what department to work at for that day."
good,it was a part time job to get the bills paid so I was satisfied with the job. It can be fun interacting and helping customers especially during the holidays
good,"The hardest part of working at Macy's was helping the customers because I rarely had to ask help when it came to locating a item in the store. My job was always making sure that the clothes where displayed and ready to be sold. I would sometimes  have to work the register and help make a sale which was also difficult to do too because I did not know what I was doing. I would always have to ask for help and stop others from doing their jobs. Since I was only a temporary employee there, I had to leave because I was lacking the process of working at Macy's. I had only myself to blame."
good,"A very busy, multitasking company. But offers little support. You have to find your own resources in order to succeed. Friendly staffing, but compensation does not meet workload requirements."
good,"The workplace culture of Macy's can be stressful. Every department has a different manager which can cause miscommunication for breaks, or little product knowledge. Employees are taught to follow company regulations such as what are acceptable returns. Various times managers accept a return when a customer is returning a used or expired return. This causes the employee to look like a liar and confuses employees on what regulations should be followed. Departments can be very short staffed which causes long lines, a mess, and annoyed customers."
good,"A very friendly work place where we have weekly meetings to deided our goals. "
good,I unloaded truck and separate items to be placed on the display floor.  This was a temporary/seasonal job.  I worked the early and sometime evening shift to secure heavy shipment.
good,"I loved Macys in Tampa Florida, the management was very organized and appreciated it's good employees very well. Had i stayed in florida i'd be probably still working there, great management"
good,Macy's provided me the skills and experience to provide exception customer service and  gain retail sales experience. They also provided a flexible schedule
good,"I was kept busy, packaging and shipping, my days went smoothly, customers were kept happy, no under appreciation was shown, employees were so friendly, it was well organized"
good,Customers can sometimes be entitled and unnecessarily rude. Management would often overcompensate for the customer's manufactured displeasure. Employees were grossly underpaid.
good,"Macy is a typical retail department store. Looking nice and meeting sales goals is very important. Management is usually under a lot of pressure to meet their goals, so you always have someone on your case about sales."
good,A typical day was learning your sales goal and reading the daily flyer with all the statistics regarding the sales and credit card goals. Also folding clothes and restocking racks.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,very good it soo god that i need to think about what else to say for this topic i am 84 characters away from being down and i dont think there is lol annoyed
good,There are some good days when customers come in and the merchandise is easy to locate. I learn to be patience and kind and most of all how to handle a irritated customer and let them leave the store in a better mood.
good,Seasonal job for the holidays . It’s a job for young people who like working.  There’s a lot of floors and a lot of walking and a lot of standing I get tired
good,"I worked at Macy's when I was 19.  I remember it was a bit disorganized, but the staff were very easy going and fun to work with.  Holidays were unpleasant."
good,"I have always said Macy's supports training and development of their management and associates. Great opportunities, and you can travel too with all of the positions."
good,They only paid minimum wages plus commission. A lot of pressure to reach the sale goal and not enough money or benefits for the employees. co-workers were nice and the manager was friendly but always stressed out.
good,This is a seasonal job. I wouldn't mind working here permanently.I just feel that the employees don't get so touchy meaning that they don't flip on you talk behind your back and give you problems this is almost everywhere now even with the customers. The customers are saying that their experience isnt always a good one because the employees are into their own feelings and dont know how to just fake it but they can fake everything else its should be in the hand book for macys like be fake even if you dont want to smile itll make you and the customer feel 10 times better and show your manager you ant to do your best i cant fake it i like people i want to be liked and get credit for my work and like i said im working to stay
good,"Interesting company that provided my entry into the Beverage industry. I was only there in a p/t role, so my decisions and influence were minimal. I had great co-workers."
good,Assisting a team with sales and overall merchandise organization. You are also a sales associate which means customer service is highly recommended for this job.
good,It was good to work there I liked what I did and the people there were actually very nice and helpful and I loved the customers the environment was nice.
good,My location provided distant training and a lack of usable knowledge. I often felt abandoned in times of need and lacked the basic knowledge to perform the duties they put on my plate.
good,I would recommend Macy's to anyone looking for additional work. I worked there quite some time ago so I can not comment on what it is like to work there.
good,"Fast pace environment causes for the time to go by faster. Great place to meet friends. Good work environment, fun, and easy job. Holiday season and get super busy."
good,My time there was pretty fun. it could be stressfull at time beacuse of the clean up every night but that clothing retail for you. i saw alot of stars that came in and shopped.
good,"Overall, I left Macy's due to burning out after years of working there and struggling with not having hours to help pay my bills. The hours I would get and pick up had bad times for the area I lived in and it was unable to make my sales by any means."
good,"The environment was very competitive in the suits department, and the company would fail to remove toxic employees due to a fear of being sued. Management was very hit or miss."
good,The managers and supervisors have their favorites. You end up working more than other associates. They do not give the days that you need. HR doesn't listen to you when you go tell them about the treatment you receive.
good,"I spend 10 hours a day in prep which means I'm opening and preparing all merchandise to be put away and later picked for customers orders and I locate well over 15,000 dollars myself alone everyday and they pay us a very low 11.00 an hour I feel being such a high end store we should be paid at least 13.00 an hour it's unreal that they are so inconsiderate"
good,Not a bad place to work if you like working with people. Nice to travel for work conferences. Benefits are ok. Recognition is not the best. Environment is good.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,It is a OK place to work. everyone is nice and they do care about you to a point. The job can get stressful or boring and mundane. I would say seasonal is great for high school students looking for a bit of extra money.
good,"I didn't have any problems working at macy's but, it's management is a little disorganized. It was very flexible when it came to working hours. and vry good when it came to discounts."
good,I was a cashier in the jewelry department. Cased out customers with a credit card debit card check or cash. Guide them to see what piece of jewelry will be the best.
good,Its a decent place to work for the benefits are up to par and you do get health benefits. The only error is they should have the part timers get full time benefits
good,It's a great company to work. I enjoyed my time at Macy's and learned a lot. Most of the senior leaders genuinely care about the employees with the exception of a few District VP's and District Director of HR that play favoritism.
good,"Worked at hecht company and then for Macys. Started out as sales associate and then went into management. Loved working for Hecht company, great family feel. Macys not so much."
good,"Macy’s wasn’t bad. Working in the mall, people were very gross and the fitting rooms weren’t kept clean. Macy’s management was okay for the most part, but they wouldn’t listen to the employees when it came to changes."
good,Macy's has alot of opportunity for advancement but don't become a 72 year old lady who has worked there her entire life. Macy's can become very depressing - other than that it's a decent job for a seasonal worker to move up in and eventually move elsewhere.
good,My role at Macy's was moving from department to department being the specialist in each one. From sporting goods and fine jewelry. Make sure that I reached my daily numbers in Sales
good,"Ideal place to work, unfortunately I believe there is a lack of mentorship and guidance. Lots of movement and office work. An hour lunch which is nice. The associates are fun but the management can be the other way around. Lack of communication between associates and upper management."
good,"If you need something on the side its great, but for living off of, not so much. I only got an average of 19 hour weeks, not nearly enough to pay my bills."
good,As a cashier I have worked with customer and working in different department from Jr department and cookware department to dress-wear department. Its Flexible to work at Macy's
good,"I had great fun working here.  Customers were great, management was fun and engaging. It was an easy job to go to every day. "
good,"it is what you expect for the most part, dealing with customers and employees hardest part is during the holidays crazy hours and no place to park during holidays so plan to be late for work or coming an hour ealier before your shift to locate parking."
good,Macys was one of my first job and it was beneficial to me because I was attending college. The hours were great and they had part time for me I would of not stayed there for full time.
good,Not a bad company past on time job wasn't far the sites were not bad sites The gave great hours and provided a great opportunity to grow within the company
good,It was a very stressful place to work in. It was too hectic and the managers were not specific on what you had to do or the area you would be assigned to. The breaks were too short for a very long time of working hours.
good,"I was hired seasonally and was on call so had very few hours, but was still required to join labor union which took a good portion of the pay received."
good,"Macy's is a great place for College students. Macy's is very relaxed but is also fast paced. A typical day you'll spend keeping your area neat, while assisting customers with there purchases."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,was promoted within 4 months; all the good managers left; if you don't open a credit card management will not talk to you. if you open credit cards they expect at least 3 a day from you
good,I received great experience here the down fall is when they have a lot of people that call out and they beg you all the time to do 10-12 hour shifts and the clean up after hours is hectic as well.
good,This job was something different for me I have never worked 12 hour shifts and stood on my for the whole 12 it was a good experience and alot to learn
good,"Could be more pay, benefits for the people who aren’t full-time workers. They also should focus on who they hire as managers, some are nice & some aren’t !"
good,"The first part of my job was working underneath two managers organizing the sales floor. One manager in particular there was rude, strict, and regularly belittled me at the start of each work day. The manager was good at the job and kept the front part of the store looking good, but everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, hated to work with that manager."
good,"I worked as a floater between cosmetics counters.  Sometimes helped with special events or inventory maintenance, assisted customers with product choices and color matching."
good,"A typical day at work was steady."
good,"Overall it’s an okay workplace, the manager that I ended up with was one of the best perks of working there, very friendly and understanding with any of my situations."
good,"You take product out of boxes and sort/organize the product by size,color,and upc. You use an RF gun to process the product. You have a 30 minute paid break, and a 30 minute unpaid break."
good,"It is a decent 2nd job. I have plenty of co-workers to laugh and have fun with. We help each other out when needed. The company serves holiday meals, and sometimes they are catered."
good,"•	Lead personnel in inspecting, loading and shipping of thousands of cargo and personnel parachutes over a 4-month period. "
good,A good company to work for with many job opportunities. A company that values its charitable work and volunteer events in its local community.  Flexible with work schedule and placement.
good,"I worked at macys Concord mall DE. It was an ok place to work. It's fun assisting customers with their purchases. I was a part time employee so my hours varied. You could world like 9-3.30,12pm-9pm,11pm-6pm,4.45-8pm...pretty much not a flexible and defined schedule if you have another job"
good,cant really put much only work there for the summer was a seasonal job and I didnt get hired again after the season was over. mostly jamaicans in my department. and hardest part communicating with the strong accents having individuals and the easiest part bout the job is making people get the macys credit card
good,Good customer service well well respected managers nice and safe environment to work I would recommend anyone to go shopping now they will have a great experience
good,Macys is not a bad place to work. It's just that expect a lot from you with and they don't give you much to work with. Not enough equipment and the elevators and escalators don't work half the time
good,"Most Enjoyable part of the job is when you can go on lunch or go home. Honestly, I question whether or not managers care about who they hire anymore. It's like they're just pulling anyone these days, nothing is worse than seeing adults now do their job. Lastly, if it isn't the coworkers its the hours, Oh my god the hours. if you want to be a part-timer at Macy's DON'T. You'll spend more money on food and transportation and see no growth in your bank, I can guarantee you unless your being paid 18$ an hour you will be living pay check to pay check."
good,I worked for Macy's several years ago but overall it was a friendly environment with growth potential. The organization was behind in warehouse technology but was slowly advancing there technology
good,Macy workplace culture is not the greatest. They need to modernize their approach to selling and distributing their merchandise. Because of this reason Amazon is dominating the clothing industry.
good,"The worst part of my experience with Macy's was really the lack of consistency with scheduling. The job itself, at least the job I had was not hard but the work is repetitive and it won't be long before you're looking for ways to keep yourself awake. But plenty of hours are available and the work culture is very positive but kind of cliquish."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"It's a straight forward job in retail, but the managers were not great at training. This place's LP was terrible, she had a bias against me for some reason and tried to get me fired, but other than that Macy's was good"
good,Got to be in the cosmetics world and sending people home feeling better then they came. enjoyed my co workers. The pay was not what I wanted and the hours weren't either.
good,Working at Macy's can bring variety in day to day challenges.  They offer some training based on the department in which you work and most associates are willing to give advice about their areas as they become passionate about them and their return customers.  Friendly faces and excited shoppers were the best part of the job.
good,Business model became overly dependent on promotions and sales. Systems were cumbersome and clunky.  The day to day work lacked fresh ideas and new initiatives.
good,A typical day at Macy greeted every morning by co-workers. I always started my day by fixing my work station making sure I had all the necessary tools needed to complete my task and reach my goals for the day. I then proceed to fix my are of work by fixing displays and merchandise. Until the customers arrive. I will help any customer who ask for help or looks like they need help with finding an item then we would proceed to check out. Management will come and check in with me regularly during my shift to update me on my progress for the day and any promotions to offer customers. The hardest part of the job is to not being able to sit down when your legs get tired. I enjoy making the customer happy the most.
good,"Fun place to work, work consisted of helping customers ,ringing up customers, open/close registers, stocking floor, organizing merchandise. Some poor management but great store manager. Must sell as much as possible, no sales goal, must open one credit card account for every 10 hours that you work ,you get a coupon every time you open an account that you can use towards merchandise , employee discount 20% but you must get a Macy's card or they offer you a prepaid card in order to receive your discount ,discount appers on statement not on purchase . Some rude customer but a lot of frequent nice customers, overall good company to work for ."
good,Working in the department taught me a lot from interacting with customer to organize area and keep them clean. Some customer are hard to handle and some were easy.
good,I really enjoyed working at this job. The dept i worked in was great. i looked forward to going to work ever day. I also was able to buy most of my kids clothes from there because i was able to get employee discount too. This job was one of my favorite companys to work for.
good,Working at macy's was very relaxed the only thing that was hard were the long 12 hours days. The management team always helped you and helped out the hard workers.
good,"I worked in the office.  Love working with my supervisor we had a lot in common.  We work great together, we were both team players. "
good,"I was only a seasonal employee, but my time here was alright. I wasn't there that long, so I don't really know to much about the company. The only thing is that I had to be on my feet for 8-10 hours at a time."
good,I enjoyed my experience working for Macys. I do believe there was sometimes not enough direction or supervision but I was able to work under these circumstances but I did observe that not all employees benefitted from this structure
good,Fast paced. Nice people. Most enjoyable was helping customer find what they need. Location was close to home and the store was organized. I enjoyed the discount given to employees that work at Macy's
good,This is probably my favorite place to shop but when I decided to get a part time working here it was definitely not the experience I expected.  The sales associates were so desperate to meet quotas and stack up on commission that they would be cut throat when it came to assisting customers which made it uncomfortable.
good,dynamic environment to work in. its a team atmosphere on a typical day its fast-paced which consist of making many decision with little supervision. I learned how to handle people with act and skill
good,"Good corporate vision, however lack of personnel at the store level to execute it at a high level. Focused on talent development, which is great, however need tools to accomplish."
good,"Hired as only seasonal, trained me through a computer. Placed me on the floor and no one wanted to help when I had questions. Customers are extremely rude and had to choose my work days through an application online which all the seniority had dibs on schedule. out of the 3 months that Macy's hired me for, I actually only worked 10 days because of the application.."
good,"Management was poor, you had employees who had no management skills manage 20. They didn't even know if you came to work or not. They called me to go in for some one when I hadn't even worked there for two weeks."
good,learning new about the products on selling items.  welcome the customers and take care any problem then have with any item.  the most enjoyable part of the job with getting to know everyone and being treated like family.
good,Not a bad place to work. Schedules can be difficult but managers can move your schedule around and modify it if needed. Managers are understanding and very friendly.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Seasonal help ; part time "
good,"daily morning meetings, scheduled breaks and lunches, never a dull moment, always something new to learn, I loved the diversity of the staff members as well"
good,"My time as a district executive at Macy's was quite enjoyable, however during my 10 year tenure, my job was eliminated 4 times! Every January, the company restructures and positions are eliminated.  It's like living on death row...eventually it will be your time to be executed!"
good,Stressful and competitive but it taught me to be patients with people. I was a very hard worker. Came up with creative way to sell the product that I was selling.
good,During my time working at Macy’s I developed quick skills and helpful skills to make sure I was doing my job at the best of my ability’s.working on forklifts and being a cashier on some days Was giving me a good view of what goes on behind scenes. I would assist my delivery drivers to help deliver some items if needed.
good,"Labor is light, pay and benefits are fair, but advancement is usually a matter of favoritism rather than (or even despite) work ethic. "
good,The company terminated me without notifying me. I was then informed I can no longer work there. I was taken off the schedule and assumed my temporary seasonal position had ended. However they counted it as missed days after I was off the schedule. I can't work there again because I was terminated without explanation. I worked 40 hours a week night shift. It was intense.
good,i enjoyed working at macys its a fun and friendly environment very face paced a lot of multi-tasking i gained a lot of experience and worked it different departments
good,"I have been employed with Macys for almost 10 years. Every company has their flaws, but if you can adapt to change and excel at that type of environment you would have a steady career with the company."
good,"Not great pay but if you need a job and can handle customer service I recommend. A variety of positions to work ""Loss Prevention, Dock, Customer Service, HR ect""."
good,The people were nice but i was a temp and worked alone. It was fine I wasn't there long enough to really have a opinion. There is nothing more to say.
good,Great environment and management. Hours are too long. Not much of a work life balance for specific positions. Flexible hours. Pay not so great. Job functions vary.
good,Macy's is a fair employer although I would've liked to have had the opportunity for advancement. The customer service training has need for improvement.
good,"This job is definitely a lot of fun if you like weddings. The amount of work it requires is quite substantial especially for the low pay. There aren't many opportunities to advance... but if you are offered one, it will make your hard work worth it. If you are looking for a fun part time job that will keep you busy, this is the job for you."
good,I really enjoyed working for Macy's during the early stages of my retail experience. They have very high standards when it comes to sales goals and all other expectations.
good,I only work there seasonal during winter holidays but for the most part everyone was friendly & we were paid weekly so that actually was very beneficial to a lot
good,"Macys is a fun, cool workplace. the big problem i have the management is not really good."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I only worked there for Christmas season. The training was easy and quick to learn. Everyone was easy to get along with and if u needed to switch a shift because something came up you can do it on line and not have to worry.
good,This job gave me first hand experience when it came to customer service. Show me how to handle people when they are shopping in your store. Management was helpful and nice.
good,Anywhere u work u cant be lazy or u will have problems. This position was a commission based position and u have to work hard to make money. Attract customers with a smile
good,"Communication was lacking between associates and managers. "
good,I thoroughly enjoyed helping the customers find exactly what they were looking for. And especially liked when I could help them find something they loved but had never thought of or even considered before
good,Macy's is a good employer to work for if your are looking to establish your self. I would not recommend someone that is looking to grow within the company to work for macy's because it takes an extremely long time to even get acknowledge for a promotion.
good,"A typical day at work at Macy's can be very stressful as a Retail Sales Associate. As a Retail Sales Associate you are required to greet and serve customers, and at the same time open new accounts, fill outside customer orders, recover the fitting rooms which can be every hour returning hundreds of items to the selling floor, and opening/closing registers."
good,"Wouldn't want permanent position. Only good as a seasonal job. People are nice to work with. Got lost in the place at first. Slow after Christmas, not enough hours. They keep who they want."
good,"There's always pressure to sell but only for your personal benefit, if you don't meet goals there wasn't much to worry about, just try your best to meet goals the next time."
good,This is a decent company to work for if you're looking for some extra money or if you're retired or a student and need to work only a couple of days a week.
good,"Macys has a lot of turnover. Basic customer service.  "
good,"Hardest part of everyday is not being staffed at capacity.  Macy's has different weekly fun activities for it's associates, there is opportunity for growth.  Nice place to work, associates are friendly and helpful"
good,"sold clearance sales shoes on show floor, had iPhone capable of scanning merchandise to inform customers of product availability and sizes as well as the price, had to checkout sales and sell macys credit card"
good,This was a great place to work. Everyone that I encountered there was very professional. It's a shame I had to move or I'd still be working there to this day. Amazing benefits.
good,I enjoyed working there and I learned a lot  working in different departments. The hardest part of the job was working 12  hrs. shift .the fun part was meeting people of different background and culture.
good,"Too controlling.  Constant time management down to six second intervals. Discouraged employees communications on a personal level , even in slow times. Low morale"
good,Macy’s is not a terrible place to work at all but there are some outrageous policies that eventually pushed me to having to walk away from this position.
good,"Worked for Macys for 5 years...satisfied.  Don't have anything else to say...a part-time job   Worked for five years, worked for 5 years, worked for 5 years."
good,"This job was most certainly yet another stepping stone in my professional career, especially when it comes to my now unrivalled customer service skill."
good,A typical day at work is ok but kind of boring I’m use to a busy work place with fast pace but overall Macy’s is ok the job is for someone who’s very chilled
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macys is a good place to work.  Advancement based more on politics than work ethic, but an overall good place to work.  Can work comfortably in existing environment."
good,"Not sure what to say, I didn't work there long not enough hours and I have kids to feed. This job maybe good for high school students or someone who doesn't have real responsibilities."
good,i was only there for the holiday season. it had very low pay and the management is rude. they sit around all day and chat. this was he worst place that i ever worked at.
good,Fun place to work but expect loooong hours during holidays. Corp staff does discriminate and very unproffessional. if you can stay out ogf there radar it is actually a fun place to work.
good,the job training for how to handle persons that will fight is not very good. I had to fight off three females for over 15 minutes with now help which i was the back up person at the time. i was injured but i was okay because i have been trained and i am instructor in control force.
good,"As a sales representative, one is required to perform cashier's duties, like completing a customer sale, with a receipt.  Returns and exchanges are also part of the job.  "
good,"It could be a great place to work. However, there policy make it hard to make decent money. They are very pushy when it comes to getting customers to apply for credit. The emplyee discount isnt alwasy the best. And the way they pay those on comission is borderline robbery."
good,Management team is not comparative. Low Salary ..there is no high expectations . not great customer service. very poor scheduling system. low inventory
good,"I had early shifts, before we would open the store. The lights were always off so it would be a little difficult to see what we were doing when working. We would mainly do PC (price change) and it would be difficult to see in the dark as to where we were scanning."
good,"Great job for someone in school. Flexible hours, good discount, opportunity to get some good retail experience. Must have the patience to deal with difficult customers when necessary."
good,"The overall experience was good.  Good part-time compensation and weekly pay.  This job was physically demanding, as you would have to physically apprehend shoplifters."
good,"Good Place to work but there is room for improvement. I do customer Service and display and arrangement of department."
good,"I worked for Macys (formerly Daytons) for 34 years. I felt the best years were when it was Daytons/Marshall Fields. There was more focus on specific training, you became an expert in the area you were working in and the store was staffed accordingly. Retail is hard on personal life due to hours and management for the most part was professional and knowledgeable but  stretched too thin. Have to say it was the only retail store I would consider working for. "
good,"I do not wish to say very much. I worked in a small store, I knew most of my customers, it was over all friendly There were some stressful days when it was busy or demanding customers, but I liked the challenge. My fellow employees were like family."
good,"Can make decent money if you are an aggressive salesperson. Very unorganized, floundering company. A good job to work at Christmas if you need some extra cash."
good,"It was a blast working at Macy's! I was employed as a cosmetic sales representative for their Impulse brand. There was lots of training sessions provided by the vendors, and gratis to go around. "
good,i guess over all not a bad place to work some of their quotas are unreal but they don't mind pushing you to try and reach them but just makes the day go by faster
good,I like retail and looked forward to working for Macy's but ended up disappointed with management and almost a bully atmosphere from supervisors. Did not stay long with company
good,You get good perks as far as being there first to get in on the deals they were having. They offer scholarships for schools. You get the choice to take advantage of the discount
good,It was a nice place to work. I was just working there to get some extra money. When it became too much as of the work and i started to doubt my place there and left.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,its not a bad place but depending on position and if you like waking up at 4am which killed me. Im sure if you'd take a different position it'll be a better place or if you are an early riser.
good,okay job. ok environment. no pay. typical work. learned great customer service skills. learned how to be a self starter because you will need that if you want management to treat you like an adult.
good,"This was just a temp position for me many years ago during the holiday season. It was fast paced, impersonal and paid well at the time. I would go back."
good,Being a Visual merchandising manager gives you an opportunity to learn about every aspect of running a retail building.  The executive team acted as one and were well versed on how the store operated and how  sales affected everything.  Customer service was the number one priority.
good,"I worked at Macy's part-time to fill in for hours cut at my other job.  They do ok for hours and pay was minimum wage, which was a bit low for me compared to my other job."
good,It was fine but I need better and more and am searching for something new. Not enough pay and their isn't much room for moving up in the company. Management doesn't listen very well.
good,"For the small time that I was working there as a warehouse associate, it was a quick paced environment, a lot time being on your feet and making sure you are meeting quotas for the day as picking and unloading items that are being ordered online. Great seasonal job."
good,"It’s a faced pace job and you can make good money if you put in a good amount of hrs, we were mostly busy in the evening towards closing time and the management was very nice and understanding."
good,"enjoyed working with sales associates and customers "
good,The work is fine only I do not offer the 40 hours and I As a parent I need a reasonable salary to support My family already my family depends on me and I know and understand that I give 100% in my work.
good,"Macy's was a great place to work, good pay flexible work hours, great place to work. Would highly recommend to work there if you looking to get into retail."
good,As a Customer Service Call Center Supervisor the stress level was extremely high. Large teams and high coaching expectations made the position difficult with little support from upper management and no opportunity for advancement.
good,"Would not recommend if you dont like confrontation, people steal all of the time and you have to be able to catch them before they leave the store within the stores rules to catching them"
good,Macys is a good place to work it doesn't pay very well there is a lot of colleges leaving the company for a better paying job there is no room to move up in the company Macys upper management always brag about how many millions of dollars a year the company makes but doesn't pay there employees very good there are a lot of other warehouses opening that are starting off with more money.
good,Good fun environment friendly respectful corporation in those fixable and always fixing the problems  making the employees happy..All the problems is always getting fixed
good,"Good work experience, nice co workers, enjoyable space to work at, not much pressure on making sales. Helpful and patient managers."
good,There was no option for advancement. Management was poor and very cut throat. There was no sense of helpfulness from managers. It's good for part time but over all it's another retail job.
good,"Customer service, recovery of different departments and parts of the store, cash register, credit-card sign ups, and making sure all of customers needs were met."
good,"I was at this store prior to the 08-09 crash and just as May Co. &"
good,this was just a temp. job it was fun and cool experience and they were so nice and they listened the customers were nice we got busy sometimes but everyone was easy going.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Worked my butt off everyday making sure the truck was cleared off and unpacking the boxes and getting them to thew floors designated to each merchandise and always went home with blisters and lost a toes nail. it was the most horrible job ever and telling people about how you felt wasn't ever going to change anything.
good,was a good place on the busy season but after that no to many hours to work managers was really good but cant do much ether because they lost hours like any employ not any full time position not enough money to bring home
good,Great place great people. Always had a great time working with everyone at this store. It was just time to move on to bigger things. I couldnt and wouldn't say anything bad about this place
good,"LEts just say that I was freight, usually longs nights would be a common thing in that business, and being sleepy was a norm.  I had another job during this one, and they both were highly draining on me."
good,every location is different but when i did makeup at macys i loved the people i worked it and always had a great time. but each year they are closing more and more stores so positons get cut. job security is not that great.
good,I worked during the holiday season which was very stressful at my location. I was required to work long hours standing on my feet and was not allowed to sit. Was given a one hour break during the shift. also worked overnight for inventory.
good,It was good but it could be bette. I worked there during the busiest part of the season. its a great place to get a retail experience from. Some of the coworkers was great.
good,"First retail job, Mostly got this job because it was 5 minutes away from my home. It was an interesting gig, lot of towel folding and bed making(worked in the domestic dept) but it payed my bills. Lots of backdoor politics, only certain people got promoted- reason i left company."
good,Working for Macy's was not what I expected. Very unorganized and not what you would expect from a big company like this. The pay is not good and the management did not know the true definition of manager/leader.
good,Easy going great for college or high school kid who is ok with minimum wage. Not a life long career no major benefits definitely a transitional job for a younger crowd
good,A typical day at work: I don't remember much 
good,"I found it hard to advance at Macy's, although I have about 10-15 years working, in sales, HR, and administration. The process to get into management is very difficult."
good,"In my 30 + years of working at Macy's I learned to multi task, manage and develop new employees etc. I enjoying giving customers a wonderful shopping experience and mentoring new employees."
good,"I was an Asset Protection Director for many years and found the pay and benefits above par. I had two supervisors during that time and both were great. This is a very hard job on work-life balance and from what I hear continues to get harder everyday. I really enjoyed the people I worked for, with, and worked for me. But everyday you are buried with so much work and emails that if you manage to take a vacation you always work through it. Otherwise you are so far behind you never catch up, even with good co-workers covering for you during your time off."
good,I worked in Customer Care and Sales Department.Dealing with day to day problems of the Customers and increasing productivity through effective communication.
good,They don't pay enough for how much their products cost they act like your very easy replaceable I don't think they value their employees their food and drinks in the vending machines or refrigerators are very high priced
good,if you are into sales this may be a good opportunity for you. You must also be able to have patience and a good attitude for ALL customers. Even the rude ones.
good,This job was only temporary and to get Christmas gifts for my family. Management here wasn't to bad and I enjoyed helping people pick out Christmas items for their trees.
good,"Fun job top have while going to school, the management was young and adventurous and kept everybody full of energy we had a great team but then again it is whatever you make your team out to be."
good,The point attendance system was hard to work with. Not really flexible while i was attending school.  Other than that it was okay place to work. I was able to work in cosmetics and enjoyed it.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I have nothing to say about Macy’s because they promote people who don’t even know their jobs  there’s not really any room for advancement most of the employees are OK but just like any other place there’s all those employees that don’t do their job and don’t get in trouble for it
good,I liked working at Macys and the advancement potential was good considering they hired from within.  Really no issues with the job but that the center closed
good,good job for retail experience. job satisfaction does heavily depend on the managers and what culture they provide for the employees. flexible hours provided as well as benefits
good,"A typical day consists of being available to assist customers with products based on their needs, follow up on messages, sales, deliveries and customer service issues while maintaining company goals."
good,It's retail. If you want to work in retail and not have to actually deal with customers Start Team is the way to go. It's better than Start Team at Target and they offer benefits fairly early in employment.
good,"often over worked. had to deal with understaff quite often as there were never enough people scheduled.  Job and duties were pretty simple, just overwhelming with little staff"
good,"It was a creative job if you like fashion and you dont need to work to hard to survive. Otherwise not the best place to work paid rate to low, hours inconsistent for you to have a normal life living."
good,Working with customers assisting them with finding new trends in clothes. Training new staff members on register and how to communicate with the public. Working with a board range of people from different nationality was FUN
good,I worked at Macy's part time with full time hours. I was given hours of people that would not show up to work even on my first day and there was no work/life balance.
good,Good place to work as far as customer service. Loved the interaction with customers. Loved my co-workers. Everyone chips in and helps one another. Excellent company to work for.
good,Working for Macy's is great at first until you realize that it has a revolving door. People come and go and anyone can be replaced. Macy's used to care about it's customers and it's associates but since the new CEO the company only cares about saving money and making productivity goals. If you need a high paying job then this is a wonderful place to work but I do not recommend making it a long term career.
good,I never worked at a retail job where corporate goes to colleges to pick up management. Its shows me that at entree level its no room for growth and that concerns me. this made employee morale really low when I worked for them.
good,"I loved this position. I worked in MBA, Macys By Appointment a free shopping service.  I got to shop for clients, wrap gifts and meet our clients.  I am a shopper at heart so this was right up my alley. I am quite good at finding bargains.  Not only did I get to spend other peoples money, but I got employee discounts when I shopped."
good,Managers are not very personal. Environment is fast paced so if you don't stand out in your performance or personality you are likely to get laid off.
good,"Really fast pace, but exciting. Learning and help create new platforms on the sales floor for new promotions. coworkers are friendly and are very supportive."
good,"Nothing special, employee's were okay, somewhat nice. I learned to keep a place organized and move fast. My multitasking skills improved having to move back and forth doing another job."
good,"it a good place to work at, the staff don't discriminate, the hardest part of this job was to rearrange clothes, I enjoy meeting new and old customers"
good,"Having worked for Macy's 37 years.  Every company has there ups and downs and still love Macy's but need some changes.  Miss the old ways and the customer service.  Do not like to bad tald a company, however I believe in full customer service and always have.  Smaller company's tend to cater to this now and bigger companys have lost that way and would love to see and help make a difference in bringing it back."
good,great place to work as far as pay and benefits. lots of vacation and sick time if you are in management.  Holidays are awful and there is not work life balance
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,it was fun place to work. I worked at Christmas time and it was always busy. I was able to help people find gifts for their family members which was able fun to do
good,It was a good job if you were looking for extra cash. As far as living a good life you would need a lot more hours to pay for your bills. It was very hard to get the hours that you needed. Overall it's not a career job.
good,Training same as everywhere else. just show up and do what you are told basically. Job gets boring fast. Most workers would just make it look like they are doing something.
good,I learned so much about fragrance and this lead me to venturing to a brand ambassador position within the same field. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the field and interacting with new people everyday.
good,I was able to come to work early and if need be work another job afterwards to make extra cash. Work environment was good based on the supervisors personality and gel with employee.
good,schedule adherance is based on a point system which keeps everyone on pins and needles. You could lose your job for being 10 minutes late. Impossible sales goals and no raises
good,"Macy's is neither a thrilling nor severely disappointing place to work. Very average. Pay was alright (you got commission in addition to hourly pay), workload was definitely manageable, and the coworkers are tolerable"
good,operate computerized cash register. handled cash and credit cards trasactions. assisted customers with products selection translated for french speaking customers.
good,"too much work with less payment  good coworker, nice place  "
good,Working for Macy's Logistics was an extremely fast paced and competitive environment. Its a high demand job and requires an individual to be able to work self supervised.
good,this job was alright. you get tired of the customer keep knocking down clothes after you fixed them over and over again. It gets very annoying . sheesh
good,I enjoyed my co workers. The ever changing work related guidelines and policies turned a once enjoyable job to a nightmare. My manager was a joy to work with.  I only hope that when the dust settles Macy's will again be improved stronger and a good place to work.
good,"open/close register depending on your shift"
good,I like working at macys. But i am overly worked and underpaid. I am working more then any other employee because we do not have enough employees in our department. Im the one handling all the heavy clothing taking them back to the stock room. The pay is not that well. I have showed my work ethic and my loyalty to macys but i still am not receiving the amount of money per hour that i want.
good,"Great place to work while in college.It provides necessary experience that can be used in future careers, careers that are worked towards our entire lives."
good,I was hired for seasonal work but really got to know the job.  If an opportunity to stay on full time had been available I would have stayed.  It was a good place to work
good,"Applied for a full time position, but it was given to someone with less work experience because she knew the hiring manager. The work was fine and I was able to pick up extra shifts but pay was meager."
good,Good Career starter  . Got a lot of experience working with people and implementing company policies .................................................
good,Mary had a little lamb its fleece was white as snow and everywhere that mary went her sheep was sure to go. the last thing I want to think about is Macys
good,"Macy's is a job for college and high school kids, unless you are in upper management. They are flexible with the schedule.  The pay could be more. I enjoyed working in women's fragrance."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Low compensation and not great work-life balance. Great culture in NYC. Good brand value but a lot of internal changes and lack of coordination between teams
good,It is a fast paced environment. During the time I was there employees were evaluated based on sales performance and credit cards applications. Most of the departments were a fast paced and there was always something to do.
good,Advancement and salary is very questionable. There is an increasing amount of responsibility but not an increasing amount in pay raise. Management has changed but not for the best.
good,"A day at Macys was stressful most of the time."
good,Macy's was a decent job but not worth staying for the pay. I was hired as a seasonal employee and that was decent for the time being. Not a job to stay at.
good,"Long hours"
good,"I worked for a vendor in the location so whilst I was not working for Macys, However it was a nice placed to be a vendor in. Always a good enviorment."
good,"I worked there for 1 year and the people I worked with where fun to be around. In slow times my co-workers where there to make fun times, but sometimes it can be boring."
good,"the job was and is fairly simple -but it pays off if your competitive. that doesn't mean your advance or get promoted, they like hiring younger people with no experience in retail for those positions. but to make money you HAVE to sell. so if your sociable and hard working, go for it! but a chance to move forward is 1/1,000,000."
good,"it keeps you busy for most of time, the environment was pretty chill and everybody was nice to me for the most part i would suggest asking as many question as possible"
good,long standing company. always on your feet. learned selling techniques. management always changing. many seniors management  have left.  the stores have great products
good,managers lie to get you to work in positions that have no room for growth and when there is an opportunity managers do not do anything to help you out no one keeps their promises here and its just a giant gossip circle with cliques of old ladys not working all day
good,"I worked in the men's department. My manager was very high energy and extremely sale-oriented. I was not prepared for the amount of pressure she put us under in regards to making sales and ESPECIALLY opening as many credit cards as possible. Macy's believes in an aggressive sales approach which is not my personality at all. Fortunately the job also involved a bit of recovery and I did enjoy that."
good,"Easy work, but a lot of workload and small pay. Nice coworkers and bosses."
good,"I work here while I was in college. At the Montgomery mall, And the Wheaton mall  Macy’s is where I worked. I would work with them again if I had to. The management was friendly and always willing to help or train you."
good,"A typical day at Macys was very interesting, you didn't know what to expect for the day. The hardest part of this job was the rude costumers. It was enjoyable when it came to helping people."
good,"I tried to do my job well as much as I could. I had no problem with my coworker. I tried to do best everything that my manager asked me. I didn't have much fun, but it wasn't bad."
good,"You are entailed to work at a steady but fast pace, each department has there own speed of work. The company is a good place to work for. I have learned a lot from all departments. I do like the flexibility."
good,Macy's was a ok place to work. They did not offer much job advancement. Low pay and they did not take very good care of employees. Hours would include a 8 hr work day or more if you wanted.
good,Macy is an ok company to work for.  Low paying to start. Longer hours and lots of hard work.  Manager are ok.  Ok company to start in retail industry.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,if you like to sell then youll like working here. client relationships are first priority. maintaining a clean selling area and meeting sales goals are necessary.
good,"This is one of the best jobs I’ve had all the managers loved me I wish I could’ve stayed longer, but it was very fast paced but liad back at the same time you weren’t pressured to do what you needed to do but mostly you just needed to get it done"
good,"Typical day was assisting customers , helping the merchandising  team,and  helping out new associates learn about the job."
good,Overall a great working experience with great and cheerful co-workers to be surrounded with to make the working experience better. Working with customers let you have more interaction and be able to help them find what they needed.
good,I enjoy working for maccy's simply because you gain experience by working with different network sites. Not to mention you have opportunity to change departments after your 90 days to gain more experience. Giving the opportunity to become an leader over multiple people is a challenge but it's exciting.
good,would not recommend working here they give you crazy hours and they dontcare about helping you to advance its just a job for them not a career and they will make you work until the last minute of your shift then let you go
good,It paid the bills. Not great for work life balance. Pay not as good for what you do and how much you do. High turnover. Lots of changes. Some room for advancement.
good,Macys Inc. is not just an ordinary store to work in. The workplace can be viewed as an environment that thrives on genuine connection. Customers can easily connect with a sales associate if they feel as though the associate is offering genuine concern to their needs. Macys strived to make sure that we as employees did that for customers by allowing us the opportunity to connect with our colleagues first.
good,"Macy's is a decent place to work, however for most people retail jobs have a short lifespan. Since weekends are key days, plan on working most of them."
good,it was always dead and lots of times people had nothing to do and they scheduled your shifts for ALL DAY. so you work all day and essentially arent doing anything.
good,"Typical retail position, Asset Protection is a dying field in retail so be prepared for job cuts and position changes. If your position isn't eliminated then your peers position is and you are expected to pick up their workload at no extra cost to the company."
good,A typical day consisted of getting new product ready for display. New merchandise needed to get merchandised and put on the floor. I was a price change team leader and would also get those reports ready for price changes and delegate that to be done the floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing tasks.
good,Fun place to work. The salary is the lowest there can be in the retail field. There is very little opportunity for advancement. Performance Reviews were a joke.
good,"Walking and stocking merchandise in a warehouse is repetitive, especially during a 12 hour shift. Some days are fast paced and stressful, some days are slow, but all days are long. There is no longer an HR department at the Owasso fulfillment center."
good,Would use an invoice to find and locate items in there locations to fill customers online orders. Also would take new items and and put them into the system to give a location and location number
good,"A typical day at Macy's is greeting your customer, make sure that your go backs and returns are put away, for our customers, So they can shop in a cleanliness environment."
good,My main job at Macys is meals & breaks. I go from department to department to cover someone's lunch break or their short break. Depending on how long this person works that day.
good,"The Macys was a fast-paced environment, but the head management was something to be desired. I only stayed as long as I could so I could pay my way through community college."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I'm a people person so i enjoyed working with customers, finding skincare and makeup to fit their needs. Didn't require much managing but there were times when the manager would micro manage."
good,"Pros"
good,Overall I've Spent Several Years With This Company And I Just Appreciate The Opportunity  In Allowing Me To Gain More Experience In The Logistics Field.
good,"Fast pace environment, too much chaos. Needs better compensation as there is a lot to be done. Its a good starter job for a teenager in high school who needs pocket change."
good,Macy 's was a fast past environment to work that offered exclusive fashion incentives and cultivated a fun and free environment for consistent sales practices
good,"A lot of waiting around for customers to come in. It takes a little while at first, but you can really make a lot of money selling furniture. It just takes patience."
good,I work hard and gave a 100% effort everyday that i work at Macy's.
good,It was a good part time job. Can be stressful. The team was good to work with but the demands of the job were hard to meet. It was good having a rapport with the customers
good,"This is a company I miss and want to be successful. However, know you will work very hard mentally and physically to deliver on expectations. It's what you make of it! Macy's, please make the right decisions to be the amazing company you once were!"
good,"Moving towards Modern Technologies & Methodologies"
good,Working for the company Macy's has been a great experience everyone work together it wasn't a conflict we all help each other work as a team the manager was very respectful the workers were very respectful we love helping out customers and I'll customers loved us
good,"the manager doesn't give a fair treatment to the good working people."
good,"When working in an on call position, it can be difficult to be treated respectfully by others or to be helped. Some managers are nice and seem to consider your work ethic and how you're feeling while others use the fact that you are a lower employee to scare you into doing a job. However, one you become adjusted and get to know your coworkers better, they can help relieve some of the stress. Some coworkers are nice and helpful while others just use the On-Calls for work they do not want to do themselves. It is easy for an On-Call to be given work that is meant for someone else because they are at the lowest position and are unaware and fearful to question it. It is very easy to be taken advantage of in an On-Call position because there is little accountability. However, a positive is that being an On-Call gives you more flexible hours. A negative is that you may not always get the hours you want."
good,There are some great people with great minds within this organization that need to be empowered in order to thrive. Company was late to adopt agile methodologies and therefore is continuing to play catch up.
good,ok place to work for .pay is good in the holidays but after that it is very bad base pay .very mundane atmosphere and to much work with not enough reward
good,As any job it has it's pro and cons. It's  a good starting point for any position in your life. I have had my fair share of both amazing and poor co-workers and associates. Pay can be lousy  or it cvan be well depending on much of an investment that you put your energy towards it.
good,Selling cosmetics was the daily goal.  I liked performing make up artistry and getting free make up for myself.  Workplace culture is great because it is social and team environment.  Hardest part of the job was losing hours.  Management was decent and I learned to listen to customers likes and dislikes.
good,"I started at 4 to 11am.  I made sure all the merchandise were  out there for the customer.  Change the new price on the merchandise, put up new sales for the day.  Answer any question that the customer have.  The end of the day make sure the dock room is clean and made sure all the merchandise is put away."
good,macys is a stepping stone work place meaning its a good place to work if youre in school and just need to work until you move on to better the pay is really BAD
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,A typical day was sometimes pleasant forwarding smoothly and some other days much pressure and hectic . I learned to just ignore the prose and focus on my job!management was great hardest part of the job was chores that didn't belong to sales ...most enjoyable part was getting your paycheck !!!
good,Great environment to work in if you are a people person. If you have a desire to sell then even better. The job can be demanding when it comes to expectations of numbers. The biggest push is store credit cards. But they do reward for associates who reach their goals and incentivize for associates to further their goals.
good,"It was a seasonal job..I do not have a opinion.  It served its purpose."
good,"It was a good job but some people who were in management, weren't the best with the floor associates. In order to get good hours you had to pick them up on your own, downfall was that you didn't have assigned hours. I liked that you got paid weekly not biweekly."
good,"This was my first stock associate position, something I  wanna want yet familiar with. But it showed me how strong I actually was and how to multitask especially when it came to stocking products and assisting customers at the same time."
good,"It was flexible with my schedule. I was able to do school and work. However, you do not get any employee discounts unless you have the macy's card. As a my first serious job, it taught me a lot and i gained a lot of experience. Id recommend it as a first job, but not as anything else. It has very little benefits besides flexibility and the 20% off if you have the macy's card."
good,Made sure everything was neat and pretty. Dressing rooms were clean and nothing was left behind. Walked through my department making sure everything was in order and where it belonged and not on the floors or on another rack.
good,"It was,a good job it just ended to quick my  Supervisors was very helpful if u messed up they didn't get mad @ u they would come an help when needed sometime u had days where u had a lot of orders that had to be out an u had to run none stop"
good,"A typical day at the robinsons may warehouse was pretty simple. I was a stock clerk,so all i did was get the clothes and other merchandise ready to be shipped out."
good,Working for MACYs is cool. Spent a lot of time on your feet and assisting customers. Very competitive employees when it came to opening Macys credit cards and commission
good,Starting Macy's I already had about 2 years of Retail experience. It was nice but kind of boring tedious work in comparison to my previous workplace..
good,There is a lack of supervision and that it would be good to have meetings on a monthly basis to track progress  and to address issues that needs to be addressed to create a certain level of uniformity that it would be good to have an incentive program to help motivate employees and have various options within the incentive program.
good,From the customers to employees everyone was fun to be around.  The holidays were fast paced but never to much to handle.  Management was great at helping with day to day issues.
good,Our typical day was busy at all times and things constantly changing.  Communicating with our Teams about changes and answering questions.  Building relationships with all or our associates.
good,Customers were great. Management not so much. They belittle and yell at you. Pay was very low. Had to work till close and then again in the mornings. Alot of weekends.
good,"Working at Macy's is not hard at all. With the issue of waking up early , this job is not hard labor. The band is the toughest thing to do. Other than that , this job is good"
good,macy;s start new employees with a salary of $9/H. and you ccan work your way up fro there. if you work in customer service then you get bonuses base on how much you sell.
good,"Very easy to get hired. Good place to start a managerial career. Macy's provide variety of training classes and it is a very good ""school for managers""."
good,"Macy’s is a good place to grow if you want to start in a warehouse career. Some management is good, some aren’t. I guess it is just like everywhere else when it comes to management."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,good place for job strong compawAS Inny the manager was good for mei i was work 3 years never they give no respect shown many things about this job and co-workers too
good,"Worked there for 6 months."
good,working here was fun at first once you get used to everything they have going on around you they show you how to do things then they throw you out in the action right away.
good,I enjoyed my time working there. I meet some really great people working there. I got along with all my coworkers. I really loved the hours worked. I probably would still be there if I didn't get a new job.
good,"macys was an ok first job they taught me what was required of me and I did it. I was a sale's associate there the job was ok they didn't stress me out as much, also the employees were really nice."
good,The typical day was always busily. You do have the opportunity to learn new systems. The management depended on who you work for. Some good. Some not so nice. Since they laid off so many it made it more work for the ones that are there.
good,"Management changes were occurring all the time.  The job changed directions so many times.  The company implemented Endevor configuration management, but, did not use the full capability of the system."
good,"The most important aspect of the job is customer service and being able to properly communicate with other associates. It is a very busy company and you are always assigned things to do or to complete tasks in other departments. There is a very strict way to do things, complete tasks and handle situations. You learn every department of the store and how to work in each one accordingly. As with any retail job you get all types of people who come into the store and you deal with all kinds of situations. The hardest part of the job is probably dealing with associates who might not get along with you or others and want to get you or other associates fired. For some reason there are always those types of individuals out there who like the drama and bring it to work. You also have to deal with a lot of angry customers who get upset over sales signs and coupons. They also get upset at the merchandise selection and sales associates. Its really a job where you cater to the public and have to make everyone happy while also doing your job. There are many different situations and tasks assigned to you. It is not a job for someone who gets offended or angry easily and is anti social or does not like people. The entire job is customer relations. I enjoyed being challenged and having different things to do. I also enjoyed some of my coworkers and the company parties where we were catered too and got free food. The other downfall is that a lot of things are not communicated well to people. Like the daily issues or activities so then some people are left out in the cold about what they should"
good,I disliked Macys because things were not thoroughly discussed or explained. Management did not give good advice and steered me in the wrong direction just to earn macy's credits.
good,"I worked few hours, part-time while I was in school. Located in downtown Santa Barbara, far from school so I had to get on a bus to get to work. I worked third floor so not too exciting."
good,Only had  a seasonal position (during the Christmas season so the pace was fast) so I am not a person who can give a fair review. Cashiers and managers were pleasant and helpful.
good,The Macy's in Baytown had very little traffic. It was hard to sell. The managers were nice but there were very little customers to sell too. We would go hours without a customer and it was a very unsafe area of town.
good,Your typical day at work would primary be just about making magic. Giving great customer service in which we call the magic service to customers. You will enjoy a lot when it comes withemployee discounts
good,This location has seen a lot of changes since I worked there so I am not able to provide a review of the current work environment. I did enjoy working with the customers and staff at the time.
good,An amount of your commission went to Macys'.  There were different managers and they all had their own way of doing things.  Shifts were all over the place so no set schedule for those who want to plan there life outside of work.
good,"Macy's was a part time job.  I enjoyed learning about different brands, and visual marketing.  The job taught me how to visually market brands and to excel with customer service."
good,The job was ok but lack of communication between the job and human resources. Poor management. I'm still waiting on my last check from them it's been 3 months
good,had a great work environment. loved working with customer service. and also with external and internal theft prevention. I liked the manager he was very good to work with.
good,"Macy's has poor management, as a new employee not everything was explained to me, I learned everything on my own, or through another employee that was willing to help."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macys has a lot of perks here and there. Really love the benefit of having commission! I love how its run but management sucks and the hours to work isn't really here i want to be.
good,You can request of what schedule you are available for. Worked in commission. The more you sales the more commission you get and im doing great with it.
good,"Macy's is a good retail company for everyone who looking for entry-level on retail jobs. I like Macy's, I got to learn some new merchandises, how Macy's mall system worked. It's good experience to work there, even it's short period of time."
good,"* On a typical day at work, the first thing I do is walking the store to make sure all visual displays are in-place, then I begin on tackle each task accordingly before the store is open."
good,Only would I ever work this company during the holidays it is the worst retail experiance I've ever been apart of people are nasty when they aren't perfectly accommodated
good,A day at Macy's is Peaceful. I didn't really learn much here. Management was great . The work environment was positive. Nothing was hard about the job. The best part about the job was how positive it was and the pay.
good,Great job unfortunately it was seasonal. It was always busy and a great group of people to work with. Enjoyed the hours and days scheduled as well. If available to work there again next season I will.
good,"my first retail experience, very new. Alot of different people. There was alot of pick up times. Was very busy. The floor will sometimes be a mess due to the customers"
good,I was generally happy with working their but I had no hours for did I receive any aknowledgement for the work that I put into the job that is all  I have to say
good,Macy's was a seasonal job I took to earn extra money. It is a retail store which allows us to choose our shifts and hours. I learned about clothing retail here.
good,"I worked in the women's shoes department, it was great experience for me learning more in rations and sales. got the opportunity to be the lead of the athletics section."
good,"There were sales every other week , the store is located in a mall that thrieving with new business and bring in different clients all the time. It's a fast paced environment"
good,Nice place to work fast paced environment wonderful people low pay rate no benefits 401k manages a nice supervisors at nice a lot of work to do throughout the day
good,"Had a team of employees that cleaned & cleared each floors from top to bottom. We only had 1 break time throughout the whole day."
good,Benefit it self is a fun company to work for. I learned a lot working with education leaders. laughter really is the best cosmetic. Benefit would be a great company to grow with.
good,"I always learned a new makeup technique, assisting clients with  product selection had it's ups & downs. Lack of communication from upper management the hardest part of this job to me would have to be meeting quotas and sales goals, as well as loyalties! Most enjoyable part of the job would be demonstrating products on client's."
good,The workplace culture there was unique for the most part. Everyone there was there because they were using the job as a springboard to achieve something greater
good,"Cool people, made the job harder than what it actually is. Provide customer service at all times. Maintained a clean work area for customers & merchandise."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,the management was so bad  but i learn a lot by the help of my co work. how to be relax when the customer complaining how to talk  with manner to the customers and i improv my customer service
good,"In this workplace, you must utilize your skills as working apart of a team and handling valuable assets. To further add, managing various task with the responsibility of handling merchandise,"
good,"Handle customer inquiries, complaints, billing questions and payment extension/service requests, issues, and concerns. Consult with customers to evaluate needs and determine best product options. Cross-trained and provided back-up for other customer service representatives when needed."
good,the manager don't want you to work any hour if you are not a full time worker or if you are not in the union. i was sent home for working over 12 hours a week on three different occasion.
good,"Macys was a great place to work at, but the hours were never enough. Im looking for more of a consistent, full time job. With a salary that consists fairly high. Macy's overall was a great place to work at, I meet many new peoples, made great friends out of collages that I'm still in touch with this day."
good,Working at Macy's is a good job for a younger audience with the ability to work long hours on their feet and in small workplaces.It can be a competitive work environment.
good,"When I first started working here it was a pretty cool and fun place to work. It was interesting getting to know different coworkers and customers because you’ll never know who you’ll meet. There are some employees that I got along with, while others had a lot of personal issues and decided to take it out on a lot of other workers and customers. They were very rude and from time to time I almost got into it with them because of that, but the job was more important to me so I just dealt with it. After a while I just couldn’t take it anymore!"
good,"Typical day involved collaborating with a team of managers, reviewing company goals and initiatives while developing strategic plans for improvements. At Macys we are always seeking to understand  ""Whats New"" and ""Whats Next"" so being a forward thinker is important."
good,I would help customers find clothing from themselves or others and then I would ring them out at the cash register. I learned how to be patient with people. the most difficult part was rude customers. the most enjoyable was the clothing.
good,Manage high performing teams in a warehouse environment. Manage reporting and associate performance. The hardest part of the job is being able to incorporate new and innovative ideas.
good,"Macy's is a friendly environment, where there are opportunities to collaborate with other team members, in order to achieve common goals.  You are encouraged to initiate new ideas, and work to have them approved by direct supervisors."
good,its a retail store with a lot of customers. i believe that the management could be better and they wouldn't constantly move staff from one area to the other
good,"Working for Macys has good and bad points.  Why the benefits are fair, they are always understaffed and change your hours without prior notice. Depending on the department it can be cutthroat."
good,"This job is great for a high school student first job."
good,Greet people as the enter my department. Its very cool atmosphere makes working a breeze and time seems to fly as more people you help. You are standing all day so I would say that is the hardest part. Helping people find what they need and seen them smile is the most enjoyable part of all.
good,"I learned that I can help people to feel good about themselves by choosing outfits that compliment their figure. Also, helping to display clothing in a manner that would appeal to customers; where sales would increase. Finally, not taking customers negative feedback personally and focusing on the positive instead."
good,"Day to day depends on your work center. In stores, there is a balance of tasks, people, customers and unexpected incidences. To be successful, you must be agile and have a growth mindset. "
good,"My first year at Macy's was great, my team was collaborative and supportive. When I got promoted, my new team and the division culture was negative and toxic. I was on a daily basis verbally abused and thought as less than."
good,"Greeted customers to Qualify for new furniture for their home,recommended merchandise and gave product knowledge"
good,This business provide needs to shoppers on a daily basis.  The staff was very helpful and courteous to customer.  I enjoyed working here and worked well with my peers.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Overall the company is a strong company however once you are in a role you are stuck unless you have connections.  There is no room for growth and the turnaround rate for certain areas is very high. No job security anymore.This is for the corporate office. I did not work on the sales floor.
good,"In the time I worked in the retail store, I did meet some great people, working Part time while in school, the job gave me great flexibility and was able to work with my schedule, I only worked mornings so I was in and out by 3:30pm which was great."
good,"I felt like I could have been getting paid more as a sales associate. The work was pretty laid back and fun at times, but most times they would count on you to do most of the floor work."
good,very great company to practice sales skills.  i would recommend working here if you are looking to hone your skills as an associate and sales expert.  Learned plenty
good,Didnt work here long dont have any complaints other than could of been more hours and also better pay . Buy like i said wasnt with this company for that long
good,"When you help the customers to select merchandise, you learn the floor layout better. This company gives you an opportunity to network with co workers and customers."
good,"Working at Macy's seems to be moderate. Only worked for seasonal time. Hectic during the holidays. Schedule seems to be fine and when the customers arrive to shop, it is even more hectic."
good,"Great work Environment, but they need more workers to work for them. Great Manager and great sales associates. Interview process is great and they really values your time."
good,"Customers were the biggest issue as many of them were rude. Some managers were inconsistent, we are told certain policies and relay that to the customer. When a manager tells them something different it makes you look inadequate in your position."
good,My first experience in retail and a fun one at that. The people I was working with was very friendly and helpful when it came to learning the job and doing it well.
good,Worked here as a trainee associate for the seasonal job during Xmas. Visited all sales floor in the shopping arcades/aisles for the clothing displays and arranged all sales items for the customers.
good,"The environment was fast pace, and I usually never got the hours "
good,I honestly loved the environment at Macys. The store manager was wonderful and the employees were usually very nice and helpful. The store can get a little cluttered and the hours can be a little hectic and the pay is a little low for how much work you do.
good,Working at Macy's was interesting and active. There wasn't a dull moment always something to do. The hours weren't the best but not that bad. I guess I learned a lot of the way department stores work.
good,"Macys is a very competitive environment. Associates are compelled to succeed, and and are properly compensated for doing so. Proper customer service will get you a long way in this company."
good,"My position as a Sales Associate come with many different duties such as cashier, store recovery, maintain a clean register and dressing room and great customer service."
good,"Macys' is a very productive work place and you learn a lot about the fashion and vendors and customer service. the job has its challenges at times, but the management helps when needed."
good,"Greet customers and assist them with store merchandise. The hardest part of the job is when a customer did not find what there looking for and they leave the store empty handed. The most enjoyable part of the job, is when a customer enjoy my service and let me know that they would come back and have me assist them again."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"A regular day at Macy's would be going to the allocated shift station, ringing in customers, and if there was no line, then recovering the items on the floor. Sometimes it got really tiring because you aren't allowed to sit or even stand idle for one minute if a manager or senior executive is around. The co-workers and executives are mostly nice, but some older workers can be deadly and rude. It's easy to get into conflicts with co-workers and customers. Sometimes, even the managers aren't very responsible. I would recommend interested people to make sure to call out less and not do anything bad, because their surveillance team is very strong and security is tight, and one mistake can lead to a huge issue. The first few days can be confusing because authority does little to train you well and keep you clearly informed on what to do and how, but you soon get the hang of it. Overall, it's a good environment and pays alright for students looking for their own earning."
good,"I learned most of my sales pitch from Macy's I did like stocking and rearranging floors, but they didn't pay all that great. You could make commission but since I did not work on the sales floor I didn't get to much extra on top of my hourly rate. I loved the manager we had there though she made working there fun. I hated to leave because I liked working there but I needed more money. Plus when it was slow they would send you home."
good,I started off as a  cool job but just did not like how things changed so much. It was not stable and takes to long to become full time. Management was not the nicest either
good,"Pay is poor.  Learn how to display merchandize, completed inventory tracking and audits.  Change the requirements for advancements. Enjoyed reviewing the different clothing designers ."
good,Enjoyed my time there as a manager. However our Macy's was closed down per Corporate. Managers and Associates were wonderful to work with. Enjoyed interacted with customers
good,"Looking for money quick work at Macy's fulfillment center, it's easy but gets extermly boring, quick paced and some of the people are friendly but snakes"
good,"they aren't good trainers. but its okay i understand they think every one can easily learn a fast paced job. I reccomend this job, very enjoyable and filled with life lessons"
good,"atmosphere is competative but cohesive everyone helps those having bad days, They give bonuses near the end of the year, you can make your own schedual if your pt, you get benenfits for being pt after a year, paid time off for pt after a year."
good,Working at Macys is actually pretty slow until around the holidays. The hours are always available. No real chances at advancing. Fun environment. Great for a part time job.
good,"Great place, Great benefits, however poor management. it all about favoritism. You couldn't find help when you have question. Training process is so poor, everyone is too busy to help, so you must learn on your own."
good,"A good job for those looking to grow in customer service . You'll learn how to organize,  be more friendly and helpful towards customers. They teach you how to ring and offer credit cards."
good,I work side-by-side with receivers and merchandisers we Mark down prices open stores and restock merchandise in size shape and color we also spoke to customers can participate as a cashier
good,"I liked it I operated the m.h.e. Machine and did order pulling.Worked the docks ,and amongst other postions.i would highly recommend this job for seasonal employment"
good,Fast pace some days it felt like i only worked for a couple of hours but turns out i was pretty much there all day. I would recommend someone to work there.
good,Sales goals were hard to meet at this specific location because the entire mall was failing. I felt like I was constantly on thin ice because I wasn't making my sales and credit goals consistently.
good,Great atmosphere however I was only there temporally. Didn't want to establish a career in that paprticular settilng however working wioht peopl had its advantages such as learning about differnt attitudes and learnming that conceptt theat that customer is alalwauys right.
good,"i feel like macys cares more about there customers than there own employees. The way they operate (whether is technique, machinery, etc) is very old school in comparison to there competition"
good,Great place to work. Plenty of carer opportunities and advancement. Overtime is always needed to work and is a productive environment to work in. Peak season is a great time to work all the overtime you want.
good,"I don;t really have much to say about the job. I was only working here for a short time because, it was only a seasonal job. I enjoyed the work but, the pay was only minimum wage."
good,"Love Macy's culture, great work pace environment with a strong structure. Unfortunately the retail industry it is so unstable at this time but otherwise, it is the perfect company to build a career."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,macys is a great store in a tough big box retail environment competitive workplace but a good workplace if you arer motivated to do well Columbus is a fun city with a lot of opportunities
good,it was alright but very hood. No rules really apply up here. no one actually works their hours. People clock in and leave so stupid!! will not recommend for no one !
good,i enjoyed working here and had no intentions of leaving until i was offered another job promising better pay. the co workers and management were excellent
good,This was a fun job to work at. This is a place you would want to work if you just want to enjoy having a job. Not a place to work if you have actual bills and depend on the money.
good,This job was so long ago I barely remember it. I had a lot of friends at work but the customers were the devil. I worked in the men's department which was the best department to work in.
good,"A normal place took place in a quiet way, helping costumers to choose the best product for them. I learned how to use the crate and how to work with other people."
good,Great first job. very laid back environment where if you want low stress or more advancement in your career you are able to chose so. great break room with fun holiday parties.
good,"a typical day at work could get hectic in that i would work until it was time for my shift to be over, yet i would be asked to stay longer or was not allowed to leave until the person taking my shift came. there would be times they didn't and i was not able to take my 15 minute or 30 minute break."
good,"I like that it is flexible hours, and we are empowered at work. I don't like that I've been working longer with them and are paid less compared with the newly hired employees.  I believed they should review the salaries of the people that worked with them longer and are working great for the good of the company."
good,"Love my job and my co- parts however the pay sucks and management can be pretty fickle.  No pay for experience or education.  I’m hard working self driven an it was noticed and promoted.  However, without properly being convasated or acknowledged.  Talent is in minded by not properly stating my position in the company.  Holding several titles only paid for one ( the lesser of pay).  Thou, my work is of a merchandiser."
good,"Macy's is a fun place to work because of the great associates that work there. The customers are awesome as well, the managers are not so great if I'm being honest. If you  are looking to get recognized for your great work then Macy's is not the place for you. There are those who do a great service because they are great people, but great people need to be thanked and recognized by managers every once in a while."
good,It's a decent place to work. The jobs aren't very challenging and the hours are pretty flexible. If you don't mind doing the same thing all day every day then the job isn't awful.
good,Too hot and was not getting paid enough for the work we were doing. Overrall it was a nice place to work if you’re looking for a job but not a great long term job.
good,"I was not there long, but the Macy's up in North Olmsted I felt was not for me because I am not a fake person and I thought it was disorganized. They really did not train me, they just through me on the floor expecting to know everything. There were associates that went out of their way for certain customers and then did not even give basic customer service to others in the store."
good,"Macy's trains their employees very well. they are supportive and provide an open door policy for issues problems or concerns of their employees."
good,"nice place to work, for people enjoy fashion and helping people develop a look that fits them. it was very fast paced and everyone on the team was nice to be around."
good,"Sales associate. Sales, returns, exchanges. Pulled orders for fulfillment and bops. Lots of hustle and can be fast paced depending on your department."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I worked in the collections department so my day consisted of collecting on overdue balance owed to the company of the customers active or non active card. Also included bonuses for meeting monthly pot quota for funds collected.
good,"Great training to show sales associate that the customer is always right and how to open, close and balance the cash registers.  Great discounts for company employees."
good,It was a sales clerking job.  I waited on customers suggested items to them and rang them up.  On down time we cleaned and straightened up the floor and hung items up.
good,"i do not have anything to say about this company, I worked here until I was let go. The company is closing a lot of it's store so I guess they were not doing good business or enough business"
good,"Working at Macy's as a seasonal sales associate was not a particular fun experience, but it wasn't unbearable. Customers will keep you busy and that helps with passing the time."
good,"I worked in women's shoe department for Macy's.  I would start my shift taking care of product placement for Coach shoes and then begin selling from all areas.  I would at times walk the floor to make sure I knew what shoes were in other areas to better serve my customers.  Most people were using the job as a temp job to move in their chosen career.  Some were lazy co workers, others were outstanding assets to the team.  The hardest part is managing customers tempers during large sales.  The best part for me was beating my goals everyday and exceeding my personal sales goal."
good,"conocer gente diferente, y el trato de las manager del piso"
good,Macy's teaches you alot about the retail industry. Great place to work to get your career started. Had the opportunity to work with alot of different people as well as learn alot of different things. Not sure if there is alot of opportunity for growth unless you transfer to different departments.
good,"This job was just for additional pay. I really had an great immediate boss. However, Upper management was really unorganized and unprofessional at the time."
good,Expected to complete the job of many while cutting everyones hours. Low wages. No-one is allowed overtime even during busy times of the year. High turnover rate
good,"Worked point of sale,interacted with customers about purchases, dressing room attendant, stocked merchandise, interacted with loss prevention. Maintained clean work environment in sales floor"
good,"although it was a seasonal job, this place was very limited in terms of trained managers. During slow hours, you were pretty much free to do as you pleased since management was never around to guide employees in the right direction."
good,Macy's is really good with flexible schedule if you're a student or working at a another job. There are different departments you could join and each of the departments has really nice co- workers that are better than some of the managers.
good,Not a great career unless you are in management and then get ready for some long hours each week.  this is not an easy job.  work weekends and nights.
good,Stressful work environment--not enough staff and staff that comes and goes.  Good opportunity to learn in fast paced environment. You learn a lot but at times its too much and they always want you to know more--almost too much information that is poorly organized making it difficult to quickly access needed information causing longer call and hold times for customers.  Sometimes feels like there is not enough support from leaders who come and go also.
good,"I worked in the shoe department of Macy's, which was a commission area, and the competition with the other associates was always brutal. If you're part time, don't work for commission. You won't get any. They'll assign you short, 3 hour shifts where there are no customers and you won't be able to make your sales goal."
good,i say its an intersting day because you never know what you have in store . some days are slow but others are fast. on fast days its stressful but fun
good,"its hard on my back legs and feet having to stand and walk the whole time, its not my type of work just doing some hours to get an income until i can get a full time job..the job is seasonal, i dont have anything more to say havent been there long"
good,Enjoyed working with customers.  Have worked with customers during my career in many fields.  Macy's a great place to develop a wonderful relationship with your customers.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"I would log into the phone. Either I would help the representative with questions, policy and/or procedures. Also store associates/managers would call the lead line for help.There was meeting once or twice a week. Phone exempt time for 30 minites to do follow ups either resolve the issue or call the customer back with a resolution to there issues. Training classes to update us on new policy/procedures or we would get emails also on them as well. we would send customers emails for there statements, letter or receipts. explain customer balance or promo balance."
good,"No clear career paths, advancement is hard to achieve through effort. very political work environment. very top heavy with executives who make it a career."
good,"review up coming events, sales, inventory, scheduling of staff, meeting, customers assistances,  working with other department managers to assure coverage."
good,"The job was fairly easy, but if can't fluently speak Spanish, it will be hard to communicate to other co-workers and some delivery drivers. Also, if you don't enjoy sitting for 8-10 hours a day, this is not the job for you."
good,"I was responsible for customer credit account management including credit verifications and setup.  I was also responsible for the Bookkeeping, Change Orders, Ticket Master and Gift Wrapping."
good,"Macy's is fine, the stocker job I got, was simple and easy, and the workplace is nice, and relaxing. However I was barely ever called to work, and when I was, it was only for 4 hours, and the management was poor, I often didn't have anything to do, because the manager was always walking around the store, and I couldn't find her."
good,"I learned a lot at Macy's. If you didn't walk in with a backbone, you surely will. It is a very diverse place. It's high pace and stressful. The company is cutting corners here and there. I was given a part time job but worked a full time hours. So I did not qualify for health insurance and etc. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who consistently are rude to you in order to get things for free. Management comes and goes. You'll have some good ones and some bad ones. The most enjoyable part of the job was making new friends with your fellow colleagues."
good,You look up one days and the years go bye at this place great coworkers who become life long friends make you hang in there such a great team atmosphere.
good,perfect as a summer job but do not get caught up in the pursuit of higher management.  That's where the stress and the unhappiness lies within that building.
good,Worked for Macy’s for a long time in various roles.  Managers were supportive and open to new ideas.  Result driven company with the CEO’s pay tied to the stock price.  Decisions were always based on financials and held little regard for company associates.  Crazy holiday hours.
good,"Macy's is a New York institution but is still tied to their brick and mortar heritage for income, and many of these stores have been closed in the last two years. The future of this company is uncertain to say the least."
good,I really did not enjoy working at Macy's. Everyone i worked with was not helpful. It was very competitive and everyone was more worried about themselves.
good,I really enjoyed working at macy's especially during the holidays. I was able to pick up extra hours in different areas of the store. The employees were very friendly and provided excellent customer service. I really enjoyed the holiday music and the excitement of holiday shoppers.
good,Engaging workplace with motivated employees.  Fosters a culture of growth and risk taking - competitive and thought provoking.  Hardest part of the job is keeping up with the vast amount of information available to you.
good,"Shopping at Macy's can be hectic, but working their is fun.  You have to enter from a different location than the shoppers, but once you're their everyone treats you like family."
good,"Macy's was an easy job to get to. They were helpful, with variable schedule. I always looked forward to my shift. I would have gone back but they weren't hiring."
good,The people can sometimes be a little harsh. The most problematic issue is that the area used to be thriving but now it is very desolate. The management can also be a bit unforgiving about special circumstances.
good,Good job experience friendly people easy work not that many hours good far as a part time job never really worked as a full time basically Janitorial work
good,I worked in cosmetic department which was a lot of fun as well as a learning experience.  Training on the lines that I worked was extremely helpful and a plus.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Management was poor, workplace culture was all about gossip, I was the youngest one there yet my maturity was higher than all of theirs combined, a typical day consisted of me standing around because there were no customers yet expected to somehow produces sales out of nowhere with no customers in sight. I did learn however that finesse is key."
good,"Depending on weather it was a holiday, or not depended on how busy the store would be, I leaned how to measure men for suits and how to read a measuring tape correctly, I also learned a lot about colors and what colors blend well with other. How to pick out and tie and tie. How long a man's pants should be on dress pants. I learn about different materials. The hardest part of the job was the clean up after the closing of the store. I enjoyed most was dealing with the people and meeting people."
good,"Depending on weather it was a holiday, or not depended on how busy the store would be, I leaned how to measure men for suits and how to read a measuring tape correctly, I also learned a lot about colors and what colors blend well with other. How to pick out and tie and tie. How long a man's pants should be on dress pants. I learn about different materials. The hardest part of the job was the clean up after the closing of the store. I enjoyed most was dealing with the people and meeting people."
good,During the seasonal position I had working in Macy's the management team did not respect any hour request that I put in. I was still a student in college and could only work afternoons and evenings but they would schedule me during mornings knowing I would not be able to work the shift.
good,"Macys for me was a bit overwhelming, but they had great deals and discounts, and also pretty flexible hours. Although it was a little stressful at times, it keeps you moving and alert while on the job."
good,My time working as Macy's was very productive. My manager always had something new for me to do which helped me learn new skills that I can put into other jobs in the future.
good,"I dealt with many different types of customers.I enjoyed working and using my knowledge of products with new clients, I enjoyed cosmetics department at Macys cause I got to work one on one with people."
good,"Macy's is probably one of the easiest places to work. There's very little change from day to day. It gets so routine that you don't even think about the work half the time. This is great because the work on the merchandising side is so untaxing that everyone is chill and great to be around. I've been on two teams and familial vibes develop very quickly. The worst thing is that it's very easy to get comfortable in what you do and not continue striving for something more. There's an air of complacency that feels inescapable at times. If you're lucky, you'll get a good manager that pushes you, but often times managers are simply plucked from the rank and file for hanging around long enough and being due for a promotion. Other than that however, the work you'll be charged with on a day to day, while tedious, is far from difficult."
good,"The work environment is comfy, and your co-workers become your family as well as your co-workers.  It is hard to leave or move on because of this,, and if you like to shop, well, you may be stuck there for life.  Overall it is a good place to work.  Communication and management I would give a poor rating.  They do not take pride in thier store, and their quality of leadership shows it."
good,Overall my experience was positive.  The most distasteful part was getting people to apply for credit cards.  There was a lot of pressure to meet quotas regarding credit cards.
good,"I gave three stars because there's major room for improvements, such as management, how certain managers play favorites and many other reasons. I feel as if my manager doesn't realize the hard work I do sometimes and should acknowledge there are other associates who do nothing and they get away with it."
good,Macy's is a good place to work around the Holidays. The work environment is festive and upbeat. Macy's is organized and well-managed. I enjoyed working at Macy's during the 2016 Holiday period. Thank you.
good,"Fast paced Enviroment, not well rewarded and compensated  amount of work that you do. Management style is not desired and comunication is bad. I would not recomend anyone to work here is you are looking for steady work."
good,"Learnt an immense amount during my time at Macy's.  Started my retail career and branded interest here, and feel it has been my foundation through all the other positions along the way"
good,This company is great to learn all the retail basics and beyond it depends on how much you're willing to learn. Pay may not be to great for all the work your expected to accomplish but trading off pay for skill is valuable for the next retail job.
good,"My experience at Macy was a fun and memorable one.  I was a part of a very competitive, yet productive team.  I learned how to be empathetic towards customers and other team members.  Management communicated well with their employees."
good,"the job was unloading trucks at 6am it was very cold and i did not like it at all it was in Dec it was winter time, but over all the people that work there  was very nice at all times"
good,the job was all right i didnot mind working the assembly lines it was all right the people was nice i work for . the company was all right would me working there again
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"retail sales"
good,Got to work with customers and checked them out when ready top purchase. also had to do a lot of the clean when people will make a mess and before leaving for the day.
good,macys is  convenient company with flexicale schualde time work you can change your time with other employee and discount for employee short break time with free coffe
good,"It's become an increasingly difficult place to work as sales have become more difficult and finding a place in the new scheme of how people shop."
good,"There is never a lack of something to do, and alot of nice people work there.  As with any retail setting, the holidays are very busy and fatiguing.  I enjoy many of my coworkers and customers."
good,Many lost their jobs due to the downsizing. The working enviornment was very tense. Managers from Marshall Fields were the first to go. High paid employees were then let go. I lasted through the downsizing.
good,"Competitive Work Environment"
good,The job itself was enjoyable but unfortunately upper management and pay were motivators to leave. Also once we switched to a high deductible healthcare plan the benefits were no longer very helpful.
good,"A typical day at Macy's usually involved receiving shipment, processing inventory and managing stock team. The most challenging part was making sure the stock room was intact. Overall the job was flexible"
good,"The amount of hours decrease as the holiday season end, which gets frustrating. the scheduling was inconsistent they really didnt consider the employees plans (like school)."
good,"Great place to work when working in cosmetics. Otherwise, often the management tends to micromanage and pressure you to open Macy's credit card accounts."
good,"A typical day at Macy would be slow or no custmors at all.I was to fix any product or put away items around the store of theres nothing to do, but the promblem was it was slow all day."
good,The most enjoyable for me while working at Macy's was working with the public. Learning the new trend of things. Discovering seasonal colors and being in the know of the latest trends.
good,it was a good place to work and some time a lot of fun and some good people  but the long hour and being on my feet were hard  for me to work I a better quality of life
good,"they do what ever they want to do. They do not see your progression at all. If they do not want you work there they find the reason. You should be like a marionette, easy manageable. If they want they can manipulate with clock in and clock out system. Very often if the manager gives you schedule from the beginning that is not in the system yet, so when you get your weekly paycheck make sure it is correct, very often it could be much more less then you supposed to get. Until system begins working the manager tells you everything is alright, I gave you a schedule you will not have problems, then, after a months she tells you left yearly or came late several times, that is not true. You have to keep all papers printed when you clock in to prove that you came on time. I kept them 3 months and yet, I was told I have points, that was not true. Even though I had a prove in my hands. You feel that you can do nothing about it, they just does not want to keep you there, because they feel weak they see you have potential to be more than a sales associate and this is what they are afraid of. I do not recommend working there. I used to love buying there especially fragrances, not now, not anymore. They ask you to open credit cards, but what can you do if the client does not want to open the new credit card? Do you have to force him/her? A lot of other things, I felt like I am discriminated, if they put two boxes with sweep stakes for sales associates, when they chose the winner they use only one box? Why that? Why workers tried so hard to participate in the lottery or sweepstakes if who"
good,"Built great relationships "
good,"Macy's was overall a great place to work.The management was friendly and flexible. Co-workers were helpful to new/seasonal employees. I enjoyed the  brief meetings at the beginning of each day which notified employees of sales goals, and goals previously reached ."
good,A typical day at work involves me working at the cashier. We learned how to work well with clients. The management is not the best. It is a very hard job.
good,"work life balance? That doesn't exist in the holiday season when most have time off to be with family. then again this is a retail job, you have to be there when the business is."
good,"Learned a lot from the people I worked with.  Management recognized hard work.  Wanted more hours, but they were not able to give me more.  Hard to be on call and work different shifts everyday."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macys is a good place to work at, i believe the hours can better and the pay can be better too.. also i think the people can be friendly too, management can do better."
good,"Most sales managers probably have a different experience. Being in a separate division, budgets were excruciatingly tight. Worked way too much with little reward. When it came time to budget for following season, senior management would not listen to suggestion. They have a ""we know what we're doing"" attitude. They should change that, since big box retail may be a sinking ship."
good,"Macy's co-workers were helpful but not that friendly. It was a better place to shop than to work.  The pay was hourly, low, with little room for advancement."
good,"It's a lot of work, but you can team up and get things done faster. There are many thing to do such as Inventory, Merchandising, Mark downs, Price change,  building or breaking down fixtures,  floor moves. There's nothing particular,  you can help with anything may need extra support doing."
good,Typically a work day was understaffed and fast paced. The workplace culture was good and everyone was super friendly and nice. A lot of the time management was unreliable
good,"My time at Macy's was tolerable to say the least. I worked there for two years. Some days it was really good and some days are horrible. Different rules per managers, they never were on the same page. Their rules all were different."
good,"Macy's is company to that is very cultural. It's always changing for the best, it's a fast pace environment. The management team are like family. Promotion is very huge, there is continuously growth."
good,"I would come into work and take calls for macys/bloomingdales.com. I really learned how to deal with customers. The managers are very helpful and amazing. The workplace is amazing. The hardest part of the job is honestly the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with, the supervisors, and the managers."
good,It was a enjoyable exprience meeting with new clients servicing them . Your busy and always on the move.Best part of the job was calling back your clientto see how they enjoyed the product.We were a very diversified company aswell.
good,"first job, it was a part time. don;t expect to be off on holidays, always working, and weekends are always a must... your lucky if you get a weekend off or a hoilday. have to deal with horrible customers, and always recovering floors, and closing and opening registers"
good,"Experiemce was ok as I joined there as holiday sales employee. Even thiugh they wanted to make me permanent, I decided not to stay since the pay scale was too low compared to the job."
good,"workload is too much in RTW  department and management do not provide with help when needed, go backs are over whelming. employees are not too friendly and growth rate is very low. payrate is completely depends on management, so no matter how much work you do the person who is managers favourite always gets all benifits"
good,"very low salary, sometimes get really stressfull, but managment was good, you can work according to ur schedule, dont give raises, or any other benefits"
good,Its great that you could pick up shifts. Its easy to grow in this company. The management was ok. We always had to get to our quota or we would not get or commision.
good,It was a good job. Flexible hours and i worked with great people. One of the cons was that we were required to ask customers if they wanted to open a credit card account.
good,Worked on average 7-9 hours a day looking for customers orders throughout the store. Prepared packages for shipments. Hardest part was working so many hours and limited days off. The most enjoyable part was being able to listen to music.
good,"Really a dog eat dog world during the holidays. They don't take the time to properly train their employees, luckily I had prior experience going into the job for the most part I trained myself."
good,It is not a bad place to work. The scheduling was good but the pay was very bad when compared to the other places I worked. The staff and management were nice people.
good,nice environment to build your work experience and understanding of sales and placement of  products and sales. While also being able to move up inside the work place.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Had a great manager, worked solo most days. Very relaxed environment. Employees performed well because they weren't being pushed. Very low pay, however"
good,"Started as extra on call as sales associate.  Moved in to a support position (permanent part time) sign team.   Did price/signing throughout the store.  Also, did mark downs and some merchandising."
good,"Seasonal Job that wasn't the best, they asked you to do more than the pay was given. Only brightside would customers entertaining you and some of the people that you work with,"
good,"The overall job was good , but the opportunity for advancement outside of the stores and into corporate was not very good.  It takes a lot for you to advance to the corporate side."
good,"I would sell shoes and shoe accessories to customers, I learned how to work in a fast paced environment. Only difficulties involved the holiday season and management always treated me fairly."
good,"Macy's is a good company, but tough times in retail have lead to recent job cuts/layoffs and multiple rounds of reorganization. I give management credit for realizing the need for change and a broader focus on omni-channel and cost efficiency, but it may continue to see tough business for a while. "
good,Management is willing to work around schedules and accommodate as needed. Positive coaching is done to help in many areas. Late nights and early mornings are expected during holidays.
good,"It was a seasonal job, the staff was friendly and a great team. It was a challenge everyday, and we got through it everyday. It was fun job for the holidays."
good,"Scheduling could be confusing at times. Good coworkers. Dress code. Flexible holidays and personal days. Overall laid back atmosphere, not very demanding."
good,"I've learned that work is endless. When people do not deal with the consequences of their own actions, it becomes a burden that others are forced to deal with.  It is an experience worth having."
good,"Do Bank report."
good,"This is a fun place to work and most, but not all associates are hard workers.  There is lack of management personnel in the store.  Management is not consistent in their rules and regulations of the store.  There is lack of people working the store and this is one complaint the associates hear all the time."
good,I like the environment and my co-workers. The job was fast paced so the time went by fast.  Most employees been with company for years which made it better to learn from my peers' experience.
good,"My day at Macy's was very busy, and finding a floor manager would be hard to find. But when I needed help I could find it. The pay was not a livable wage. I needed more and that was really difficult. You need a full second income to make ends meet. I loved the associates and the coaching was great. The customer really was first there. I enjoyed being able to help people in many ways."
good,"-Provide customer service"
good,friendly work place flexible working hours good for students or employees who has other jobs or responsibilities . very low pay and no benefits for flexible working team
good,"Macy's is a great job for young students who are just looking for some extra spending money. Weekends are always mandatory, however, they are flexible with a students schedule during the week."
good,"If you need a temporary job or something to do with your time, Macy's is a place you could work at. I would not recommend trying to make a career out of it unless your someone that tends to be in the management crowd. If you aren't in good with the managers, you will not get promotions. A few people that worked in the location I was in was terminated as they approached retirement (some for made up reasons). Raises come once a year and some years there are no raises at all. Macy's run on a point system, if you call in, you are late or leave early, you lose points. However, every 30 days if you have not been late, called in, or left early, or if you do overtime when asked, you gain points back. I enjoyed working with the people but if you are not one of the favorites, you will not move up and the management are the ones that talk behind your back."
good,"Challenges you on a daily basis.  You need to think on your feet and be proactive.  "
good,i wasnt even sure who my manager was. there were other coworkers who get paid just the same as me that would try and boss everyone around when it was well known that wasnt their job. its a little bit too chill. I could take an hour long break if i wanted to and nobody would notice.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,customers can be a little aggressive but over all a decent place to work. Certain managers work with you while others don't do much of anything. Easy place to make friends.
good,I was hired as a sales associate in the costume jewelry dept but my first day of work I was told the position I was hired for didn't exist and was moved to the kitchen wares dept.
good,"Typical day was clock in, and fix anything that seemed out of order or out of place or assisting customers.  One of the main things that were learned was patience when dealing with certain individuals.  The management and work itself was generally pretty relaxed except around the holiday season.  The hardest part of the job would likely be standing for the entire day.  The most enjoyable part would likely be being able to converse while working."
good,"The job itself was honestly fun, I had to go out and find product that a customer bought online, then i would go and get it, bring it back and package it up. It was a scavenge hunt and i could listen to music, it was really peaceful."
good,"This was a part-time position at Macy's dealing with restocking, and assisting the customers with purchases.  The experience with working with the public and ensuring they were satisfied with the overall purchase."
good,"Exposed to customer service and maintaining cleanliness on the retail floor and stock room. It is quick pace during the holidays. Managers will try to work with school schedules and if employees want more hours, they can search for more hours on work site."
good,it's a good job but a lot of bad communication between bosses and would know who I had to listen to half the the time but other then that it was okay for the time
good,"Mornings job"
good,"loved assisting customers in their selections.  Ringing up their purchases."
good,"Helped consumers with promotions in store and with all store products. Assisted in processing and replenishing merchandise."
good,Macy's is a wonderful company to work for if you know someone. I have fantastic customer service skill. The most enjoyable fact of this job is the customers. They truly Rock!!! I love to interact with them it's my pleasure.
good,The job itself is pretty self explanitory. Its a 5-8 hour job. It has nice people and good management. It is very dusty. I would advise against working here if you are allergic to dist.
good,"While I enjoyed working at Macy's there seemed to be some poor decisions from Corporate.  The internal managers were great, but had no access to giving corporate what the associate's needed.  Since the pay was so poor people came and left.  Constant training and turnover.  If I was paid more in Fine Jewelry I would have stated.  I loved selling diamonds and precious gemstones."
good,"It's a better place to work than other warehouse jobs I have previously worked. Made decent money there working graveyard shift, but HR can be very tough to work with in terms of taking days off."
good,It  is not that great of a place to work out. A lot of lazy people that don't wan to do go backs. worked there during the holiday. Not that good of pay.
good,"It's a cool place to work especially if you live n the area. Good staff, good management and it's a place where hard work is rewarded."
good,It's a place where you will make one-on-one connections with customers to learn about their style and beauty concerns. There is also room for growth and advancement.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Macys was a good place to work for. Employees work together as a team. Store was always organized and merchandised as per floor plan. Floor plan was fairly easy to put together.
good,"I have worked two retail jobs in my life, one in Macy's, one with Men's Warehouse. I would not recommend working in a department store, unless you enjoy folding the same pile of clothes six times in a five hour shift."
good,"A typical day on the job involves alot of customer service, cash handling, and putting clothing in their designated areas and cleaning up. The job is simple, yet slow and does not provide alot for self growth. Majority of the job is also independent as you may be the only one in the department with few check ups from management. Coworkers are very friendly and helpful, but it is hard to get management to help you if you have a problem with scheduling or work issues. This is a good temporary job to earn retail and customer service experience, and good for those who like consistency, but not for those who want to advance further in a career."
good,"If you want to get your feet wet, Macy's is the way to go. Co-workers and managers are fun and provide a nice atmosphere to work in. The employee discount are great! There is a back-house 20% off practically anything for employee purchases plus the standard Macy's coupons and Macy Money you earn from opening credits."
good,"No two days were the same. Always something new and different to learn. My talents were utilized to their fullest. Strong collaboration among teams. Positive work/life balance culture. Company had a number of give back initiatives that not only benefited causes on the national level, but in the local community. Best part of the job was my co-workers and work group. Worst part of the job was dealing with seasonal budget cuts and downsizing."
good,"Good job overall. Flexible schedule and good discount. If your willing to how with the company, show your good work skills and behavior and you will definitely move forward."
good,"Just know if you don't kiss butt, things aren't going to be so smooth for you. "
good,This company is horrible to work for. They basically made me resign after almost 2 years due to personal reasons. They don't care about anything going on with you. You could be dying on the sales floor and they will tell you to drink water and go back to work. Horrible place
good,"I provided service for 4 Macy's stores in the Detroit area.  It was mostly 8 to 5 maintaining Point of sale, office, and phone equipment.  "
good,Macy was a good place to work for a year. But I would have to say being a flex worker was sometimes hard. It was hard to get a good amount of hours during certain points in the year.  It was also hard because he didn't feel like your part of the team because you moved apartments rapidly and can form bonds with other workers. management was very supportive but you didn't see them often. overall Macy's was a good job during college but I would not see it as a longtime career.
good,A fun environment to interact with customers. I enjoy being social and this job facilitated those things. Its autonomous and yet I still feel very connected to managers and co workers.
good,"Team driven environment that focuses on customer experience. Business and goals are actively discussed and shared with staff. Culture widely varies form store to store. Customers can be the hardest part of the job, and corporate never enforces it's own policies. The payed time off is amazing and flexible work schedules are very enjoyable. Management can vary from ""back-office"" managers to highly involved, helpful leaders. Again, all depends on your location."
good,my day would consist of me driving all the way to cascade rd from lithonia GA  where i would have to pic up a van and pick up and drop of dialysis patients. then pick them back up and drop them off to there homes.
good,Great place to start your career. It. helps you build solid business acumen and develops your leadership abilities. Workplace culture varies from district to district.
good,Flexible hours are permitted. Great company to work while in school. Ok commissions. Great place to meet and engage with people from all over the world.
good,I loved the cosmetic/fragrance department...I just did not like the older ladies that worked their.  They did not like to help train any new people.  I think they were afraid of being replaced.  Management was the worst.  Talking to the supervisor was like talking to a brick wall.
good,Worked here during the Christmas season and it was somewhat stressful. A lot of micromanaging goes on and strict dress code rules are enforced. Customers often expected too much from employees.
good,"Macy's logistics is an easy job, but they do not care about their people. They think their people are just numbers and can be easily replaced. I was told that they pick from the bottom of the barrel from Human Resources."
good,Fast working pace people on closer play management sucks They only work with a girl is not the guys if it's a girl manager over all if you need money great place to work
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,It was a great place to work with the whole department so friendly and helpful. The managers helped with anything required and helped me grow at my own pace.
good,"Fun place to work at as well as improving customer service skills but not really what I wanted to do as a Career. Otherwise, it is daily maintenance of the store, meeting the company's requirements, and meeting its daily quota. Extremely competitive."
good,Retail jobs like this one are decent enough. The pay isn't to good and there are hardly any opportunities for overtime. Great if your're in school and need a simple part time.
good,"A short time to give a proper review, but it was interesting and fun if you like different personalities and being around shoes all day. If you have the patience it's okay."
good,"Good working atmosphere, management staff was easy to work with and the overall atmosphere of the workforce was positive. I was a student and the hours were great for part time work."
good,"This job was fun allowed you to interact with customers and help prevent theft. also since there was so much going on at the mall, time flew by and your days seemed to go by quicker."
good,"Working with customers was the best part of this position. Being that the position was commission based, you had the opportunity to truly work with customers and have conversations with them in order to find out what they really needed or were looking for."
good,"Wasn't there long. Staff was friendly and down to earth. Discounts were great, and incentives were great. Very high energy and positive vibes. Management was very helpful."
good,"Fashion is a tough and stressful field. Always ahead of the curve. Macy's HAS to be in the front to win and they often relied on the people to make it happen, however they could. The learning curve was steep, but it was rewarding to see the accomplishments at the end of the day."
good,"A day on the Macy's loading dock would begin with about ten minutes of downtime before the truck arrived."
good,"A typical day at Macy's includes long work hours with minimal breaks. Your work day consist of constant moving, lifting and standing. The hardest part is keeping your steady pace all throughout the day with no time to rest. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with team mates. The company itself is a little disorganized so I learned to create my own work in order to complete what needed to be done."
good,"Good systems and processes gave planning organization a strong structure."
good,"My experience was so so there at Macy's Kings Plaza. While I connected with my coworkers, we connected through all of the negativity in our environment. I was happy but after two months I stopped smiling (I was told)."
good,Macys is a place where you can grow the customers can be very pushers. But i had fun with my co workers. Macys always promotes grow with teamwork. I loved employee
good,Macys was an OKAY place to work at. If I had the choice I wouldn't work there again. The managers were okay not great and I wouldn't say the associates were friendly. It was a job.
good,good pay just not good place they lie to you before you get hired and tell you that you will be doing one thing and these are your hours and then when all said and done its a hole other story.. but in all some good people i did three diff jobs there through out the time.
good,I liked my time at Macy's. Everyone worked as a team and the days went by fast because of that. People were friendly and the training was really good.
good,Very fast pace because its located in the heart of the city. A lot of on going traffic so its never a dull moment. You always have something to do whether its interacting with a customer or simply keeping your area neat and organized. But mainly customer interaction and giving MAGIC.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Macy's was a fine place to work at. I enjoyed the culture and how everyone felt like a big family. The coupons and trying to please every single customer was difficult. I moved up fairly quickly but saw women who had worked there for years and had never moved up. If you work hard, show them you are customer oriented and fashion savvy you can get places with Macy's, you just have to prove it."
good,"minus the commissioned sales in the department i worked with, it was a great first job. very flexible with the hours and a ton ov overtime opportunities"
good,"is an equal opportunity employer committed to hiring a diverse workforce and sustaining an inclusive culture. Marriott International does not discriminate on the basis of disability, veteran status or any other basis protected under federal, state or local laws."
good,The job itself was not something few people can do. Being understaffed we had a lot of problems keeping up with a lot of the workflow. This and we didn't really have a lot of room to work.
good,"self starter with work tasks, fast pace, friendly work place, know how to multi task, be friendly under pressured situations, it can be a fun place to work"
good,I did not enjoy the job much. the scheduling was done terrible. my days would change the night before and that would mess me up. My shift felt like it would never end.
good,Working in ready to wear was not difficult. Consisted of folding clothes and keeping the racks and dressing rooms neat and clean. Challenging part was to get people to get a Macys credit card thats where I fell in my goals.
good,"I wouldn't recommend to work where.  That job was stressful and salary was really law,also the brakes are really short, do not have enough time to rest."
good,"Its a decent place to work at for a first time job, especially if your going to school or have another job. Don't expect to see the same person twice unless they are a manger or a higher rank employee. always new people every time."
good,Store had a pick your day and time schedule that never allowed me to pick up any real hours. Pay was not great and neither was the leadership. Found myself doing more than I should.
good,"A typical  day, at Macy's would be to Open the Registers, and to Count the Shoes inventory to make sure, the inventory matches the pervious day.   As an employee i would make sure our floor is set to plan according to the Corporate Policy. "
good,"The receiving dock is challenging as to the size of the unloads and the amount of associates that we have to work with on truck days."
good,"I did like the physical part of it but you do risk hurting your back and for $9.00 hr it's not worth it. Management is not friendly, they want you to literally hustle the whole time and your not allowed to talk to your co workers. I never received a review and worked there for a year. The best thing about the job are the hours, I was done for the day by 10am. If it wasn't for the hours I would have quit a long time ago."
good,Macy's is a good company. Very fun place to work. Ability to earn extra money and have a flexible work schedule. Meet and make connections with people daily.
good,"Do not really recommend it. "
good,"works with school schedule and easy job after everything it memorized"
good,"I worked at a small store that was okay. In my opinion, management was too lackadaisical. It always felt congested and it was more of a learn as you go environment. had I stayed longer, I'm sure I would've mastered my departments though."
good,"Under good management, working here will be great.  Otherwise it is a very stressful retail job that sometimes requires you to make unreasonable personal sales goals for very little compensation.  On top of that, it is nearly impossible to move up in the company from a sales associate position."
good,"The store has great discounts and long hours if you want it."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Meeting a lot of great people from different states and country, and learn how they live. also the prices. what I have learned is learning different styles."
good,"The department I worked in was brand new. I was the first in store employed there. It was for shipping and packaging online orders from store opposed to warehouse. It was very slow. No real supervision. Pay was minimum wage for heavy labor and often times heavy lifting. Manager was friendly, Most supervision knew little about how things supposed to work in the department."
good,So I have worked here twice. so therefore it must not be all that bad. You do have your good and your bad people. I work in security for a couple years and also human resources.
good,The hardest part of the job is that it's not a job where you can get to know customers. The employees were rude and i was glad when the season was over.
good,Very hard worker did a lot of driving for Macy's stock warehouse at least 3 years of  experience I handled a lot of the shipment there was a very cut throat business
good,"Here I enjoyed my coworkers, we all pulled together to finish our days.  Team work was important to keep things running smoothly in the department.  We had a great department manager."
good,At Macy's they give an hour lunch break and a thirty minute break. They are very nice and welcoming. The training is very thorough and time consuming but they pay for training.
good,"I would clock in and then walk to my post based on the area I worked that day.  It would usually be in the morning I would get my drink from Starbuck then I will check my floor. I would clean up and so often check the register to see if anyone was waiting or needed help. I would fold the clothes and make sure the items are where they needed to be. It was a pretty easy job I picked up on the vibe easy and learned everything easily. At first, It was hard to deal with customers since I wanted to please them, but I learned how to be more pracitcal when dealing with customers."
good,"I was a cashier and it was hard to keep track of everything. I was very stressed out and some of the managers were very rude. I did not enjoy it, I quit because I constantly felt pressured."
good,"While working a seasonal position, you have to be flexible. There is a lot of movement. Most of the time, you are assisting customers or working at the register."
good,"This job is great to start your career in makeup because you gain a lot of confidence in the process. The management is the main flaw working at Macy's from my experience. It seems unorganized and chaotic especially when it comes to coverage. This isn't the job that will admire your artistry, is more about how many credits can you open in a day that matter. So if you're a good sales person this is the job for you and if you're more focused on the artistry than you will be let down. If you're an oncall you don't get training nor gratis at all about any new products. You need to step up and do your own research or ask if you want to learn about new products. But besides that you will enjoy the people around you because they are all about teamwork. This job can be a hit or miss."
good,Macy's if for those who need a job to build character and customer service skills. Career wise is more challenging. Its a little stressful but is something you can control.
good,Macy's is a nice place to work however I think there should be some improvements with the management. Departments need more attention by managers who are too busy with other things. Poor training of the associates.
good,"This is retail and it isn't for everyone, especially if you are not a people person. Like any other department of retail environment there is going to be customers that just will come at you with no mercy. and some can't handle that, but what you also need to keep in mind is that there are sales goals everyone needs to meet, and that is when co-workers become your competition."
good,".basic retail job."
good,I enjoy time in the workplace when I fit the company culture. I tend to enjoy work when I need and values are consistent with in the workplace. I have developing
good,"Macys is a good place for your first job but the pay isn't realistic for someone trying to make a living. Depending on your department, making sales was extremely difficult and competitive with others in your department. On top of that, the goals they give you are almost always unrealistic.The plus is the discounts and they do offer room to grow and become a manager if you can tolerate being on the sales floor long enough."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,Never have time to get bored. Fast pace work environment with a lot of customers. Customer Service Skills are indeed needed to work retail and knowledge of sales is important also.
good,Work there for 5 years. People working in the ladie's department are not very welcoming when you are the new face around. I finally settle in the men's department where it is least stressfull to work.
good,"Every day is different, some days are crazy busy while others might not have as many sales opportunities but always something to do!  Overall it is not a horrible place to work, just be prepared to actually work and not rely on others."
good,They could pay more and give more room for growth. The employees were very kind and everyone got along. The employees worked together as team players. Didn't see much of management though.
good,Slow place to work. Customers are really nice and don't give a lot of trouble regarding purchasing or returning items. Coupons are granted to customers.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Macy's the people were friendly and fun to work with I met some cool individuals, The reason for the three stars is because we were laid off when the Valley Fair location was closed and they were not able to relocate us."
good,I wish I had been able to receive more training in the field of visual merchandising. There is a lot to learn but I was sort of set loose to figure things out for myself. My manager was a very talented artist though.
good,Learned a lot of my security skills through this job. learned how to make a report. tons of management experience given and helpful hands along the way this company definitely helps you grow.
good,"not a set schedule, but the job is alright it just wasn't meant for me. other may enjoy it. not a bad company to work for. hectic during the holidays."
good,"a typical day early morning shift consist of getting all merchandise in proper position before the store opened. If completed before store opens, then each team member is a assigned their own task."
good,"if you are looking for a part time job/ 20 hours or less than this is a great place to do that, most jobs are combination jobs such as combining multiple departments for merchandising."
good,the pay was great but they're really just throwing you into a position they barely train you for. Training is done online so you aren't given any human interaction until you're ringing up customers and have no idea what youre doing.
good,"As a seasonal hire it was hard to get hours "
good,The Co-workers that I had there were great but management was not caring about the fact that I was attending school at the time. They would ask me to stay extra time and when I said that I could not they made me feel like I was not pulling my weight. They are constantly on you in trying to get people to open credit accounts. Management has no sympathy for student who work and go to school.
good,Fast paced industry where you rely on team work. Safety is a priority for all associates. Everyone works hard to finish projects and predict obstacles.
good,A great place to learn about product and hands on training. Managing the Bare Mineral's counter has been a great working experience for me and to grow as an associate.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of clocking in, tending to cash registers to ring up customers, restocking shelves and items, organizing inventory, helping deliver items, using Macy's business software to place online orders for customers as well as helping customers find products on the sales floor."
good,"I was happy to help all the customer with their purchases. It was a meaningful experience and i loved dressing up and being professional. Macy's is a store where one should be very polite, customer friendly and know everything their products. I gave great customer service"
good,It's a good start for someone  who's  just getting started in the workplace for the first time. Also If you need a second job. The job  also a discount on products .
good,Working at macys for the holiday season was interesting. they set high sales goals for the staff and push to open credit accounts. everyone is always looking busy but doing nothing
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Very fast paced environment, great mix of both team as well as individual work. Holiday season is peak hours as well as workload, aside from then workload is mostly manageable."
good,"Doing stock, Moving boxes in a fast pace, The Management was great,Workplace culture was different but every one was nice to each other ,Hardest part was unloading trucks alone most enjoyable was learning alone"
good,After school job that taught me the basics of customer service. A lot of unfairness in the workload among the young and older generation there. They worked with your school schedule.
good,"How you are treated about macy's really depends on your department and position. However, it is almost always about the money. And hours arent usually very reliable."
good,"Meeting the customers who walk through the door and helping them in every way we can is of course our first priority. This means finding the perfect outfit for them, or even custom ordering whatever meets their needs. Also keeping track of stock, ordering new stock, setting up a marketing campaign for our regular promotions or special deals, … is part of our daily work day."
good,My most enjoyable part of my job was the customers. They always made my day no matter what.Also I had an awesome supervisor. We always put the customers first.
good,Management are very disrespectful  they talked to employees as they  are kids.  That was  my reason for  leaving. Talking  to some of the  employees  they said things  have gotten worse
good,"I think it was a good job, especially if someone want to get started in retail. Scheduling could be a bit better but it's an every day retail store. I enjoyed working when there are more customers in the store. The training was good and the pay."
good,"each department has its own work patterns, you go in, get your goals and accomplish them . meet people and learn new things everyday. "
good,This was only a seasonal job. The pay was greater than I expected and the job duties were suitable. There was not a lot of hard work but it did require you to actually work.
good,It was a fun place to work and the customers made you feel welcome. The staff were very helpful and a lot of the people work together. The actual hiring process was quick and easy.
good,The people working there are so rude. the managers never care and  also not enough training... a day of training wont cut it. Hopefully they change managers soon.. and new employees... PLEASE
good,"a typical day at work is generally a fun day, but there were too many ""in'house"" cliques circulating. overall, Macy's provided me with a solution to my unemployment problem."
good,"I enjoyed working at Macy's. My manager Leslie Weinstein was the best. She was a long term manager, but people did seem to come and go fairly quickly.I enjoyed talking to customers and helping them put outfits together. I worked in almost every area of the store, even did interviews of potential employees at the holidays. Overall it was an enjoyable work environment. I did towards the end of my working at Collin Creek Macy's had a problem with one employee. I talked to loss prevention on a night he returned about 500 dollars worth of merchandise to me. He took his break and I put the merchandise back in stock. Later in evening I noticed he had gotten it all back out and had it folded under his register. I alerted Loss prevention before the store closed. He handed merchandise off to a friend at closing time as I watched.Loss prevention was aware so that was that. Loss prevention chose to talk to him about it, so he figured out who said something. He began to tell others I got him in trouble. Not so and I would do it again. Working with him was a little strained after that but we never talked about the situation."
good,"A typical day at Macy's, somewhat a lot of customers, most of them have returns."
good,Macys a great department to shop and work if you need extra money. But sometimes management overlook hard work and sometimes never offer opportunity to grow in a company in other areas of employment
good,"Not a difficult place to work, but my location was always busy, so there was always something that needed to be done. Overall a solid work experience."
good,Flexible schedule. fine place to work everyone experience will be different some good and some where bad its your typical department store to work for.
good,The camera system is very good compared to other stores I have done Asset Protection for. The associates that work here are ok but need a lot of coaching to help reduce loss. My immediate supervisor is a very good person and is well equipped to provide the team what we need to perform our jobs properly. My only complaint is how strict some of the training supervisors can be when looking at a case. If it isn't a textbook apprehension than it isn't worth making the stop because most likely you will be reprimanded later.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"the hardest part of this job was being so to myself, im more of a social butterfly, and this job was a very self having job. But the most enjoyable part of this job was being able to learn things on my own!"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Macy's my first year as a part time associate and that made me go for the full time position, but once I turned a Full time Associate and changed department(to women's shoes) things changed a little, very disorganized part of it was the management and other part the system, very difficult for new hires to learn how to do your job properly, but once you get it and like working with people you would have fun."
good,"I enjoyed working at the job but didn't like the pay. I felt it could've been a better place to work, had I had better pay. Truly loved the staff at the job, and the management, for the most part was good."
good,"Your work life balance is pretty good and you can learn from another team or they send you to train."
good,"I loved the people I worked with.  We all helped each other out when it was needed, whether we knew them or not. The managers were in the worst position because they tried to keep their workers satisfied while not getting adequate support and materials from the company.  Departments resorted to taking signs from other departments without their knowledge so the correct sale signs would be on the correct rack.  It was very depressing to see Macy's total disregard of the day to day operations."
good,reggae party will be his folding clothes counting money usually customer talking to a lot of people . My management was OK could've been a lot better days this hard holding wasn't good for me
good,"There is just a positive vibe and great atmosphere in this company. Yes, we all work hard but the people that work here genuinely like their job and smile. The company cares and does great things for us like Strategic Dreams and all the events... I can't say that about the companies I worked for before this company."
good,"It was a good experience, meeting new people, great enjoyable customers who became more than the client and loyal to me,  always purchased anything that they need it from Macy's, having always a good experience with my customer service."
good,Macys is a wonderful place to work it just a couple cons that is hard to understand but past that it has great employees to work with great hours I just needed some off days
good,It's a good place to start if you need a place of employment. Weekly pay is always great. Depending on what position you play you're day will be full. Hardest part can be dealing with difficult customers. It's fairly easy work.
good,"Exciting but sometimes slow and boring.  Learned sales techniques and how to get the sale, management was somewhat hard driving, workplace environment was pleasant..Hardest part of the job sometimes was making your weekly goal when business was slow and the enjoyable part was when I could achieve my monthly goal."
good,"Enjoy everyone, especially the customers.  Difficult to be on feet 8+ hours a day when business is slow though."
good,This is a good job if you like working with the public. Also there are numerous shifts available from part time to full time. Typical retail experience.
good,"Employees normally friendly, work isn't overbearing. Management can use great improvement but there were many respectful and understanding managers/supervisors."
good,"A typical day included assisting new hires with training, assisting with paperwork, different types of admin work and human resource like things. Easy if trained properly"
good,"The company itself was fun working for, but management wasn't the best. I feel that if Macy's would listen to their employees more it would have been a better company. It was a lot of who like who and how you can get a position."
good,"Great forward thinking retail company"
good,Serviced customers by assisting in purchasing and finding all accessories needed to ensure that they received everything that was requested during their daily shopping experience.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,I worked several departments before becoming manager of gift wrapping and also the cash office.  My job required me to balance 30 plus cash registers while at the same service customers in gift wrapping.  This job really need two people.
good,It's not that bad of a place to work. You only have 12 emergency days that you can call out on the spot. The rest of the days need to be approved 2 weeks in advance. A lot of changes are being made constantly that the employees do not like at all. The hardest part is picking up the really big awkward boxes. My back hurts daily because of the physically demanding part of the job. Since it does pay well I just put up with these downsides to working for this company.
good,"Working at macy's was stressful at times my hours"
good,"Great company and product. An opportunity to grow."
good,Great place to work with. I absolutely loved the hours that the support team works. Early mornings and out by 3pm. Peers are always helpful and willing to help one another out. I have no comment for the management team.
good,"I have enjoyed working at Macy's. The benefits package is very good, and the work/life balance is adequate. The culture is multi-cultural, and everyone is friendly."
good,Did not care for the work place or culture of Macy's. The store manager did not want anyone to advance. They do not care about the other employee's unless you are a top seller.
good,"Drive around warehouse pick orders, build pallets of merchandise,  put merchandise on shelves, count merchandise, and make the warehouse was clean at end of shift"
good,"Drove around the warehouse on a forklift picking orders, build pallets of merchandise to be put up on shelves, put away merchandise to correct location in the warehouse"
good,A lot to learn from day to day. Different encounter and many different situations with customers that will advance you experience and know what to do in many different situatuions
good,I enjoyed my coworkers and enjoyed my time with the company. The management was less desirable. I felt as though growth was near impossible and it was hard to move from part time to a full time roll and the compensation left me looking for work elsewhere.
good,My co workers for the most part all worked very well together had respect for one another and always willing to help out in different tasks..especially enjoyed my time spent working fulfillment learning new things.Supervisors and company always ready to give praise to employees for their hard work
good,"Typical day at work involved having to use many semi-functional conveyances, and since I was a support associate, much running up and down the store. The work itself was typical warehouse type labor with retail elements thrown in. With the proper training and will, an associate would surely achieve competency and solidify their work routine. "
good,"Even though it was only a seasonal position, it was an okay place to work at. People for the most part were helpful but I was often on my own and struggling to keep up."
good,"is a really fun place to work staff are very friendly "
good,"Macy Warehouse was the first job i learned how to drive a forklift and that when i received my certification. My job was to get all the plastic that was on the strip docks, load them unto the dock, and make bales all day. There were alot of days me and my co worker would get behind and plastic would get build like 9ft high some days."
good,Macy's was my first retail job and it was difficult around the holiday season. I was able to keep up with everything but was tiring as well. Certain days I did not even get a chance to get a break. Managers wouldn't have someone fill in my spot to relieve me.
good,"I worked there during the holiday season, so it was very overwhelming, but they the managers and supervisors were good to their staff. They made sure that despite having a crazy schedule we got our lunch breaks and didn't have us staying to late at night if we lived far from the store."
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,The management wasn't great at Macy's. I enjoyed working with most of the people. Some were rude and not helpful. Work life balance was poor. It was difficult to call out when needed.
good,Macy's was a great place to work. I Had fun working there and meeting new people. Macy's give excellent training so that you are prepared to work once you hit the selling floor.
good,"Fast paced environment, great learning experience, awesome team work and great food. Flexible hours, knowledgeable leadership with great customer service"
good,A typical day at work starts by checking your register cleaning after customers and helping them find everything their looking for .As well as helping them check out and help them out with any account payments . However as a sales associate we are required to meet sales and open accounts and meet the stores goals . The hardest part of the job was when it got really busy on holidays .Over all the it gave a great customer service experience  .It helped me get to know a lot of the customer and find their needs and its  always great to meet new people and get to know the customers and be able to greet them with a great smile on your face everyday.
good,"I have enjoyed the experience working in retail, learning about product knowledge sharing with the customers. Working together with co workers insuring  our customers are always leaving happy."
good,"decent pay-"
good,"Macy's was a decent store to work in. The management was not very supportive or helpful. The politics was fueled by a lot of gossip, mainly from the dept. manager."
good,"I've been there for many years and I love my work environment and working with customers. A typical day at Macy's is opening the registers do fulfillment and help customers. I've "
good,You spend most of your time on the phone dealing with customer issues. Or your on the computer interacting with customers. Training is offer before you start to familiarize you with system. Good job but the pay could be better.
good,this job was pretty cool to have as an part time work. Schedule can be very flexible . The pay is not so great but you can always get a bunch of hours to make up for it.
good,I worked as a sales associate in the women shoes department of macys. macys doesn't have a customer service department in store so we are required to do it ourselves. Associates are given sales quotas and are required to achieve a certain number of macys credit a month.Women shoe sales associates are not allowed to get the shoes for their customers instead shoe expediters.
good,They took care of their employees who did their work in a timely manner. Did not however have an understanding on serious medical conditions. They would fire you for attendance issues
good,"This position was physically challenging and involved some customer contact.  I didn't mind light weight projects; however, took on a lot when it came to the restocking part of the job."
good,Not a bad company to work for but growth is limited due to glass ceilings and bad management. Pay raises are very little and promotions are far and few between.
good,"Macys is a place where goals have to be met. Daily goals, credit card opening goals. Commission. It's a good place to start working if you are unsure what route you want to go as a sales associate."
good,"Macy's gives the associates availability to work and grow within the company."
good,"Macy's has been trying to gain the cost saving customer from the other retailers who had closed. "
good,Retail experience with commission based selling experience. Flexible hours. Diverse work team and with a variety of customers. Actively works on following fashion trends.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"The hardest part of the job was juggling - taking care of customer requests, take out from fitting room clothing customers left in a heap on the floor and hanging them up on racks while ringing up sales and keeping the selling floor neat all at the same time."
good,"If you've worked one retail job, you've worked them all. Macy's tends to be a little more disheveled than other department stores but management is generally good."
good,"This job is an okay place to work as far as being a regular associate, unless you're part management the pay isn't good. They only offer at most a 25 cents raise EVERY YEAR."
good,"I came into work clock in, and I start looking around finding things to do. If there nothing to do than I start folding the clothes and make sure everything is nice and clean."
good,"Macy's receiving team members provide the store with daily merchandise by unloading nightly truck deliveries. a typical early morning shift consists of unloading packages off of each truck, unpacking every item, and bringing every item to the sales floor for display before the start of each sales day."
good,You always doing something. People always shopping. People always putting clothes where they don't go or leaving things in the fitting room you always busy.
good,good start place if you like their mission and willing to work really hard. you have to be there for years in order to move to management. overall ok place
good,"Macy's strongly encourages balance between work and life.  Management has always been understanding that people have needs outside of work. By letting their employees fulfill them, Macy's knows their employees will perform better at work."
good,"pay does not equal the work done. if you want people to stay offer better pay so working somewhere else isn't a concern. if you want me to focus on my work, make it so I don't worry about my bills cuz the pay sucks."
good,"This was my first professional setting experience. However, the pay was not great, I still managed to take away great customer service skills from this experience."
good,afternoon shift are more exciting then the morning shift because there are more people who shop in the noon. i usually set up the display cases and separate certain pieces from one another .
good,"This was the first job i had outside of my dads help, although is gave me responsibility it wasn't the best place to be i felt overwhelmed by how much work i had to do in such a small amount of time"
good,Great job for those just getting started in a department store or customer service setting. The job gives recognition for those that are working hard and there is a family-like community.
good,"As a seasonal associate, the hours were very flexible for the most part. Management created a fun and welcoming environment. Also the associate discount is an amazing perk."
good,"Good place to work; friendly people and a lot of support.  The salaries are real low, I guess because its retail.  Communication could be better but it was adequate.  Physical environment was great and co-workers were good at their jobs."
good,"Pros - Macy's was a great place to work.  Pay and benefits were good.  Good opportunity for advancement.    "
good,"I worked the Holiday Season, Super Fun, Great Sales, Great Management. It was my first retail sales job, but definitely worth the experience. Great job."
good,"I would typically be there for a few hours every morning seeing I was in signing. I didn't really learn a whole lot from this job, it was more so just learning to work at a faster pace."
good,It was a good place to learn from especially if you have no experience. Equipped me with more customer service and cashier experience. But it's easier to get in for seasonal than permanently
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Customer base was very loyal to macys, many employees were as well. Many of the product we sold spoke for itself so not that hard of selling was used."
good,"A typical day at Macy's would be to clock in- get assigned to a area and head there to begin. It could range from sorting clothes, restocking, or moving around racks. Most of the times I found myself assisting customers in need, which I enjoyed."
good,"I started off by shadowing a couple different employees, this was my first job and it was seasonal, just to get shown the very basic. The next day I was pretty much thrown to the wolves. I asked who my manager was and I literally got five different answers. I tried to ask where certain things were to employees who work at the fragrance and guess what I get... ""That's not my department."" Well, great. "
good,"I worked in several departments throughout my time there. Mens, childrens, womens and the home department. The managers were nice and worked with your schedule.  Hardest part of the job would be when the systems went down and you can't meet the customers need. Bringing pleasure to satisfied customer."
good,"Normally a typical big box retail environment, many priorities , high pressure ect.  Currently going through very difficult transition as they work to find their foothold in the market, would recommend waiting for better stability before making a move to work here."
good,Macy's work place culture is great. Personal life and work life can be managed in an appropriate way. Benefits were provided such as bonuses and discounts.
good,"This was okay for a temporary sales position. Womens dresses, sports wear, mens and jewlrey departments. Other departments like home goods and appliances."
good,"Macy's had a wonderful and fun environment with coworkers that were often ready to help out even if they weren't sure how the department worked. A typical day for the two positions I held involved a morning inventory and there were records to be kept in Jewelry specifically. The management was decent, but were so geared towards customers that occasionally the associates were treated unfairly. The attendance policy was based on a points system that had a good ground work but there were glaring flaws such as Dr. notes meant nothing. Being unionized at that location was also difficult because the dock workers had a different union than the associates who had a different union than the managers, so things such as how long you had to work there before earning PTO got you three different answers."
good,There's always something to do even when the store is not busy with customers. Recommended for anyone who is looking for part-time employment or needs to gain more work experience.
good,"Management does not give you the support that you need to achieve your goals."
good,Good pay great management and amazing quality of work there . I enjoyed the time i worked there and would recommend to anyone looking for a sales job or wanting experience in the field
good,its a good place to work not the best but its ok better then jc penny i have to say managment was really good. culture have to say good. everybody works the only issue is they put pressure on you when you trying your best which is not very good most enjoyable part is going home leaving
good,"I was provided great opoortunities to adapt and learn many skills across the technical fields. Unfortunately, Macy's has to react to the retail climate as the others.... Sears, JC Penny, Nordstrome etc.  .com sales is Booming, and serving fast is what the customer wants."
good,"Flexible job, everything online so its easy to swap shifts with other associates. It is a great environment overall. Great co-workers all are team players. The managers are very approachable and fun to work with."
good,Macy's is an awesome experience for the new worker.  It doesn't take long to grasp customer service.  It's a demanding job.  Not much reward as far as pay and commissions.
good,"I enjoyed that my co-workers and I were encouraged to work together in a way that made our days easier and our tasks lighter. My managers, though, were not good at backing us up."
good,"I worked as only holiday help.  Ringing up customers with all of their holiday purchases."
good,I found the sales to be the most important part about the job. Macy's always had a different sale weeks are or every other week. It's best to stay in tune with the different sales so that you will be able to give the shoppers the sales they deserve.
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Busy work environment everyday"
good,I have the ability to develop client relationships. Share products and knowledge.  Make every clients experience personal to fit their needs.
good,"I worked in the seasonal section with the toys and gadgets ."
good,My favorite part about working with Macy's was the artistic liberty some of my clients let me take when I applied their makeup. I also enjoyed knowing I made someone's day a little better or a little less stressful when I would give them a facial massage.
good,it was an ok place to work. it was a warehouse. I made decent money here and the management staff was okay. I would have preferred to have been in a different position
good,"The day always started with a huddle and got everyone ready for the day. Was always fun to interact with the customers and tend to their needs. Very rewarding to have a happy customer. I worked in the womens clothing linens and jewelry department, so it was always fun helping the client find what suited them best."
good,"Long hours, simple tasks, stay on your feet all day, requires a lot of walking, but plenty of breaks and tools to help you get the job done"
good,Management can be very unprofessional with the way the handle internal situations forgetting the betterment of the tore
good,"Very good place to work, I worked as visual merchandiser I loved it. It was only seasonal so it was bitter sweet. Overall very fun job."
good,Women's and juniors shoe department is fun to work in but you have to make sure you meet your sale goals every day which can be a hard task if the store isn't busy. Everyone is competing against each other if not helping one another meet their goal for the day.
good,"The amount of work put in by the sales associates is not compensated by the salary. Managers were hardly ever available and rarely support their associates so you had to be very independent and a thick skinned. Advancement was impossible. They always hired from outside so the new managers were usually clueless. I knew a sales associate who worked at the store for 4 years and had been trying to become a manager and was constantly told she wasn't ready or didn't have the experience. Customers know how weak the return policy is so they easily take advantage or throw a fit when they don't want to follow rules resulting in the managers taking back items over a year old or clearly used. "
good,"In the department i worked it, the people were really nice and willing to show you the ropes. My biggest issue was with HR. They were very disorganized and not very cooperative."
good,"very friendly co-workers, management was okay could do a little better with communicating with everyone, the hardest part was knowing if I'm staying or not"
good,"I would make sure that all orders were taken out to the floor to be put away, I made sure that customers were taken care of when needed. Made sure store was clean."
good,"unless you work at 34th st the Macys experience is that of a bye gone era.  The place is old, hasn't been updated in years"
good,"This job taught me a lot about presentation and being friendly and personable. Learned about different cultures and having patience, understanding and compassion ."
good,it was fun to work here see alot of people you havent seen in awhile around christmas time good extra money for the season time
good,"Gained lots of professional knowledge while working in Macy's "
good,"Lack of leadership and unrealistic expectations of workload. Pay is low and promotional opportunities are limited. The longer you work there, the more opportunities there are instead who may be qualified more."
good,"At the location that I was hired at, I was unable to meet my daily goal multiple times a week. This was because our customers did not shop near as much at night as they did in the day. I spent many days not getting the chance to speak to anyone because business was so slow. I almost felt like it was unnecessary for me to even be scheduled to work most days. I just didn't feel like it was fair for me to get punished when I didn't make sales on days when I had no chance of even talking to anyone."
good,"It was fun planning in store events. The purpose was to generate business and retain customers. As a department, everyone worked together to make those events a success."
good,It wasn't awful. I liked my coworkers but the job was exhausting. It was a minimum wage salary but it was more than minimum wage work. I wouldnt work there as a sales associate unless I worked off commission.
good,"Macys is the dupe of Bloomindales. So much more work because customers leave everything everywhere, but the work environment was ok. Be prepared to be on your feet."
good,"Depending if I was working as a stock picker or on the loading and un loading docks. If i were assigned as a stock picker that specific day I would report to my group where the shift manager will tell us our tasks, I would continue from there and go select specific orders from my scan gun. If i were assigned to the loading docks, I wuld do the same as far as checking in with the shift manager and the proceed with the tasks assigned for the day. which would including for that position would be to make sure the boxes that are about to get loaded on to the truck are not damaged and properly place onto the trucks in a time full manner."
good,It was fun working there . i met lots of fun ..... i like the working enviroment....i liked the managers......its a great place to work ... i recomended
good,"My typical day starts organized with time, and room for improvement. A synergy base flow stemming from a clear vision, purpose to achieve the finish service, or product. It is all wrapped in a culture of flexibility, and encouragement that projects the hardest part of the job in a failure to achieve its goal, while the most enjoyable part of the job is understanding that perfection does not exist, while excellence does. To Learn, grow, and become more knowledgeable in playing an active part of the day that makes a significant difference, and enjoys that, perhaps, every day may be different from the rest."
good,"Macy's commits to their associates and provides growing opportunities through out their stores. The standards to be your ""best self"" are what give the associates the want, the motivation, to excel every day while supplying the customers with tools to succeed in their own ways. Macy's not only sells clothing and accessories, Macy's helps everyone who walks into the building. Macy's is team oriented which is wonderful especially during the holiday season."
good,"Enjoyed my coworkers and job duties. Management, benefits, and pay could have been better. However I Learned alot in visual and am grateful for the opportunity."
good,"macys was my first job "
good,"This can be challenging for those who do not like talking to people, staying organized, or pushing customers to open a Macy's credit card. Employees are friendly and some flexibility with hours or lunches is possible."
good,"very unorganized ,i would come into work, check in the office to see what floor im on for the day, go to that floor just to have another floor manager tell me to go to their floor . Then the first manager would be upset with me for leaving and make me go back because the floor is a mess and they need help this was every day.also they were over staffed which left some employees with little to no weekly hours ,but somehow during closing their would only be 1-2 people left to recover an entire floor sometimes two by ourselves .btw most of the floor managers are LAZY would ask you to ""help"" them recover 3 rods of clothing but just stand there and watch and talk when they are supposed to do hands on work as well .I eventually got sick of it and left ."
good,Management was hard to contact; seemed like they did not want to be found. Coworkers were great - friendly and outgoing. The fast pace was fun and never dull.
good,Got paid weekly. Don't really have much to say because I only was employed for 3-4months. Work environment was friendly. Have to be good with talking to customers. Greeting customers.
good,"Macy's is subpar employment. Due to nearby closings, all the employees from those stores were sent to us, which had a lot of us being fired."
good,Great associates to interact with but favoritism toward particular managers from the stores senior executive has caused a serious moral issue.
good,"My team was dissolved.  Absorbed by another team, and then disbanded most of the leadership...why bother calling it an organization if that's all that's ever changing?"
good,During my employment at Macy's I was given next to no training. I was pushed out on the sales floor and asked to meet sales quotes as well as credit card and rewards program quotes. The job was stressful for me because I don't like forcing people to buy things or sign up for things they don't want. The management that was right above me was friendly and very good at communicating. The management above them was pushy and very numbers driven.
