rating,review
bad,Did not enjoy the experience since the contract was supposed to be one year however only lasted a bit less than 4 months excluding the one week vacation i took. Hence felt that i got all the work done in a very short span of time hence my yearly salary was drastically decreased.
bad,"Contract gig.  Biogen treats its contractors like second rate human beings.  I Do Not recommend working here.  Management is completely disconnected, processes make no sense to me, I feel like the entire place could implode any day now."
bad,"I was made to work holidays weekends and after hours with no extra pay, the management was yelling all day long and un professional they should have management let go"
bad,I would go back and work there if given the opportunity. Right now they are running a skeleton crew. Need to work on being so top heavy
bad,"Terrible management, "
bad,"My boss, Director of Quality for the Laboratories, was extremely personable. When I started becoming ill she was first to recognize something was wrong and took me to the company doctor on site."
bad,"Closed bldg, so employees did not care to engage in conversation"
bad,Too many processes and procedures that caused many additional hours of work and confusion.  No streamlined procedures. Management did not care about the person who was the employee.  I was looked at as a number.
bad,"Its a mess, chaos. It was a great company and will be a great company again once the pipeline moves along a bit. Was packed with great people, now gutted to the bone. If you come here you will inherit a disaster and be cut when it blows up on you, which probably won't take long. In the meantime you will have no idea what your priorities are supposed to be. Find someplace else and revisit Biogen if you want to in a couple years when its had time to sort itself out."
bad,"One thing that soon becomes painfully clear on joining Biogen is that your manager, your manager's manager, and colleagues are all running scared. "
bad,"The manufacturing environment was stressful due to the ""shift wars"".  Management did not care about the workload left over from one shift to the next. The schedules were also uneven and recognition was only given to a select few. Performance was evaluated by the amount of projects or meetings an employee participated in and not the actual work performed. Promotions were given to their "" favorites"". Management was unprofessional bad mouthing other supervisors and managers in front of employees. Bad environment to work in if you are serious about your work. Lack of accountability and various  issues that were constantly overlooked. If you weren't part of the ""click"" you were pushed aside and trampled upon. Experienced employees were not taken seriously while the"" favorites"" were compensated. Completely opposite of the supposed company values."
bad,I enjoyed the operators i worked with but the company itself was very clicky. The managment group was less than desirable and played games and had favorites.
bad,"Contract to perm replaced another person who'd already been there for 2 years and had been promised hire after 6 months but that did not happen....so they left"
bad,Open concept seating very uncomfortable. Sitting next to different department that had no commonality so hush was rewarded. Very difficult to communicate with pairs
bad,visual inspection from day to day would be nice to perform a different function. Packaging department is no longer there.  They have a new aim machine
bad,"Limited time at Biogen, 8 months only.  Department environment was very stressful, no accountability for individual work.  Department at odds with another department, passing the buck.  Just not a good experience."
bad,"After seeing people work tirelessly completely dedicated to the patients we serve a lot of very good people were let go to boost the bottom line. "
bad,I was just a contractor . A fun place work .i learned a lot about what it goes to to developing MS druges
bad,Management is poor. Work/life balance is almost non-existent. Scant development opportunities/opportunities for upward mobility.
bad,"Management was focused more on having staff give and show them complete personal loyalty. This was placed above actual professionalism and work performance. Dress code was nonprofessional which created a atmosphere that was more like working in a plant or factory. Dressing professionally was actually frowned on by management and co-workers. A extremely competitive atomosphere has been created, one that is not conducive for actually trying to work together to accomplish goals. Management struggled with speaking respectfully to staff and often took a superior approach in meetings, both individually and in groups. Management enjoyed when staff ""cowered down"" to them and ""attended to their personal needs""."
bad,"Multiple shakeups in upper management has lead to a deteriorating work force confidence.  No management vision, inactive vision and poor communication."
bad,12 hour shift 7-7. co-worker call out regularly. No on the job training which is mandatory. Shift lead was never in the lab.
bad,"Despite an exciting pipeline and some smart and dedicated employees, Biogen is plagued by internal politics and favoritism. The Board of Directors and Executive Leadership team is weak and that impacts every facet of organization."
bad,"It's an okay place to work.  The office is very political and there is never a clear path for career advancement.  Your performance metrics are all subjective, and there is an emphasis on office ""culture;"" which ultimately amounts to smiling through the consistent stream of over-asks, undervalue, casual racism and incompetent leadership.  But if you need a check, its as fine as any other place. It offers that."
bad,There is a real team environment at Biogen but it has gotten slightly more political at higher levels in the last year or two. There is a lack of strong leadership and the climate is very uncertain right now with regards to our future direction. Many of us are waiting for a new deal or other decision.
bad,"Company has gone into decline and has a negative atmosphere.  Incompetent and inexperienced people frequently promoted. People often ask for help and steal others work and take credit for the work. Its a fake it til you make it company. Diversity is great, but you've gone too far in promoting women that it is at the expense of every other minority group and now even white men. This was once a great place to work, but the talent is walking and going elsewhere.  Managers are extremely inexperienced and failing at it."
bad,"They will impress you with all of the free things during training making you feel like you're a part of something important. There are a lot of free things given but the training is mediocre at best. "
bad,"On my first day I found out that contractors are rotated every six months, there is no opportunity for advancement or permanent placement.  You are thrown into an unorganized environment.  They are misleading during interviews."
bad,"there was bad communication with management.  Work was few, never knew if we had work for the week and too many layoffs. Other than that working with coworkers was fun and the environment we created was great do to the fact that you never knew when it was your last day there."
bad,"Workplace culture at Biogen is becoming increasingly toxic, driven by upper management that does not have a vision forward after our recent Ph III Alzheimer’s failure. Biogen has hemorrhaged employees since the exit of George Scangos, leaving several functions with literally no one with any institutional memory or context for the daily decisions they are making. The rate of exodus has increased all the more since the Adu failure. "
bad,Management not considering feedback from employees. Particularly in the IT Department. A lot of changes coming soon and i believe that these changes will impact the work ethics of the employees.
good,"Mucha carga de trabajo y largas jornadas de trabajo "
good,Very fast paced and changing environment. The benefits and compensation are great. The employees are very hard working and dedicated people.
good,Both my manager and her boss were incredibly inept at their jobs. I would still be there if it weren't for these people. HR was not helpful Company is good.
good,"It is sad to see this, but Biogen invovles its employees in scinetific discussions only at the superficial level. PhDs are always boasting while some more smarter and talented research associates get left behind. Biogen has poor managers in the research and early development portfolio."
good,"Decent work, minimal job security.  Excellent Facility.  Difficult to become full-time employee from contractor."
good,"I accepted a contract position with Biogen not realizing the model this company has for contractors--work them until they drop and then hit ""next"".  They hire 50% contractors--apparently this model works for them but I find it inefficient.  "
good,Call center environment
good,"I was a great company when I started.  It began to shift about 2 years in and became more about money then patients.  Biogen then began bringing in managers with no managerial experience who were ""yes"" men."
good,"New leadership has dampened the culture and GREAT talent has left.  6.5 years ago I joined a tremendous company that was focused on patient care, specifically the MS space.  Now, its become less about the patient and more about metrics.  There should be a balance of both."
good,"Know your SOPs and execute them to the ‘T’.  Let the SOP fail you, don’t you go and fail the SOP."
good,"This place is no joke, and they compensate well to prove it.  But work life balance is a joke, they have a hard time hiring younger people that want a flexible schedule, many unhappy faces these days"
good,Great place to improve the quality and lives of patients.
good,"I believe that Biogen provides a lot of opportunity for growth and development, but very, very few signposts on where to go for those things.  Although innovative in many ways, I have sometimes felt that the most elementary areas (ie, central files) were neglected, leaving those of us more experienced having to work to play ""catch up"" and bring things to a standard."
good,"The projects I worked on were fast pace and the people that I was involved with were knowledgable, helpful and very nice to work with. Overall it was a positive experience."
good,"Challenging place with constant change, good work life balance,  benefits and pay.  Talented people that are committed to the science, patients and providers."
good,Awesome schedules and work from home policy along with flexible telecommute schedule. Scientists and employees work hard for lives that matter.
good,"great company poor supervisor"
good,"Biogen built equipment which created energy through a processing organic materials. The average day was to produce, assemble, design new components, improve the process of the machine. There are some very smart individuals that together we would constantly be thinking outside the box to do things never achieved before in this technology. I was very proud and still am to have been part of this company. Management was good but issues with having family members in positions they were not qualified to do. That is the only real down fall of this company. The owner is 100% committed to making the company grow but have financial constraints slowing the growth."
good,"My time at Biogen revealed an ever shifting executive management, with likewise, ever shifting priorities. The changes in direction at Biogen were frequent enough to make progress challenging and the revolving door at the top created a lack of clear cohesive direction for the IT organization."
good,"Once a great company, now a shadow of what could have been. Culture shifted to now being a number and they have forgotten about patient care and employees."
good,"Biogen was once a thriving and exciting biotech to work in.  It has rapidly declined into a low service, low knowledge company, squeezing a few dollars out of old technologies.  They have, and always will, hired managers with little scientific knowledge.  A recent move to hire from Big Pharma has brought all of the problems of empire builders with no benefits and a sudden inability to be nimble.  everything is now essentially a branch of sales, even medical and R&D"
good,I would not suggest taking a job here at the moment until upper mgt figures out what they want and how to go about getting things done without killing there employees and contractors
good,"New management are focused on constant re-orgs and re-structures, by the time the dust settles and you figure out what is going on, another one is happening.  Used to be a great company with a great community.  Now it is eat or be eaten."
good,"This was a job where I learned a lot, but the people around me and I weren't very happy there. The atmosphere was very stressful, and people in my department had difficulty maintaining a healthy work/life balance."
good,Overall Biogen is a positive and good place to work. The work / life balance is favorable and there concern for there employees lives outside of the office is refreshing.
good,"Too many meetings and need to work overtime specially in operational areas."
good,The time working under BiogenIDEC was not ideal.  It was totted as being a merger of equals.  That it was not.  The culture suffered and the working environment was not ideal.
good,"Lots of changes, not for the better and lack of recognition for hard work and lack of advancement opportunities because it is who you know not your accomplishments or what you know"
good,Rewarding line of work calling upon Neurologists and promoting best-selling line of therapies for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis.  Company culture very stressful and cutthroat.
good,"Ability to work in different areas and Good Management. Good Image in Industry. To give good oppurnity and areas to work."
good,"es un contrato de corretaje no hay estabilidad, pero agradezco la oportunidad pero no hay que perder la sensibilidad ante el empleado."
good,"unusual place to work. The IT infrastructure is outdated and in much need of re-organisation, very silo mentality across the IT teams and very little cross co-operation or pooling of knowledge. Unsatisfactory."
good,"Constant state of reorganization, with some difficulty keeping a normal environment with a steady and constant goal.  Fast paced company (industry) where directives and decisions change quickly."
good,"Anaerobic digestion is a new technology that Biogen have been a main player in since the inception of the idea. "
good,"Possui produtos e qualidade mas ainda faltam testes específicos para serem utilizados pelos produtores brasileiros e profissionais especializados em marketing e comercial, para direcionamento das vendas e crescimento da marca no Brasil."
good,"great work force limited growth opportunity"
good,Night shift gets put in the back burner. It can take the same person 2-3years to get promoted on day shift while it will take 5-7 years for a night shift person to get promoted. Pretty unfair. They don't really govern what we do at night and also don't give them any credit either. Pretty toxic on one of the shifts.
good,Great pipeline but grew too fast and very functionally divided.  Lack of collaboration leads to inefficiencies.  Great benefits and work life balance.
good,"This job had an excellent merit system and the middle management was also good. It had a good work culture, however job security was low."
good,"professional and respectful environment , nice people , open to new technologies. good compensation. relaxed culture , right balance of diversity, leading company in the bio tech industry. satisfied customers."
good,"Company has a fast paced dynamic environment, however, very political and very much an old boys network.  Women do not advance as quickly, and very few female Sr. Leaders to advocate change."
good,Work days began by checking the controls from the run the day before to make sure that the data was valid.
good,"This is one of the best places I have worked when it comes to benefits  and pay. However when it comes to getting credit for your ideas as a woman*, I would said that you don't exist. Senior Leadership wil take those ideas and pose as their own."
good,"Fast paced workload on daily basis, learning curve is straight up. Must be able to absorb and learn new things fairly quickly."
good,"A Typical day at work is always a learning experience. I have learned in past 4 months is that if you want something to happen with your contract position, you need to make it happen. Management is very busy and generally does a great job touching base. Everyone here is nice and knowledgable. The diversity of Biogen Idec and inclusion is an amazing feat for this company"
good,"Provided Technical support for a Global IT Infrastructure supporting 6,000+ employees throughout the US and overseas. Primary focus was the Business Critical applications such as, but not limited to Oracle eBusiness Financials, Siebel 8 Helpdesk, AXIS 8 while being the primary support group for our home based Sale’s Force Group."
good,Biogen takes care of it's regular employees. They treat contractors like used tissue.  Very second class and annoying.  Like all biopharmas a lot of lip service regarding patient importance.
good,"Biogen spares no expense at making the environment for employees quite comfortable, but lacks a scientific inquisitiveness for making major advances in the field."
good,Workforce reduction programs have cut off many employees careers at Biogen.  After working there for several years I felt that it would be a good place to retire.
good,"IDEC was an excellent company...Fast paced, but friendly, collaborative, and otherwise relaxed."
good,Good place to work lot of employees keep to them selves very neat and clean.  Biogen treated employees good it had alot of extra fun stuff to do outside of work.  One good thing that Biogen offered is 30 day leave with pay after seven years of sevices
good,Best benefits in the industry; good science; employee focused; inefficient management structure (research); nepotism/favoritism; Top heavy; multiple management layers leading to ineffectual decision making
good,"(poste aux USA où la sécurité de l'emploi est beaucoup moins rigide qu'en France)"
good,A good place to work with great job security and excellent benefits. However work life balance can be an issue. The training provided is good but a huge learning curve. There is always a lot of work with lots of calls. If you don't like customer service then this is not the job for you. You have to have a heart for helping others and enjoy the healthcare environment.
good,Enjoyed with a variety of business areas within the organization.
good,"Decent place to work with highly talented and dedicated people. Company still offers good compensation and benefits, however there is a decreasing trend in recent years."
good,Great company with talented senior management. Good compensation and benefits. Company strives to help patients and has a strong pipeline.
good,"- A typical work day was very busy"
good,"I worked with some of the best people in my career at Biogen and I would not hesitate to go back if it were not for the long commute.  I do believe the company does what is in the best interest of the patients, although they often loose appreciation for the people that work there."
good,"Biogen is truly a people-centric company, but we are floundering under the talent bleed. We want more strong leaders who will provide able direction to the company."
good,Flexible working hour and benefits are good. The most enjoyable part of the job is that co-workers are friendly and collaborative. Parking garage is nearby. New facility and working spaces are pretty nice.
good,"I loved working for Biogen, but was recently told that I either had to relocate to Raleigh, NC and take a 25% pay cut or find another job as of end of June."
good,"Excellent Work Place, but need to retain experienced employees and contractors.I suggest professionals who are willing to work at BioPharma, please apply."
good,Biogen Idec seems to be one of Americans leading medical supply co. I didn't work for Biogen for a long perioid of time four days is not enough to judge. Over all the manager that I worked with was very helpful and polite.
good,"Continual  turnover of senior and executive IT Management  extremely disruptive. They do not value IT and outsource 80% of their work , minimal or no SME's in critical support roles. Very hard working and very nice  IT staff and managers, spread too thin and setting of un-realistic  objectives and goals without input from those who know better.They are trying but  morale is shot"
good,"After the first merger with Shire HGT and Shire, there were management changes that made the work environment challenging.  Those challenges caused many hard working people left with having to seek out other opportunities."
good,"Great company but with some absolute divas in the new LSM facility management team. Unfortunately they are decision makers and not to be taken lightly. The rest of the team is fantastic!"
good,"Great company, good learning experience, rewarding work, beware if you are brought on as a Contractor, this company has a culture of ""permatemping"" (keeping contractors on full time and for years)"
good,"Biogen is a patient centric company, developing innovative products for difficult diseases.  They offer many different ways for patients to get the medication they need, regardless of their ability to pay for the medication."
good,"very busy and plenty of resources around you to help get the job done. The management needed some over haul, but the people around me were pleasant and welcoming"
good,"Biogen was an awesome place to work with a culture of fairness, development and balance.  It has suffered like so many others over the years and the culture has suffered along with the benefits.  Most of the people are genuinely good, but the hiring culture has also changed where the process does not favor the prepared or experienced.  I believe they will learn these lessons and come back strong, but they have a gap to work on for sure."
good,"Attending various meetings. working on BRD, FRD. Attending various requirements gathering sessions with SMEs."
good,"Empresa bastante dinâmica, na qual a rotina de trabalho é intensa, porém satisfatória, onde foi possível aumentar meu conhecimento sobre Esclerose Múltipla e suas opções de tratamento."
good,"Biogen provides a great work environment for its employees, and promotes job development and growth. As a contractor, however, Biogen does not offer any benefits, and getting a full-time position with the company after six months is nearly impossible. In order to advance, making the right friends is more important than the impact of your performance, which I assume should be expected at a pharmaceutical giant such as Biogen."
good,The people were great to work with on a daily.  Management has lack of communication and doesn't promote within.  The most enjoyable part of working there is the people.
good,The Cambridge manufacturing site closed 31DEC16.  I can't add anything to that.  Need to keep typing to reach 150 character minimum.  Like all companies there was good and bad.
good,Great company to work for...unless you work for the IT department.  IT management changes often so policies and projects get flipped just as often.  They also like to declare total victory on major projects when the project just went live five minutes before.
good,Great work place with numerous growth opportunities. Biogen has a long tradition of integrating innovation into its daily routine. The foundation of such strong culture is embedded in many aspects of business.
good,"I love Biogen and its products.  It's been the best Company I have worked for.  However, over the last couple of years there have been many management changes and stability has been lacking.   Also due to the changes, management in my particular area (IT) did not articulate a vision or strategy so not a lot got done which was frustrating."
good,"Biogen is a time of transition and speculation about the future abounds. Pay and benefits are great, but entitlement has set in. Culture can be cut-throat and doers don't get recognized as much as those who attract attention to themselves."
good,"It was really great getting to work with friendly coworkers, but there were some issues with management in the group I was a part of. However most other groups seemed to have great management."
good,"Pros: 1. great benefits and lots of perks."
good,"Worked as a contract IT developer.  Contract ended due to new HR policy limiting contractors to 18 month stints. Despite that, enjoyed working with permanent employees who treated me with respect and kindness."
good,Great place to work excellent supervisor  family friendly allowed to learn new skills and flexible schedule.  The hardest part of the job was knowing it will end temp.
good,Company truly does care about the patriots and puts them first. Company is going through some changes now and it will be an interesting year.
good,"It's a fast-paced work environment. They've taught me a lot; I've gained a lot of experience and I feel appreciated by them for the results I achieve and, generally, as a member of their team."
good,The culture was great and my co-workers were the best I've ever had. Benefits are amazing. There are social hours once a week which makes it easy to meet people from other groups.
good,World class company in biopharmaceutical research and development but with an ever evolving culture and management style
good,Biogen Idec is a great place to work. Great benefits and a hard working culture. Opportunities to learn and grow.
good,Support and resolve Win 7 issues with Outlook client. Troubleshoot and educate new hire on MS Lync 2013/2010. Update & build tickets in (VSM) VMware Service Manager ticketing application. iPad O/S upgrade with Cisco AnyConnect app on iPad installed. Maintained and recommend upgrade on blackberry devices as per client requirement.
good,"It was a new experience. "
good,"I have learned that you must always come to work to work for the company and leave your personal issues at home,"
good,"Before coming hear I knew I wanted to make a difference in peoples lives. Biogen Idec was perfect for me because they are an established manufacturor of Multiple Sclerosis treatments. Even though I physically did not see patients, I made sure that all of their documentation was in order for the FDA and MHRA. I learned a lot in my two years here. I developed strong team work and leadership skills. I was able to maintain high standards despite challenging deadlines. My co-workers were great people and you could approach them at any time if there was an issue or if you needed assistance. The hardest part of the job was to make sure that the Case Report Forms and Data Clarification Forms were correct for database audits and inspections. The most enjoyable part was that I knew everyday I made a difference in someones life."
good,"They are trying to find the right mix of consultants, full-timers and agency partners to service the brand marketing teams. There are some growing pains in that but they are doing a pretty good job."
good,"Initially company had department to support patients with MS and supported staff in their jobs. Was hired because of background in mental health work and social services. Over the years company's mission changed to a more corporate mentality and then it was all about the numbers, metrics. In the end, company closed patient services department and laid off 40 people."
good,A good environment to get your feet wet; educated colleagues. Variety in daily tasks; fast paced. Opportunity to advance in many different departments.
good,Productive and fun place to work with the team. Very helpful team players. Ethical work place and nice place to learn the corporate culture as an advancement in career.
good,I feel that Biogen truly cares about the patient they serve. They are a very present force in the MS and Hemophilia communities.
good,"La mia giornata inizia in ufficio ca alle 07.30 e finisce alle 20.00. Lavorare in un'azienda in forte espansione è una esperienza unica dal punto di vista formativo perchè si è coinvolti in tutti i processi dal finance al business support. Biogen Idec è un'azienda fortemente orientata alla formazione e alla gratificazione dei propri dipendenti. I miei colleghi sono tutti fortemente motivati e la collaborazione non è un optional ma è nel DNA di chi lavora in questa company. La parte più piacevole del mio lavoro è quella di riucire a sviluppare i talenti che ognuno di noi ha e di raggiungere gli obiettivi, quella più difficile conciliare la vita privata con quella lavorativa."
good,"Lovely place to work when I was there, but it was very difficult to advance in any way or even make lateral moves within the company. The group I supported was involved with multiple areas of the company which was interesting."
good,Coworkers are willing to help each other learn and increase understanding of the process. They are available to answer questions and are willing to help people understand the impact of their work to other groups.
good,"Good company ,nice to work at for long term or short term. Hardest part of job 12 hour shift. Management is ok . The most enjoyable part of the job is days off though the week."
good,"Great company where to work. The management strives to ensure appropriate level of knowledge of important matters ongoing. To that end breakfast are scheduled, meetings to inform people about new products with launch offered, and others."
good,In home office setting there are way too many meetings.  This hampers execution of good ideas and/or to do items that came from the useful meeting time.
good,"Good workplace culture, tackling difficult therapeutic problems."
good,An awesome company experiencing the challenges of catching up to rapid growth experienced a few years ago. It is a company that delivers amazing therapies to the patients.
good,"Was at Biogen for the boom years - company was very generous and a comfortable place to work.  But company fell on hard times with the failure of some clinical trials - this led to perpetual rolling layoffs, massive turnover in leadership and a lot of uncertainty."
good,"- At least 9 hours of work"
good,"I worked at Biogen for 7+ years, it was a great learning and applying the skills.  "
good,I was able to develop academically. My co-workers worked very hard to achieve the ultimate task of ensuring only quality materials were used in the manufacturing process. The focus of all employees were the wellbeing of the patients for who we produced the final product.
good,"I like it there, the other employees are really friendly, nice group to work with. i like the environment. Its good to work in a place where you feel welcome. and a place where you comfortable no matter the role you play"
good,"Biogen was my FIRST dispensary position. Very smart & experienced staff. Willing to help, teach and listen to any problems you may have with the position."
good,The most interesting feature of Biogen is the down to earth nature of the personal interactions.  Biogen provided great benefits and a lot of fun events for the employees.
good,Company is committed to improving the lives of patients.  Very manual processes; systems and ways of working need to be updated.
good,Dynamic company that has had an excellent pipeline and good science.  The company has experienced tremendous growth and has a bright future. Biogen is very patient focused.
good,"Biogen Idec has been fantastic company to work for. During a typical day I can be working on anything from budgets and purchasing, to travel arrangements and supply ordering. The management team is really supportive, and assist everyone in driving towards their goals."
good,"A very diverse environment with many daily challenges.  Most colleges are very friendly, and willing to assist with any challenge that you may encounter."
good,"One of the greatest BioPharmaceuticals and BioTehnology companies in the Cambridge/Boston, MA area."
good,Great people. Nice culture. The work/life balance was difficult at times.
good,"Great pay, great benefits, great work/life balance for some areas. Management a little fickle and top heavy, but otherwise decent. Definitely a lot of growth in the future with new drugs and contract work, but hard to land a job here and people do not quit due to the quality of the benefits."
good,"Not as personal able as other companies. Great benefits. Seems like a lot of management/ directors. Growth in some areas can be difficult. Seems to be ""buddy system"" used in some areas."
good,Worked on many great international projects which required flexibility regarding the time of day for meetings.  For example if there was a meeting with a team member in Japan then it meant night or day for some of the individuals.
good,A lot of changes while I contracted there. Two significant SDLC changes within a year.  Enjoyed all of the people I worked with both in the Quality and Commercial organizations.
good,"Learned a lot from co-workers."
good,Current Research Management has lost it's mojo and is headed in the wrong direction.  Losing focus of Drug development and rather being more enamored with academic style research.
good,"Worked at Biogen for 15 years with no regrets.  Amazing people that were great mentors.  Some new senior management lately has been tough, but they are trying to do the right things.  Hard to get promoted unless you are in Boston offices.  Definitely worked weekends and extra hours but progressive in most respects.  Really rewarding place to work, they do care about patients.  The CEO George Scangos is a great guy and very sharp, I have met him personally a few times."
good,"I enjoy working at Biogen. It was my first biotech job. I had a great experience, everybody in the manufacturing department were really helpful and great mentors!"
good,"I found the opportunity to work at Biogen Inc. as an rewarding experience that allowed me to broaden my professional background as a project manager in a GxP environment. "
good,the BMS group at Biogen has been a great place to spend the last three years.  The direct management is rigorous in their science without forgetting about the human aspect of their positions.
good,"Too many reorganizations. Always feel like you're in line for a chopping block.  Depending on management endless opportunities available.  Company as a whole offers excellent benefits, but difficult to determine if you'll be there long enough to reap some of them."
good,"good place to work for benefits are good, management needs to see what their employees are doing."
good,Great company!  BiogenIdec pay exceptionally well.  The work-life balance isn't the greatest.  The benefits are unmatched.
good,"mi profesión lo realizo con diversión, alegría, para el desarrollo de los procesos, buscando internalizar con los microorganismos y tener empatía para lograr que produzcan con la misma emoción que yo"
good,Very good company to work for. Great pay and benefits. The best company I have ever worked for. Excited about seeing employees grow in their role.
good,"Fast pace work style, productive, cutting edge technology and discovery. Stressful but fun."
good,"Passionate company striving to provide top customer service for our customers. Friendly atmosphere. Well maintained work areas. Low call volume, but detailed conversations pertaining to compliance issues and patient care. Lots of training opportunities available at your fingertips. This is a company of change, change for the better."
good,"Biogen Idec will keep you on your toes with your skills-set and your work responsibibilites. No excuses for a job not well done. I enjoyed this about BIIB because I learned a great deal and being an employee that cares about the quality and quanity of her work product. On the other hand, the work / life balance stinks - I was working routinely 14-hour work days with no relief in site."
good,My previous colleagues all worked very hard to advance the projects.
good,"I was a in a contract role at Biogen. The company is very different for contractors than employees. I would readily accept a permanent role, if they should ever actually be hiring BS/MS scientists in permanent roles."
good,"great for advancement"
good,Een dynamisch bedrijf waar veel mogelijk is. Jonge mensen en veel binding tussen de werknemers.
good,I enjoy my profession and where I work.  My day fluctuates but I pretty much am independent in how I decide to run my day. I average 2-3 meetings a week. The hardest part of my job is to be friendly even when people are nasty and/or not nice to you. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping a patient receive the help they need to get the therapy they need and working with my Colleagues who are awesome!
good,My co-workers are great people who enable me to perform my job efficiently. I have learned much more about management with a focus on direct report development.
good,"I really like it here. The culture is great day to day. The management changes structure and ideas seemingly DAILY and the turnover is EXTREME. "
good,"Great work life balance"
good,The focus of the company was in flux which resulted in programs being ended after researchers put years of effort into them. Compensation and work culture was good.
good,"Great place to work, just uncertainty of future. Random layoffs always occuring and hard to talk with upper management. Benefits are great as there is great health and dental insurance. Along with 3 weeks vacation to start and unlimited sick days."
good,"It has been a pleasant experience working at Biogen, With it's growth, we as an employee grow and develop as well. It's a great company with great compensation and benefits."
good,"Biogen is undergoing some changes.  Senior management is being replaced up to and including the CEO, a new company is being spun out of existing products, one manufacturing site is being built while another one is being closed.   My job is a manager in the manufacturing facility that is being closed and to be honest, I am surprised at the amount of transparency in the closure process and the amount of services that are being provided.  They have excelled in that regard."
good,"Biogen is a results driven, innovative place to work. They are very big on work/life balance and provide great compensation and benefits. There are many opportunities for advancement, depending on your career path."
good,"Viagens"
good,Work 4 10 and off on Friday's unless we have work to be completed. Always doing things for it's employees. Great place to work.

good,"in a typical day at work i meet with the team of my department to discuss the goals of the day, how to do it and what to do to improve the process, I learn of each member of the team, after the meeting i take time to evaluate the new topics and take the decision if it is a good improve and easy of implement. during the day I have several management meeting and in my free time i meet with some co-worker to talk about different topics and in the afternoon i take some time to verify the PLC and HMI programs trying to improve the process and do everything more easier and friendly."
good,"Too much instability at the levels of upper management."

good,"This is an employer who truly cares about their employees. They have some of the best benefits in the triangle area. They offer vision, medical and dental."
good,"I am a very organized person, which helps me keep track of the volume of samples I see weekly. Biogen Idec has helped me grow as a young scientist by allowing me to think outside the box. I was allowed to experiment with new methods of detection to better support our studies. My daily tasks changed with each day, depending on projects or assays involved. This was a skill I learned quickly and now consider to be one of my best abilities."
good,- Most work days were productive with routine laboratory tasks.
good,"Great compnay to work for, looking for a new challenge and grow in my career"
good,Good place to learn sterile manufacturing skills. SOP driven manufacturing techniques.
good,"I worked here for 4 years before they laid off 11% of their workforce in October 2015. I supported a variety of execs during my tenure - VP, SVP, EVP. All applicable EA duties completed in addition to special projects, event management, etc."
good,Good company to work for. Very good management and professional leadership. Work family balance. Nice place to learn and friendly work environment that encourages you to contribute much in giving back to patients and stakeholders.
good,"-Amazing people"
good,Nouveau projet très stimulant techniquement et humainement
good,Work always began with a shift exchange which ensured the incoming shift knew what was in process. Usually production would be in process and at times it would be in a fast paced environment. Each shift had a Team Lead and a Manager. The Lead delegated who worked on what piece of equipment of activity in the process. The Manager was always there for guidance and would be the decision maker should something go wrong. Throughout the time I was at Biogen I worked as a Manufacturing Associate (MA) and that is when I learned how to operate all the equipment in Large Scale Purification. Biogen granted me the opportunity to work on other projects unrelated to being an MA and I was able to establish new programs and work on providing a safer environment for MA's with the newest Biogen safety program. The hardest part of the job was when you had to think quick if something went wrong or there were stressful time constraints. My favorite part was knowing that the product I produced went on to helping someone in need.
good,"Highly dynamic, regulated, innovative cukture-consistent"
good,"Lots of collaboration "
good,"Scope to learn a lot. "
good,"Good work/life balance, knowledgeable people."
good,"It's been nearly 3 years since I left, but most of my memories of the place were great. The reasons I left are no longer working there, so I'd consider going back."
good,Biogen was by far the best company I have worked for in my 14+ years working in this industry. A well balanced culture of hard-work and collaboration while maintaining a work-life balance approach.
good,Biogen is a great company. Only problem is they have lay off every 5 years so the career stability is not guaranteed. The company shifts organizationally too often not giving time to adjust to new management.
good,Working for Biogen was very exciting. The company always give you opportunity to grow in the company. It was normally a exciting and fun atmosphere. Working for this company I felt that I was being helpful to someone needs that's what made it worth it!
good,The management are friendly and so are the co-workers that are willing to help. They have a lot of training program to get you up to the level to complete your assignments.
good,"I truly enjoyed my time at Biogen. The product is interesting and the work culture is supportive and stimulating; a good idea of the cleaning lady is taken just as seriously as that of a CEO. The company is very well structured and is focusing strongly on GMP and GDP. In addition I was always stimulated to think out of the box and to always look for ways to improve (myself and company processes)."
good,"•	Research on Development and Characterization of Mouth Dissolving Tablet formulation."
good,"Normal typical day would start with intake and triage assessment followed by case processing."
good,"During my time Biogen Hemophilia was a mostly separate entity that was collaborative with the R & D group in Cambridge. That system had its drawbacks but it did allow for rapid decision making and clear communication within the group. We did have a management change during my tenure and while it did lead to some staff turnover, the development of the drug candidates continued rapidly and the quality of the science continued to be excellent. In the last two years at Biogen I personally spent much of my time overseeing assay development and sample testing for both pre-clinical and clinical studies. I learned about cell line development and characterization, clotting assays, SOP writing and review as well as how to implement and execute testing in a GLP setting."
good,Biogen provides an attractive benefit package.  The job is rewarding.  Having a 13 hour work day is the hardest part of the job.
good,"it has been great working there, team is very supportive and i learnt a lot. "
good,"The site culture in RTP, NC was positive and committed to helping patients.  We were collaborative, hard working and focused on achieving our objectives collectively.  I enjoyed my 20 years there."
good,"Biogen Idec is a great place to work for!  This company is growing very fast so there are many changes daily that one must keep up with.  This company cares deeply for its patients and employees, giving generously to both each and every day. "
good,"I truly liked working for this company when they were Idec. Once the merged and became Biogen Idec, it was a hostel take over. They gave Biogen employees certain things and did not apply them to the Idec employees. They laid off 150 + employees in the San Diego office. I wasn’t one of the 150 so I was saved due to my time of service with the company. I think over all that it is great company to work for if you live in the Boston area and east coast."
good,"A typical work day consists of physical security, monitoring CCTV and access control points. This was critical for the daily operations to maintain employee safety."
good,"Biogen Idec helped create an industry that has touched countless lives. We were among the world's first biotechnology companies, and today we are the oldest independent biotech firm in the world."
good,Biogen Idec is a great company to work for. The culture of excellence spans across the corporation with our focus on patients and maintaining a competitive edge within the biopharmaceutical industry.
good,"I had the pleasure of working at Biogen Idec as a contractor. The staff was pleasant to work with and if I had inquiries with upper staff or mgmt, it was addressed immediately and with professionalism."
good,"As business analyst in Biogen Idec, I participated in some large-scale projects, for example, Implement and Validate UNIX SAS 9.3 as well as the upgrade of the production servers’ hardware for the biostatistics department and R&D IT Clinical LOT Release."
good,It is a call center environment with job options other than being on the telephone. The hardest part of the job is the telephone coverage that is required. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to assist patients in anyway possible.
good,Worked here for 12 years and planned on staying until retired. Company had lay offs that affected some of the employees that had been there the longest to knock down pay scale which was pretty shady but otherwise this is a good company.
good,Biogen continues to be a company that leads the industry in neurodegenerative diseases. Scientifically strong but continues to experience organizational change.
good,"ambiance familiale et manager professionnels"
good,"Patient Services needs new leadership.  Great work/life balance.  Company potential is very high. Great training department and ""Brain"" that has easily assessable answers to procedural questions."
good,Great company to work for they definitely take care of there employees. Biogen always had some type of fun filled activity planned
good,"Complete your assignments on or before time and enjoy your working life"
good,It was a very intense couple of month right out of the shoot as we were launching two drugs as the same time.  It was fun and the leadership team overseeing the salesforce was instrumental in ensuring we had the tools to be successful.
good,"We do cutting edge science,"
good,Great Benefits! I would recommend working there! The culture is excellent and the company really works to make sure every employee has a great work-life balance. It is a caring company with leadership members who honestly care about the morale of the employees. I wouldn't change anything about it
good,"Un día típico, analizar los resultados de las siembras en los medios de cultivo, conteo de placas y reporte"
good,"Biogen Idec is a great place to work, especially if you can get in as an FTE. They do treat their contractors well, but the recent trend seems to be away from converting contractors to full time employees. Other than that, I've really enjoyed working here. People are happy, benefits for FTEs are excellent, pay is competitive, and they work hard to help employees strike a good work-life balance."
good,"I came onboard to assist with the documentation of processes, procedures, and work instructions. I assessed all existing documentation, listed processes and procedures that needed additional documentation, and prioritized tasks with the managers. "
good,"Where I worked was several hours earlier than the ""core hours"" and it would generally be a medium-paced environment. This was due to my specific group would liase with other company groups, which provided the opportunity for insight into other aspects of a biotech company."
good,"Great place to work, with flexible hours, friendly atmosphere.  Great growth opportunities and different areas to explore and learn.  Location is perfect, in the heart of Kendall square."
good,"- A typical work day was productive"
good,"I was very blessed with this position. My manager was easy to understand and held me to a high level of proficiency. He and his team provided multiple opportunities for me to use my skills in logistics, communications, meeting planning, travel and expense reporting within their Concur system. I had been looking for a position that would allow me to stretch my skills and Biogen provided an excellent environment. I very much wanted the position to go permanent but that was not to be. That being said, it was one of the highlights of my working experiences because of the administrative team I was able to work with. Every administrative team member was outstanding and from day 1 I felt welcomed. They really took the time to on-board me correctly, ensuring that I had the tools to succeed. Kudos to Biogen, and excellent place to work!"
good,Biogen Idec has a large Oracle Applications footprint in the Financials and Supply Chain Area.  Oracle is used to support the entire end to end Order Management to Cash process as well as Procure to Pay processes.

good,"Ao final de Janeiro terminou minha gloriosa jornada de trabalho de mais de sete anos na Biogen Idec, onde tive o prazer de trabalhar com ótimos produtos e conviver com colegas e clientes maravilhosos."
good,"Very fast paced environment, amazing benefits, and overall great people. You know you are working for a great cause too."
good,"Biogen Idec is a great place to work with their structured departments and their helpful coworkers. The main manufacturing group is broken down into three section: Dispensary, Cell Culture, and Purification. This allows the individual worker to learn all the aspects of their job so they may become an expert. There is the opportunity to do cross training which helps the individual become a more rounded operator. The hardest part of the job is getting use to the rotating 12hour shifts and if you don't live close to Cambridge the commute in and out of the city. The coworkers are easy to get along with and have even been known to hang out after work."
good,Biogen offers flexibility and works hard to instill teamwork and eliminate departmental barriers.
good,Un dia tipico de trabajo llegar media hora antes del ingreso
good,"A empresa Biogen foi fundamental para minha vida profissional, tendo sido meu primeiro emprego e onde aprendi e fortifiquei as bases dos meus conhecimentos teóricos adquiridos na faculdade."
good,A outgoing environment which enhances diversity and inclusion culture. A place where management treats you with respect and lead without authority. Great place to work.
good,Biogen is a good company depending on the department you work in. Biogen gives there employees lots of benefits and rewards you for good work. The one thing that needs to change is the politics and gossip.
good,Biogen is a great place to work. They have many benefits and really care about their employees. I would recommend to work here if possible. NO complaints about this company.

good,I enjoyed the time I had there. Working at Biogen was a good type of culture and management was decent but could be better.
good,"Typical back office environment; however, with a large number of employees, it's difficult to get to know many of them. Biogen works to promote employee happiness by offering good benefits, competitive salary, and flexible home/work balance."
good,"It was an amazing opportunity and I had a great manager.  Unfortunately, I had to return home because of an elderly parent was ill.There was a lot of challenging working with all of the different groups and some of the managers didn't  take ownership for issues."
good,"Biogen offers an excellent place to work and learn. Managements decisions are often opaque, especially when it comes to promotions. If you are there as a contractor be aware that you will never be offered a full time position. The work they do is important and it's refreshing to work at an organization that is on the cutting edge of discovery."
good,"Great place to work with exceptional employees. Ground breaking ideas and innovations, must do a better job to retain employees too much turnover"
good,"A typical day at work is when we, who work in the manufacturing department, sit together, brainstorm and bring forth ideas that will lead to simplication of GMPs and SOPs."
good,Good company.  Cultures is good and ambiance and the workplace are very safe. Advanced in technology and employees are so nice and helpful. Very closed to the home.

good,"I loved working at Biogen. The people were great. The company was so focused on the patients instead of profits, costs, etc which was very encouraging. This company has high moral values and integrity."
good,Employment here comes with may benefits. It is a very nice place to work. Layoff seems to be something that is very frequent at this company. Nice campus
good,"I worked at Biogen 6 years.  I began in clinical assessments of HIV positive patients, in Biogen's clinical trials.  After a couple of years, my role was pure HIV related research.  Hours were long, and I'd little time for a social/home life."
good,"Loved working here but job ended, the benefits are great, people are great, they take really good care of you, lots of summer outings, Christmas parties."
good,Excellent company to work for. Very considerate about work life balance. This company also offers excellent benefits. This job also offers great opportunity to help people.
good,"I enjoyed the company's competitive pay and  great benefits including matching 401K, dental and vision as well as good PTO incentives.  "
good,"I have learned everything from Clinical Research down to Regulatory Documentation when it comes to running a research study program. However, I have been a long term contractor waiting to go permanent."
good,"ótima empresa para se trabalhar, pessoas tranquilas, comprometidas e engajadas na cultura da empresa. Aprendi coisas novas como recursos humanos generalista, contato com profissionais de diferentes áreas. A parte dificil foi não ter perspectiva de crescimento profissional e não aplicar aspectos da psicologia na rotina. A parte agradável era o dia-a-dia com pessoas agradáveis e independencia em algumas tomadas de decisões."
good,"the only issue I had was with management. If you ever do anything wrong it follows you for the time that you''re there until they need a reason to fire you for it they will use it. Biogen was better when I first came on and then it started to change and I wasn't part of the change. I loved the people working there all except management they are really good at telling bold face lies and then act like they don't know when things happen. Don't get me wrong, Some of the leaders are awesome but I wasn't blessed to have one of them in the end. My supervisor at the time knew how hard I was working to keep my job but none of that mattered. I was just on the break of being a renewed person when the plug was pulled. They have a great culture and values they just are not living up too them fully. I was their opportunity to live up to it and they failed miserably. I just wish I was given another chance. But what goes around surely comes around."
good,Biogen is an excellent place to work. The company has grown tremendously in the past 10 years. Employees are given a competitive benefit package on the first day of employment. Biogen boasts an impressive product pipeline.
good,Biogen is a diverse company that I have enjoyed working at over the past 5 years in the patient service department. The culture and D&I is a very important part of what they stand for.
good,"Biogen is a wonderful place to work. Salary, benefits, work/life focus, mission-- all very strong. There are some downsides, like advancement is often based on ""who you know"" rather than what you know, so that is frustrating, but overall a great place to work."
good,"Management was strong within this organization, along with their training and advancement programs.  The organization motivated you to perform at your very best, and you enjoyed going into work every day."
good,"in azienda ho imparato a condividere, delegare e dare fiducia ai collaboratori nonchè l'importanza dei team building: unire i vari dipartimenti e capire chi fa cosa"
good,"My review is based on 26 years working in the Technical Development Department.  Working at Biogen Idec is greatly rewarding but demands the most from you.  The company has always run lean on headcount so expect to have more than enough work.  Compensation is excellent including vacation days.  Management is moving towards flexibility in work schedule and working out-of-office but this has not translate to the TD department.  Biogen historically has done business in a matrix/team effort which at times results in no one owning a final decision. Your colleagues are excellent people and dedicated to the job.  As Biogen matures into a prominent biopharmaceutical company, other job opportunities become available for employees to consider.  It is not unusual to find employees who have been with the company for 10+ years."
good,"Wonderful company to work for. Great salaries, and benefits. "
good,Learned so many things working at biogen management was very friendly and work place was tremendous the hard time which i suffered was didnt get the leave the most enjoyable time was every friday  after lunch we use play games sometimes wee party outside with management.
good,"Love loved loved this job! Great team, great bosses all the way up to the VPs. Loved my clients and my peers. Building had every amenity you could dream of including a starbucks, gym, cafe with chefs waiting to cook up your fav meal, you name it! The company took great care of the employees and they in turn had no complaints putting in the additional hours when needed. Access to the best software tools and programs too. I can't think of any cons except that they unfortunately shut down the entire site when corporate decided to move the company in a different direction. It was great while it lasted though,"
good,Great company that truly cares about their employees.  Great management that ensured that employees received all of the necessary training needed to perform their job.
good,The culture at Biogen was nice. The scientists were still interested in doing science and it had a biotech feel vs a pharma feel. I enjoyed working there and would recommend it to everyone
good,I loved working for Biogen wish that I would have came on as permanent employee instead of temp awesome work  environment.
good,The company has very good culture and benefit. People work hard and very aggressively.
good,"The products that they are manufacturing make a great impact on people's life. "
good,"Working in the labs and the desk job made my day very interesting.. The increasing number of products in the market kept us occupied and gave the team a room to exercise innovative ideas for more efficient procedures to meet the deadline. i was apart of an amazing team, supportive and very encouraging. The only difficult part was the change of the database system and ever increasing number of complaints. I thoroughly enjoyed the group lunches and happy hours."
good,"Biogen IDEC was such a great place to work.  As a long term employee (along with MANY others), compensation and benefits were great.  Many of us had worked together for many years and knew we could depend on each other when the team had to pull together to produce data FAST."
good,"Good work environment "
good,"Your day goes as well as you plan it. The ability to multitask, willingness, work with different team, and the willingness to accept change is important. People are willing to help to guide you to other people who can help. There is something to working in a world class biotech company that is rewarding."

good,Great Company to work for they take care of their employees by supplying them with everything they need to perform their job with excellence.
good,"I worked for financial institutions my whole working career until I worked for Biogen Idec.  I learned many things about science, drug discovery and FDA requirements.  I was very impressed at the dedication, work ethic and intelligence of the scientists.  Most days were very hectic as I worked for a VP with over 100 scientists in her group and someone always had a question or needed assistance regarding department processes.  Days flew by, weeks flew by.  It was nice to get up in the morning and enjoy going to work."
good,All of the employers who worked there was greatly supportive and always willing to help. I would highly recommend this internship for  any graduating high school students or recent college students looking for a great first internship experience.
good,"This is a place where I have been allowed to expand my knowledge and experience, where hard work is not a chore but enjoyable. "
good,Great Benefits and pay.  I would recommend working here to anyone.  Flexible work arrangements are awesome.  CEO has a great vision and company has a promising pipeline.

They strive to allow their workforce to fully participate in innovation and be a part of the team. They embrace diversity and welcome what diversity brings. They have a wonderful dining facility. They offer competitive salaries and ask everyone to be engaged.
good,"No two days the same, so a typical day was anything but typical.  Biogen is an innovative company that cares not only for their patients, but their employees.  Heavy emphasis on the work/life balance.  Their idea is a rested employee is a happy and productive one. The hardest part of my job was working for someone who was difficult to please... which really had nothing to do with the company itself.  We just had too many differences.  The most enjoyable part was the people - hard working, passionate, highly gifted and intelligent - they believe in everything the Company stands for, and it shows in their work."
good,"Worked on documenting intellectual property, setting up a search database and sending material to be digitized and stored off site. Excellent work experience. Wonderful colleagues. Was able to"

I enjoyed working in collaboration with the Clinical Team to meet their needs as well as the Records Management group."

good,"When you have a thriving company like Biogen Idec, pretty much everything at work is provided for you to do your best work, be it well stocked break rooms, to excellent office and laboratory equipment. Culture is not incredibly strict, given that everyone is doing their work successfully. With that in mind, work hours are fairly flexible, which is very nice for those with children or busy home schedules."
