good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
bad,"dont recommend it.."
bad,Terrible place to work. The supervisors suck and you won’t ever move up unless you know someone or lick their butt. You constantly get pushed to do things that are possible to do in a whole shift.
bad,"POOR MANAGEMENT"
bad,Worst company to work for. The Cresson terminal managers had there head up there butt. Don’t really know how that place operates......................
bad,"Scotts will do anything to increase sales. They train you to lie about the benefits of their products. They steal space in the stores from other vendors. The have you remove and hide other vendor's products so there will be no competition. They make you break OSHA & other safety rules with an attitude of "" what ever it takes to get the job done.""In the Industry their reputation for these tactics are well known, therefore you get no respect or support from store and vendor personnel or mgmt. HR department is a joke."
bad,Extremely unethical and cultivate animosity vs teamwork. Employees are not allowed to work with confidence. Highly hypratical to PR message of promoting healthy environment since they deal with carcinogenic and now in the canbis business. 2 major EPA infractions and the ceo has a nepolean and arrogant behavior. He leads with a motto of racism and endulges in attention .
bad,Horrible work environment. Worked the sales guys 6 days a week without OT. Actually had a class action lawsuit against them for this. No HR focus. Management was horrible.
bad,"Merchandisers are ""just merchandisers"".  We aren't good enough to get a greeting from the arrogant managers. Constant finger pointing (do this  and do that). Just treated like we are nothing."
bad,"If you like having a balanced life this is NOT the job for you Long hours, excessive work, cold temperatures, lazy office....the list goes on and on. Winter time there is nothing to do, layoffs happen.    The company actually offers layoffs and you keep benefits....not sure if that is legal. The job isn't hard just the amount of work that needs to be done. Turn over rate is insane, this is a dirty facility, little support from a crabby office staff"
bad,Hired seasonal and I was fired because I wasn't in the budget sales went down the manager said so he said I'm sorry we have to let you go don't give me a end date of when I would be done and you let me go way before that.  That was such a terrible experience an I never had a job let me go like that..  Unprofessional!!!
bad,it was a temp job was only there less then three months took the job for extra cash and till I could find something better it was a dirty place to work
bad,Good company but my department not good due to old fashioned manager approach .He is micro manager and not cooperative person .He force people to work on everything but not to share management decision information to team members.
bad,"Long hours, to nothing to do.  This is a seasonal job, so be prepared to be bored during the slow season.  temporary seasonal workers, make for a unsafe, scary work environment."
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked !! Dirty inside , 6 days a week 14hrs plus a day, No chance of moving up in the company, .The scotts employees don't care about you!!"
bad,"Boss is an a**hole "
bad,"First of all it's not so much a merchandising job as it is a stocking job. Merchandising requires thinking this is mindless work. "
bad,"Horrible company culture. Virtually zero training. You will be thrown into the field expecting high sales 6 days a week. Management treats sales team like garbage. Even if you sell high volume and revenue you will be fired quickly if you have a bad sales week or two. Terrible customer service, constant lies from managers, many unhappy customers. Complaints are not properly addressed. Expect to work 60 plus hours per week plus every Saturday. You will have no family or personal life. Low base salary, very poor paying commissions, gas milage not enough to even pay for the gas. Must use your own vehicle. Physically and mentally exhausting, led me to be sick. Not worth it."
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
bad,"Dirty, dirty, dirty. I know the place made growing media, but everything was always covered in dirt. Machines broke down all the time, and the maintenance staff had their hands tied and couldn't fix much."
bad,"Forget everything you know about honesty and integrity when you accept your inside sales job offer from Scotts Lawn Service in Elgin. A typical day at work is making about 200+ outbound calls to customers who have previously rejected service or up-selling existing customers. You will be on an automatic dialer talking to people who have already been called and called and called. Management only cares about sales numbers for the day and going golfing. The hardest part of this job is working 70+ hours a week, only getting paid for 40 (besides commission) and never seeing your friends or family. There is no job advancement whatsoever, only made up titles and more responsibility for the same pay. The environment is very deceptive, dog eat dog and you will be thrown under the bus."
bad,"Only work here if your under 25 and live at home.  The pay sucks, no vacation time.  You will work for only 6-8 months out of the year.  Then you will be unemployed."
bad,"Please do yourself a favor and find another company to work for.  Unless you like working ten+ hour days and don't forget you have to work Saturday's too. For all those extra hours you get paid 1/2 your regular rate and your regular rate would be awesome if you were working in the 1970's. Working isn't so cool when it's 90 degrees and you have to wear pants, long sleeved shirts and boots that make your feet sweat. This is that way across the country. You do get several months of unpaid vacation in the winter though, which is a real bonus. Hopefully you don't have any bills to pay, just rub you hands together when the heat gets turned off. You get a chance to get a raise after 2 years at which time you're looking at a kick in the teeth.  Bottom line is this company could care less about you."
bad,"I worked there for a little while as the quality control technician. They are unorganized, rude and backstabbing. The production supervisor was ex military and he treated the employees like they were stupid and didn't know how to do anything. He was mean to the employees. He tried to cover up stuff by making the people he managed take the blame for his mistakes. He does not even know how to run any of the machines on the floor. The office manager was the rudest of them all. She tried to do as little as she could, she needs to be fired. Everyone in that facility that works in the office needs to be FIRED and they need new people in there ASAP. THIS IS A HORRIBLE COMPANY TO WORK FOR. I DONT RECOMMEND ANY ONE TO WORK FOR THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE."
bad,"I've worked here off and on out of necessity. Because unfortunately there are no job options in my area. They hire you through a temp. service. They then have you do a years worth of within 6 months then lay you off in the spring. There is an unwritten policy, that if you get an injury from working and you report it, as intructed, you are fired. You are underpaid for hard work that is only made harder so some fat cat, can line his pockets. There is no chance of being hired on full time. It's barely above indentured servantry."
bad,It seemed like the harder you worked the less they noticed. The less you said the better. I worked 6 pm to 6am. With no supervisor. I really enjoyed the position. Wish I could have been hired as a permanent employee and given benefits.
bad,"Management are a bunch of LIARS!!! Ghosting of lawns was a COMMON practice, techs do nothing, stick a bill in the mailbox and drive off!!! Happened in every region the east Tennessee call center covered from Raleigh, NC to Memphis, TN!! MGMT blamed staff for all the lost revenue and you lost your job if you didn't SAVE at least 95% of customers who said to cxl the account. Common customer statement: MY LAWN LOOKS LIKE S***!!! OFFICE MGR, SALES MGR, and TECH MGR ALWAYS PUTTING OUT FIRES AND BILLING MGR ALWAYS GIVING REFUNDS!!!"
bad,"No training, impossible expectations, monotonous, and no validation. Paid for 40 hours actually work 60+ and is just a miserable existence. If you want to be over worked and under appreciated this is the job for you. If you want to be constantly belittled and humiliated, this is the place. If you want no training but high expectations to know everything, sign at the ""X"". If you want to enjoy your life and have a family, don't work here. It was the WORST 2 years of my life."
bad,"If you are looking to go to a company that puts your safety in danger than this is the place for you.   The office/breakroom flooded when it rained.  If you apply for a job and they tell you changes are coming, they are not--they have not for over a year.   The office got moved to a trailer, not an office building, the loading dock is unsafe and made of dirt.  I cant tell you how many drivers were in ahh of the horrible dock, and that OSHA allowed it.   I have a feeling if OSHA went there the plant would be shut down."
bad,"This is one of the worst jobs I have ever had.  Dirty, and you will work with mainly felons but when you have such a unsafe, dirty, horrible culture that is all you can get. "
bad,left after 10 weeks worst mistake of my life talk to people like dirt very dirty and dusty environment. people walk out not as expected no job satisfaction.
bad,Toxic and hateful work environment created by the company and its management. Due to a divided work force between full time employees (green hats) and much needed and overworked and underappreciated contractors (Orange hats)
bad,Does not follow own mission statement for quality or working environment. Turns blind eye towards safety. Lack of follow through from corp. leadership
bad,"In my 5 years of working at Scotts, I have seen dozens of people fired. They care more about the temps then full time associates. The factories are politically biased. Working conditions are horrible. Very dusty and refuse to buy more dust collectors. Always short on people and constant retaliation once you voice your opinion. Corporate factory pays 5-10+ dollars more an hour than the rest of the plants that do the same job. Numbers matter more than safety. In the span of my 5 years I have had 2 plant managers, 4 different supervisors, 11 different foreman. Oh and one death."
bad,"I would not recommend this place at all Management is awful and rude. And disrespectful to there employees. They be little and discourage there employees. The company it’s self is amazing, but this facility needs to clean house and get new management in there."
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
bad,"Management and supervisors think they are better than everyone else, they say 1 thing & do the other, dirty & cutthroat, run away as fast as u can.Bad."
bad,"I learned a lot at this company, mostly how people should not be treated and managed. Management was poor and under qualified. Work place culture was grossly unprofessional. Hardest part of the job was dealing with management. Best part of the job was being funding and benefits."
bad,"the worst management ever. no clue how to treat people. temps are just cheap labor yr to yr.to them, if you like to clean all the time and be stressed out then maybe its the job yor you"
bad,"Stock shelves for lowes on the weekend,  Never worked a day at the store. just did on line training. like to have the oprunity to work."
bad,your basically working in a concentration camp and the plant manager is hitler. they take safety way too far. Dont get me wrong im all for safety but a person is only as safe as they want to be. The scotts company in morrison is a joke because of the way managment treats there employees. any other plant world wide i would recomend but trust me when i say stay away from morrison IL plant.
bad,The company was short of staff and refused to hire the man power for jobs requested. They punished employees if they refused overtime but complained about paying for the overtime work.
bad,If management had a clue or a care in the world it would be a great place to work. Plant manager that does not care about his workers and is barely here to know whats going on. They do not train employees. The temp agency's do nothing good for this company. If the management team doesn't know how to do their job or care about their job. Then who will?
bad,"I can understand a company that doesn't allow smoking on the job, but last time I checked, we don't live in Russia and it's none of my employers  business what I do on my own time. Unless they want to pay me 24/7, my time isMINE! There are plenty of jobs out there that respect their employees privacy and rights."
bad,I didnt like them at all. They lied and jerked you around all the time. They were too up and down with hours. They didnt compensate well with the amount of travel involved.
bad,"ScottsMG is more focused on advertising and stockholders than it will ever be in employee productivity , employee benefits or employee retention with a great number of their retail partners are in extremely seasonal locations so the window of sales is very short so all they want is cheep part time short time labor"
bad,"Soaring stocks ,a ever changing budget,I put two seasons in got layed off twice,two unemployment claims through two temp agencies,I worked with some of the laziest people I’ve ever met in my life there ,and the most two faced employees watch your back ,one guy who ran amazon building just played video games and booked cruises for his vacation and read audio books all day long ,while all the people they gave him quit at least 5 people because they do all the work while he does nothing really and the dude even sleeps on the job, how this guy has a full time job making $20.00 hr doing literally nothing there is beyond me,guess it’s his inventory duties that keeps him there and the guy is fat the have alcoholics that drink on the job ,on the lines and double forklifts,one guy did over $ 40,000 dollars of damage and was not fired and this guy is a real drunk,they will use temps for all the dirty work,plenty of illegals hiding out there also the guy that runs it for the past 12 years likes illegal immigrants working under false socials ,one moron had to pay child support that s what you get they come and go every year they have a lot of family members working there also a lot of self entitlement from people who feel there entitled this is not a place to work if you want a full time job stay away from Lebanon Marysville needs to clean that plant from top to bottom place is a jo"
bad,"Did  not work there long enough to give a unbiased opinion.  The  job was  seasonal and I was glad, because I never knew who was in charge. Too many chiefs."
bad,"Long hours, bad balance between work and home. Always promised full time to new employees but hardly any openings that get filled. Always shorthanded."
bad,"Worked as a temp to hire, or so I thought. Company has a no nicotine policy for new hires only."
bad,"Very busy job with unorganized managers, terrible hours, bad work/life balance, bad pay, constant lifting, pulling + pushing pallets unmotivated coworkers, poor organizational culture, high stress work environment, lots of products to manage."
bad,"A typical day at Scotts is you start your day cleaning up after the shift before you, doing double the work for they do not hire any experience people and pay everyone the same money...there is no incentive in this place .......management, well there's really no management because they're never there too watch anything, the culture hmmmmm there is no culture just a fake safety meeting, the hardest part of the job is wanting to do well and move up, it is definitely a boys club that's led by a plant manager who will bold faced lies to you to get what they need a that moment ...... the most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out and going home"
bad,"From the Residential Turf Management division, a typical day requires one to be in optimal physicalcondition.. A Turf Manager will probaly push about 600 pounds of fertilizer in a spreader per day or spray 300 gallons of product per day while walking in all types of weather conditions. The starting  pay is not all that great for the physical conditions you are under. "
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
bad,A lot of unsafe areas at this location and never would fix the problems. always make more product no matter what. Did not enjoy this company racist. Learn don't tell everyone who you voted for.
bad,"I have been working here for over two years and I much as I have learned there is not an opportunity for me to grow locally. I would have to change regions to move up. I work the 9-6 shift M-F which means I have to take the day off to schedule doctors appointments for my child. The management staff is confused about every day transactions and honestly it just a bit overwhelming. Every morning, I come in to an average of 15-40 voicemails that have to be checked for the ATL Market. Attempt to address the 300 various call logs that come in for the ATL within a 2 day time frame (which doesnt happen). Assist the CSAM with everyday task such as or getting memos to the CSR team, locating error within the system, speaking with help desk to fix the various problems with office equipment, take a basic inventory for biweekly ordering of office supplies."
bad,Typical day consisted of starting work at 6:00 am only to work till very late at night. Trying to deliver sales goals that at times were very unrealistic.
bad,"-Be prepared and or willing to make large sacrifes in your Personal and home life due to the constant mandadation or overtime hours. "
bad,I work within logistics of the company.   I find the upper management is cut throat.  Still idea's and take all the credit.  Specific managers was a director and is now a VP is not trustable and takes credit for his employees doing the job creating cost savings and then takes all the credit.  If he feels you are a threat he makes you look bad.
bad,Poor management.  They let high paid managers and other employees go and do not replace them sometimes for years.  They expect other employees to pick up the slack and sometimes take on multiple job responsibilities outside of their scope of work without any extra pay or benefit.
bad,"This is a churn and burn job, where they will hire close to 100 people in the spring and whittle down to 5-10 by end of summer and then lay you off in October. Benefits are great IF you can get them, but you will start out as seasonal with no health insurance available. They talk big about giving it to the top sales people......just don't expect it. Top sales people may earn $30,000-34,000 (which includes getting unemployment for 3 months). I am glad i worked there, but am happy to have a better job. I did enjoy being able to work outside and walking 2-4 miles a day was great exercise."
bad,"Scotts Miracle-Gro is very disorganized when it comes to their field reps. They tell you that you have a job full time until the end of September. Halfway through the season they cut half the staff and still tell those left that they will be employed until September. Two weeks later the budget changes again and your hours are reduced. Not even 2 weeks later they change the budget and hours again yet a third time. At that point you are part-time and will have hours though until September. Not even a week later the budget changes again and you have until the end of the week. Doing all this even when you beat sales for the year for the year a month or 2 early and some of the stores you service are up 15 to 25%. This has happened every year and gets worse each year."
bad,Scotts was fast pace I enjoyed working on the line the only thing was every time you turn around the line would brake down. One thing I didn't like about the company it was a lot of underhanded things going on to get on full time.
bad,"I do not recommend working for them...unless you have no education and are looking develop skills for direct prospecting.  "
bad,"If your only need is money to pay your bills, Scotts will help you with this. When it comes to planning, family, health and job satisfaction, they fail at this miserably"
bad,ok part time seasonal job Fertilizer is heavy working by myself most of the time too much work for 1 person
bad,"."
bad,"Company only cares about money, as they work you on production line to pump out as much they can while quality is lacking. Nowhere to advance even though you are cross trained in different departments."
bad,"typical day consist of going to multiple stores and merchandising products ,setting floor sets and ordering product. nice company to work for."
bad,If you like to walk and walk and walk and walk then you will love a door to door sales position with this company. If you like to talk and talk and talk and talk the same thing holds true. If you like to work in brutal cold or blistering hot weather than be my guest and sign up for this sham of a job. If you like to work 6 days a week and an average of 70 hours per week with no family work balance than what are you waiting for. If you like to hold a seasonal figure 20 week job that pays nothing but survival money than step right up. If you want to be told that after 20 weeks of hard work that the only way they can keep you is to make you an aerator over seeder; which by the way is one of the most physically challenging jobs a man can do; in blistering humid conditions sign right here on the dotted line. If you want to work for a company that does not give a hoot about its customers and constantly be yelled at by those same customers what are you waiting for LOL
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
bad,"Somewhat productive workplace. The management effectiveness is very questionable, prepare for a bombardment of instructions via tacky text messages and lame motivational phrases. You will deal with the weather and work Saturdays. The pay is above average but the obstacles and job life/interest does vary. Co- workers are all competitive so don't expect much help, I thankfully got all of the training I needed from a competitor company."
bad,"This is a face pace high performance company. The values and the culture the top leaders speak of is the top in the industry. Unfortunately, it does not trickle down the chain of command. It is simply a vision that has not become reality. The company is full of valuable and intelligent employees. The hardest part of this job was maintaining a work-life balance. Due to the high demands of the company and the amount of resources allowed, each individual does the job of at least two people. This translates into the volume of work and the number of hours required to complete it. The company reorganizes and restructures every year. This makes everyone uneasy and not secure with their job. There is a very high turnover rate within the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was the effort that the company makes to give back to the community and its employees with events for the families."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was the constant changing of direction on a daily basis and no career path options available.  It was very frustrating to have the same issues with inventory being available to fill orders at various warehouses to get orders shipped at 100 percent and on time.  After working in supply chain for five years with no changes/improvements made with order processing procedures/issues, it was time for me to move on."
bad,There can be long hours during the spring.But the pay is worth it. The  management is out for themselves and do not believe in helping employees. Would be a great job except for that.
bad,protocols are not followed properly. High expectations from new workers with no real training. They dont provide the safety needed for being around chemicals
bad,I was not what I thought.it was going to be  to much cleaning and heat. most of the time was cleaning animal feces like rat and bird from their product at the stores.
bad,There is not a whole lot of communication between bosses and employees. They really don't tell you anything along the lines of training. They just put you in a spot and let you go.
bad,Leader in their industry with old products. Didn’t successfully bring to market new products while there. After leaving SMG I went to work for and independent hardware store and they were hard to work with compared to every competitor.
bad,Management was very cliquey  did not care for this role at all.  Good products and opportunity to work on big brands - just did not like the culture.  L
good,"this is a seasonal job with no benefits, if you just looking for extra money and you can handle heavy lifting and a lot of test on the computer for product knowledge"
good,"learned about plants.It was fun but, did not last long."
good,Usually travel between two stores a day to check on Scott's products. I would communicate with store managers about getting our product displayed in different areas of the store. Have store associates to pull down any product that is in overhead and find locations for it throughout the store. Making sure the right price and promotional signage is out on all product.
good,Management does not fix any issues. The people are all okay with doing minimal work relying on few to work hard and keep up with work flow. Hours are insane.
good,"They like to bring in consulting firms to ""clean house"" every few years, so not a lot of job security.... especially if you are higher in the ranks...."
good,Prepare to work 60+ hours a week. Management is a complete joke. Major disconnect between upper management and employees. The most enjoyable part is going to different places every day
good,"pays good but a lot of drama"
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
good,"D2D Sales Rep.  Don't look at this as a job. Look at it as a temporary fill in.  In sales, that's how you are viewed by Scotts so why not turn the table on them. You are safe your first week- maybe 2.  After that, if you don't make your sales quota you are gone.  They breed an environment of lies and cheating which ultimately filters down to the customer. Scotts wins. The sales reps and customers lose.  It's so numbers driven that the focus of where it all started - the customer has lost it's original intended purpose. Ghosting is common ( technicians claiming to have serviced a lawn but don't ).   Signing up customers for services they never really wanted ( maybe wanted 2 applications but get all 6).  Over 60 hours a week 6 days a week only to miss time with family for 12.00 per hour ( if you break it out hourly and that's WITH the minimum sales quota commission).  Is it worth it? If you are not working, need something to do and don't have any options. Just keep it in perspective of being only temporary."
good,It was a good a job except that it is seasonal and the glyphosate thing. I did not like working with chemicals sometimes when it was really hot outside.
good,unless yo u come in as a manager or just happen to be in right place at right time your going nowhere.the states of Ohio and Washington are best bets for advancement.
good,"The efficacy of time and efforts improved the facility quite literally lead the facility from a plant ranking near dead last to a top five ranking in every category."
good,"It was fun working there but with the changes management has become shortsighted and want people to work long hours. Which is not possible if you have family. Less flexibility to manage work and personal life. Company lacks leadership view of nurturing the talent."
good,If you are super-political and interested in your own advancement and how you look to senior management even without having a clue about what people beneath you do then this is the place for you!
good,"Great place to work. its located in pearl, ms. I like the hours because its 6 am to 2 pm. they have 3 differemt shift to work for and were off every weekend."
good,"Mediocre management, awful job security, and terrible opportunity for advancement. Sufficient benefits and paid vacation. Management forced employees to work on weekends without overtime, and never mentioned these circumstances in the interviews."
good,"The sales manager I was under is a liar, and only cares about what he wants.  He basically preached to us about the bottom line numbers, while doing nothing to help.  We worked 6 day weeks, and he would come in, give a morning meeting and then go home until the end of the day (when he showed for close).  FANTASTIC COMPANY!!! Horrible manager.  He once gave a co worker greif about going to his daughters FIRST B DAY because he had forgotten that the employee requested the time off."
good,Its been a few years but I have talked to a few reps that now work for Hershey and its pretty bad. Sales reps are now hourly employees and they basically treat them like garbage. When I was with Hershey we were treated like peasents but not garbage.
good,Door-to-Door sales in all types of weather. Inside/Outside sales selling lawn care and weed control products
good,Make and take calls to generate business for the company. Help out with production in the fall. I earned bonuses for exceptional sales and service. Consistently produce the most sales revenue per week in my office. I achieved #1 in my region in spring sales in a class of 99. My office achieved market of the year award in 2011 for customer service throughout the entire nation. Consistently help and train current sales staff.
good,I enjoyed my co-workers. Learned a new industry that i have never had experience in.
good,again this is something I should not have to do to apply for jobs. who ever thought of this as being a good idea should rethink things. I am just trying to find a job.
good,not a bad place to work there good opportunity and good hard work holiday benefits are great.  Its just to up tight for my country blood to work there for to long.
good,Never knew day to day if you were working or not. Never knew how many hours you would be able to work depending on product change or placement. Often only 2-3 members of the 5 man crew were actually working.
good,Scott's wasn't bad to work for except if you worked 1st shift you had to work swing shift every two weeks between 1st and 2nd shift.  You never had time to adjust.  I opted to work 3rd so at least I was on one shift.  When they opened a new plant they wanted to make us take a significant pay cut to stay on or move to Mississippi without any notice.  It was a lose lose situation.
good,I like what I do because I am a Customer Service Focused . Every day is a challenge and a good opportunity to deal with Customers because I am learning a lot from them.
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
good,"limited direction, frequent changes in assignments, insufficient training and orientation and direction. Assignments are given without explanation and objectives. Worked alone often and di not always get timely responses from manager about stock placement for upcoming promotions."
good,"In spite of management flaws, I enjoy the work and the work atmosphere. I want to be hired in full time and not have to work through the temp agency. I've had 2 tours with this job and would take it if they offered full time,  non-seasonal employment."
good,"Exciting and challenging to work for a company that is number one in its industry, the leader with huge consumer awareness and brand equity.  The everyday work colleagues are all team driven for the common cause. Senior Management can be difficult and create a hostile work environment.  They do not value employees who are doing the right thing and making an impact.  Always changing the organization and losing many valuable people who have helped create the company, driven the business, and made senior management money."
good,"Talent Development, Coaching, Compliance, Employee Relations, Change Management and overarching support for the business"
good,"manageing a 12 million dollar territory. Calling on Home Depot,Lowes and Walmarts to follow all corporate plans to maintain the inventory and increase sales."
good,"you will work with no overtime, they have a agriculture overtime pay system, which means you will work 50-70 hours for 1/2 time, not 1 1/2 overtime. now part of trugreen."
good,"The role consisted of making sure that the products for Scotts Miracle-Gro, Round Up, and Ortho are being displayed properly to increase sales. On hands of products often have to be checked to report any errors and to inform your sales manager why the numbers are not good for a certain product.  This job involves working inside and outside of Home Depot and Lowes in their garden and their pest control products sections. The forklift drivers for these companies will often be the largest cause of your stress during the day because of how much they drag to help you move heavy pallets using the forklift. Their managers sometimes change where you set something up, like a display, when you are not there, to please another vendor."
good,"The good:"
good,"Very good place to work. Biggest downside was the lack of work-life balance. I would work 60+ hours per week in order to hit the annual projections until October and then we would be forced to take part in a ""voluntary layoff"" and be unemployed for the last three (3) months of the year."
good,"If your looking for 40 hrs, then it's OK. In my personal opinion, it has some prejudices that started to bother me. I started feeling uncomfortable and it began to affect my everyday work habits. That's when I made the decision to leave. When you get on their bad side or they don't like you, they come up with ways to get rid of you. And they do it in a way so that it doesn't fall back on them. Upsetting to me."
good,"Job duties limited.  No opportunity for advancement.  Cross training not allowed.  Micro-management practices.  The hardest part of this position is handling the stresses created by a mico-manager and no set guidelines for tasks.  Guidelines and procedures change frequently based on management mood.  Great co workers.  Overall, a good company to work for."
good,Best in class lawn care products produced in a lean environment. A fast-paced work place setting with field and site based employees who work together to achieve common goals.0
good,Over all a good company to work for.  Co-workers are a reason to remain with the organization. Tremendous amount of exposure and experience with cross-functional teams and in areas outside of expertise.  Inconsistency in direction and constant change in strategies from leadership make it difficult to complete objectives and advance projects.
good,Very challenging working environment with good co-workers.  Lots of constant change.
good,It was a seasonal job. Had to drive around to different locations. The pay was alright.
good,With great products comes great responsibility. Work/Life balance is probably the most pressing issue.
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
good,The career was a very good choice for someone with out a degree. The positions for advancements were always good. After the CEO made some crazy changes that all dissipated and expectations were raised to extreme levels that could not be met.
good,I believe they are weak in management and holding certain individuals accountable for their actions.  I believe this will hurt the companies direction if not dealt with.
good,Scotts is a fast paced high energy work environment.  Upper management is inconsistent at times and ever changing.  Good environment to gain work experience
good,"It's an ok place to work, as long as you keep our friends and work separate."
good,"to start off  scotts company is a great company ,I have worked with great   team workers. also the products scotts sales is  best of the best. if you enjoy this  there no hard part of the job.thanks to scotts I had great  d.m. leaders and regeional s. d .m. top of the day is dropping overhead and gaining increamental displays and interacting with customers and store employes."
good,A lot of hours in a short period of time. Never a dull moment! Always on the go!
good,Scotts is a seasonal job that allows you to display your selling and merchandising skills
good,A typical day at work for me would be me knowing that i want have the man power but I have to make it work.I learned that its not always easy managing a big group of people. Mananemant can be fun once you gain respect from your co-workers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with a million problems at one time. The most enjoyable part of the job would be knowing that we were sucessful eventhough it wasnt easy
good,I worked for Scott's for a summer to take the place of an internship and actually make some money. They paid above minimum wage and my boss was a enthusiastic and motivated individual.
good,"I loved my job when I first started, Really the first 10 years. The last four years they have had management changes and slowly terminated the entire office staff, The last 4 years have been really hard."
good,"I've been involved in a variety of Green industries (Landscaping, Nursing, Retail L&G, Golf Courses, etc.) so i really enjoyed working with people and in Big Box L&G departments. Going to different locations was also nice and work wasn't repetitive at all. After awhile thought the physical toll out weighed working with the products and people. Even though your job is a sales counselor the emphasis is more on being a human forklift at times. Lots of times without the assistance of coworkers or store employees. Having extensive product knowledge was a second thought to being physically able to move products, very heavy pallets of products and downstocking of heavy boxes on shaky ladders. Training advises to work as a team for moving large objects but many times your by yourself. Plus, there are times you independently which is nice."
good,Production is fast and good for exercise. Me and the rest of the team box up 6 rows and 10 to 20 pallets a day. Then we ship them out to stores like Walmart.
good,The company has  closed so there's no need for a review because they're no longer in business if I had to do it again I would not have stayed there as longas I did.
good,I would not recommend Scott's to any of my friends or family they don't care about your work like they do care about safety that is one thing they do care about but it is not a good company to work for
good,Started early in the day finished early. I learned about how to take care of a lawn. What to use for insects and what to use for deseases in lawns. Very enjoyable to deal with customers.
good,"To many duties and not enough help. Low hourly wage and not enough hours. Not enough money to survive in the present economy. "
good,I was not with the company for very long. I was a door to door sales person and the turn rate on that position is high. I would not recommend the position to a person that is not ok with a lot of walking or not ok with people shutting the door in your face because you will experience a lot of both of those things.
good,"I was working for this job for many years, as a temp, I learn a lot on this job, from putting my hands to work to collecting data from study's, running machinery organizing, prepare ring product for study's, communicating with others to complete tasks that need it to complete."
good,I have worked there for about two weeks and it been pretty good so far. I am learning a food amount of things here. I have been training to work on the bottle machine.
good,"Currently driving a fork truck for Full Steam Staffing at Scotts Miracle-Gro. At ScottsMiracle-Gro, we believe in the importance of giving back. As a leader in the communities where we operate, we take to heart the phrase, ""find a need and fill it,"" a belief firmly held by Miracle-Gro founder Horace Hagedorn."
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
good,"Managed cross functional teams to ensure timeline, quantity and quality were met. "
good,"The Scotts Company offers a lot of opportunity. There are many divisions under the Scotts umbrella including plant level shipping and manufacturing, lawn care, and other subsidiaries."
good,Even with work and family on a daily basis.  Looks out for their employees and expects the same for the company.  Good for someone who enjoys lawn and garden.
good,Scott's is a good company to work for. They have flexible hours and shifts. I like working for them. The people are friendly.
good,Great first job if you're looking to expand your communication skills and go a little out of your comfort zone. You knock door to door and sell Lawn Care to people. I'm glad I took the job and it was worth the experience. Pays well for young kids who like to socialize.
good,This is a highly productive workplace. You are fully trained to mix chemicals properly and to run your own route on a daily basis.
good,"How one manages change and guides employees through the process tells the story of company culture. Well thought out and planned change keeps employees engaged and productive, sudden changes in direction, structure, leadership and mission create uncertainty, fear and disengagement."
good,"Once again, difficult place to work. Not for everyone. Excellent associates to work with. All very co-operative. Some of the best workers I've ever worked with in my life."
good,"Scotts is a fast growing company with lost of opportunity for process improvement. This is a fast pace environment, where you need to be able to change gears quickly. In the TA world there is never a dull moment and there is always something to work on."
good,"Very seasonal in the midwest- very long hours and weekends in spring early summer and fall.   Numbers driven, but what business isn't."
good,"- Inventory, restock, order."
good,"Assist EVP of Company Management"
good,"On a typical day at work, you will arrive a bit early to spend some time refreshing yourself on the events of the day before and prepare a plan for your day, you will likely be interrupted several times, have urgent meetings to attend, work through your lunch, realize you have not yet accomplished the things you intended to complete in the day (due to the ""priorities"" that interrupted you) and you are already leaving later than expected."
good,"get to lowes early, start to see what products are low then go in back or check up top for more product. Use ladders and pallet jacks inside store. I have learned alot about lawn and garden how to get grass green and stay healthy and how to keep mosquitos away."
good,"I'm required to down stock and up stock ,stack product up to 60 lbs. Merchandise products,reset bays in Major Box Stores"
good,"Friendly employees, hard workers and yet found time to chat."
good,"Manditory overtime for Temps was rather ridiculous, especially when they would have 6 of us stay for 1-3 trucks, on average an extra hour and a half to 2 hours, all because the 3 permanent drivers wouldn't say they would stay to take care of it, so management looked at it like fine everyone stays."
good,Machine Operator duties was to operate the bagging machine and keeping an eye on the machine making sure it was in operating condition so the product would be properly bagged
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
good,"Overall pay and hours are decent."
good,"It was a part time job, I do not recommend this company to be taken into consideration in your personal or professional growth, to the level that works."
good,This is is a fun work environment something different everyday.i like to work as a team for one common goal  this is everyday at Scott's.also get to work  outside quite a bit.
good,"So wrapped up in putting revenue metrics together, that focus is lost on putting together good processes and tools upfront to curb problems and issues, thus you are always putting out the daily fires not being able to catch up.  If it were recognized that money makes money and more money was spent on adding staff, training and quality tools to curb the issues, there would be less of a revolving door of  employees quitting, retraining, rework, lost knowledge, etc. and revenue metrics would magically not only be positive but also grow."
good,"Exciting, fast paced and ever changing work environment.  Seasonal company where work during the busy season may be 7 days a week and up to 12+ hours/day.  Challenging job where you are constantly learning!"
good,"Pros – Make your own hours."
good,"Scott's is a great company to work for. They really care about you and the community, very personal all the way up through management. They are a very high paced and at some times labor intensive however it doesn't go unnoticed in the eyes of management. They constantly show how much you are appreciated other than a thank you and a pay check. Frequently buy lunch for everyone and especially during the hot months the coolers are always stocked with cold drinks and the freezer with ice cream and popsicles"
good,"The work was good; neither too tough or too easy. The pay wasn't worth the work. If the pay was too be higher, the employees would enjoy the work a bit more."
good,The frontline empployees and local level management are awesome and understand what it takes to manage the business however the corporate team leaves a lot to be desired.  Policies and procedures are not considerate of internal or external customer needs.
good,"I enjoyed this outside sales position, fast paced many tasks that kept the job interesting.  I enjoyed establishing relationships with customers.   I also enjoyed the selling to established accounts and no cold calling"
good,A good company with great products for consumer lawn needs. The company has some perks that add to the enjoyment of the work year. There is often a lot of overtime during peak season and a very steady work schedule during this time. I did gain management skills and to be a people person.
good,"The Scotts Company is a very goal driven environment to work in, bordering on obsession. Many safety and hazardous conditions were overlooked in the drive for high numbers and productivity. Overall, it was a decent place to work with plenty of room for improvement."
good,"Make sure All Scott's products are mapped correctly and marketing is on display and up to date"
good,Meet a lot of people and good environment just need better pay/benefits. I learned a lot about lawncare and pest control its a good company to work for.
good,In short... it is a good company. They try to keep up with the times by introducing new and improved processes and procedures as the business requires. The problem they constantly face is that since the company is dependent on the weather. The uncertainty of any project is always at risk and it introduces the problems of miss understood directive from the management. I has a good family atmosphere and it is a good place to have a successful career.
good,Overall a great place to work. Wish there was a larger market here in Buffalo. 
good,"Worked with great people but the nature of the business causes uncertainty. Additionally, frequent management changes tend to make long-term planning difficult."
good,"A very strong company."
good,"A typical day at work would be getting to your store and talking to the department manager or the store manager and telling him/her that you are there to put up displays that came into the store a couple of days prior.  Find a good location in which the store manager will approve and to make sure that you have enough product for the display.  Other times you are there to stock up the shelves and to clean the product that corresponds to your company.  The learning aspect of the job is to correctly how to place the display in a way that it will represent your company as well as the store.  Management in the stores is very good because as long as you communicate with them, they will always have your back.  You really don't have co-workers because you do your work by yourself for most of the times.  I would say for the most part the hardest part of the job is to drop merchandise from the top because most of the merchandise are heavy.  The enjoyable part of the job is basically once you are done you check your work and you get good critiques on your performance."
good,"other employees adjust placement of pallet to make it more difficult to load so they can drag out production times, they feel it gives them a longer time to work, and not be laid off. Supervisors are ""stuck"" in letting them do it out of fear of the ""team"" slacking off even more."
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
good,Scott's was my very first job it was okay in the beginning then I started to realize this some of the people work there acted like it was still in high school overall it was a very fun experience working there
good,Seasonal job. Scheduling inconsistent. Great job if looking for another source of income. Not a job to heavily rely on because of the seasonal hours. Feb-July are when the most hours are given out.
good,"Diagnosis on all machines. Functionality of all equipment was my task."
good,"Scotts is a great place to start your career in sales. The closer you get to the top, though, the more abrasive the leadership style gets."
good,This is a great company to work with. The only problem is that the job is seasonal.
good,Seasonal part time employment. Enjoyable work environment.
good,"Typical day involves multiple stores, more independent work as to managed work with good co workers. Nothing was really that hard to do. the most enjoyable part of the job was I wasn't stuck in the same place all day everyday."
good,"Usually start work about 8 am or earlier if the seasonal demand is high.  very physically demanding job. Lifting heavy materials daily and all day.  Easy to get time off, but it is unpaid for a merchandiser."
good,"A true example of corporate America in Ohio."
good,"AM staff meeting, safety review, forklift inspection, unload and load trailers, production assistant, re-stack pallets."
good,Scotts Miracle Grow was a fun compnay to work for mostly because nobody was hanging over your shoulder telling you what to do. you simply went into a store stocked the shelves asked the store manager what they needed and you went on your way about it.
good,"Scott's Miracle Grow is a very large company, they higher many seasonal employees for a short period of time. The company cares about their employees, has great benefits, but the possibility to obtain a full time position is virtually impossible.  Would of liked for this to become a full time position."
good,it was a very fast paced environment it can teach you the importance of an assembly it is just not a secure company to work for due to seasonal shut downs
good,liked working there just a lot off drama but pay was good and we worked 4 10 hr days in the summer and then 6 to 7 days during winter and spring getting overtime
good,Na . I done not believe it is ethical to review working at any company
good,"Overall Scotts provided a decent environment to excel. Employees were pushed to their limits, but often times management failed to recognize hard work. "
good,if your over 40 they will not advance you. co workers good. I am Merchandiser in lowes and Home depot. they hire management which have no experience. when sales are down the just fire them and get someone new. Most enjoyable part of the job is freedom.
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
good,"Good job but laid off due to lack of work. There was no air conditioning while working in warehouse for long, physical hours."
good,I worked long days sometimes 12 hours long but the pay was good and my co workers were easy to work with. Easy job but sometimes wears on your body after a while
good,"temp/seasonal work"
good,"Good job for beginners. Can be stressful at times, due to high customer traffic. But not stressful due to the flexible hours and job descriptions. I would recommend it to those looking for work."
good,"A good company to get CPG experience. Heavily seasonal so every year seems to be a sprint to spring. Leadership can be great, some leaders not as much."
good,Hawthorne Gardening Co.  offered me opportunities to learn from professional leaders in the industry. I was constantly putting my skills to the test on various projects.
good,"Scotts Miracle-Gro maintained a truly unique environment to work. Everything revolved around the shipping season, or spring. The workplace culture is light yet manages to be still be highly productive. The part I enjoyed most was the colorful characters that worked there."
good,"The lawn service division of Scotts Miracle-Gro no longer exists.  It was, however, a great place to work with great people.  The benefits and pay were great."
good,Unload any trucks or rail cars that are left or come in. Once that is done clean up everything in your area.after that help out in production.
good,"Repairing conveyer belts, hoppers .Had computer run automatic bagging machines very complex. had to to daily pms while running product . Hardest part of job digging out hopper when conveyer belt broke.Good co workers managment ok."
good,"Although working at Scott's is tough and very fast pace, the work keeps you focused and the hours are great. The hardest part about the job is learning a new task but when you're able to grasp it everything becomes easier. Working here taught me to work at a fast pace and to be able to work together as a team."
good,Great college job with fair starting wages. Seasonal. Work at local home improvement stores.
good,Best brands in lawn and garden industry. Industry growth has slowed so need to find new ways to grow.
good,If you want to move up you have to move to Ohio which kind of stinks.
good,"Within two years, increased sales of Scott’s products by 70% including sales of MiracleGro, EcoSense products, and over 55 soils and soil nutrient products"
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
good,it was a fun place to work i liked all coworkers and they made u feel like part of the family i learned alot from working at scotts being a dispatcher
good,Low pay and no benefits. But easy work. Got good hours since big shipments. Hard work sometimes but gets easy after certain point.
good,I worked there for 6 months before being offered a position elsewhere. I enjoyed working there. There was something different going on constantly and the people I worked with were pretty cool. They would take the time to teach you things instead of just talk at you and expect you to do it. I would recommend this place
good,"hard to stay healthy working in all the chemicals and dust...  overall the people are great, and the hours are fair.  just have watched the politics grow out of control but that is happening anywhere you go these days."
good,"• Merchandising and marketing of Scott’s Miracle -Gro brand full line of products at twenty- four different retail stores including Home Depot, Lowe’s and Walmart stores with focus on Customer Service. following plan-o-grams and promotions using varied equipment throughout stores"
good,"just seasonal/budget to last,worked 3 days a week,great pay,no benefits for seasonal employees,great team/management,worked independantly/with management on the side with communication."
good,The company is a great company to work for. The only problem is you only get paid every 2 weeks and when you have a family that just don't work. The pay is good but the raises I feel should be higher than they are.
good,"Great flexibility, just not sure I like where the company is going. The flexibility is less and less every year.  Microscopic Micromanaging is making the daily work culture suffer a little."
good,"Very physically demanding job. You are constantly moving, building and restocking displays. Scotts will teach you about their product and what each is used for."
good,Providing excellent customer service. Counseling customers on different lawn and garden products. It is very important that you feed your lawn at least 4 times a year. Sales Manager allowed you to do your job with little supervision.
good,"Being an outside sale representative is hard work but is flexible and you have the power to write your own checks. Most of the time, it will be door to door sales but in the event of bad weather, you get the experience of inside sales as well."
good,"Pros:"
good,Good company and cool superviser. Lots of over time. Good equipment.
good,Working within a food service provides customer service and handling food properly. The balance of handling large sum of currency and products.
good,"During the busier time of year, i ma responsible for using the loading shovel, and communicating with the supervisor to ensure that the plant continues to run and making sure the raw materials are continually feed into the system, while at the same time solving any issues that arise. The most challenging time is keeping the system filled while taking deliveries of raw materials, which can be anywhere between 1-20 lorries a day. The most enjoyable part of the day is know that I have been at work and had a full day running while being busy with fill the system and having taken raw deliveries."
good,Enjoy being able to utilize and maximize relationships for all sales process.
good,I enjoy working for Scotts  I am looking for a year a round position
good,"Associates are dedicated to the product, because the product, the company are both world class.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the fellow workers.  The training is excellent, I have learned a lot about lawn care."
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
good,Able to balance family and job travel. It is fun to build relationships with associates in the stores we visited. 
good,Each day presents new challenges. Associates are expected to be entrepreneurial and learn multiple areas within the business
good,Receiving incoming calls of up to 100+ per day and responding to emails from consumers wanting information on products offered by the Scotts Miracle-Gro Companies.
good,"Scotts is a fast paced, results oriented culture. They treat their employees well with little turnover at the top. however, this lack of turnover can lead to lack of opportunities."
good,I only worked for one season because if your not their dull time you either have to wait for a spot to open and be qualified or work work their for their bussiest season  witch is September true April of every year.
good,Hardest part about job was hitting quota. It was a great job and mostly everyone was always friendly however the only downside is that they expected a little bit too much sometimes.
good,"Generally consisted of arranging Scotts products in store to ensure they are stocked and ready for sale. Does require some travel, but nothing too far. Managers generally allow you the freedom to maintain the stores as you see fit, and the hours are fairly standard. Good money for the job."
good,"I am currently employed here. The hours are early starting at 6:00AM ending at 4:30PM, and during busy season most associates are required to come in 6 days per week mandatory. The pay is decent and my management team is good. They could improve their training for new employees though."
good,good pay at Scott.. could of been better managed.. really stressful and pushed production. and safety but only in the slow season when production wasn't a big deal
good,Working as a Scott's Merchandiser is a great job for those wanting a physically challenging job and flexible hours. The work can be dirty and in the south it can get HOT.
good,It was a very fast paced place to work. I only worked 3 hours a day for 5 days a week. Some of the people there were nice. You have to be 18 to go into the back of the company.
good,Scotts is a very laid back company to work for. They need more full time positions however. Most outside jobs are seasonal. There is little job ssecurity.
good,i stocked and clean bags of dirt as well as packing out product. I also worked to restock shelves and help customers with any help they needed. It wasn't too bad.
good,"If they could have hired me full time, I would have stayed.  Company is too tight to hire full time.  Benefits are amazing for full timers, list is long waiting for full time employment."
good,This was a great job for my need at the time. The peak season was six months to prepare and sell. I operated my own line and ran forklift.............
good,Fast-paced environment with learning opportunities. Scotts has a great commitment to total health for its employees.
good,I liked running my bagging line because it was challenging getting to know the machine. The whole bagging and stacking process was automatic so everything had to be just right to work. I did not like arguing with my foreman because he did not handle the situation like management.
good,"My Manager was a great guy and the coworkers and I got along fine, the only tough part was getting help with certain projects. other than that Scotts is a great company to work for."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the people That I worked with and the customers I was able to meet and help with their particular situations.
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
good,"I worked 8 hour shifts for 5 days a week . Overall, I thought it was  safe and fun place to work It was fast-paced and structured."
good,"-shifts ranging from 6am-7pm"
good,"Scotts has provided me a vast array of agronomic training. I have developed here as a sales rep . There are many opportunities to shine, and advance in the company. It is a fun place to work and I thoroughly enjoy being part of a winning team."
good,Working at Scotts was rewarding. Co workers were friendly and competent. Many changing priorities but fairly typical these days. Excellent benefits with medical and fitness facilities right on campus. Overall a positive experience.
good,I enjoyed my work and time there.  They payed me well got to travel and meet lots of people
good,Very busy yet fun and productive environment. Also enjoyed the free lunch due to meeting or exceeding quota.
good,Solid company that's been around a while. Good group of people to work with. I thorughly enjoy the autonomy and the opportunity to meet so many good people.
good,A typical day at work would have me coming into a store and walking the isles that had our merchandise to see what needed to be refilled and to see if I needed any pallets to be brought down to refill displays. I then proceeded to outside garden where I pulled pallets of fertilizer and soils that needed to be refilled as well. Once everything was off of the pallets I would spend hours refilling products on shelves and stacking fertilizer on pallets.
good,"I worked there 6 yr,s as under a temp agency the pay could be better.  hard to get on as full time as company employer, but their pay is good. good benefits. coworkers are good to work with. this company will give u all the work u can handle. over the Scott's co. is a good company to work for. Provide shoe vouchers to help u buy steel-toed boots required for the job."
good,Travelled to various big box stores within area. Met and worked alongside management. Learned the retail side of merchandising. Seasonal and lots of online training. Mileage reimbursements past home store assignment.
good,Working for Scott's was a great experience. I honestly would still be there if they offered full time hours year round. It is only a seasonal position for anyone that is not salaried.
good,"Lack of personal protective equipment caused me to become ill several times due to breathing heavy dust particles.  New equipment was not properly designed for product production and this created numerous maintenance issues.  I did enjoy working for my supervisor, who understood the equipment issues."
good,"Morning would start with getting items pulled down. Afterwards, all shelves & bins were restocked & cleaned. After that, we would assist any customers in looking for the appropriate products they needed."
good,Great products and team members.  Only seasonal and no room for advancement. Working hours are flexible and time off is granted if needed.  Limited travel for my stores.  Conditions can be very cold or extremely hot working outdoors.
good,"Working for Scotts Miracle Grow I stock shelves with Miracle Grow products, and also counsel customers if they have any questions about any of the products."
good,"Doubled checked inventory."
good,Scotts Miracle Gro has been a great place to work.  Over the past 5 years I have seen many changes in upper management and regional structure.  Being one of the largest lawn and garden companies means things change fast and often so you have to be willing and able to adapt to the current market conditions.  Scott's has given me the ability to significantly grow my marketing skills and is open to less than traditional ideas that could grow the business.  Overall I am pleased with my career at Scotts.
good,I liked the job youd haft to be there at 7am start working all the people were cool to work with it was assembly lines it was hard work being honest and it wasn't something i liked
good,Great Company with many talented employees.  Must be highly self motivated to have success as a Sales Manager in the field. Expect long hour in season.
good,"Good place to work, very fun during in season and require someone who pays attention to detai. Again one have to be very creative to succed in this company."
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
good,"It's a pretty good job other than that it is seasonal. They work around your schedule. You'll get sent to a retailer such as Lowe's or Home Depot and you'll specifically work on getting Scott's products in prime locations, work on displays, get promotions out. Hardest part of the job: moving pallets of mulch and fertilizer. Most enjoyable part: Seeing your hard work come to life. More often than not you'll work by yourself unless you're doing resets for a store. You'll have one Sales Manager you'll report to."
good,"if you do your job you should be fine. a typical day starts at 7 and finishes when you complete your route. usually a 5 day work week. "
good,"Good working environment healthy work life balance, job culture is welcoming and cordial. Management is helpful and ready to solve issues as needed"
good,"I utilize forklift to restock areas, help others, and relieve for breaks. Learned hard work pays off. Good management. Friendly co-workers. Hardest part of the job was the drive there. Enjoyed learning new equipment."
good,"So a typical day at miracle gro can vary. This job is very hands on and will get you in shape if you are not already. You are lifting bags of soil constantly with the weight varying anywhere from 2lbs to 50 lbs. So if you have a gym membership you can cancel it. While you tend to get dirty lifting soils all day you are expected to stay neat and clean. You will be dealing with the customers as well as Assistant and Store Managers so that is key. Coming into the job i didnt know much about lawn and gardening. Being on the job you really have no choice but to learn about the product and about gardening ,you have customers coming up to you and ask you the same questions everyday. The hardest part of this job is lifting soils and sometimes dealing with the store employees. It is a good job to have because you are never in one spot, your meeting new people all the time, your building relationships at the stores and your staying in shape with the work  that you do. So all in all its a good job to have if your not lazy.....LOL"
good,Merchandise and Sale all of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company products. Interact with customers daily. Enjoy reviewing and introducing new products to customers.
good,Great atmosphere.
good,"Overall, Scotts was a wonderful place to work. I enjoyed the majority of my co-workers and truly liked the work I did. I felt appreciated and needed. Learning of the closing of the Oregon division and the loss of my job was the hardest thing. Scotts was wonderful, however, by offering us bonuses to stay on through the end, and paying us a severance."
good,One of the first things that I liked about this company was the Headquarters. The landscaping was outstanding making it a wonderful place to work. It was a small company that grew very quickly. Many of the associates had worked there for over 20 years. That has to say something about the company.
good,It’s a great starter job if your getting into marketing or for college students it also helps with job experience in sales and merchandising as well as customer service.
good,"Scotts is an interesting company for IT - IT is not is product, so the IT department is housed in the basement, I was in a converted closet, in fact, which was actually a highly sought after location. The building had the chief executives and so an excellent cafeteria. The benefits are fantastic, with a medical facility in the campus as well as a real drug store. We got the computer hardware we asked for, but cheap monitors, and always had the third and fourth generation hand-me-down chairs. The ""worst"" part was the company is out in the country, far outside the Columbus beltway, so it was quite a commute for most people."
good,"Scotts Miracle Gro employees are the best, & it’s a awesome company to work for! They treat their employees like family, & they do so much for the employees. Excellent benefits with on site care."
good,My typical of day of work I most have good day and sometime I have bad day depend on what kind of day it is going. I earned a lot about my job cause we take class on line to learned about what kine of products that we are working with every month of two. I talk to management about how they want they products display on the flood and clean the product off. The hardest of the job is to get some one to drop products racks and products away and stock the shelf. Help customers to buy the right products for our company.
good,This was an excellent job (untill July when it gets hot)  A typicle day you would do a walk through of a store and see what needs to be serviced and restocked.
good,"Job security risks but great place to work with great benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job was the constant workload that came along with it, never bored always something to do."
good,"I really enjoyed the job, enjoyed managing a great group of staff. I also won Rookie of the Year in 2015 and Sales Manager of the Year 2016 which I was given a trip of a lifetime boat cruise, it was amazing."
good,"Scotts is a great place to work, good environment, and room to advance, friendly staff. The benefits package is adequate and the on site health center is a plus."
good,"The job is a good one and management is good to their employees but the hours are not dependable.  I started at 50 hours per week, went down to 40 and then down to 32."
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve.

good,i realy working their job was not hard to do boss was good to me had my on office order parts for the plant work by my self long hours but love the money
good,It was a seasonal position. There is a lot of heavy lifting. Could be at two to three locations in one day. It was difficult to have a full day off being I had three locations to oversee.
good,"After June you are forgotten and on your on, as the company moves through the season you don't. When it's hot you'll be on the hunt for income because if your like me you like to eat all year long."
good,"work is fast paced and must be able to work in hot or cold climates "
good,I started at Scott's right out of college and worked my way up into a management role. Great workplace atmosphere and ability to move up if you put the time in.
good,Each day you meet with your area supervisor and go over what needs to be done. You work as a team and alone to accomplish tasks throughout the day. Light travel throughout the Houston area.
good,"Top Products"

good,I loved working here. I just wasn't too excited about the July layoff. I was waiting on a call back to return to work. But I never received that call.
good,"The company is very stable, benefits are very good, smaller facility so a good family atmosphere. The compensation for the work is at a good level for the area."
good,"The company has caring people who is willing to help with anything. Please to be part of the team. Would highly recommend this job to anyone, you do your it pays off."
good,"Great atmosphere, can be light to heavy activity, big moves of product & detail work too. Great supplement income job. If you smoke, don't bother applying. No benefits given."
good,Loved it if was amazing hours and income was superb the only  exception and draw back was the communication from my direct supervisor. Better repor amongst us as vendors with a direct and upfront supervisor with every one on the same page would of been the ultimate.  With communication a key component to structural integrity and efficiency it made for unforeseen chaos and confusion at times.
good,"Long, seasonal hours during spring/summer months but dedication is paid back with flexibility.  Good safety culture with room for improvement.  Great benefits & an ok job/life balance if you fight for it."
good,"The Scotts Company sold Lawn Care and Garden Products to Lowes and Home Depot. I serviced stories in Washington, PA , Wheeling, WV, & St. Clairsville, Oh ."
good,"good place to work,good people. busy season is very hectic and fast paced. non busy season your trying to find things to do.do some cooking on fridays and go home happy"
good,I work there as a seasonal position. Enjoyed the job very much. Plenty of over time. Can't wait to go back next season.  Seasonal job last from end of September early October till end of June.
good,A fast paced weather driven environment.  Weather is not an excuse to not deliver results.  Must be familiar with internal workings of the company to get things done.
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
good,I enjoyed working for Scotts Miracle Gro. I wish there was full time available. My manager is very fair and trustworthy. It was a temporary job. I was happy with it.
good,"Great opportunity to be a part of an Assemble Line that is constantly running, then getting to know how to operate different machine, and doing different tasks each night."
good,This is a great place to work and gain understanding in shipments and product information. I felt lile i was well taken care of from my other co-workers when i first started working here.
good,"Regional sales manager was a dynamo, very professional and a joy to work with.  Attention to detail, clear in day-to-day issues, procedures and motivation."
good,"Temporary position to tide me over to my next job. The work was hot, but rewarding.  Upper management  have asked me to return as a permanent full time employee."
good,Overall my time at Scotts was great. The management in my base shop was awesome and made the position worth going to each day. I referred several technicians to work at Scotts and most are still working there.
good,Every morning you wake up and drive to one of the 20+ locations in the region that sell their product and merchandise and sell. You are the one with all the knowledge of the product so explain to people just what is good for what.
good,i enjoyed the work and the work environment my co workers were great a lot of the work was repetitive and the worst part was the use of temp services. the position basically required a college degree and yet they hired through a temp service and made you take a month off every year so they could re hire you as a temp and not have to actually hire you on and this went on for almost a decade for some people before they got fed up and quit
good,"Long days, some weekends overall fun place to work nice co workers and proper training, would recommend. Hardest part of job is sometimes working long hours."
good,"A typical day consisted of checking employee hours from the previous day and correcting any errors. Coding invoices, matching with proper paperwork, and entering them into the system. Handling any customer service calls. Filing any paperwork. Created PO's and reconciled P-Card purchases. Printed reports. I learned every aspect of payroll and accounts payable at this job. I began this job with zero knowledge of these tasks and was trained for everything. I even learned the new payroll system alone and went on to train other locations. Management was great to get along with as long as you performed the work required of you and only missed days when absolutely necessary. Coworkers were easy to get along with, however, the open office environment did not allow for much privacy. Therefore, work sometimes was distracting. The hardest part of my job was year end. It wasn't so much as hard, but time consuming and making sure that you had everything entered.The most enjoyable part of my job was the actual work. I loved my job and felt I was very good at it, including handling irate customers. I enjoyed the people I worked with and even having to stay late during busy season."
good,Always encouraged to learn and to be the best you can be. A good environment with welcoming employees and good management ready to help
good,"Work was easy but lots of travel."
good,"Scotts is a company that really cares about their employees.  They provide excellent training, outstanding benefits and an energetic work environment.  The hours can be long but the compensation is worth it."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was building relationships with employees and store manager to set up displays with Scotts product and help the store make sales
good,"I had the privilege of working for The Scotts MiracleGro Company as an Administrative Assistant in the Marysville Manufacturing Facility for nearly 10 years. During that period of time, I met lots of wonderful, interesting, and brilliant people. The compensation and benefits offered by the company were really great, but the experience I gained and the things that I learned working with so many types of personalities and levels of management were priceless. I truly enjoyed my job and looked forward to work each day. I will always be proud to say that I worked for The Scotts MiracleGro Company."

good,"Scott's is one of the best companies to work for if you are willing to work your butt off. This place is no joke when it comes to work. Its mainly for men and you will get down and dirty. Good people to work with, but management is poor."
good,A typical day at work was coming in at 5 am getting on the line and doing the most through out the day.The hardest part about this job was doing a lot of 12 hours shift.
good,"fun job helping customer daily, you will learn something new everyday, would do this job every year, love working with customers on a personal level to fill their needs"

good,"Scotts has a friendly culture. It can be relaxed at times, so to stand out you need to take initiative. Management is accessible all the way up to C-level."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,Got to work with a lot of wonderful people. Great for anyone who likes to travel around store to store.
good,"Call on major home improvement centers writing orders, building displays, stocking shelves, managing a merchandising crew, dealing with distribution center for timely orders.  I learned that I could be super efficient and succeed in a fast paced job environment.  Management was always supportive and my job tasks and functions were never in doubt, and were always performed at a high level.  I received many glowing reviews about my job performance and would receive merit increases according to my effort with this job.  I have to say that working with my co-workers with Scotts Miracle Gro was one of the more rewarding experiences I had with the company.  It was definitely a team first environment as we tended to provide support to one another on a daily basis.  I enjoyed working in this team environment.  The hardest part of the job was keeping all my customers happy and that meant going out of my way day and night to achieve this."

good,"Scotts Miracle Grow was a great place to work to learn new products and to do marketing of those products but work was not stable Low hours in spring heavy hours in April, May and dwindling hours in june and july, unlike Chemlawn."
good,"My main duties would be to restock Scotts products throughout the store. Restock shelves, displays, end caps. Getting with management to secure more floor space typical for items soon to go on sale or high selling SKUs when inventory is much larger than the shelf can hold."
good,"This was a solid place to start a career, but as far as moving up through the ranks, it can be tough to do and require relocation."
good,I love work with anyone as long as we work as a team that all it matter to me.I drive fork lift for long time an I like my job.I'm a Samoan an I work hard everyday.
good,"I knew I would love this job before I even started it. The day when by fast and the co-workers were great. You need to be able to lift while climbing a latter with this job to do it justice. That's the hardest physical part of the job. I worked part-time seasonal and would do it again. The only other ""hard"" part is communication. You drive your own vehicle from store to store and typically you have a weekly schedule. That can change and often at the last minute - and out of your territory. There was a management change the year I worked, however, so I have to assume communication is normally better. Still, all in all, a great company to work for from a Merchandiser level point of view. Crew Management (District?) is totally open to ideas and that was a plus for me. And I loved our weekend hours when we were Counselor at local box stores for customers."
good,This company is a good company with good benefits and wages. When the season is around plan on willing to work long hour between January to May also to July depends on locations.
good,Good job fun hard work but relaxing as well temporary leave makes for a few months of family and personal time. Love the product and the job over all it's always interesting!

good,"You work the hours you want to as long as you increase sales."
good,"Outstanding place to work. Good communication. Positive culture. Flexible with scheduling and getting time off if needed. Pay could be a little better, However, the 401k match is top notch and the medical benefits are good."
good,"I enjoyed working for Scotts-MiracleGro, Interacting with the costumers was rewarding. My manager gave us constructive criticism. He listened to our ideas. We basically were allowed to make decisions on our own. Also, he kept us informed on what was going on with the company."
good,"The Scotts organization has a major emphasis on safety, so much so that safety was the biggest part of the culture among all employees."

good,"I worked for Scotts Miracle Grow for about 5 months. This was one of the best work experiences I have had. You go through a lot of Computer based training which are essentially slide shows with little quizzes at the end.  You are compensated for all your time during training.  Your manager issues you a company phone and tool bag with lots of great items that you will get to keep. Also you get several nice Scott's polo shirts. "
good,"There is no way to do a review of an ordinary day at Scotts, one day isn't like any other day, Monday is not the same as Tuesday and so on and so forth. One day may be the most stressful day of your life and the next could be the most relaxed day you've ever had."
good,The job I do for Scott's Miracle Grow is only as a seasonal merchandiser.  The pay is good for a part time job but there are no benefits with this job and it is only from March until the end o June every year.
good,"Scotts is a great company with strong views to the employees and community and I loved working for them. I learned a lot working for them. The hardest part was going through management change,"
good,Worked here during my MBA....found managemnt to be very helpful and open to new ideas...supported me in the project i was completing.....strong focus on safety.
good,"Great company to work for. We work as teams sometimes (4 people), mostly on the larger accounts in Syracuse. Fantastic manager, good work environment. We work hard but it is one of the few jobs I've had where I also have fun."
good,Great place to work unless you afraid of hard hard and out door work great benefits management is okay need to be very much a self starter and very machine inclined
good,"Working with scotts,was fun and fulfilling.Worked within the home depot stores and a typical day was with the hustle and bustle of customers and associates.Started before 8am,and worked for a days shift.Fulfilling a customers needs was my joy and pride...Went all lenghts to assist customers and associates with product knowledge."
good,Good company to work for. Flexible time and very good management.
good,"Seasonal position that pays you to work out.  Walk miles a day in home improvement warehouse, move hundreds of pounds of product a day."
good,"I worked as a Shipping/ Receiving Clerk (Seasonal/ Temp) but the management treated me very well. They were very welcoming and encouraging. I did not feel like I was ever new or that there were communication and professional barrier. "
good,They are family oriented .  In summer you work 4 days a week.  From October to June you work 10-12 hours a day 6 days a weeks.  Sometimes you will work on Sunday.

good,"I was brought on board in 2000 and was the first of 300 new reps to be promoted to DM. I loved calling on independent and larger national accounts.  I won many national, regional and district awards in 6 years. I could sell anything to anybody."
good,"Very excellent company to work for, flexible hours and the manager is awesome. it is the best job i ever had. granted there was not benefits for that i found for being part time but i could almost get full time when the hours were available."
good,Fast paced exciting career. Position can be very labor intensive at times but definitely rewarding. Freedom  to operate and flexibility are standards in this culture.
good,"A typic day at Scotts Miracle Gro consisted of running any machinery necessary to continue production for the company. I clocked in around 6:51am every morning which allowed some free time to get an idea of what was accomplished by the previous shift. After being briefed on what our shift needed to do, we then got to work. My job  was typically transferring raw materials by forklift into the workspace of our operations for that day. Once we had our materials, we could then start operation. At that point I would report to the necessary machine for the day to produce Miracle Gro. I would definitely say this is a solid company with a solid work environment that treats their employees well."
good,"gret place to work, people are friendly and outgoing, lots of interaction with coworkers. hardest part of the day would be to troubleshoot machinery and equipment. good family oriented company."
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
good,There are multiple experiences you take away from this job. Working from Lowes to Home Depot getting to know the employees as well as how the store works. It might seem like there is a work load and your always moving but the job is worth it and there is never a moment where you are unsure what to do next. The management is great and as long as you aren't afraid to speak up and enjoy a little taste of a manager position this job would be great!
good,fun place to work- able to work at own pace- plenty of opportunity to accomplish job tasks and interact with customers and store employees-
good,"Great place to work, opportunities to grow within the company, everyone usually seems to be in a good mood, great work environment"
good,"If you work hard and hold integrity you will succeed. "
good,"I was fortunate to work for some great people.  The business in Ipswich changed so much as it passed from being the well known and established Fisons Ltd, through the management buy out period to become part the wolds largest Horticulture business Scotts Miracle-Gro Company.  In all that time my co-workers were always of the highest quality, it has been a pleasure."
good,"I would go into work set up at my cubicle and put my headset on and welcome the calls. I enjoyed talking with new people everyday, I also liked that each persons situation was different, it kept me on my toes and always thinking."
good,"I had a great manager when I worked with this company. He was understanding and fair and told you up front what he expected from you and didn't overload you with a bunch of meaningless chatter. He was the manager, I was the employee. Sounds simple, but I like that kind of distinction in a job."
good,"Challenging and rewarding, a very fast paced environment. Working at Scotts requires you to work in a collaborative environment."
good,My typical day starts at 8am when i go into the office and check the printer to see if any more despatch notes have been printed off from me leaving work the previous day.

good,"Scotts is a great place to work with excellent benefits and good pay. Pretty much laid back, but there are times things get hectic. Best 401k I’ve ever had, cannot be beat. I guess the only bad thing I can say is that we didn’t have sick days and had to use vacation time, but other than that I highly enjoyed my time there."
good,"Can be physical at times, indoor and outdoor work but good pay and good place to work for early spring to early summer work in big box retailers. Good"
good,"Scott's was a fast pase, and a competitive workplace. Sometimes it was fun. Employees treated each other like family. If your shift did better then the others the company treated you with a free launch."
good,Although Scotts has been bought out by Tru Green it is still a awesome place to work and to also learn about not only Lawn Care but also how to treat for bugs in the house.
good,"Great company to work for, just not enough hours in the summer our main season is in the spring. The management was great to work for they let you set your own schedule."
good,Limited opportunity for advancement at Temecula plant.  Must be willing to relocate if seeking supervisory or management positions. Great benefits and pay rate which are more than other companies in the area.
good,Great company.  World class in every way.  Senior leadership is extremely driven to satisfy customers expectations.
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
good,"You check in on different stores that have Scott products, sometimes needing to go to a different city to do so.  You check around, and see what looks empty or needs to be restocked.  Then go check to see what the store has in stock.  After that, its about restocking shelves, making sure prices are right, and the displays look good and accurate.  It's not a hard job, but it will make you tired.  No one really is there to tell you what to do, so you usually are alone.  Hardest part is just getting something from top stock, because you are at the mercy of the store when it comes to that, but that is like a break in the shift.  Overall, it is a good job, and one I was happy to do."
good,"- Starts early mornings and finishes once the job is done"
good,"Scotts Miracle Gro is a strong, growing company with excellent benefits and room for growth. Training is great, and employees are compensated for personal vehicle use."
good,I enjoyed my merchandising job with Scotts. Would work with again next season.
good,Great company to work for hours are geat . The work is not hard just some long days etc.
good,"The company benefits are the highlight here. Excellent benefits all around with medical/dental, vacation upfront, family leave and a generous 401K match. The company seemed more interested in their employees rather than them being a number."
good,"Great company to work for long term. Fair and competitive wages, benefits and 401k match. Opportunity for advancement for those in search of growing within company. Also has great opportunity for tuition reimbursement if seeking continued education."
good,I was unfamiliar with Workday walking into the role. I began very efficient with the system by the first week thanks to the support of my team. All team members were willing and able to answer all questions I had.
good,"Employed as a merchandiser, worked with a team of 5 people plus a supervisor. We covered Lowes and Home Depot in an a county in NJ, traveling sometimes to two stores in a day. Mileage was paid along with travel time in between stores. Good environment to work in, each day was different."
good,I enjoyed my time with Scott's it's hard but yet fun a great place to work. You get to go to more then one store and your pretty much your own boss and hours are flexible.
good,"I worked for Scotts for 4 1/2 years including being a temp for 5 months.  I enjoyed working in the office.  During busy season, which is about 4-5 months out of the year, it is busy and we work many hours.  I loved that we were busy.  Every day is challenging.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and management was always willing to listen to new ideas.  "
good,"Rewarding working for a company that dominates the garden/yard market. Very strong training and management support. The majority of their business is in the spring/ early summer calendar. Work is scheduled early mornings to early afternoon, because of traffic in the stores. Inter reactions with customers is constant, so knowledge of 140 different products and math to answer questions about howmuch product is required for a particular job."
good,I really like my position with Scotts I would really like to work year round
good,A great job for the right person dedicated to the lawn care field
good,The Job is very flexable. Each store you have a set of jobs to complete. Every day was a new day working with customers and store management.
good,"Business was very seasonal and during peak times one was expected to put in long days, but during off season we had time to prepare for the upcoming season. The most difficult part of my position as office manager was discipline of an individual who was very strong willed. Managers would come to be to talk with this individual as they did not like to approach her either. Most enjoyable part of my job was moving up within the company and learning different aspect. Continuous education was encouraged and the company reimbursed 100% if we maintained a 3.0 or better. Finally as Office Manager it was nice to travel to other parts of the United States every January to meet with Regional Office Managers and other Office Managers for training and collaboration efforts."
good,"I normally arrive around 7am and log in at store locations that require that I do so. I check all of our product displays and make sure they are well stocked, neat in apperance and clean. I have learned quite a bit about how a merchandiser position works. You may have to go to several locations in one day. My manager and co-workers have been very helpfull to me and have been great to work with. I would say the hardest part of this job is at the end of the day I'm pretty worn out but I enjoy a job where I keep moving. No sit down all day jobs for me. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to customers and helping them find what they need. I try to get them to tell me exactly what there needs are so that I can help them find the products that are best for them. I have no problem talking to the public and I have been told by some of my customers that they enjoyed talking with me."
good,"Working for Scott’s was such an awesome experience. Very laid back management and they wouldn’t pester you like some jobs. If I could’ve work full time I would’ve. Typical day is you showing up to your assigned store with a task list and squaring away the Scott’s section of said store, making sure that the sections look clean and presentable to customers."
good,If you like to work in outside elements it is a fun and active place to work.  Good people in office and working in the warehouse and field. Would recommend.
good,"The Scotts Miracle Gro co is a great place to work but I am looking for  better career prospects, professional growth and work opportunities.  "
good,This is one of the greatest companies to work for. They never stop teaching you about the product that they sell. They do everything that they can do to help you succeed
good,"We start the day with a 5 min tail gate/ huddle motivational meeting going over Safety, Quality and Production goals for the day.  We then fire up 4 production lines that each is tasked to produce 6K+ units per shift.  A multitude of other job tasks must be done such as production scheduling, inventory control/ procurement, quality control, safety/ environmental concerns to name a few."
good,Working here as been great for my family and I. lots of work if you like to work and it's a fast move pace...So if are the kind of person that likes to move slow then this job is not for you.....
good,"typical day at work would be meeting up with one or more other employees at a store going through the store to have product forklifted down. Filling shelves and restocking any product, working pallets of product creating laydowns and pricing product. as well as assisting customers with the best product for their own homes. than going to lunch, and moving on to another store to work the product and repeat the process. I have learned how to properly and safely handle freight, restock shelves, price tag products in various stores using their systems, customer service skills. my management was helpful and would hold weekly meetings, and would also meet up in store and help work the freight and set laydowns to ensure it was done correctly. Working with Scott's and the various stores was a great experience with building relationships with management and associates. hardest part of the job was moving soils without another employee. the most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom of going from store to store building our own schedule and having the responsibilities of taking care of tasks."
good,"Good company.  Well organized.  Safety conscious."
good,"Full charge remote location reporting to upper management in Corporate headquarters in Marysville, Ohio. Spring season was always the primary challenge providing excellent customers service to Lowes, Home Depot, Walmart, and many others.  Required a tremendous culture of safety first, quality and then operational efficiency to meet day to day challenges. Out of 36 Growing media plants Nationally, our plant was awarded Plant of the Year twice, 2004 and 2008."
good,"Short hours, hard work, great people. Being a seasonal job, there were few hours to go around and being new you're the first to go, but that's how most places work. Really enjoyed my time working there and it provided myself with priceless knowledge."
good,I was a seasonal employee but I greatly enjoyed the position and the atmosphere. Management worked well at providing a positive work environment and to help out in any way possible. Training was adequate to feel prepared for the job.
good,"Made production schedule for both shifts, charge of plant inventory, worked with SAP."

good,"An environment where you get flexible hours, and also a lot of them as well. You manage your own time, and there is great fun and respect for all employees. No boss breathing down your back, communication is valued and you meet a lot of laid back employees in your own company as a vendor, or in the host store. You have things to get done during your scheduled day, but you can come in anytime, doing it in the order you want by yourself or with a coworker, as long as everything is done, than just submit hours after the day.

good,"I really enjoyed my job with Scotts. I love the opportunity to become a subject matter expert concerning gardening and lawn care, with the Scotts products.I enjoyed meeting people who have the same interests as me. I love gardening and lawn care and was so pleased to share my knowledge with customers while recommending specific products for their needs. In many cases, I gained valuable information  from the customer concerning their personal experience and was able to use that knowledge to help others as well as myself. My only complaint would be the red shirt that I was required to wear. I worked in Lowes and was mistaken for a Lowes employee far too many times. I was required to spend too much of my time explaining to the customer that I was a merchandiser for Scotts and then spend too much time helping them find a Lowe's employee to help them with their plumbing needs. After a few weeks, I could direct the customer to plumbing, lighting, kitchen and bath departments, but still couldn's answer specific questions concerning those departments."
good,it was a great place to work and i enjoyed going to work every morning. i really enjoyed my freedom and worked alone and at a very fast pace. i wish the franchise wasnt bought out

My co-workers became family, I gave respect and earned respect with them. I miss them very much, The hardest part of the day, would sometimes be at the end of the day when there were still drivers who had not shown up for their respective loads. There were phone calls to make and sometimes loads to be rescheduled for what ever reason. My most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers and the strong team we had become, we would all pull together and work on problem situations as they might arise, We always found solutions to any situation whether it was a negative situation or a positive situation."
