good,"Good place but went Bankrupt."
good,Was a fun place to work. Will miss the novelty of business. Great place to interact with customers. Have watched many children grow up as a Toys R Us kid!
good,"Before the downfall of Toys r us, It was a great place to work. I loved my job and always 100++++%. A typical day of work would be answering and follow up with overseas emails, going through approval submits and pre pro samples and advise vendors., consulting in fit sessions, checking production."
good,"I worked at toys r us for 17 years ,as the times got tough so did the hours most people had to perform 2 peoples jobs daily and was very tiring.the people where great"
good,"A typical day at work is getting stuff done but still having time to relax and not run around the store helping customers, I've learned to always do my best to satisfy customers even if it means going out your way. The hardest part of the job would be keeping your calm while customers can get pretty upset and become verbally abusive."
good,"Toys R Us has a great management team, all of whom are trying their best to help you learn & grow; all the way from Executive Directors to your supervisor. as an IE, i worked on various projects, allowing me to learn many different tasks. The culture at the DC level changed for the better since 2017; they are more accepting of support/engineering and work together to achieve greatness."
good,I did enjoy my time spent at Toys R us. I would go back to the job if given the chance. The people around you were friendly and the job was pretty easy for the most part. The most difficult thing was probably difficult customers or orders but it was all worth it.
good,Over time wasnt really an option. A few managers were a problem very difficult to work with. Comfortable work shoes are needed.the environment is so much fun who doesn’t like working in a toy store!
good,"I Learned how to stock the merchandise, scan in orders , work the cash register. But it was kind of difficult but as I were their I had people to guide me threw everything I need to know."
good,Cool place to work if you are a teenager or college student in need of part-time work. They are extremely flexible with your schedule and will definitely work around school schedule.
good,"Typical day working here depends on the day of the week and the season of time ( during the week very slow calm work , during the weekend very busy ) during seasonal time ( Christmas) very very busy"
good,"I enjoy working at TRU. They’re a lovely caring company. They not only care about the customers, they care and look out for their employees. Easily one of the best jobs and set of management I have ever had."
good,Nice place great co workers flexible hours seasonal is a busy time but enjoy the extra work . Big fan of toys so is a great fit. Customers are usually wonderful n patient during busy times . Store runs smoothly
good,I loved working here at this company they makw you feel like part of the toys r us fam. I would go back if i could to get a full time at this place only cauae i love toys but mainly cauas its a wonderful place to work.
good,Cleaning the store was a hassle. You were unable to leave until every section was clean. Being that it was a toy store things would be everywhere. It was great.
good,My job experience at Toys R Us Great it was very laid back. I loved the environment and the coworkers. Everyone had a great attitude and i love the customers. Even though the job paid little it was still a good job.
good,"WOrking at toysurs was not bad. Managers were not the ebs. But, the sales associates I worked with made the job fun. I would not try being a manager, though."
good,i enjoyed my job everyday. you keep to great smiling faces everyday of soon to be parents or parents already. Its fun to shower the parents around help them find what they need in the store. i learned every department that way if any other departments needed help I could help.
good,"Great place to work - but every company has room for improvement:"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of you coming in and getting straight to work. Around the Christmas holiday work was very hectic, from customers messing up aisles as you clean them to running around the store looking for items, I enjoyed working during the holiday season because I never got bored and I was always up on my feet. The hardest part of the job is you work long hours and your breaks are not very long. Although, the most enjoyable part of the job is having direct contact with customers and helping them make the best shopping decisions."
good,Other than empty promises by upper management regarding job advances and the change in management I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company. I am an adult child so I felt very at home surrounded by toys and electronics.
good,Very simple and minimal tasks to perform during the day. I was responsible for cash handling and placing new releases out on the shelves. It was a stress free environment.
good,"Good place for a seasonal job,  I really likes the people I was working along side of. the drive was a little father than I liked but it was worth the fun face paced environment."
good,"Typical first job in high school. Great place to work, fun and great people. There is a chance to move up pin the company and they always award their staff."
good,"Have a meeting at the beginning of the shift that tells you what your doing today and what needs to get done."
good,"In my 8.5 years at the ToysRUs office, I was able to collaborate daily with both peers within the Operations department and other cross-functional groups. This gave me insight to several areas of the business.  I furthered my knowledge of communication, presenting and project management.  Over the last few years, the culture seemed to be changing for the positive with an emphasis on work/life balance, work environment, and overall morale.  As is the case with several retail organizations, the current state of e-commerce made success for brick & mortar increasingly difficult.  In my position, this was not easy to directly affect but I looked for things that could help our stores focus more on the customer versus store processes.  The people I worked with made every day a positive work experience.  Coworkers with a balance of diligence and humanity were easily the best part of my time at ToysRUs."
good,I leaned how  to ship and receive the proper way. This was to customers homes and to different stores.ialso learned how to stock properly and input quarterly numbers.
good,"A diverse workforce that taught me much about communication, tolerance, and work ethics. Was very sorry to leave. My immediate security supervisor and regional security director were top notch at teaching by example. It was my privilege to work for them."
good,El buen trabajo en equipo y buen ambiente laboral.
good,"I Love Working hard unloading trucks with 35-50,000 pieces , Toys R Us provides great products for children and those alike. Working there was indeed fun: only because of the workers around me. Work was otherwise rather tough and seemingly one sided because those who are available at night usually close, which is much harder than working in the day. Compensation does not vary on that, however that is the way the cookie crumbles. The management did a good job with filling me into my position and teaching me the things I had to know. However other than that, it wasn't the most enjoyable experience."
good,Approachable management who were clear and decisive in their instructions. Also allowed for run during restocking and when packing up and setting up the store.
good,"Nice place to work, lots of friendly customers and fun place to be! Great benefits and always exciting to come to work and be yourself, Management was good."
good,All around great place to work.Employees always helpful when other employees ask each other questions. I merchandised the action figure aisles and was always trusted to alter planograms when I needed to..
good,"Days for me varied greatly; whether on register, at the customer service desk, pulling shelves and re-shop to assisting with packaging and shipping, this place was never dull, ever-changing with a decent management. Hours were a bit lax, but awesome when i got them :-D"
good,This job was perfect because it was seasonal and I needed extra cash for the holidays. they worked around my schedule and I met some pretty great people while working there
good,"Whether or not you'd enjoy working at Toy's R Us depends on how much you enjoy sorting, lifting, and stocking. For me, This routine work each day was relaxing."
good,"I enjoy working with every employee and manager, but I would like more advancement. Also, I feel the level of knowledge I have and the amount of work I preform does not match the raises received."
good,"I sweep and mop entire floors followed by buffering floors emptying bins and then cleaning, toilets I also pick up toys or any rubbish which may ccause a hazard to customers."
good,work hard   how every customer what something the supervisor was not polite all the time   co workers are very friendly and helpfull   to keep the place clean and safe     helping the customer find what they are looking for
good,"Fun place to work, good people to work with. Good management. overall just a good place. Keeps you busy, Unload trucks sort the product and stock shelves not too hard. Co workers make it fun but joking and playing."
good,This job place was fun and motivating. There was tons of team activities to motivate the employees. My co workers were my favorite. They were fun and very willing to work as a team. The Management was very understanding and helpful
good,I loved working at Toys R US. I worked through Christmas and it was so fun to help people find the right gifts for their children and Black Friday was a blast.
good,I learned how to operate a cashier and learned how to interact with the customers and provide a pleasurable shopping experience.
good,"As a seasonal member for Toys R Us I had quite a few different positions. Mainly I worked register, however if a customer needed assistance finding a specific item or had any questions about and item I helped with that as well. Another facet of my job was making sure it was clean so every once in a while my managers would ask anyone not busy to do light cleaning, such as wiping up the crane machine and bubble gum machines in the vestibule and also wiping up the register counters and making sure they were spotless as well. I learned that all customers are important; young and old, as well as big and small. My managers were all excellent and I have absolutely no room to complain, they all were very accommodating to my and my coworkers needs. My coworkers were all very easy to get along with and usually we saw eye to eye often on many things, and if someone didn't know the answer to a question a customer had, you could always count on another coworker to know the answer. The hardest part of the job was knowing it was only a seasonal position, because I loved working at that job and liked the people there as well. The best part of my job was when a child would come to my line excited about getting a new toy, they'd always be smiling and usually they'd interact with me about what they got, how excited they were and what they were going to do with the toy."
good,"Co-workers were wonderful, on a professional and personal level.  Higher management is/was very encouraging and supportive."
good,"Being a team member I was able to fill various positions (cashier, stocker, truck unload, special order fulfillment, pricing and signage). It was a great environment mostly due to the families I was able to help on a daily basis, especially the first-time expecting parents. There's a realization that sets in when you see the joy in a new mother or father's face when you help them to pick out the right car seat, stroller, crib, furniture, etc. It was very fulfilling for me. "
good,"Management is a bit better than Wal-Mart"
good,"i actually enjoyed going to work everyday, my co-workers were very nice. i learned to be a lot more social and all the cartoon characters which came in handy because i have a baby. there was not a hard part working here but the thing i enjoyed most was putting smiles on children's faces when they got the toy they wanted."
good,A typical day consisted of working with great employees and having a fun work atmosphere. Working with every customer that crossed my path doing beyond what I was hired to do.
good,I enjoy every hour I work for the company. It has been a wonderful learning experience about the retail industry. I have great confidence in the skills that I have gained while working with my management team.
good,"As the name suggests indeed we are the worlds largest Toys store."
good,I absolutely loved working here at toys r us. I love the kids that came in and how excited they would get over the toys. and the new born babies were so adorable. Would definitely like to work here again.
good,A typical day is unloading a Truck and re-stocking shelf's. Their was nothing hard about this Job for myself. The management are very nice people as well as the co-workers I had. I very much enjoyed this job than others I had.
good,Working at TRU for a seasonal position has been great! I love ALL the people I work with and enjoy working with the public.
good,"Responsible for assisting customers with personal inquiries"
good,I enjoyed working at this position because of management. They made it very easy to work for them. Very patient with me while I learned Customer service for the first time and i also received my first and only experience with a register.
good,"A typical day at work included we show up get our duties for the night then go get them done.  The big thing that I learned was how to unload trucks and how to use/read the back bays.  Management was decent I was not there long enough to form a actual opinion of it.  With it being seasonal there were the workers and the ""I am just here to get paid"" people (standing around talking not working the leaving as soon as their shift was over with work undone) I stayed and helped finish that undone work.  The hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks because we had to do it by hand box after box.  The most enjoyable part was probably the unloading of trucks because it kept me busy and the time flew by and we got good enough to knock out a truck by our deadline and was able to scan them into the bays."
good,"I really enjoyed working at toys r us as i was constantly busy, my typical day at work included stocking shelf's that were empty and directing customers to certain aisle's if they couldn't find what they were looking for, i also helped with the delivery's which included a lot of heavy lifting but i enjoyed it. Hardest part was the delivery as it was very hard lifting all the cots and stuff from the lorry to the stock room."
good,This was one of the best places I have ever worked. The upper management made a point of having lunch with warehouse workers at times and always ask for your opinions. They always made it clear that when goals were made it was due to the workers. I would still be there if the distance from my home hadn't become such a hassle.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is working and assisting the customer with helped and the outing the job had for the employees
good,"Love working there. The manager that I had when I first started, was very understanding. I like working in the baby Apparel. I got alone ver good with my co workers."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Toys ""R"" Us and would do it again. The only problems I had were the lack of pay and sometimes the hours. It was a great customer service experience from start to finish."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of early mornings stocking shelves of boxes. I would scan out items to put out on shelves for customers to buy, and scan in items that could not be put out (for space sakes), in z-bays. I would also assist customers with typical shopping needs such as, finding items, and giving information about unfamiliar products that they were interested in."
good,I enjoyed my time even though it was seasonal. My managers were fun to work with as were my co-workers. unfortunately i was not picked for full time employment but it was fun while it lasted
good,"A typical day at work would consist of greeting customers as they entered, organizing shelves, informing customers about products, and providing friendly, helpful customer service. I learned to treat each customer individually to ensure that they were being treated with above and beyond levels of respect. Co-workers and managers were like family, lending out a helping hand with any situation that required help. Though I must say the hardest part of the job was keeping up with customer service but also the most enjoyable and rewarding part once fulfilled with 110% satisfaction."
good,"greeting guest, help showing them items they may be looking for or answering any questions.Calling new registrants to congratulate and inform on any promotions they may not know about. Answering incoming phone calls to help guests with any questions they may have."
good,"Couldn't have asked for a better team to work with. Managment is VERY accomodating with flexibility with your work schedules, team Supervisors are awesome, very dependable, reliable, never make you wait if you have a question or a problem. Everyone helps everyone!"
good,challenging at Christmas time to keep things full and available
good,"A great place to work, setting up and replenishment of stock, dealing with customers. gaining knowledge of all the latest toys on the market."
good,My work day at Toys R Us was making sure everything was put back in place and making sure my area was nice and clean. I learned to maintain a positive attitude no matter the situation. Management was great and so was the employees. There was no hard part working with this company and the most enjoyable part was seeing all the new toys that was in the store.
good,Toys r us was a great job. I would have loved to keep it however it was in brooklyn and i lived in the bronx. If it was during the day the traveling wouldnt have been a hassle however overnight made it inconvenient.
good,wonderful people and place to work. Toys all around you while you work and some times you can play with them
good,"I like the job it was seasonal but i would do it again, i loved being around kids and helping customers find what ever they need ."
good,i worked in the back unloading trucks and putting out stock on the floor and the back of house. i had to make sure every thing was scanned in and counted for.
good,"Working for Toys 'R' Us was a new and exciting career for me as i was hired to be a fork lift driver.  this job opened me up to something new in warehouse work.  An average day would involve me moving and stacking pallets and loading and unloading pallets of lorry's."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Toys R Us. Good working relationships were maintained, Team work was effective and my time management was good."
good,"I loved working seasonally for Toys R Us! The team was kind of a motley crew of people, but it made for good conversation and fun. You're required to work fast paced, but it really is a breeze if you're comfortable in your surroundings and team members. If you're over night workers, they will let you listen to music as long as you work efficiently. I'm just sad that I had to leave!"
good,"I start my day at toys r us by picking baby food for multiple store order soon the picking is done i jump oever to break it down to different pallets by items thats ordered by the stores. And when thats done i jump over to shipping loading the trucks with the items that my co-worker and i picked and broke down. I learnd to pay good attention to the order slips and item number because the item can look the same but has different flavor inside or different color items inside. Managment is there but its a dependent job working with very little supervision. Ive worked for toys r us for 3 years  everyone is  friendly and everyone there respect me as i do back to them. Theres nothing hard about the job after 3 years of it everything pretty much became acustome to me. the thing i enjoy the most about the job is the co-worker i had there, everyone is nice and friendly to me."
good,Fun place to work. Learned to deal with customer service and making sure every customer is happy.
good,"Enjoyed working at toysrus, would do it again."
good,"Unload trucks and stock shelves, management was great, they never asked you to do anything they weren't willing to do first and more often then not would help you with it if you needed it. Co-workers were good, they would generally try to get as much done as soon as possible, hardest part was working the overnight shift."
good,Enjoyed working with staff.
good,"At Toys R Us i learned excellent customers service skills, which is something the ""R Us"" company prides themselves on being the best at. Working at the service desk i learned how to deal with guest and resolving several guest problem to insure that they left the building knowing i did everything i could to help them. With co-workers and management we worked efficiently and rapid to get everything done in a timely manor so we would have time to spend with every guest. The hardest part of my job there was making sure i spent the appropriate amount of time with each guest and their problem while moving the line along so other guest wouldn't be waiting to long. My most enjoyable part of the job was building relationships with co-workers and regular guest."
good,"It's a very good company , employee's are fun to be with, we have a time management , self discipline , I developed my Customer Service ability in this company , I acquired skills from them , to become flexible in any terms , to work under pressure without hesitation."
good,"During the holiday seasons it was busy customer wise. I was busy accepting and reviewing applications, interviewing, I also worked the office one day a week amangst other duties."
good,I enjoyed people and the diversity of it all. I felt appreciated and allowed to take initiative to get things accomplished.
good,typical day at work was helping customers find the product of choice. I learned how to interact more with the customers. Management was the best always helpfull and trying to improve productivity. My coworkers had good work ethic. The hardest part of the job was setting up the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was everything else.
good,I worked there for the Christmas season and the best part is it was fun.. The co workers were great and I got to play with toys :o)
good,"Very busy environment followed by slow times. The customer is first priority, then all cleaning/ zoning is done. Cashiers are called to straighten(zone) the various departments, with the expectation they will come back to the front immediately as needed"
good,"Working here was the BEST!! I loved this job inside and out... but when we brought in a new store manager , he was very disrespectful to former employes... he hired in all new heads to try and push the older ones out. But instead he hurt himself in the long run because he was only there 5mths and got fired for stealing!!"
good,It's a fun company to work for its not stressful but fast paced just have to know the last cartoons and figurings kids are into then you'll enjoy your job.
good,"Loved my job, the kids and making sure they all had an amazing time shopping at our toy stores. management never gave up, we tried all we could to save the stores but in the end we had to close and the awesome job and memories went with the office when we closed the doors in Wayne corporate office. really miss this position was by far the best and most fun i have had in my career!"
good,it was a great work experience loved to work there great superiors and great co workers very understanding with personal issues and will work with you if needed and always flexible with hours
good,"I learned how to navigate the store, customer service and a lot of patience. It was a clean work place with great managers. I also learned how to relate to customers needs."
good,Loved working for Toys r us! I had an amazing time and it was an awesome first job for me! I wish they were still open and running! Awesome company for anyone
good,"OUT OF BUSINESS"
good,I would if TRU treated there  Associates better. And also have a better life balance. Would love it there was they do every other weekend for management..
good,"Was a great experience working here though I would say it's hard to move up because of how few stores and employees are left. The full time people don't want to leave very often so higher level positions are hard to come by. They will push you to sell credit cards and ""insurance"" but other than that, no complaints."
good,I’d love to work for Toys “R” Us it’s a great experience especially if you love kids I love the fact that I got to experience working at Toys “R” Us for the Christmas season although it was very busy but I loved the fact that I could help out a lot more kids than adults during that season
good,"I Loved working there, the staff, the customers the environment. I even enjoyed seasonal. The only reason I left is because we had a baby and pcsd with the Army.."
good,"I was brought into Toys'r'us for a seasonal job offer, so I only worked for about 1.5 months, I have no complaints about the work due to my short time there."
good,"Every company has it's ups and downs. Toys R Us especially did. Sometimes it sucked, long hours, rude customers, and sometimes poor management. But overall it was a wonderful experience. Some managers were great whilst others weren't. Sometimes it was hard work, a lot of lifting, a lot of running around. But depending on who you were working with it could be a whole lot of fun."
good,This company was fun to work for. We worked over nights so there was no one there except the employees. We made the best of every night. We laughed and had fun but we still worked and got the job done. There wasn’t really anything that I disliked about the job except that the company shut down and we couldn’t keep our jobs.
good,Glad I was able to work there for the holidays. It was crazy busy but definitely a lot of fun. I got to learn about all of the new toys coming out for the holidays so I was better prepared that holiday season than any other.
good,"I loved working here, the hours were consistent and and pay was good, great people to be around and the managers were very understanding. recommend working here for sure"
good,It was a great place to work at never had any peoblems the people there was great to work with a nice staff in the pay was good i just love working thanks
good,It was pretty easy. I enjoyed my time there although it wsd only temporary. I wish i cud have stayed longer. The management was very motivating and the hours received were plentiful.
good,"As with many retail operations, a manger touches everything in the store from the logistics to resolving supplier product returns. With 4 supervisors as a support team I managed Hiring, accountability, terminations, legal compliance to CA employment law and ensuring the store was ready for business 7 days a week. I presented the stores metrics every two weeks, which included all P&L attributes from the electric costs to the final tallies for each day, presenting profit and costs."
good,"Toys r us was a fun place to work. Everyday was a new experience meeting people of all ages and from all over the world. The real pleasure of it all was when you have people that you’ve meant come back every year and remember you, but come with the same excitement as if it was their first time experiencing the store. Seeing all the smiles and hearing their laughter knowing that you were a part of  bringing out the inner kid in them was a good feeling. Seeing their eyes light up when they walk in and saw  how high the Ferris wheel was or watch them be amazed at the roaring moving dinosaur that the store had. Experiencing and playing with hands on touching with the toys that were on display. Going to work at tru everyday was nice because not many people can say that they got to relive the happy times of their childhood everyday at a job, and got paid to play."
good,"A day at work always had tasks, whether it was filling shelves on the floor, facing, locating products in the back room, and helping up at cash. I was hired to be a cashier and ended up leaving with experience in many departments of the store. I loved being able to gain new skills and have the support and help of coworkers around me."
good,"Extremely flexible hours, learned about new merchandise through demos, management we’re nice, hardest part is when there are events for the kids but pretty easy. Typically it’s not busy only through holiday season"
good,It was fun working at toys r us because of the environment. Everyone was sweet and open to answer any questions. Easy flow working schedule and mangers were really nice.
good,"Ein sehr schöner Arbeitsplatz gewesen, die strahlenden Kinderaugen jeden Tag einfach schön. Natürlich lieg nicht immer alles rund aber jeder Zeit wieder in den Betrieb zurück."
good,"Positive reviews from customers , gladly meeting new people everyday. Management was a little fuzzy. So is every business that is about to be shutdown."
good,the workers always had a smile on their face and always willing to help you get something or find something. Never complained about anything always easy going
good,"This is one of the best jobs ive had, i loved working for the company. i made a lot of friends and i had regular customers always come in an ask for me specifically. the hardest part about my job was when we announced that we were closing all my regular customers were very upset. i learned so much from this company from learning to deal with difficult customers to setting the schedule for the employees."
good,"My main goal at work each day was to bring smiles to the faces of my customers young and old. The work varied from assisting guests with purchases, merchandising, processing inventory, setting up baby registries and running events. Overall the company was poorly managed. At the store level, our managers were excellent. What I loved most about this job was my team. Even when we had a guest that was unhappy and even unreasonable, it was still a place i liked working because of my co-workers."
good,Creativity was encouraged and appreciated. You were encouraged to play and learn more about the products. During season it could get hetic but there were always snacks and encouragement from other employees. Great place to work.
good,"Had a great staff that I was working along side of. A good balance of fun and hard work. The managers were very strict about hoe you should sell things to the customers and it sometimes felt as though your numbers were more important than you were, but it mostly just depended on who you were working with. Overall, a great experience."
good,"The job was never too stressful and the managers were always there to answer your questions and help. The holiday season was surprisingly easy too, there were always enough people to help."
good,"I didnt mind this job for what it was; a quick convenient job to earn in the neighborhood. Not a bad salary for the job and more shifts, but I think the store is now cloSed."
good,"I loved working there. We were a family, not just coworkers. Even though we were extremely underpaid and undervalued by the company, we loved our jobs."
good,"It was a seasonal job, but it was a fun job. Fast pace but a lot of freedom. It was a very cheerful and friendly place to work."
good,"Everyone who I worked with (minus a couple of people) were nice and funny and made working there an ease even if I worked 10 hours a day, I felt comfortable with working there. Currently, it is closed but if you can find a Toys 'R' Us near you and it's your first job, I would highly recommend. If it were still open now I would absolutely go back."
good,"I loved my job here at Toys R Us unfortunately they are closed down now and my job was seasonal. I would have loved to continue working here! Great employees, always had fun at work of course being around happy faces!"
good,"cashier, head cashier, count draws , stock inventory , service desk, the job was fun to work for. the mangers and coworkers were friendly. got to pay with toys and show customers what we had . I moved before the store closed and im so sad it gone now"
good,I hate it when it was time to leave but it was time to go is toys r us was still here I will still be working with the people that I love and laugh with I had no problems with any of my coworkers it was a great experience for me
good,I started out as just a seasonal worker and it turned into a regular job after the holidays. It was the first job in a long time that I enjoyed going to work.
good,"Became more social working here and met alot of interesting people.  Got lucky in this job, was my first job.  Enjoyed seeing the excitement on all the kids faces"
good,this place was great to work at especially the co-workers there they were absolutely fabulous. we always got bonuses whenever we were to work on holidays plus we got pizza parties for the most rewards cards we got people to sign up for.
good,I wish we didn't go out of business... I absolutely loved my coworkers and customers. If you read this review than you'll understand why I answered the way I did. Lol
good,i really enjoyed my time with Toys R Us. i got to mingle with children and actually put a smile on peoples faces. its a fun work environment and a very interesting ace to work.
good,"Had a lot of fun working there. Coworkers were amazing, store management was amazing. Unfortunately, the CEOs had no idea how to run a company and investment capitol banks drove the company into debt."
good,I was only there as a temp so it was only a short time but everyone was very friendly. I worked there for the holiday season so it was fun helping parents shop
good,"I took this job for extra holiday money in 2012 and loved it so much that I left my position with Pleasant Valley Hospital to devote myself to it fully.  I was never technically full-time at TRU and I took a significant pay cut; however, I was happier during my time there than I have ever been with any other employer.  I enjoyed the fast-paced, occasionally high-stress environment and I deeply respected my management and co-workers.  I will miss them more than words can express."
good,"It was good hours and good pay, and is a friendly and good peers, the staff are lovely and they are able to change hours around your suitable time, it’s a good job"
good,The atmosphere in this place was good and fun. You get excellent training and work closely with execellent people. what i loved starting from October thru January was the overtime.
good,Can be both a laid back and fast paced environment. Hardest part of the job was not being able to fully satisfy every customer. Best part of working here is being up to date on all the newest toys and gear on the market.
good,Working for Toys R Us has been a rewarding experience and provided an opportunity to guide new parents through their pregnancies and continued growth.
good,"Although there are things the company did that I did not agree with, the stores themselves were great to work at. The companies executives made unethical decisions which lead to its demise. "
good,"Working at Toys 'R' Us was a very short time but a very memorable one. you would come in greet you fellow employees with a good morning, afternoon, or night.clean the area your put in and work in a calm environment. Of course during the holiday season it was quite stressful. us as employees seemed to be doing fine, it was the stress of the mangers who seems to struggle with keeping a calm work environment on top of upset customers. most of the time its very relaxed and their is plenty of us to help each customer. Ive learned the register for the first time and how to be quick with it. when the season passed I learned how to organize and properly label products and fix broken ones. Management is extremely down to earth but still professional. The hardest part was when it was dead ad there wasn't much to do. but thats about it. Besides that I adored every bit of the job."
good,"Amazing management, great coworkers, and very flexible on scheduling. Our guests are treated like family and they treat us the same. Awesome place to work, not too fast paced (off holiday season), and everyone is very helpful. Teamwork makes the dream work ;)"
good,"Great place great atmosphere, was closing. In my brief time there, I was trained extensively, and fast. I thought it to be a great family enviorment. Great mangement."
good,"Working at ToysRus was a great experience. The shifts are pretty straightforward and you have the option to do more work than you were assigned if you finish ahead of time. The better you work, the more opportunities are afforded, the hardest part of the job would emptying the trucks. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the stocking of the merchandise, as you are challenged in certain situations and forced to make quick but smart decisions. Management is straightforward and extremely helpful, even willing to work with the employees and show them how tp do the job right."
good,Your work experience you will be fun filled and you have the ability to make people smile. Its really about finding the right product for your customer. And the management team definitely pushes the team to achieve daily goals. It can be challenging but it makes for an exciting work environment.
good,"Toys R Us was a great company to work for with a can do mentality that required you to work hard and often long hours however it was great working for a company that really developed every aspect of your management skills. No two days were the same. You could be resetting half of the store, building new sections or completing payroll changes and schedules. In store there is a real team spirit which I will greatly miss and a lot of laughs along the way."
good,"ToysRus was a great company.  It's been an awesome opportunity to have worked for the company for a total of 15 year.  I will always cherish all of the fun memories of my team, as well as, all of my regular customers. This beautiful Brand is going to be dearly missed.  Unfortunately, the company is going out of business."
good,Toys RUs was a good company to work for. Good training program. Good safety procedures in placeBut they are closing all  U .S. operations in May 2018 .
good,I love working for this company but unfortunately I do not have the option to stay since the company just announced all stores at liquidating. Very sad to see it all go and to not be around the great coworkers and regulars at the store.
good,Nothing better the being a part of making a child's dreams come true.The connects that you are able to make on a day to day basis are priceless. I was fortunate to work with talented team of people that did an outstanding job.
good,I have learned a lot to help me with my career. I have had exposure to many cross-functional roles and have met a large group of amazing peers and mentors.
good,"It was a national chain but the individual store felt like a small retail store. I was mostly janitorial and building maintenance, however during my time there I was trained in most everything short of management. Love most of the other store associates and a few of the managers that went through there during my time."
good,I have been at Toys R Us for 3 seasons now as I only work there seasonal. I love the people I work with. It is a fun atmosphere but everyone gets their work done.

good,"Toys R Us is a very good company to work for. Everyone will help you to get everything done. The management is very knowledgeable"
good,It was a fun seasonal job it was during the holidays so it was vary busy but it was always vary positive. The store manager was really great I would love to work with him again.
good,I love my coworkers and the all store. They are very supportive and we are like one big family and I think that's the key to making the store really stand out.
good,Although this was a seasonal position  i enjoyed working for toys r us as it was very busy and i got the chance to work in a few different positions within the store. the hardest part of the job would have been after closing time when the store had to be tidied and all the stock that had been misplaced had to be returned to the correct isle again which was quite difficult if unless you had a bit more experience in the store
good,"I loved this job! Staff were friendly and easy to get along with the store got very busy at time which I loved because it kept me occupied and many I got to interacting with many different customers, great place to work."
good,"Positive and joyful workplace. Get the job done and make sure the customers and their kids leave with a smile and be ready to come back again. I was a cashier at toys r us. I enjoyed working there. Very fun environment. The only hard part is trying to get people to get an account or buy the plans they be having. Also, get the customers to buy the insurance on electronics."
good,I absolutely loved the staff. I was always on the go doing whatever was needed to make sure things would go smooth for my work day. Customer calls and product searching.
good,I loved working at this company because the people were great to work with. I really enjoyed the discounts. My only regret is not being asked to stay.
good,It was very exciting working there I loved seeing the smiles on the children's face when they visited the store.also the excitement that it braught to each parent that came i think the parents were more excited than the children
good,I really did love working for Babies R Us. My manager was amazing and always worked with all of us when we needed time off or if we had to leave early. He is so great to get along with and so easy to come to if you have any questions about your job.
good,"Even though the job was temporary i have learn how to work as cashier,stocker and greet customer at the same time.The work place"
good,"I loved it at one point in time. But, The manager i was working for at first was very rude to his employes. So, I found me another job. It stayed busy. I learned that customers came first. The work place culture was a friendly one. Putting smiles on childrens faces."
good,"Working at a toy store may be considered fun but when the store becomes a mess after customers, fixing the mess is a must! my co-workers were fun to work with. definitely a fun working environment."
good,This was a fun job. I was able to recommend toys to customers and stock awesome toys I wanted myself as a kid. Managers and supervisors were very nice and respectable.
good,"Greets all customers and Associates encountered with a smile and encourages others to smile and say hi. Assists customers in a friendly, courteous manner."
good,"Toys ""R"" Us is a really awesome place to work, especially if you enjoy toys and games !! There's lots of work to be done at toys r us , but it is always fun and exciting !!"
good,"I really enjoyed working for the toys r us company. Toys r us has a really great atmosphere and lots of neat products that are fun to sell. They gave me a really great opportunity to gain lots of necessary experience that I use even to this day. I really love Toys ""R"" Us !!"
good,Work was easy going during the overnights in which work was done at a efficient level while still not being pushed to the max. It was a fun job that is very easy for the low requirements and reasonable pay.
good,"Like any other job you will come across stressful days but for the most part it is a fun and manageable job."
good,"Fun place to work at. Most of all I learned a lot from this job, customer service  department taught me a lot. I was not there very long because it was seasonal."
good,Great place to work within retail environment. career opportunities and training. Positive working environment. Focused on customer experience. Shift work week days and weekends. Typically very busy during holiday periods.
good,Interview process is fun and creative. Makes it where the right teams are put together. Get to see the new toys coming out before other people. Management o is easy to work with and always has a game plan.
good,"Working at Toy R Us was interesting. We were expected to have fun but be serious at the same time and I don't understand how that works. Overall this was a great place to work, the managers and supervisors were amazing, and its a really great place to start if you don't have much experience."
good,"Buen horario y sueldo,  compatible con vida familiar, buen ambiente"
good,"I really enjoyed Toys R US. Very great place to work. Only thing that made me leave is the job was temporary, Also , the schedule wasn't really made out you had to call in every day for the time being to basically see whether you were working that night. I was doing over night ship from store and also picking items. Then , I switched to day shift ship from store and helped assisting customers."
good,the guests were a pleasure to take care of and the employees were always fun to work with.  the hardest part of the job was making sure that guests didn't wait too long.
good,I would have loved to stay there but it was seasonal only.  I really enjoy working with and helping people.  people would tell stories about toys and christmas experiences.  love working with people.
good,"The company is great place to work, managers were very nice and easy to work with they made the job easy and the environment friendly. I do recommend."
good,I worked seasonal for toys R us it was a very good experience in retail. I got the chance to communicate to a lot of employee's and tons of customers.
good,I travel the country with a team of 5 staff. I open Toysrus and Babiesrus stores. The work entail from cleaning shelves to the final merchandised shop ready for opening. I also do the floorplan and work out the bin planning. I work under presure but will never fail in my work. I started as a store manager and did all admin and banking of monies.  I always give more than 100% and i always better my merchandise. I believe in honesty
good,"Great environment, great guidance into the world of retail and basic professionalism. The hours during holiday seasons can be a little demanding, however, that's to be expected from the job itself. Pay is pretty standard for a very basic position."
good,This was a great job to enter the workforce. Management was awesome and very in tune with employees. Lots of team activities.
good,the only issue i have is that working out in the area i was during the time nyc had a black out was not fun overall if you dont mind doing all activities not including what your hired for is fine.
good,Loved it here. I worked with great people the only thing that bothered was the pay. People should get paid more working for that huge company.
good,"the hours were great, and the job was easy. I only signed up for a seasonal job so thats why I didnt attend the job long. The people were nice and energetic and very positive."
good,Selling toys is a very happy and fulfilling experience. I can not review compensation or benefits because I was a seasonal worker. Job Security/Advancement is not guaranteed because of the seasonal nature of toy stores and my experience there was seasonal.
good,I love working for this company in New Concept Store in Tampa. I see manager has favorites in her supervisors and it shows with there work ethics. Assistant Manager is great person to work under he recognizes work experience in his team.
good,"Friendly team members,easy schedule, different task everyday so you never get bored as well as different types of customers so youll always be on your toes."
good,i was able to acquire new skills on how to handle the public and deal with different personalities. it was great experience
good,Toys R Us was a great experience and alot of fun to work at. The customers are polite for the most part and the feeling you have to see a kid smile is just a great feeling.
good,"I couldn't tell you how many times I sang that song with my kid's when they were growing up I never imagined I would work for them. It was only a seasonal position but it was a great place to work. But I must say it might not be for everybody. A typical day for me was pretty busy with a a lot of toys coming through my register most of my customers pretty happy. But you do get some that wait until the last minute and then they can't get what they want and that never makes anybody happy. Some people are not cut out to do this type of work. But fortunately the people who work Human Resources at Toys 'R' Us are very good at screening the people they hire to be there employee's.Everybody seemed to work very well as a team, always willing to help each other out. And management was great, I was always a closer and they were always so encouraging towards their employee's. We always had a little meeting before leaving for the evening and I never once felt like ""I don't want to go to work tomorrow"" I always felt like ""really it's time to go already"". The hardest part if you could call it that was just try to keep a toy store picked up a Christmas time The most enjoyable part of my job was being there every day , interacting with the customers while some of them were stressing out to give their children and friends and families the best Christmas they could and it was so much fun for me because it brought back all those memories of me doing all those same things to make the best  Christmas for my kids and family. And what I learned was what I already knew, you always keep a smile on your"
good,Muy buen gente con buen ambiente y trato. Lugar ideal para trabajar.
good,This was a fun place to work except it's not easy to move up. They focus more on who had been there longer rather than who puts in better or more work for the company.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working here. During the holidays it is fast paced and that is something I liked. Also, they allowed me to be myself."
good,"Good place to work, Good people to work with, Good Environment, Good opputunities. Overall just a good place to work at."
good,This was a great place to work. There is a lot o knowledge to take in about products. The management changed a few times while working there. Overall was a good job.
good,hectic mainly customers but good people there. I worked there only during the season. they maybe hiring me again during the season
good,"My experience working at this Toys R Us has been, for the most part, very rewarding. Each and every Supervisor comes into the store with a bright personality and a ""can-do"" attitude that gives the rest of us the will power to take on any challenge that may come with the day. They ensure that every employee is trained in anything that he/she feels comfortable doing, and they will go out of their way is there is anything that a person is struggling on. It's a wonderful group of people to work with."
good,Was a pretty good job only worked there as a seasonal cashier and electronics salesman so i didn't get to spend much time there but the people there were pretty nice and knew what they were doing.
good,Me encantó poder trabajar para la campaña de navidad ya que hay muy buen ambiente de trabajo y los compañeros hacen un gran trabajo en equipo y aprendes mucho
good,"I enjoyed working at Toy's R Us, helping the customers with their purchases & seeing the smiles on he children's faces knowing that they were getting what they wanted."
good,Fun place to work during the holiday season. fast paced setting. Position can change on hour basis and depending on column with in the store
good,Greeted every customer that walked in. Made sure every kid and parent was helped. Made sure everything was clean and organized.
good,I would recommend working at toys r us the company values its employees and is a leader in the community with exceptional guest service to customers.
good,"always in the spirit everyone always happy and management was excellent, Co-workers always happy and friendly. Most enjoyable were the holidays."
good,I absolutely loved working for this place in Rapid City. Everyone was very nice and welcoming. They understood if you made mistakes and worked with you and around a schedule you wanted. if you ran late they didn't really care as long as you showed up.
good,Stocking material and zoning merchandise. Assisted with sales floor as needed due to holiday rush. Assisted with black Friday displays and relocated certain merchandise to different areas of the store.
good,"When i worked here, we were almost always busy so we had to be quick, but we had a lot of fun in the store and made the most of it!"
good,"A typical day for me would be on cash register, greeting guests in English and in Spanish, helping guests find what they need on the sales floor, selling bikes, and other outdoor products. Management is wonderful, very easy going and very caring for their employees."
good,"working for Toys R us was very fun, the balance between life and work was awesome!! a typical day at work was busy but I made time go by fast, all co-workers were very friendly and welcoming."
good,"toys r us is at a very fast pace. I enjoyed working there, I love children so it was always fun helping them find a toy they  wanted. I enjoyed hosting any fun events that we had going on."
good,I would be up front cashiering or in the electronic department. I would tidy up the front end of the store. I would help out as a sales associate at times and assisted customers finding items. I learned that i loved working in a fast paced environment. The hardest part of the job was volunteering to wear the Geoffrey costume. What I loved most about working at Toys R Us is the gratitude customers would have when you would do everything possible to help them find an item.
good,During my employment with this company I was able to learn a great deal about supply chain logistics . It was a pleasure working for them .
good,Toys R Us is definitely a good place to work for a first job. it helps new comers understand what is required of them in a low stress environment
good,give you the skills to learn. If you want to move up they help you find a job with in the company. This company have great family values.
good,"One of the best retail companies I have worked at. The management team goes above and beyond to make you feel like you're worth something in the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is just being able to have fun and bring out your inner kid. The hardest part of the job would probably be working around Christmas time, it gets hectic but it is fun at the same time!"
good,"Jeden Tag beginnt mit erste mal der Uhr klicken, meine Weste anziehen, was ich an der Plan für der Tag haben und dann zu mein Arbeit für der Tag. Ich habe Sortieren, Kunden- beraten, Preis Kontrolle, aufräumen gelernt usw. Die Management ist sehr gut und meine Kollegen waren sehr nett, freundlich und Hilfe bereit.Es gibt Artikel ,dass ich noch nicht gehört habe und wenn Kunden fragen, ich muss erst mal andere Kollege fragen. Aber ich habe schnell gelernt. Neu Ware an der Wand liegen und Neu Preis Machen und Sicherung und Kunden beraten habe ich sehr gut gefallen."
good,"sorting out merchandise from the truck"
good,"Typical day at work for me was walking around the store helping parents and kids find what they are looking for or suggesting different products if they weren't sure what they were wanting. I learned a lot about different toys,different ways to approach the parents and how to explain products to get them to buy.The manager and my coworkers were all awesome,I love kids and this was a fun environment to work in!"
good,When i would clock in at the Rzone which is the electronic station in toys r' us i would help checkout at customer if need then i would walk around the vicinity to see if anyone needed help or the straighten the aisles and keep the clean the hardest part was holidays very busy but was able to be maintained the enjoyable part is watching the customer walk away with a smile.
good,a typical work day incudes customer meat an greet and the excitement on childs face when they see how big the store is. I learned that even an adult is capable of finding there inner child. Maintaining that which keeps the store healthy is what is perceived by the customers entering the store. the people you share your work space with is also your best friend and will help guarantee customer satisfaction. Probably the only thing that makes this type of work the hardest is when a child cries when they dont get the items/toys they want. But when they do it gives you an unsurmountable amount of cheer.
good,I didn't start there as a worker I had to show them I worked hard an they kept me after the holiday session the job is a cool job the ppl are nice but everyone has there days overall thums up loved helping the customers I made famileys in there I didn't even kno
good,fun and friendly staff along with management. I really loved interacting and talking with the customers.
good,"They were always for the guests. they wanted them helped with the utmost respects and help them in any way possible. even in getting heavy items out to the car for them, by offering carry outs.  they also insisted  employees knew their jobs well to give best service."
good,great internship that gave me and opportunity to learn some of the subtleties to law
good,"nice smooth job,"
good,A typical day at work would involve cleaning down a machine i had started on day before or i would begin on a new one. developed my team working and personal skills some more. Management was good always easy to talk too. Interesting array of co workers able to make quick friendships and made the job more interesting.
good,my time at toys r us was very flexible and worked well around me and my family. It was challenging and busy environment and different every day as you are working directly with the public. I loved the people i worked with and got on well with managers and floor staff alike. the only reason i left was to go back to college and pursue a career in the health services. A great place to be as a student or working parent.
good,"I wish the Express store never closed down, i rather the Express store than the regular big store"
good,I had a fantastic time here. If this wasnt a pop up location I would have stayed. Working with toys and interacting with excited happy kids made for a very easy quickly passing day.
good,Really great company to work for.  They give you the tools to succeed
good,There is always plenty to do when working for the biggest retail store for kids toys.
good,It is a very tedious job. Hard work. but the customers makes it worth wild.
good,"the people were nice the managers were hard workers and the co workers were easy to get along with, a regular day at toysRus consisted on helping people find what they need and making a lot of kids happy that was the most enjoyable part if the job"
good,It is a very fast paced environment I love working here. The people are nice the supervisors are great and they always leave room for improvement..
good,I was mostly working on a cash register and was seasonal. I learned that sometimes places keep the weaker workers and let the better ones go after season. I enjoyed working with many of the other seasonal workers. They were nice and upbeat.
good,"While only a seasonal position, I enjoyed my time at Toys R Us. The people were nice and how can you not enjoy working with toys?"
good,"I was a cashier, floor salesperson, and more. I left because it was too far away from I home."
good,As a seasonal employee there is not really any job security but you are pretty much guaranteed to work a good amount of hours in the holiday season.
good,"Great place to work, promotion potential great environment"
good,"When i get to work clock in, go to the register. if their is no long lines, i do re-shop. that's usually gets done pretty fast. Then back to the cash register, I learned more about toys an how important teamwork when dealing with a retail toy store. Management was wonderful handling this in such a business an professional level. The hardest part was getting off from work I loved my job I really enjoyed the customers. The customers would be the most enjoyable part. your interacting with people from all over the world, learning more about people an how to communicate with one another!"
good,The environment is pretty amazing. It's very relaxed but serious at the same time. They usually have all the employees doing everything (no one is just at one place)
good,"Among all of the duties needed to be done at this job, all of them were pleasant due to the fact that everyone there were caring and helpful."
good,It was fun to work with such a wide variety of people that were particularly nice and productive at the same time. I was able to learn how to communicate and socialize with others as well as work in a fast pased environment. Their were no hard days because everyone worked together and assisted eachother.
good,If you don't know how to operate equipment they will teach you. I became a turret driver and that is my position there. They make food for you some days give out random stuff and you get bonuses. Only thing that kind of sucks is you don't know if they keep you after the holidays.
good,"Hele leuke baan met dito collega`s "
good,"Stocking, cleaning, helping guests"
good,"I spent my time improving and learning more techniques to use in the world of sales and customer service. I was able to take home knowledge of different technology merchandise such as tablets, computers and gaming systems. A typical day at work included, setting up registers, making sure work area was clean. When not needed at the customer service desk or a register, I could be found walking around pulling items for customers who couldn't find them. The hardest part of the job only came along when we had unruly customers, most of which were under the age of 9, but the most enjoyable part of the job were the same customers."
good,"Very good place to learn the basics of customer support. Only downside though is that it is only a stepping stone to better things, not a place to grow."
good,i was able to learn and cross train in every department and help co workers cross train as well.
good,The only place I have worked in my 30 + years working in the public that all have fun while your making people happy. The joy of helping parents and grand parents make children happy year around. The holiday seasons were even better.
good,"A typical day would be coming in and ready to work.I learned how to work better in a fast pace enviroment,learned how to train others. My co-workers were open to help when needed. The hardest part of my job was working seasonal. The most enjoyable part was the money."
good,"Good place to work during the holidays "
good,Most enjoy part of my job was locating a toy that a child wanted and seeing the reactions on there faces when I would pass them the toy
good,"I walked into work, and was warmly welcomed by the co-workers. I was then welcomed by the management with a ""hello, how are you"" and made me feel welcomed. They wouldn't just make me do cash register but, they'd make me work the floor as well. Although that wasn't what i signed up for. It gave me a good look around the store so when customers would ask me to locate items, i would be able to with ease. The hardest part was dealing with the customers who didn't seem to know how to read the signs that told them about when the sale ended, but beside that i loved it. "
good,i have keep everything clean and help peolle to find what thay are looking for .
good,"It is a great and fun place to work. Co-workers are friendly and the vibe around everyone is great. Flexible schedules and managers and supervisors at the store I work treat everyone the same. I've learned merchandising skills, improved my customer service and cash register skills. A typical day at work for me runs between customer service, sales and cash register. The most fun and exiting part of the job is Christmas season, because there's always something to do, there are a lot of customers to help, the day goes by without notice. On the other hand, the hardest part of the job is when the season is over, it gets slow, not a lot to do, not to many people to help and worst of all less hours of work. In Christmas season a part-time associate can work up to 28 hours a week and when it's over we only have like 6-8 hours weekly, and that is really though. Overall it's a great experience but i will definitely recommend a Toys R Us Express for seasonal job only, or to compliment with another part-time. Definitely not for an only job unless you are a manager or full time supervisor or a person without responsibilities of paying rent, car, etc."
good,"I was employed only temporary, but it was a great place to work with other employees willing to help."
good,I actually love working at Toys R Us its a really great job and I love my co-workers.The work environment is great and I have alot of fun while im at work.
good,I loved working for toys r us. Its a good work evironment. But most of all I liked helping out the customers and making sure they left with a smile on there face.
good,I would clock in to work then get on the register and begin to check customers out. If the store is not crowded I would start re-shop.
good,Great time working over at toys r us
good,I am a cashier along with sale floor team member. I greet guest and help the mfind products throughout te store. It is very rewarding being able to see people smile after all that I do for them. I beleive in going above and beyond to accomplish my task.My co-workers are very helpful and friendly.Great job for the season!
good,I had a great opportunity to learn and grow fast. I assumed management position with the help of the current management and with their guidance I was successful at the role. Worked along side great co-workers that was the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part was the high peek Christmas season which started from early November till the end of the year.
good,Enjoyed the job and was kept busy but only a three month contract with no chance of being taken on full time.
good,Enjoyed my time there. Iwish they could have hired me seasinally consecutively.
good,very busy
good,"I work here form the bottom up there was nothing in the store when I started but the walls. I learn alot from the people that I work with, I enjoy my job it was fum and sad at times, but most times fun."
good,"Toys-r-us was a great and fun job , with fun people who didnt mind helping a person if he or she needed it, the hardest part of the job was to reach the deadline with short help or very little time."
good,"Enjoyed my time here, great company to work for. Advancement possible with hard work and right attitude."
good,A typical day at work would be to restock and assist customers
good,"Learned lots of key responsibilities as an employee,"
good,"I was a Sales rep-I had to explain to the costumer that day what was on sale and where to find it, floor rep-I had to represent the merchandise an find its secure area, price checker- i had to find the sale and replace it with a new sticker then it is placed on the merchandise to let the costumer know about the product and where they can find it, a boxer that's when i worked in the back room an took all the shipment of the trucks an u got to keep track of the numbers or you could end up with someone else s shipment.there were a lot of workers there who didn't have time to have fun they were working hard just like i was. most of them pulled double shift an worked a lot longer than me. The hardest part of the job was finding something to do when your done with your task. The most joyable part of the day was working at Toys R Us thats every kids dream an i got to do it for a little while."
good,"I enjoyed working at Babie's R Us, I learned all about how to become a mother through teaching the New Parent Classes, and by learning about different products for babies. My Co-Workers and I helped build the store once the consturction was done we put in the fixtures and stocked the shelves. Managment was pretty good there, very accomodating to your schedule and always gave you the days off you requested. The best part about my job was registering the New/ First time Mothers and helping them set up their registry."
good,overall my best job loved going to work had a great working crew great managers
good,"A fun store for kids to work and shop, with valuable retail experiences year round for sales members. High emphasis on metrics and teamwork. Very flexible with work scheduling."
good,"I enjoyed working here. There is a friendly environment, that makes coming to work pleasant."
good,"The people are great, and the work is easy. They like to make work fun."
good,love working there have nothing bad to say only one problem with is that some of there policy are out of date and need to be revised to how the world and personal life change.
good,"I am currently employed at Toys R' Us as a seasonal security guard, i really enjoy working there. The people are great, the environment is good and the management is also amazing."
good,"- Place to advance "
good,My time at Toys R us was a fun experience me myself I love kids and seeing how happy they got when they entered the store really warmed my heart it was honestly bitter sweet when the store was closing because it was my first job and i grew up in that store every toy i got was from Toys R Us I use to be the kids I use to see walking into the store so to hear it was closing was a wow i'm glad I got to get this experince .
good,"I can honestly say that I really enjoyed working at the establishment of toys r us they were extremely helpful with the guests at all times. They always did what they could to assist whichever way they knew possible. If we had to get in touch with another store to order something for someone to be picked up for their child for Christmas, or birthday. It was a real different kind of experience working with that many children, but I really enjoyed every minute of it with the families day to day, it was amazing. I wouldn't have traded it for anything. I miss doing it everyday."
good,"Working at Toys r us was a pretty exciting and fun job to work at. Why? Because your surrounded by your childhood toys you use to play with as a child. And to see kids happy faces, that brightens up my day."
good,"My time at toys r us was good, it's just that they closed it down. Honestly if it where to be open I would probably still be working there above all it was my favorite job."
good,Was a really fun job the management was amazing the hours were really flexible  the overtime was optional the pay was really good as well as the job also gave great discounts to employees
good,Good place to work. A job that showed me experiences that I’ll take with me to the next job.  The management was good to work with along with the other co workers
good,"Worked there for 2 seasons doing overnights, the people I worked with and the job itself was pretty good, though the pay leaves something to be desired, but it is a minimum wage job. If you're in need of a good work environment, this is the place for you."
good,"My favorite part of working at Toys R Us was that everyone was around the same age."
good,"•	Greet customer "

good,Had a supportive manager and was able to grow within the company. People were great to work with and we always assisted each other when needed to meet a deadline.
good,"I was like the song “I don’t wanna growing up because if I did I wouldn’t be a Toys R Us kids , I was a cashier and most of my duty was to greet customers and help them find what ever they need"
good,Toys R Us is one of the best companies that you can work for. The staffing becomes like family and the work is enjoyable and fulfilling. Being able to see the joy on the kids faces when you help them find that special toy is also a plus.
good,"Large company with great benefits but just happened to lose to big marketing and closed down warehousing,Good wages and hour to compensate employees work week."
good,"a typical day at work is picking up the phone and answering student questions. Printing out work orders and creating work order schedules."
good,The most enjoyable part of toys r us is seeing the children with smile helping them out. Probably the hardest part was cleaning the store up after the holidays. Stayed there until 12 cleaning the store and fixing the shelves folding and hanging baby clothes. I learned that a person in a job love their work environment by the people one works with and the place. Toys r us was a great first job and couldn’t ask for anything better. Managers were great and employees. We became a family.

good,"I enjoyed working with the other coworkers, some had been there for over a decade. I probably worked too hard considering my position but that’s why I got along with everyone. Job itself would be really boring on slow days but annoying on busy ones. Dealing with the entitled parents was worse than the kids who made messes. But overall customers were good and the job was pretty much what you’d expect it to be."
good,Very energetic environment. Fun for everyone. Great first time job for teens. You’ll learn all the basic fundamentals of retail while being able to test the toys.

good,"Being apart of Toy'R'Us was greatl. My coworkers were nice and hard working as well as I am. Got to have conversation with the customers and make their day by helping them with their purchase. The typical work day was busy,I learned how to communicate with strangers better. The management was well and the workplace culture was great too.he hardest part of the job was when the store would have the deliver and we need to display all those new items within one day.The most enjoyable part of my job was making people happy by helping them get what was best for their child."
good,I enjoyed working at the Toys R Us it was fun and very easy to get the hang of the only issue was most of the work days there was no direction by management. Everything else about the job was really enjoying.

good,"ince Keller Williams Realty is a profit sharing company, all the agents are vested in a common goal. In an industry that has always been 'dog eat dog', it is such an advantage to be at a real estate company where agents have true vested interest in a common goal, and as a result, teach classes, work together and step up for each other in tough times. If you are real estate agent that truly wants to build a real estate business and values being treated like a stakeholder and a company cultu..."

good,"The job was often fast paced,especially around Thanksgiving and Christmas, but it was easy to understand and easy to do. The other employees were great and made the experience better. The only thing that made the job difficult, in my case, was working the 3rd shift. It was long hours, but they went by fast."
good,I was only here as a part time seasonal help. The managers were extremely understanding that it was a second job for me to get extra income around the holidays. They scheduled accordingly.

good,Toy R Us was a great place to work for. The benefits was great and the company was very family originated. Employees receive paid vacation and time off from work. The only reason for leaving Toys R Us was because the company went of business.
good,I loved working for the r us family and that is what we were was a family. It was a joy to meet new customers and make sure they found what the were looking for.

good,Toysrus was a great company that gave me my first opportunity to enter into the workplace. It enhanced my skills and gave me the ability to work with others as well as interact with individual's from different areas. The pay was great and the schedules were extremely flexible allowing me to balance my education and my work.
good,"When I was told we were closing, I was very disappointed. I enjoyed the people and my co-workers. I was comfortable in my job. I enjoyed TRU/BRU very much!"
good,It didn't pay well and it was hard hard work but unloading all those heavy boxes off the truck would be worth it to see a child's smile when I would find the toy they were looking for.  I miss it.

good,"was a good place to work before it went into Administration. i worked there for 18+ years we always made sure shop floor was clean and tidy and all shelves were full and correctly priced where possible. learned how to work as part of a team and on my own, how to deal with awkward customers also how to be a supervisor. we had fun as  well but we did work hard especially at really busy periods"
good,I was able to move up at Toys R Us because I showed that I was invested in the company.  I was paired with new employees to help them learn the process of stocking and labeling products.  I started overnight stock crew in September and was moved to Baby Registry in January.  The Baby Registry was a very rewarding position  I met with new parents and helped them choose items to place on their registries.  I explained products to them so that they could make informed decisions.  When Toys R Us was then forced into liquidation I was asked to return to the stock crew then helped with the price changes.  I enjoyed all of the employees and the customers.  I really enjoyed helping children find toys they wanted and help grandparents find age appropriate toys.
good,"Toys R Us was a wonderful environment to work in.  Many of my co-workers are like family.  It's sad to have to say good bye."
good,I had a great team around me so it made everything a little easier. especially when you stat between 4 and 6 AM. Trucks were unloaded efficiently and usually ahead of schedule. Once everything was off the truck it was either put out on the floor or stored in the backroom. Once the store opened my team continued to stock/backstock while also assisting customers. I miss it a little honestly.
good,"The customers were great and my co workers were amazing people. There was always something to do, especially during the holidays. Great management who acknowledged good work."
good,"Start there over the holidays, friendly people, fun place to work. Management was friendly and fair. Learned more sales techniques and patience. Sad that the company is no more."

good,working at toys r us is anyones dream specially if your a parent with kids theres many diffrent cultures there also the hardest part working there would be cleaning the store at the end of the day
good,a typical day at work was always taking care of customer service first before anything. The most enjoyable about the job was when we closed we rode around the store with the display bikes.
good,this was a great place too work but the times have chanaged and this company is now going out of business  but working there was both fun and a great learning experience
good,"I am in charge of the service desk and answering customers questions as well as managing break times and covering for others when they go on break. It has been a great company to work for, I just wish the company will remain in business."
good,"My role as customer service representative interacts with a company’s customers to provide them with information to address inquiries regarding products and services. In addition, they deal with and help resolve any customer complaints. For instance, a customer representative may assist you in opening an account or help you to resolve a problem if you cannot access your account or if your order never arrived. Usually, customer service representatives gather their information via a telephone call, email and or social media. Customer inquiries often involve some form of complaint that the customer service representative must handle in accordance with the company’s guidelines and policies."
good,"I loved working there but I was young. They people where amazing. I had fun working there. But I heard that ToysRUs is going out of business, Its a great first job."
good,Working at Toys R Us was fun but it got too stressful for me along with being a high school senior. As a high school senior I have a lot of work to finish and not having enough time after school and having to go to work was effecting that.
good,"Toys 'R' Us was an amazing company to work for, with such a fun environment you almost forgot you were at work. I learned a lot of valuable customer service skills in my time at Toys 'R' Us. The management was absolutely amazing, always willing to help and were always very connected with all employees. The hardest part of the job would be the busy season (October-January) just because each day was faster and busier than the last. Although the job could be stressful at times I would say the best part would be seeing all of the smiling faces that walked out the door. Toys 'R' Us is a place where kids can be kids and with so much to look at it truly was like living a dream, Toys Everywhere!"
good,"a really relaxed work environment, so long as you got your work done, you could do whatever. I always got my work done early, and then just kept working so long as they let me be clocked in."
good,"Toys R Us was a fun place to work with new toys constantly being released. "
good,"Great place to work, bringing joy to the faces of kids.  60% of your business comes during the holiday season.  The rest of your business comes from birthdays, holidays, etc."

Had to take care of my own area, including restocking, back stock, ring up customers, answer questions about the many products. everyone here was really nice, no big problems or anything like that."
good,I worked overnight as a seasonal stocker. It was a great environment to work. We all worked effective as a team to get the daily task done. I was always able to pick up extra hours.
good,If I could work here again I definitely would. One of my best job experiences. Never a dull moment there. Not too difficult but also not easy. Especially stock.

good,they are very flexible with the schedule to work around my available with my child. paid breaks and 30 minutes lunches for 8 hour shifts. the pay over the holiday season was higher then the out of season pay rate. for all the work that is done the pay could be higher
good,This is a great organization that really cares about the people. I was recruited over by my former Executive director. The environment was rough but we were able to change the culture to one that was built around respect integrity and leadership.
good,"I truly enjoyed the opportunity and time I had with TOYSRUS. The Leadership team and workforce made the job worth coming back daily to the challenges at hand."
good,I enjoyed working here as a seasonal associate even though it was hectic you didn't feel like you were going to get your head chopped off if you made a mistake. The managers always had your back and everyone who worked there were very helpful and patient in helping new people.

good,"toys r us was a great place to work considering it was only seasonal. "
good,I was only a seasonal worker but I did enjoy what little time I spent here. We did have long hours but the pay was worth it and the job was fairly easy.
good,"Sometimes complicated, but working at TRU is great! I used to help unload the trailers. Now, I help my other team members to handle the online orders that are sent to our store! TRU is showing me great growth potential!"
good,I enjoyed my time working at toys r us. I was first a cashier and then customer service assistant and then helped management take care of the front of store and training new staff up. Meeting new people everyday and I enjoyed helping them look for what they needed. Loved the look the kids face would have when they have found their toy.  I was easy to get on with and worked as a team as well as working on my own using my own initiative.
good,"Great open door policy and educational benefits! Working for the company overall was a new learning experience. Hard work and dedication allowed me to show how I  could benefit the company, It also provided me with opportunity to grow within the company."
good,a typical workday is very quick paced and it can be stressful around the holidays. i learned about stocking merchandise and memorizing where things in the store belong. the management is disorganized. the hardest part of the job is when the store is busy and you are called to do multiple things at once. the most enjoyable part is the customers and learning what kids today love to play with.
good,"I really enjoy my job at toy r us. Its a great place to work. I like working with all the kids that come into the store and get to pick out a new toy with their birthday money and pay with their gift cards that they received for their birthday.  It is a very fun job and I work there on Saturdays because I have a full time job during the week."
good,I enjoy my work at Toy's R Us. I work this as a second job. They have good benefit's and work with my schedule with my other job. The pay could be a little better but all in all a great place to work.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was that I did all my work by myself I didn't have someone always behind me telling me what to do I would work hard to make sure I went home by the times I was given to work.
good,manager  was difficult  and rude .Experience  wise wouldn't  mind recommended  the company .very  excellent work  conditions. comfortable relaxed  peers and atmosphere great
good,Typical work day was a 10 hour shift. However if you did not finish you had to stay until it was done. Driving for results daily was not an option. We have a strong team. Buddy training was the most important to ensure everyone was on the same page
good,This retail job was a whole lot different from the other retail job I worked at. It was a different retail culture. The only upside to working there was a 5 to 10% discount on items. While working there was too many floor mangers and mangers from other stores so it was hard and stressful to learned names if you had a question or needing assistance from them. I got more help from my fellow co-workers in learning the computer system.
good,I really loved working at toys r us. The employees and managers were excellent. They were polite and very patient with teaching me things. I would love to go back if i could but not just for seasonal.

good,Toys R Us was a fun place to work. I enjoyed interacting with kids and helping customers find the things they needed to make Christmas and other occasions a wonderful experience.
good,Honestly I worked seasonal but was offered a permanent position. This job is every big kids dream minus the working part. It's quick easy work and you get the hang of things pretty quickly. Seasonal may be the only time you get decent hours though. Overall it's a good job if you're looking for something part- time. The only reason I put a bad rating for benefits is because I personally didn't receive any except discounts towards the store.
good,"the work place was full of vibrant energetic people who all shared the same goal, to send customers home happy. I learned how to get into the mind of the customer and help them decide whats best for them or their loved ones."

good,"I had a great time working at Toys R Us. I was helping customers with locating their items, ringing them up for their purchases and helping them enjoy their shopping experience. The only down side was that I was only making $8.25 an hour at the time and unfortunately, was laid off before the holidays. Management there was just top notch. I loved working for the management because it felt like they were really looking out for me."
good,The job was easy. Everyday I came in and helped sort things in the back. I learned how to use a handheld printer and how to figure out where everything belongs. The hardest thing to do was to carry the ladder to a certain spot since I'm so short.

Os meus colegas eram impecáveis porque me apoiaram e me ajudaram bastante a ter confiança em mim mesma.  Apesar da secção no qual fui posta como responsável, ser um desafio devido a ter vários tipos de brinquedos para rapazes, a parte mais agradável e divertido é ser como uma criança e poder mexer nos brinquedos e ver como a tecnologia e o design de brinquedos tem vindo a crescer desde da minha época de criança."

good,As a stock person I was responsable for unloading the trucks and restocking the backstock. I worked as a team with not only my peers in the stockroom but the personnel on the sales floor. The supervisors worked well and were attentive to subordinates needs. Christmas time is the busiest for any retail company and is the most stressfull time for any employee of one of these companies.

good,This was a seasonal job and I enjoyed it while I was there. I enjoyed my manager and my job!!
good,"A typical day at work usually consisted of restocking the shelves with merchandise and working on the register when called. Working at Toys R Us taught me how to handle money properly and accurately, it also taught me excellent customer service skills. The management could have been better than what it was. Most of the skills and tricks of the trade I learned from fellow co-workers and not during training. All co-workers were very helpful and friendly with each other and with the customers. The hardest part of the job was learning how to balance the needs of multiple customers at once and to get everything done quickly and to the liking of every customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things and the experience."
good,"A typical day at work is doing daily floorwalk and handovers. Ive learned lots of things like how to deal with different customers,how to give excellent customer service,how to properly handle complaints from customers,and proper cash handling and many more.Management is strict when it comes to targeting the sales target.My co-workers came from different places so we have different cultures but despite of these we still have harmonious relationship and having healthy competition with them helps a lot at the end of the day.The hardest part of the job is not at all. The most enjoyable part of the job is hitting the target!!!! :)"

good,"A great place to learn new skills, the best atmosphere of anywhere I've worked. Friendly staff and management. I loved going to work when I was employed by them. Only downside is the zero-hour temporary contract, didn't provide great job security or steady enough wages."
good,"Babies R Us has taught me so much skills! I first started off as a cashier. I already had a year of experience working a computerized cash registered system and handling different forms of payment but I also learned how to sell our credit card and warranties for different merchandise. A few months later, I was promoted to registry consultant. It has built my communication and customer service skills, as well as my skills for answering telephone calls. All of my managers and supervisors are super nice and can be very enjoyable to work with. I'd say the hardest thing about working for Babies R Us is dealing with difficult customers. Our customers want the very best for their children and if they do not get it, we are in trouble! But overall, great company to work for!"
good,"*typical day is putting out merchandise and restocking."
good,"La dinámica, forma de trabajo y dirección de esta empresa facilita la acogida al mismo y consigue un buen ambiente de trabajo y rendimiento de los trabajadores."

good,"Great place to work, focus on customer service. Team members are driving to reach goal set by company."

good,It was a great company to work for. The management were easy to talk to if you had a problem. The employees treated you well. The only thing that wasnt that good was the pay.
good,I never dealt with rude customers my time being there! My manager was always open to listen and work with me if I needed time off for my children. Also I never had to worry about money loss for time off.
good,"Company closed due to change of CEO's and corporate greed."
good,"Good place to work for part time worker. Unfortunately the multiple members of management could get in the way of getting jobs done, as there was a communication issue when i worked here. However the job is vary stable for those willing to put in work and make the most of it. this is the best job I've worked up to this point as the employees tend to be motivated and the first few months of work you get to do a variety of jobs from unloading truck and stocking to cash work."
good,"Easygoing management, pretty easy work, pay wasn’t great, but good enough to get by, before Christmas we were getting OT, but right after it, the hours dropped SEVERELY, as expected, so, can’t complain, we got the hours when they were available."
good,"helping customers and seeing kids smile was the best. "
good,"Management was always fantastic. Our store manager was so dedicated to the company, and she really worked with our school schedules or anything else that might come up. It was a fast paced environment, which I really enjoyed. Our other managers were great as well, 2 of them always made working the closing shifts really fun, and we made light out of the liquidation. We became a family, and that is something that I absolutely loved."
good,I loved working for the company and was very sad when they closed. I would have stayed with this company much longer. The management was great to work with and made you feel like part of the family.
good,"I had a great time working for this organization. The staff was all supportive, which created a great working environment. It also has a fast paced working environment, which helped me enhance my work ethic."
good,I have strengthened my people skills and multi-tasking skills while working here. Its helped me build character and confidence in myself. It was a great experience working for this company
good,I loved working for toys r us however I needed full time with benefits and a higher pay and they just couldn’t accommodate so I had to move on not that I wanted to I loved every minute of it
good,I didn’t work there long because the job was seasonal but while I was working there I never called out the  experience was awesome I learned new things while working there and met new great people the pay was great and it was just good to be working with kids all day because it was a toy store I enjoyed every second.
good,"TRU was a great company to work for.  We built a culture of family, but unfortunately, the company filed for bankruptcy.  I enjoyed the many challenges that TRU gave, the supportive network, but most of all the family feeling."
good,"I loved working here. I wish they never shut down or I'd still be there. Great managers, employees and good time off/sick leave. Only issue I had was having to work all holidays but the holidays pay made it for that."
good,I worked on the Babies r us side. Got hetic and VERY busy. Family environment. Enjoyed my coworkers and managers were approachable and open with employees. Long hours and short breaks. Pay could have been more for all the work you put in but the job was good and worked with my school hours.
good,It was a fun place to work and i only did a weeks work experience. had lots of fun and the colleagues of mine were very polite. And be happy to go back there to visit and buy toys etc.
good,It was a good company to work for it just ran out of business for the Houston region I wish I could go back.We had an awesome staff and it was great managing a great team it was also a great experience learning new toys and selling them to all kids.Love the atmosphere and the enviroment to look at the kids and adults in such a wonderful wonderland we worked in.The hardest part of the job was getting some employees to participate in the contest like credit apps.I was mostly the one who pushed the sales with awesome prizes!
good,"A job with meaning and a focus on children. There was no place, and still no place like it. A warehouse of toys where kids and kids at heart can visit, touch, play, and purchase. I’ve worked amongst people that has been there for 20+ years. The culture was amazing. Some work tools and ideas were outdated, but overall everyone nee the goals to achieve."
good,"Coworker lied about an assault I did not commit, even though he first threatened to assault me and then continued to take out a knife on me. The manager had to let us both go even as much as I loved the job."
good,"Typical day is to go in find equipment, receive job duties, and get them done. I learned how to drive specific equipment as well as not every one is as the seem. My managers where amazing. I thought they were the nicest people. Mixed culture. hardest part of the job was trying to maintain a work/life balance especially during season. Most enjoyable was the people you met along the way and the crazy stories of their experience in their years working at TRU."
good,Overall good company to work for if your in management you are guarenteed hours. Benefits were okay. there was room for advancement if you applied yourself.
good,"The workload like anywhere else can be overwhelming at times but overall, a decent place to work. The hours were flexible and the atmosphere was positive and doable."
good,A typical day at Toys R Us was pretty easy. It was an overnight position so it was pretty quiet & calm for most of the part. During the holiday seasons is when it normally got hectic but it was actually more fun when our work days were heavy. The hardest part of the job would only be when we received trucks at night & we were under staffed so our day was harder than normal.
good,I really wish they could have found a way to at least keep Babies R Us. It was the only place to find everything a mother needed for her baby. It was the only part of the company that actually made money all year round.
good,"This was a second shift position which I came to love.  Days was Sunday - Thursday.  The company closed a year ago.  If was a good place to work.  I had 3 direct reports.  Handle payroll, Interviewing, Benefits, FMLA, Unemployment, Workers Comp, All leave of absebce."
good,I loved working there because I love kids. The environment was clean fast paced and the managers helped a lot. The vibe was always positive and the pay wasn’t all that bad either.
good,This was one of the best jobs I have ever had.  I advanced quickly and only left the job due to the fact we relocated out of state and I could not transfer.
good,Quite sad that this company had to close its doors. This was a fun and enjoyable expierence from cowrkers all the way up to managment that were understanding and fun.
good,"Right now they are closed but there are talks about reopening. It was fun working there. Typical work day you check to see what area you are working in ex: boys, girls, games, bikes, restock or if you are assigned a register."
good,"A typical day at work included talking with customers, taking phone calls, getting merchandise from the back, ringing people out, cleaning up aisles. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the technical issues."
good,Evey body. Got along.  Managers. Was. Fun. To. Get along. With.  The place. Was. Like. Your. Family.  We had. Ups. Downs. But at the end of the. Day. We left. With. A smile.
good,It was lots of fun working with others and getting a chance to learn how to move quickly when customers are around. The customers were very nice and also the employees treated everyone fairly.
good,I loved working at Toys R Us when it was still open. I enjoyed the atmosphere. I enjoyed the people I worked with. And the management was wonderful there.
good,"Its closed now so this review is pointless, but I did have a lot of fun here. It was truly where a kid could be a kid. I learned so much here and I learned a lot about team work and how important it is."
good,"My managers were helpful and I got along well with my coworkers. My only complaint was that I did not receive enough training at the beginning of the job, but nonetheless it was a fantastic experience for me. I wish I could have kept working there after the holiday season, but Toys 'R' Us is no longer in business unfortunately."
good,it was cool seeing all the new toys and learning about them. I also loved seeing the looks on the kid's faces when you would help them find the toys they were looking for. it's sad they're no longer around/.
good,"I enjoyed working for Toys R Us. Liked busy Christmas period. Team was great. Had opportunity to work few different places in warehouse,so it gave me more options what to do if we weren't busy"
good,Place was lots of fun and easy going with nice managers. The pay was a little low but the hours were really flexible and lts of poepl up for doing shift swaps to help ou out
good,"As a first job, it was as expected for someone new in the workforce. The job was fine and the employees were very friendly. I minded my business and focused on my job doing the tasks I was told to do."
good,"no comments at this time, company is closed, it was a very good company too work for at that time I needed a job. management was fair to the workers, deal with the people"
good,"Toys R Us was, in my opinion, the best place to work at. Management pushed you to do your best, but never micromanaged. We had to push sales, yes, but it was a fun, fast paced environment. Everybody was like a family there, and they treated everyone with respect."
good,"I was provided with excellent sales experience, customer service skills, leadership skills, good communication skills and was able to learn to work as part of a team. Management was always polite, caring and ran the store well. The hardest part of the job was the rush hours and the best was working in a friendly, caring environment where everyone got along."
good,My time with toys r us was great loved working in a environment that was like family. And the hours were flexible and all my co workers and managers treated you with respect. Overall the company was great to work for

good,"Great team culture, very family oriented and dedicated team members. Salary and benefits were great, projects assigned were great and appealing enjoyed working there."
good,"I helped a lot of kids , barely had hours working at this job because of the management also they were hiring and recruiting new people.  Overall I enjoyed my experience"
good,"A typical day at Toys R Us is, going in 10 minutes early, clocking in then going out to the register. Some of the responsibilities that i have as a store/ admin associate are serving customers on registers, processing and finalising refunds, lay-bys, zip-pays, online orders, answering customer enquiries whether in store or on the phone, managing tills during open and close of the store, training new employees and cleaning. "
good,It was a great job until it shut down. I would come in seeing familiar faces and bringing cheer to parents and children alike. I wish I could still work there but sadly I cant.
good,"I enjoyed working at Toys R Us because of the positive relationship between the Associates themselves and Management. I learned how to deal with customers in a positive way even if they were negative. Management worked with associates on issues concerning hours, time off, and disputes among employees, which were rare. The culture consisted of the values, beliefs, attitudes and behaviors that the Associates share and use everyday. The hardest part of the job was restocking items returned or not purchased.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the camaraderie between the employees. We all loved working there because our common culture made the job fun and made the workday go faster. Also enjoyable was conversing with the customers and their children."
good,"busy fast pace warehouse, you have to be able to multitask and have great memory skills. can get frustrating at times but at the end of the day it was a job"
good,"Great place for starting out. Management can pretty much make or break the team, but for the most part, have had pretty good management experiences! The team is like a family, so it's a pretty good environment to work in."
good,"The store was very interactive and there were many customers from all over the world."
good,Love Toys R Us love multitasking made my time go by so quick love to be on cashierIt was a great learning experience wish they didnt have to shut down
good,"I got to meet a lot of loving parents who during the time that I worked here, it made me enjoy being there. The best part was seeing kids super happy an excited to be in the store."
good,I liked toys R us so sad they are closed down now. I always think back and wish i had the cash to help them stay going as a company. As a whole and most of all the place it resembled. A place for kids and families to have fun and not spend too much.
good,We were a very productive group in the supply chain.  We developed a very nice friendship and ended up being very close friends working together for the last 22 years (my manager have been there for over 33 years). For me they were like my family.
good,"Most days I was operating the cash register or straightening and putting things away out on the sales floor.  When customers needed help, I would do my best to show them what products we had available that would meet their needs."
good,Love how kids come in all happy to get they toys and play around such a great day to have if you like/love kids that's a good job to work at such a great place
good,"I started as a seasonal employee and was kept for the off-season. Best place to work! So fun every day, and genuinely made me excited to go to work every shift. I’m so sad that they closed."
good,Unfortunately I began working at Babies R Us after we started liquidating. I didn't think I'd like the job as much as I did and when the time came to close I actually was upset. I always say I had wished I worked there for years. My fellow coworkers and the managers were always pleasant even if it was busy or it was a frustrating time for the store. We all worked but also knew how to have fun.
good,The people I worked with were great. The management was laid-back and knew how to have a laugh and when to be serious. I loved working for Toys R Us. I'm sorry they closed.
good,"Toys r us was my first job and i absolutely loved working for them and im very sad there closing , they gave me a chance when everybody else overlooked me"
good,I loved working here. It’s a very fun and extremely positive environment. My favorite part was getting to help children find their new favorite toys and helping parents shop for Christmas presents.
good,It’s a great place to work for; unfortunately it’s closing its doors forever. It was a happy place. Great leaders great team. Best part of the job was to see the kids face light up as they walked in the store.
good,Worked with the best management ever thats where I learnt customer services skills even though it was for a short while.Bosses was friendly and they cared about theur staff money was never short and they always put your needs first
good,"Management was great, great team work. I learned a lot when it came to customer service. The most fun part of the job was interacting with the team members we all got along and the costumers made it better."
good,"So sad to see this company go out of business! It was the most fun job I've ever had, being able to interact with the kids while still doing my job. I worked with some of the best managers and co-workers that I have had the pleasure of working with there."
good,"•	Used the company’s website to perform operations such as assisting customer locate online items in the store.  Researched the company stock to determine if we actually have the item for the guest at current or different location. Reviewed sales report and made revisions where needed."
good,I really like it here. Were it not for the company going out of business i would not be leaving. The management and HR staff are excellent and have genuine care and concern for their employees. Overall great place to have worked.

good,"Typical day normally 8-5. Working with 5-8 team members on store projects with hardware and software upgrades. Providing support to in house and store employees. Learned a lot about the retail business and project management.  Working with our vendors and both the business and technology side has been a great experience. "
good,a typical day was 7 to 8 hours i learned through bosses and employees and myself management were nice nice work culture the hardest part of job was doing shoes helping moms and dads picking out baby clothes
good,No complaints. Sorry to see this place go. Management was always happy to help you with whatever you needed. The shifts were slow paced but it was fun helping each customer with whatever questions they had.
good,as a student and mother it was important hours were flexible which they very much were. Manager was very nice and staff also a pleasure to work with. I very much enjoyed my time here.
good,I was only seasonal. I enjoyed working there. I worked the cash register and loved helping and talking to the customers.  managers were great! there was nothing hard about the job
good,Love my job and the people I work with.  Raises are not what they should be and neither is advancement. During Christmas season I worked between 40 and 60 hours a week. Many times 15 hr nights and back with only 4-5 hours off.  I love my job and would be staying if the company wasn't closing all stores.
good,A typical day was working at customer service or at baby registry walking around making sure everything was in place and looked neat. Making online orders for customers when product was only found online. Making gift bags in baby registry and making phone calls when needed. Also making returns or exchanges as well.
good,Management is super understanding. Team members are so collaborative to get stuff done. Always pushing to meet our sales quota. A lot of parties for reaching goals to celebrate.
good,"My typical day at Babies R Us was helping the parents pick out the different baby products we offered, stocking,being a back up cashier, taking on line orders and filling customers on line orders.I learned a lot about the types of cars seats and strollers that I didn't know in the past. The store has a good work culture, they make you feel like you belong from day one. The most enjoyable part was working with the parents and helping them choose the baby products."
good,I've enjoyed my time at Toys R Us. Have had the pleasure of working with a great group of people. Management is very well rounded and understanding as well.
good,"great place to work, lots of fun, great employees. good discounts. etc... place is shutting down though. sad, very sad...................................................."
good,"Toys R Us is a great place to work and believes in their team members. They have helped me with my personal and professional development. Is all about TEAM and achieving our goals. It is not an easy job, you have to work hard but we were compensated well for the hard work. The most enjoyable part of my job was the amount of relationship I have built within the Marketplace and the Global Resource Center."
good,ToysRus is a great company. They offer many advancements and help train the employees to succeed. There is a great level of communication between all departments. Its a fun place to work.
good,"Challenging and fun environment.  The culture is engaging, work hard and play hard.The most enjoyable part of the job is all the fun events they plan, diverse environment, and making sure the team members are always informed of what is going on."
good,It was very easy to make a lot of friends working at toys r us. I would love to work there again. The store manager was very nice and if you ever needed help nobody had a problem with helping you.
good,This was the first job that I had where I was actually having fun at work. I loved helping the customers and I was comfortable with my coworkers. I honestly wish that I was hired as a seasonal worker
good,"Typical big box type retail store. Stock shelves, assist customers, etc."
good,Difficult customers  /easy understanding customers /good team player /going extra miles to satisfy customers /patience /bare in mind that customers are always right
good,I enjoyed working here. I'm a big kid at heart and I just loved playing with the toys and helping kids find one that they really liked. I enjoyed being on the floor and doing what they call zoning. Which is basically bringing items from the back of the shelf to the front.
good,A really great place to work Good Room for development and progression as I was able to progress within the company. Great culture with a lot of friendly people.
good,"Demanding work but rewarding.  "
good,I enjoyed my time with TRU. I was seasonal but they treated me like I was a full time tenured employee with the company. The job itself is fast paced but time flies when you're having fun.
good,"Great place to meet people, and to find out about the top selling toys. Flexible when it came to shifts, understanding managing staff, their pet peeve is tardiness so make sure you arrive 15 minutes before your shift."
good,"I really enjoyed working for babies r us. This company is going out of business so I'm seeking other opportunities. However, I will stay to the end. Thanks."
good,The staff and management are amazing. I have worked there twice and I miss it. Only hang ups is that I cannot make a living wage without moving up and the job is so much fun no one leaves.
good,"really enjoy working for this company and i liked working overnights so it was a plus working for them,people are nice helpful,toys us are family they help each other"
good,Have nothing bad to say about this company. The only down point if I had to think of something is that they took along time to conduct my background check after initial hire. there corporate office computers was down continuously for a month.
good,"The work place was always friendly and understanding. As long as you do what is needed with keeping the store looking in place, you will have a great time. Team work is always going on and helps with the over all work environment."
good,i love the employees there. we had fun. we played games when we weren't business. we brought food in for each other to share. management was awesome. i loved working there.
good,"This position, while very fulfilling, offers very little in terms of advancing your career. It works better as a first job then as a continued main source of income."
good,"A typical day at work included doing re shop, and going to back of house to help them with MSS if they needed it, or they just didn't want to do it at the time. I would also cashier, and from that I learned great people skills, and how to work well with others."
good,Great culture.  Management teams are all close and work very well within the district.  Fun workplace with a quality of life.    The hardest part about my job is that I will have to leave it because of store closures.
good,Nice place to start working experience. Flexible shifts. Friendly and understanding co-workers. Duties are not to difficult to complete. Task consisted of register and the floor (cleaning up and putting items back on the shelf).
good,"Great place for a first job, workers are nice and so are the managers. customers can give you a hard time, but that's everywhere. Would recommend this job to someone without a lot of experience."
good,"a typical day would opening or closing the store. Answering phones, assisting customers, doing reshop, ringing customers up help finding the right toys, offering advice on which toy to purchase. The work place was a fun environment. I enjoyed working with the toys and helping customers"
good,"Overall it was a great place to work although , sometimes I didn't like what I had to to , I still got it done and didn't complain. The works where nice and welcoming."
good,"I enjoyed working at toys r us. the associates and the manager were all great. the only reason i left was i needed work benefits, my husband had lost his at his work"
good,Friendly works. Some hard driven. In my 7 Years there I’ve had ups and downs but over all I would recommend this job to anyone in school or needing a side job. They will be deliver with you and the hours you require to the best of their ability.
good,A fun but slow paced to work only time it picks is during seasonal times the pay is good for the work that has to be done. Also its a team based work environment.
good,I liked it a lot.  The employees worked well as a team.  It was fast paced and we always got the job done.  I wish it would have been a permanent full time position.  It was only seasonal employment.
good,"Challenging work, that is also very rewarding. Main focus is on customer experience, and helping customers find the particular product that they desire."
good,"As a sales advisor, you are responsible for the sale of a range of children's toys, multimedia electronics and baby products. Customer interaction is one of the more enjoyable aspects of the job."
good,From the week i was in toys r us it was a friendly work environment the staff were very helpful due to the fact i was only on placement for a week for my transition year work experience when i was in secondary school
good,Working with parents to help them find for what the are looking for. Being friendly with the kids and keeping in eye if any kid gets lost to help them find their parents. Learned how to be a retail sales person.
good,Friendly fellow employees. Just a real joy to work there. The holiday season is rough and very stressful. the rest of the year is slow and boring. Very customer focused.
good,The company is great food jump starting your career. Chances are given for you to move up throughout the company. During my time working I dealt with great management and excellent staff members.
good,"I have nothing bad to say about Toys R Us it was great work experience so sad that it was only seasonal. I had a great manager and great co-workers, we got to work and had a great time doing so."
good,"Toys r us was a great company, fast paced I worked on the register, stocking shelves, returning items and customer service, it was an absolute pleasure to work with this company"
good,"Couldn't ask for better, hardest part is learning something new But fun once you get the hang of it, the most enjoyable part is successfully helping customers find what they're looking for, management is awesome/fun to work and get along with, unique workplace culture"
good,"Toysrus is a lovely job to work at, I enjoyed it for the time there. In the Holiday season, it was very fast paced but was glad to learn more about different products."
good,"Help customers check out at the register items they are purchasing. Offer them a rewards card and give them a quick run down on the benefits. I learned how to use a register and their computer system to look up specific items per customers request. Management was very layed back and enjoyed their work so it made it nice and pleasent for the employees to enjoy and be comfortable to work there. Just make the customer happy and be yourself. Hardest part of the job, not being retained to continue to work there. I really liked working there."
good,"good place to work if you're looking for something temporary. The pay is low but its retail so you cant expect much. The managers at the location I worked were all amazing, I worked for them two years in a row and if I still lived in the area I would have still been there."
good,"Being an overnight job there is minimal customer interaction to start, every one is friendly and outgoing and the atmosphere is over all relaxed. Once clocked in you go and load up boxes on carts and distribute them through out the store, when that is done box cutters are passed out and the actual stocking begins. "
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo, buenos compañeros y pago de nóminas sin problemas"
good,"Enjoyed working here, I was here for 16 years and never had plans of leaving.. I like the people and the processes that assisted me in my duties were well planned and executed. Unfortunately the company hired a third partly transportation company to take over the department and all personel were dismissed through out the entire company."
good,"Great place to work if its your fist job , coworkers are great and funny , eassy jobs to learn , verry well kept community, and best of all amazing managers"
good,My Job is my second family! We work well together and have little to no hiccups in the work place! Management is well with training and we all have each others back in making the store better than what it was!
good,"It's a good place to work, dealing with kids everyay makes it more fun.Salaries are mnot so good compred to the work load and working hours.Hard to grow unless you push hard but the benefits are fair."
good,"Work environment was a bit stressful during Christmas season but other then that everything else was pretty great, it was a very fun experience. This was my very first job ever, and I learned a good amount of things."
good,Toys R Us was a great working environment. The only downsize is i feel like they do not pay their employees enough and do not provide benefits. But it is a fun environment to work in.
good,Great place to work Lots of fun Friendly coworkers Great Managers Good flexible hours Good discount for employees Great seasonal job Would work there again if I could
good,"I worked at Christmas,, we got pizza brought in by  bosses--fun place  and busy place to work during Christmas--down side was cleaning up and putting toys back in boxs"
good,Fun place to work for had alot of fun helping children do d the perfect game toy or with ever they was looking for enjoy the experience really would be  a nice place for a younger person who can relate to all the hottest games and toys that around other them o love the place
good,for the most part this was an amazing place to work and i loved it. however that came to a head when i was terminated when i was in the hospital with a ms flare up leaving me walking with a cane and unable to work at christmas time. i was terminated for job abandonment.
good,Typical day is just like working in retail. Your a cashier and also do returns. you could be hired and kept after season. the hardest part of the job would be not having certain items in for the customer. the most enjoyable part is getting 10% off on items.
good,I started off as a cashier for a seasonal position with the company and less than a few months. I was then offered a Department head position and I accepted and I enjoyed helping the customer more and it was a great learning experience for me.
good,working at toys r us was tiring some nights people would not  come to work and that would se back the whole team and in order to finish you would have to pick up on somebody elses slack
good,"Learned to communicate with a lot of different people. "
good,fun place to work especially during holiday season. everyone is always nice and very helpful. only hard part about this job is dealing with nasty customers during the holiday other than that enjoyable
good,Nice place to work. Great people. Friendly environment. Comfortable. Good combo of work/life. Managers are good mentors. Co-workers are great to learn from.
good,Muy buena por el ambiente agradable entre compañeros y con los clientes.
good,I enjoyed the freedom of what to choose to work on. Always had something to do. Understood my school schedule with sports and was flexible enough to allow me to work the days I could with extra hours
good,"The best job, I've ever worked. Started as a seasonal hire; which is the best time to apply for work. As the season came to an end, the store manager noticed my clear communication skills with the customers. She also noticed people enjoyed my friendly demeanor and offered me a position as a full time HR Supervisor."
good,"fun place to work, needs better equipment to work with such as ladders, lots of heavy boxes to stock, management was nice, i was seasonal and they were going to cut pay and only give me one day a week."
good,This was my ideal place to work. I got hired during seasonal time and helped open a pop up store and ended up working at that store and was an assistant manager. The employees were amazing and so was everyone at the main store. Only problem I had was when the season was over they didn't have a position available so I could not work there anymore.
good,"I facilitated the interaction among staff and managers for upcoming team and management events. In this environment, to ensure the staff that they are not being singled out, is of utmost importance to a company's management team. It is helpful to explain that company policies apply to everyone equally."
good,"Toys R Us was a great company to work for. Employees and management were both pleasant and great to work with. The store was always clean,  and there were enough employees to meet customer demands."
good,If you love kids this place is the best place for you there's a lot of kids there. you become a super hero when the kids cant find a toy and you go and get it for them. you're basically a super hero with no cape.
good,"Had fun working for this company and had a chance to work on my customer service. I was able to work on my organization skills, being able to work also on my time management skills."
good,I've worked there for 4 years. It's fast paced and fun work place.  I've worked there for four consecutive season. The atmosphere is fun and out going.
good,It can be really fast pace sometimes or super slow the next! Either way it's lots of fun with a great crew and understanding managers! They work with your schedule and theirs lots of skills to learn here!
good,"It was fun working at Toys r Us seasonal with good employees, they were always there when I needed help on the register. It would get busy at times that it went by so fast."
good,I liked the job it was my nice first job. I loved it the customers was fun especially the kids like I like the happiness of the kids when you hand them I toys
good,"At most 8hr job. Management play a BIG role in keeping customers as well as employees. With the right workers, your able to get alot done in a timely manner. With the right workers your able to keep your customers engaged in the product. The hardest part of the job is satisfying every employees request as well as customers. The enjoyable part of the job is seeing the joy on a customers face after finding the right item they are looking for."
good,"I would say the management was the worse part."
good,"I enjoyed working part time at Toys R Us. Although It was a seasonal position, I felt it was flexible for me in terms of the hours because of my family life. I was out of work for quite some time and I had to get comfortable with working again. I really liked and enjoyed working with the staff, they were all very sweet and always willing to help. They helped me understand the great qualitities of customer service."
good,"Fast pace, a lot of big boxes and items to stock, if you like labor work this would be consider a good seasonal job tiring but good enough to make extra cash for the holidays. Always provided food most times if we make good progress. overtime was always an option."

good,It was fun working here because I got to help children pick out amazing toys. Also the managers and my co-workers were very dependable when I needed help with something.
good,"Working here is great because of all the cute babies you get to see. Doing many different things in the day really builds your knowledge. Baby registry, stocking, reviewing online orders, and customer service desk was all good places to be. The work crew got along good and it was not such a tiring job, as far as no extensive work load."
good,"There were some challenges when it comes to technology. For example, TRU bought a basic support package and off shored it, and it was a disaster. But the local support teams were really nice to work with. Most things got resolved. Still, I hope that they fix that and choose a better IT team."
good,Very fast paced and busy but super fun environment. Both management and co-workers were great and easy to communicate with. Hardest part of the job was difficult customers especially around the Holidays. Best part about the job was all the happy kids that would come in and out of the store.
good,"I loved the work and the people, both co workers and customers. I was responsible for developing print media and marketing campaigns for the sales force. I tracked sales numbers and developed a data base for the individual territories for the salesmen."
good,"was a fun place to work and i made new friends while i was employed there, the management was excellent and answered any questions"
good,"I was in customer service and i loved this job i was only seasonal. Its a fun environment. The crew is silly and the customers are sometimes ok. I got a lot of people who stole from other stores and tried to get money for it as a ""returned gift"" never fails. Other than that its all good. Funny managers who like to play and work."
good,"I learned a lot from this job, and it was a great first job. I was very close to the store team, and we have all kept in touch routing each other on as we further our careers. Toys R Us is very group oriented and likes to encourage team work and creativity. The benefits are decent and the hours are there if you are a hard worker."
good,"I was in charge of replacing price stickers that had been changed, and finding items. also made signs for sales and items. Enjoyed working here but the work I was doing I was very inexperienced for but I really tried my hardest and won over a lot of management there who really enjoyed me working alongside them."
good,I loved going to work and challenging myself and accepting new goals to reach. The management team always made the work place a fun environment and all staff members were treated fairly
good,Toys R Us was an awesome place to work and learn new work ethics as well as programs. The boss was great with working on schedules and the opportunities in working in other Toys R Us stores was great.
good,"Fun place, lots of changes that made work rewarding. Challenging at the holiday shopping time."
good,"This is one of the best place I ever worked at because I got to be in a working place that catered to the young and young at heart, the place where it had one of a kind items for now and the olden years. Being in a working place where everyone was like family instead of workers. I would still be there if I downsized from 5-6 days, 4-5 hrs. a day to 1 day 4 hrs. I couldn't support a family on 1 day a week so I left with good feelings about the store, not new management. The work was ok and uncomplicated. I also enjoyed all the perks of working in a place that exclusive items that no one else carry."
good,"The environment of the company is upbeat, but the management did not really respect the employees. Great job for a college student just looking for extra income."
good,"A typical day a work was always busy, eventful, and exciting. The team members often joked and had a wonderful time together."
good,"Being that I am still a kid at heart, it was fun working in an environment that is every kids dream store. Learning of new games and technology was cool as well."

good,Great experience overall working at toys r us. Although it was a seasonal job and would've loved to continue working there the experience that i go there was good enough. Everyone there worked together as a team.
good,"It was a good work experience for me because each employee has a goal card to follow and accomplished at the end of the day, which motivate me to go beyond the expected goal. In addition, working with a group in a different department to provide an excellent service to customers was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Would recommend anyone to work and or shop at his fun oriented establishment. Especially if you have children. One stop kids shop!
good,"It was a productive and fun environment. All the staff members were friendly and everyone got along well. The days were short sometimes but when they were the mangers made them worth well. The atmosphere is friendly and inviting to both the employees and customers. There were many times, especially during the holidays where the mangers would bring us free lunches. Every team member work hard to do their part in providing exceptional customer service to each and every guest."
good,"Helping customers find certain items. Answering phones, printing out labels for UPS. "
good,"The management, and co-workers were a pleasure to work with. The work was physically tough, but it is worth it for the compensation."
good,"Had a wonderful time , stocking selves , being greeted by almost everyone. Management kept everything under control. job was very lit"

good,"Fun place to work with a knowledgeable team and supportive management. I love putting smiles on the faces of customers and employees.There's equally opportunity for growth and development. The team works well wit each other and they are always willing to help wherever and whenever they can. The store is big on numbers(making sales, and pushing company initiatives such as credit cards, rewards cards and square trades)."
good,"I personally loved working for this company. I got promoted after two months of being a temporary hire for the holidays. Most of my customers were very pleasant people, who I could come in and treat them as if they were someone I knew by helping them to find items in the store, or find another store that had the item if we didn't have it. I love a fast-pace, multi-tasking type of working environment where I can challenge myself to become better."
good,"Less distractions, more confident and creative assignments. Very cooperative and skillful in getting tasks done properly and in a timely manner. I've learned that you can accomplished anything that you set your mind to doing when working as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was the raises in your salary and the compliments that I received on a well done job performance in completing difficult tasks."

good,I loved it here but they let me go because I didn't went one day when there was people that miss a lot of days and they kept them
good,"We get all things done before closing, we straighten the store and label all missing labels. Some co-workers don't really do much or act like they don't know what to do. But the most enjoyable part of the job is all the smiling faces and all the kids."
good,its good overall just gets real busy during the holidays. i love everything about it from the people to the customers. i also learned how to connect with the customers depending on what they were looking for .
good,Enjoyed everything about the job. Except for it being seasonal. I hoped it would have turned into a permanent position.
good,"Nice job and wonderful management.  Everyone has a smile and speaks every day.  The hardest part about the job would be customers who are demanding about things out of our control and threatens personnel with corporate."
good,"I loved working there and wished it wasn't a seasonal position. I caught on to the flow of the store very quickly it being the holiday season where the store was the busiest. The hardest part of the job overall was dealing with unsatisfied guest, but I always kept a smile and help them in a professional manner. the best part of the job was being able to see the kids happy and enjoying their visit at our store. My coworkers made it easy to get the day by faster everyone got along and was able to keep each other smiling ..."
good,"great atmosphere, people are friendly & great..  a typical work day would be a positive day... all the employers there & management are great... I had the pleasure with one particular boss..... great person.. very under standing guy.. The hardest part of my job is.. i cant go home with all the toys... the most enjoyable part of my job was all the cute little shoppers that would come in... they are the reason i came to work everyday..."
good,I enjoyed working at Toys R US / Babies R US. I learned about many different products. Every day I worked everyone was always smiling and willing to help. My managers were always helpful and willing to teach you anything you needed to know. I got along with all of my coworkers as well. I really enjoyed the people that I worked with as well as our customers. The hardest part of the job for me was learning all the different departments.
good,"A typical work night for me, consisted of heavy unloading of merchandise from delivery trucks in receiving which i enjoy. What this job is teaching me is to plan ahead and make work easier for others. My co-workers were seasonal but we managed to work together fluently. The hardest part of my job was reorganizing a perfectly done face shelving that i previously did. Management was awesome. Great hard working manager who led the team. He expected and received 100% out of his team. Appreciated the fact he was not afraid to get his hands dirty. Unfortunately he left for a store in Kentucky."
good,I enjoyed my days at no matter what job/company I am working for.Things I've learned from the jobs I worked at the most was to be more straight forward and more personal with people.Most of the management that employed my in the past were really nice and friendly towards me and always told me how great of an employee I am.The co-workers I work along side with were really friendly I did my best to build civil relationships with everyone I work with I never worked with someone that I did not like and like wise. The hardest part of any job I've worked was when there a customer that was difficult to work with along means of them raising there voice at me/ a follow co-worker and doing it in such a way that is so belittling and rude.The most enjoyable part of any job I worked at was being able to help the customers and the company I was working in anyway shape or form and completing any task assigned to me big or small.
good,Overall its a happy place to work at especially if you love kids like i do. Very honest workplace and great motivational people.
good,"Fun place to place but the pay is not that great, The management is good and they are very organized."
good,I worked seasonal for two years. there was never a dull moment. the entire management team was the best that I have ever worked with in my 10 years in the workforce. They knew how to lead by example. they were approachable and compassionate. I had an opportunity to work in many different areas and take on multiple roles. Toys R Us is an outstanding place to work.
good,"Always fun to view new items, can be very high paced, guests are friendly and fun to help with gift choices"
good,"I was only working on sunday, part time, I abousetly love that job enjoy and fun put the toy up on shelf and social through family when they come in see where to find the toys.  I'm always stocking up with a new toy shelf or scan around the store to make sure these are right scan for the toy of price. I was only in high school, so i never expernice doing cashier because i wasn't older enough to be.  i love my co-worker they are aweomse!"
good,"superisor where always helpful, fun place to work at, good pay, good benefits"
good,"This was a great first job. Had the best team to work with, and only wish I could return there."
good,"Team atmosphere, Co-workes nice people and hard working."
good,"A typical day at toys r us begins with me punching in then reporting to r zone to get my equipment and seeing if their any new products that i need to know about to day. I learned alot about personal interaction between the the customer and the sales associate"
good,Lovely environment to work in. Co-workers are always friendly to everyone especially customers of course. Usually I would be on registers all day then re shop most of our items to finish up the day. Hardest part of the job would have to be carefully listening to specific instructions from managers however if they would always help you if a co-worker was unsure of what they had to do. Most enjoyable part was making good friends throughout the co workers and getting along well with my managers and making work fun to go to!
good,"I enjoy servicing guest."
good,"I enjoy working here at Babies R Us, its a great place to work at with a great atmosphere"
good,"Same things as other jobs, metrics and monitored performance, upset guests, unpopular policies and team members with completely different back grounds, some of those back grounds that don't understand what hard work is. All the same things that other jobs I have worked have... biggest difference is it is a toy store, with all the toys I played with as a little kid and most of the new toys that I play with now, such as video games and tablets. No matter where you work you will have to deal with certain things that you may not like but the people are usually what makes it worth it to stay or go. Toys, kids and the atmosphere that brings can be a feeling that puts many people in a good mood. However, too much of a good thing can make it a bad thing. ""Season"" is unlike most other jobs and can be completely overwhelming. Little to no room to move inside the building and guests who are automatically upset because they have been waiting in a line that wraps around the building outside."
good,"Assisting guests with the many needs that our company can satisfy."
good,"I have worked for Toys R Us since I completed Berkeley Business school.  This was my first job out of college and I have learned so much about the work force, my skill set and how to be an effective, executive assistant providing support to a leader."
good,Typical day varied. If my shift began in the morning we would unload the trucks and stock shelves until open upon which time i would hit the register and begin assisting customers
good,"Great work environment, friendly, and treat you respectfully. I've managed as many as 500 employees and we had fun working as a team."
good,"I had always wanted to work there so yeah I was excited but I thought working there might change my mind and ill be honest nothing did. Its a great work life, the other workers were friendly and helpful at any time."
good,This is a fun job if the employee lets his/her inner child out. Good management and co-workers. Everything is catered to all things kid's friendly.  High customer service and child awareness is a must.  This is a retail store and a kid's wish come true.  Anyone with great child comprehension will do fine.
good,The store was well organized and the customer's were very respectful.
good,"Everyday would be extermly busy, I was on there temporary for the holiday season. I enjoyed my coutomers and coworks, I learned that people spend alot of money on there children lol. And that holidays bring people together, I felt my coworkers could have had more personality b ut overall they were a joy to be around. The hardest part of the job was letting coustomer down when we didnt have what they were looking for. Most enjoyable would have to be to know that kids will be happy."
good,I enjoyed working for Toys R Us because of the smile I was able to create in the buyer face from assisting in purchasing toys.
good,I enjoyed going to work at Toys R Us. My co-workers are like my family. We all got along very well. My managers were the best!! Making sure our guests were happy when they left our establishment was having a good day. You have to have a good team of associates if you want to have a productive and good day.
good,"A typical day started or ended with a team meeting if I closed or opened. We would check the daily schedule to see where we were put for the day. Front of house team members like myself were either designated to stay at the registers all day or to go on the sales floor and organize or help customers with their needs and to be ready to help at the registers when needed. Management was always amazing and helpful. My co-workers became some great friends as well. Everyone was always happy and enjoyed working at TRU. The hardest part of my job was when a customer had a problem that I didn't have the clearance to help with or if our policy did not permit me to do what they wish. I would always try my best to do everything I could, but due to policy mainly with returns, I was unable to help all the time. The most enjoyable part ofmy job was organizing the entire store. I was quick but precise and always double checked my job. I also loved training the new team members and welcoming a new person to our TRU family."
good,always a fun an friendly environment to work in. management very helpful an considerate an have excellent leadership an management skills
good,"A typical day of work included receiving incoming toys and locating them using rf scanners & deassorting items that were different styles, colors, etc using as400 system. I learned how to use the RF Scanner & a little about KIVA. There wasn't really anything hard about the job, everything was pretty simple. Management was very helpful and always friendly, most days walking threw the warehouse to say Hello to everyone. Co-Workers were also very pleasant. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pace of the work and the friendly environment, they took care of everyone whether seasonal, temp, or year round employee."
good,"Assisting with the day to day running in the Babies buying department. Working on both branded and private label products; my duties include general admin duties, compiling trading figures, competitor shopping. "

The work environment was awesome.The people i met were amazing whom of which i still am friends with today. We started off every morning with a meeting to talk about the day and how we were feeling. To me thats important as an ice breaker.I learned alot about retail and how to run a department.also how to do payroll and count down registers and worj in the money room.The hardest part to mei really didnt find anything hard about it I loved being there.The most enjoyable part of my job was being there in general.I love to do office work and work and help the people such as the employees and customer.
good,"I loved working at toys r us! I advanced from stocker to customer service associate in less than two months. My co-workers were all upbeat lively people and the managers were super cool! The hardest part of the job was dealing with the Black Friday rush. It was fun coming to work and playing with kids, helping people with their registries and stocking all the new stuff"
good,The most enjoyable part of the day was being able to help customers and bringing smiles to the little kids who comes into the store.
good,"Its a great job."
good,"A typical day at Toys R us is not typical. Every day you are doing something different. You may go to work with an agenda in mind. and find that you are need to do something else. "
good,"Cash room was #1 duty to start my day, 2nd was making sure store was ready for our guest, making sure everyone was in place to assure guest received the best service we could provide. Learned passion for giving guest all I could to assure they got just what they was looking for. Hardest part of job was Christmas season, hard for guest to understand that 2 days before Christmas we are sold out of the toy they wanted always tried to replace it with something close to what they needed. "
good,"Fast paced environment, enjoyed the co-workers and had a good time working."

good,"It was seasonal so it went by pretty fast. Very busy! But overall fun, I love seeing the smiles on kids and parents faces when whatever they were looking for was available."
good,"Customer services and sales profit are the number one priorities so having a smile and a good attitude should always be shown on the sales floor.  Meeting sales numbers can be challenging at days.  Limited associates can occur.  Overall, management is very supportive and I felt like I was part of a great family."
good,"It was fun but very hectic, customers would get agitated from the lack of newer products. For a Christmas focused store it was very disheartening to watch so many potentially great customers leave. Also being across the street from the Big ToysRus Didn't work in our favor either. "
good,"A typical day at work would include clocking in and starting with a smile. I ran the cash register, greeted guests, and answered questions to the best of my ability. I learned a lot about toys, and more experience in a retail position. The management was very nice. They helped me when I needed it. My co-workers were basically a new part of the family, they were all very nice and caring, they also helped me with the things I needed more help with. The hardest part of the job was being let go from my seasonal position, I didn't want to leave. I loved my job. The most enjoyable part of the job was working for a paycheck. "
good,work hard stay focused  keep a clean an work place stay with a smile love to work hard at a fast moving pace

good,Everyday at work was a great day for me . The customers were great . I learned how to use a register . The managers were great if i needed any help they were right there. The hardest part of my job would be get the layway out on time. The best part of working there would be the customers every morning i looked forward to see the happy customers.

good,work was exhausting when we had multiple truck unloads day after the next. ive learned how to maintain inventory. employees were very nice and enjoyable. most enjoyable part of the job was being creative in organizing the stock room shelves.
good,Managers are wonderful to work for..... I have learn't so much about the retail business and i like that the manager give you an assignment and is confident that you will do it. The most enjoyable part is the team work.
good,"Great People, lots of customer interaction, and a great environment overall."
good,"I love working at Toys R Us, the atmosphere is always friendly and you can tell that everyone is happy to be there, its an easy job until season hits but when it does your hours sky rockets and the pay check proves it. All Mangers are friendly, outgoing, and motivated, they keep us busty working hard but at the same time having customers best interest in the back of our minds. The hardest part of the job is all the multi tasking but you get used to it after your first week. The most enjoyable part of the job is working around people who love their job and most of all that you love it too."
good,"A typical day at work is upbeat, fast paced, and fun. I have learned about how sales work, how better to interact with costumers, and how to be engaging. Management is pleasant to work with, interactive, encouraging, and motivating. Coworkers are pleasant to work with and hard workers."

good,well i like that i can help people out and that is was a fun job . the people were very nice and loved them all.
good,"It was a lot of fun, but it was over competitive. You have to be in the top 3% to qualify for a real position, which I held for weeks, but I didn't hold it long enough. You're success DEPENDS on signing people up for discount cards and when you're up against all the other new hires who want the ""real job"" it's not easy."
good,From start of my day to the finish the store was packed at all times. I was a seasonal cashier at Christmas time in the biggest toy store in Fresno. It was very fast paced but I was always able to maintain an extremely low stress level. The hardest part of the job was not wanting to spend my check on toys for my daughter. The managers were very helpful and always there to help when you needed them.
good,Helping pregnant mothers shop for their new babies.

good,Great place to work and interact with the public. Maintained a safe and clean work enviroment.
good,hardest part of job is getting merchandise out before store opens.The most enjoyable part of the job is working with all the toys
good,"I loved coming to work being able to assemble toys, put together the theme for the store during holidays or jus for fun. I especially loved seeing the kids come and tear the store apart and begging they parents for a toy it reminded me of how i drove my mom crazy now i could buy my own toys. It was so busy i often didn't get to get a closer bond with my managers i knew they were there, They were like strict parents you only approached when you needed them. The hardest part of the job was closing at nights or holidays when the kids have torn down neat piles or decorations. Most enjoyable part was knowing the newest toys when they came in and being able to purchase them first if you had the money and getting to relate with kids when they come in trying to buy the same toy."
good,The Toys R Us company has high standards in customer satisfaction.
good,This company is very unique in the management and training computer seminars it gives to the employees. On an average day you will use the sales training and techniques it gave you. Product knowledge is taught as well as put on each product and monthly computer seminars are given to the chosen few. Toys R Us and Babies R Us are the same company.
good,Helped customers find what they were looking for as well as what was best for them. I also cleaned up at the end of ever shift. I opened credit cards and reward cards. The supervisors and co-workers were very friendly.
good,"Working for Toys R Us was great! At the time I was just starting to raise a family and just wanted some extra income. While it was great to work at Toys R Us, it was a little hard at times when I closed because we wouldn't get out of there until midnight or so.

There was never any drama, and the mood was usually pretty cheerful. Being a toy store it is easy to keep the mood happy. "

I was able to learn many aspects of the roles in the store, from stocking the shelves to running the front end, and am able to carry over those tools into almost every job I have been able to get into.

good,"This was a fun but intense work environment. Management was very through and did not accept any slacking. Pay was very well. A typical day at work for a cashier would be to open a cash register and handle purchases or returns for most of your shirt and at the end of your shift, you would put away all your returns then go home. the staff was friendly and passionate about their job."
good,very independent place to work hours aren't that good though great staff even better management anytime help was needed I had no hesitations about asking

Each member helped another whenever asked, and managers were never harsh. I learned how to operate a register and how to count cash fast and how to present myself to customers. While the hardest part was restocking as knowing were to return toys to their right position was a pain, anyone who was available to help did help. I wish I could've kept my job."

good,"When I was with this company, our store was fun to work at.  We went through 3 store managers who moved on to bigger and better things and while they were there everything ran smoothly.  Of course, November to January was a challenging time under the best of circumstances, but I was lucky to have good managers there who energized the team and were very organized."

good,"I just loved being able to interact with the children and being able to share in the enjoyment of toy shopping with them and their parents. The position was only seasonal for 2016 but I had a blast. Overall customer service is where my heart is. Regardless whither I'm working with children, young adults or even the elderly or disabled if i can help assist anyone and ease their route through the many day to day obstacles encountered. I'm satisfied"

This work environment is drama free for those who hate petty drama. Training is great, due to people who have been there for 10 plus years ago are very knowledgeable in everything.

good,I think this site will help me to get a job that I really need. So I can take care of my family. I have three kids and applying online isn't something that I had to do when I was working. But now everything is online and when you try to get a job you have all these schools calling you now it's a really big headache.

good,"Great place to work.  Great people to work with.  Everyone always has an upbeat attitude.  I started as just bike builder and have since learned to do so much more now.  I've now worked in just about every aspect I can. The best part is the feeling of accomplishment and recognition you get when completing something, and there is always something to do."
good,It was a great sales job and with it being mostly phones you always make money. The place was very relaxing and if you understood your job then you knew how to get people in and out.

The most challenging part of the job was learning all of the ins and outs of the cash register. Now, however, I am confident when ringing-up customers. I loved spending the season with Toys R Us."
good,"Selling furniture to customers "
good,"Always gave me great hours, Even when I was going through something very scary at the time they helped keep me safe! The staff was very nice too except when they kept trying to make me sell credit cards that I didn't like because they would look over my shoulders and scold me if no one applied for them, like I can't make people get credit cards."
good,"Job was fun, co-workers could help me when i needed it. Not being busy was very hard for me work would seem very long. I liked that I was able to work long hours."
good,i loved overnights working stock crew my coworkers made me feel great every night i worked so professional last year was a blast
good,entrprise bien organisée chacun savait ce qu'il devait faire .Bonne communication entre employés et manager plus possibilité d'évoluer pour celui qui le désire
good,"A typical day at toys r us consists of me recovering the sheleves so they look neat. I also assist customers that are having trouble finding a product. Also I help at the service desk and the cash register, and I answer telephone calls and customer questions."
good,"I started off there as a seasonal employee, working about 10 hours a week, but I ended up getting to be an assistant manager after about two weeks. The management there was always very friendly, personable, could always relate to each other, and cared about the employee. My only issue was with the corporate. They didn't care as much about the employees, more about profit and such. But outside of that, I really miss my job there. Hopefully I can work for them again soon."
good,"Friendly enivornment, Good seasonal work. Basic retail job. Have a lot of slow days. Must work black friday. need better comunication with other employees. walkie talkies are not always the best means of communication."
good,"the most fun part of job is helping customers with decisions on what product they should purchase,and stocking the shelves.Getting what they ask for or finding products they couldn't find."
good,"worked with numerous of customers"
good,I enjoyed going into work each day. The people were friendly as well as the customers. I learned to assist children customers. My managers were understanding when I got pregnant and was sick at work. The hardest part of the job was standing on the hard mats at the registers. The most enjoyable art of my job was helping customers find a specific toy or item.
good,"Each day would depend on if we had a truck or not. If we did then we'd unload the truck using a convey belt to load pallets with boxes. Once that was done we'd commence with our normal day which was stocking items to their shelves. With that there were times we'd work store hours and take out back stock, lift heavy things for costumers, and push carts back to the store. This job taught me all about retail and  a lot. Management was the best, they really worked with me, and encouraged me in my goals.  My co-workers were more like friends, we spent a lot of time together, it was no question I could rely on them on or off the workplace. Hardest part was leaving, and I enjoyed the whole job throughout. GREAT PLACE TO WORK!!"
good,"While working at Toys R Us, I got to indulge my inner child. I interacted with the many children that came through asking about video games, giving advice to their parents on which games would be better for their age group. Being an avid gamer myself, I happily helped everyone get a better understanding of the games they were interested in."
good,You are always on your toes. No down time especially during holiday season when sales are up. Very comfortable atmosphere
good,toys r us is an excellent company to work for. They have good benefits and they also are flexible with their working hours.
good,"Very fun job, great people! Hectic around black friday, but retail always is. Customers are a varied mix, but usually very friendly. Store clean & well stocked."
good,"Excellent Job training, environment was awesome. I would not mind working for them again. The managers are great and helpful. Long term Workers are also just as nice."
good,"Toys ""R"" Us is a fantastic place to work, the managers and supervisors are get at training and understanding if an emergency takes place."
good,"management was understanding"
good,"Perfect company to gain experience and ""wear many caps"" as management will encourage you to take on many tasks on a weekly basis. Team dynamics within the building will determine whether you will enjoy or hate the experience though."
good,"A typical night at work would be me working 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. I would start by loading the boxes off the truck onto U-Boats for a specific area of the store depending on what kind of toy it is. Then I would be taking boxes out to the floor so the toys can be stocked and the boxes can be broken down. After that I would either help stock shelves and break down boxes or I would collect the broken down boxes and take them to the compacter. On some days the managers would call my name to pick orders for the shipping team, or they would call me to box toys for shipping. At the end of the night/morning I would normally load the boxes being shipped onto a UPS truck. This all would involve heavy lifting and fast paced movement. I could say that the management at Toys R Us is very good and friendly. They are your friend but still your boss, as I think it should be. However, I cannot say the co-workers were the best. A lot of people treated the job like a joke which I did not like so I tended to try and work as hard as possible and communicate only when needed. The hardest part of my job was knowing I might not get kept after the season. I cannot say anything was hard to me while working at Toys R Us. I loved it there. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to listen to music while doing most activities there. I can honestly say Toys R Us was the best job I ever had."
good,"A typical day would include emptying the freight truck, organizing the packages according to the floor plan for shelving the toys. We proceed then to open the every box and either shift or fill in a space for such toy(s). On the job I became more accustomed to organizing with a small amount of space, I learned how to make a bale, which is  the waste product of the cardboard dumpster bins compacted together and ready for transport. But aside from tactical hands on learning, I also became more aware that life is too short to take things so seriously, and that we should enjoy our time wherever we are in that moment. This realization came to me when seeing a wide range of children interacting with their parents and vise versa. "
good,I work this job while in college and I do have to say it was by far one of the funniest job I have ever had.  The manager at my property was great and it being a toy store there was always a child like vibe in the air.
good,CO workers were easy to get along with and there was no workplace drama. The managers were all nice and helpful and around 24/7. The schedule was flexible. A typical day was rining as a cashier and doing reshop on the sales floor and answering customers questions.
good,"A typical day at work involved maintaining the store, manning the register, assisting manager and customers, taking calls and at times watching the store. I learned how to listen to my gut and take initiative. Co-workers were fun and friendly"
good,"Typical day was very busy."
good,"awesome place to work, loved opening up stored and going to other stores to help out"
good,"This job is a very fun job around the holidays, the store is packed and children are running around everywhere. It almost makes you feel young again.I learned that working in toy stores require allot of cleaning up to do. I wouldn't say anything bothered me because staying busy is something I love to do. The basic things that are done daily are cleaning up toys off the floor, helping customers with questions, and ringing up the belongings of customers."
good,"Out of all the jobs i have been at has been experiencing customer service. I have worked in a lot of retail places dealing with customers and that is something I enjoy doing, I enjoy interacting with new people."
good,"I enjoyed working at Toys R Us. A typical day at work was usually me working as a cashier. If things were slow, I would walk around the store and see if anyone needed any help and organize shelves. I learned a lot working at Toys R Us. I learned how to work in teams and also how to work by myself when it was necessary. I learned how to communicate better with not only customers but fellow co-workers. The co-workers that I worked with were all amazing and very helpful in helping me learn the routine. The hardest part of the job was learning how the register worked so that I could cashier. After a couple days though I finally understood it and felt very comfortable using it. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find items that they were looking for."
good,great place to worked they teach you everything the right way and are very team oriented.
good,"Lovely LOVELY work atmosphere . "
good,fun and easy people to work with. very easy to approach them to ask for help
good,really nice to work her as you will find that you could work here permanently and will never be mistreated.
good,"A typical day at work is a guess pretty much. Even though i was assigned to work as a cashier and be in the front, I also do recovery which is putting back what customers decided they did not want when they came to the registers. What i learned was to be fast because i was doing multiple things. The management is good but sometimes i have to repeat myself when i say i can't work at this time because of school. The co-workers are nice. Haven't had any problem with them. The hardest part of the job was asking the customers if they wanted to save 15% on their total purchase today by applying a Toys R Us credit card. Most of them would say no and some would even get mad. The most enjoyable part of the job is I can sometimes play with the merchandise. Toys R Us the only place you can do that."
good,A typical day at work would start out in the morning cleaning and straightening up the aisles. Then after a couple hours it would begin to get busy which is when I would begin cashiering. I learned how to work a cash register as well as how to stock shelves. The hardest part of the job was working during Black Friday because it was so busy. The most enjoyable part was getting to know my co-workers and being a part of a different kind of team.
good,"My typical day at was was mildly busy. I was eight almost nine months pregnant when I started working during the holiday season. I was a cashier and was required to be on my feet for long periods of time. That wasn't an issue for me, but the heat coming from the computer system underneath the register cause me to constantly over heat and have to sit down for  five to ten minutes each time I got too hot."
good,"Mi experiencia en esta empresa es estupenda, el trabajo era constante y mucho movimiento, atención personalizada a cada instante. Mucho compañerismo."
good,I worked for Toysrus for 5 years and loved my job. The people and customers were great and had a lot of fun working there
good,"Toys'R'us taught me a lot about being professional and dealing with a lot of responsibility in the work place. On a typical workday I am in charged of the entire front end of the store. It is my duty to make sure all cashiers our daily quota in credit cards, insurances, and memberships. I also assist other stores transferring items over or making guest orders over the phone. I enjoy the work environment because we all work as a team. I enjoy meeting and interacting with different guest that come into our store. The hardest part has to be dealing with the guest that do not want to take no for an answer but it has become a lot easier to deal with. The most enjoyable part has to be helping guest get what they need whether it is a return, shipment, or a phone order."
good,Helped the store manager with the daily running of the store and to hit daily sales
good,"Management was more than understanding about certain situations. Being that I was a seasonal member, I seen the store at its best and worst. It was a very emotional time though. I had fun and I learned about different people and cultures."
good,I liked working here. Management was great. I mostly had fun meeting guest (customers) and helping them on the sales floor
good,Dealt with a lot of people who needed help or had questions regarding any toy or item they wanted. I learned so much about toys and shaped myself into a high seller. I enjoyed this job so much because of how dependent people were on me. I always knew what to do and took control of a sale to offer more for the consumers money. my co workers made my day easier because we all shared the same hours and liked having extra helping hands when we needed it. the hardest part of the job was having to work longer hours because there weren't enough workers scheduled during rush hour times. the managers were all great to work with but sometimes they were more pressured for goals and sales rather than work on what they needed to.
good,A typical day for me at Toys R Us would be standing at a cash register of the floor managers choice and checking out my guests and fast and friendly as I could. The co workers here where fun to work with and I enjoyed working for this company a lot.
good,I can always remember having wonderful experiences and relationships as a former employee at Toys R Us. On a given day I interact with so many different people of ALL ages! The best part of my job was either the kids or being able to feel like a kid! Working in customer service taught me plenty about problem solving and I enjoyed it. The not so great part of my job was people who I could not satisfy but I guess you cannot please everyone. The interaction between co-workers and management were rock solid and awesome
good,"Uma empresa dinamica e com um diversidade de pessoas de varios lugares do mundo."
good,"A great company to gain experience in retail.  Hectic holiday season, but great coworkers."
good,"Greeting and assisting guests to fulfill their shopping needs for the day.

good,"Working at Babies R US is fun and enjoyable place to work at. From the customers to the co-workers your sure to have a pleasant day. A typical day at Babies R US is eventful, your day may start off working the register the leads into working 2 departments at the same time by the end of the day. If your already working the floor your dealing with 5-7 people at a time looking for the same items so your always running in cirlces from one department to the next. Management is always on point with whats going on in the store. Management is always available to customers and workers anytime of the day to help solve problems. The most enjoyable part of of the day is when your demonstrating the toys or security items being sold  to soon to be parents, and the seminars that are given through out the month.Seeing the excitement on the customers faces are always a plus!"
good,"Fast pace work environment with a heavy customer flow. I handled a lot of tourist and locals which helped me learn to deal with a wide variety of personalities. Although there were moments when toys r us was not very busy there was never a shortage of things to do, from maintaining the show room floor to assisting in the stock room. The most enjoyable part of my job was assisting customers. "
good,"I have only worked at this particular Toys R Us store, but it was a great experience.  I really enjoyed the people I worked with and worked for.  I rarely post on these sites, but felt compelled to for this one.  Any one would be lucky to be part of this store."
good,"I Learned To Be Patient With Rude Costumers ,I Learned To Work The Cash Register And Do Stocking I Also Learned How To Do Inventory."
good,Had a blast assisting customers. Management team was always willing to teach crew members new things
good,"well organized, and easy training. customer service is top notch . and fast pace."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers find things they are in search of, which help you learn the store and what merchandise is no longer available."
good,Assisting customers with their baby registery if boy or girl or multiples. You get that feeling that you want a baby of your own or not if it is for you. Make sure that all expecting mothers or all comfortable in everyway possible. Fair as can be but look out for themselves so stand watch. Heavy lifting on your back and knees and look out for those that might pull a fast one on you. Knowing that you helped a expecting mother with her baby registery.
good,-Coordinated incoming and outgoing freight orders
good,a typical day at work consisted of completing transactions and satisfying the customers. Management was okay. the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. the most enjoyable part of the day was seeing a customer leave satified and with a smile on their face.
good,It was very interesting meeting the guests who came into the store and help them find what they were looking for.
good,I am motivated by new experiences putting up shelving and merchandising to tell a story was much more challenging than just having a few toys in the store. We also demonstrated the toys.
good,Estoy muy contenta con esta empresa.
good,This is a great place to wrok for is your not looking for anything serious. Great management team aswell as team members.
good,"Typical day at work was fairly simple: I clocked in and went right into the ship-from-store department, I found all the toys on the pick lists, packaged them and shipped them off. I learned how to manage my time to make sure I picked the items, boxed them, and process the orders before 6pm. If the all orders are completed before 6pm, I helped out in Front of house on register or doing reshop (restock). My co-workers made me feel comfortable the were really nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job was learning how to run the ship-from-store department by myself in a timely manner. The most enjoyable time was once I learned how to run the ship-from-store department the amount of respect I've received from my co-workers and managers for running it in a professional manner."
good,Was fun and memorable. Learned how to stock shelves and help customers professionally. The management were great teachers and I loved everything about the job. The hardest thing was working all those hours on black friday.
good,"What a great place to work ! coworkers, management are all very nice. You are trained well and your work efforts are appreciated.The most enjoyable part of the job is you get to try the toys out and watch the kids have fun in the store. Hardest part of job is climbing the ladders up high, telling a child shopper we don't have that ...."
good,I just had a great time working at Toys'R'Us from the Mangement team to the team member's
good,"I absolutely loved working here, the people i worked for and the people i worked with were just fantastic. I knew what my job was from the moment i clocked in till the moment i clocked out, my training here was the best within 2 weeks i completely understood my job and responsibilities. I learned new cash register and computer skills and spent most of my day utilizing these skills. The best part of the job was working with the customer's."
good,Would still be with Toys R Us if the job wasnt outsourced. 21 great years there.

I learned how to work as a team effectively. The management are wise and sympathetic people who understand our daily duties and responsabilities and work to train us in a fun way. The coworkers are the best, everybody gives their 100 percent. The hardest part of the job is the black friday!!! The most enjoyable part is being able to help parents get exactly what their children want."
good,Preparation for REC meetings.
good,I spent most of my days getting customers to look at me and smile to take their picture its always a main priority to get everyone in the picture but the kids are the most important. I learned how to better interact with people and become more outgoing. Management and my co-workers helped me understand the job and have fun with it. The hardest part would be missing a photo and having to retake it but I enjoyed bringing a smile to a customers face as much as possible.
good,"A typical day at work was like any other day I have, Very productive ! I learned that in most situations the customer is always right and the most important thing is to satisfy the customers. Making sure you meet there needs. My managers were as they should be always on task and on top of everyone doing there work and job correctly. They were also very fair. The hardest part to me was not being able to work as much as I wanted to, Seeing as tho i was only part time. The most enjoyable part were the store meetings or get togethers. I could give my opinion on certain things people or situations and i can be myself. I was comfortable at all three work places."
good,"I absolutely LOVED working at Toys R Us. My other co-workers were always thier to help me if I had any kind of question, even if they seemed silly at the time. I was able to work on all parts of the store as well as learned alot of new skills that I now use in my everyday life.

I learned a lot about retail and up selling. I had great managers, and there were a lot of them. I had a lot of great co workers who i became very close with. The hardest part was learning the systems and having thousands of people coming in and out of the store. I loved meeting new people and I loved working on the register."

good,Toys 'R' Us was a good job for me while I was still very young and in high school. It worked around my schedule. The management was very organized and on top of things.
good,"I enjoyed going to work because the people I worked with helped to make it an enjoyable experience. Our managers pushed us to perform to the best of our abilities and helped us out when we struggled to reach our daily goals. The hardest part of the job was trying to make sure every guest left the store happy, some guests were a little harder than others to please. The best part was when you were able to help someone and you could tell by the look on their face that you just made their day. It was the best job I've ever had."

The job was flexible to your schedule, everyday there was always a challenge with the public. But I took that in good spirit and thought about being helpful and a blessing to others. I enjoyed working with my managers, but sometimes we didn't agree on certain things but that's all part of life.

I processed all broken merchandise and sent it back to the warehouse. I often completed sales transactions, returns, and interacted with customers throughout the store."
good,many jobs at our location was hands on training so when you were moved to the floor by yourself it would be a smooth and easy work flow making the teams productivity sky rocket.
good,A typical day at work started off by me entering at 9 in the morning and getting setup to work as either a cashier or on the floor helping customer. One of the things I learned was how to use a cash register and how to deal with angry customers. Another aspect I really liked was the managers because they were always helpful and kind.
good,Toys r us is a good company with very helpful managers & supportive workers that provide you with all your work needs. If you have a question it will definitely get answered & also have awesome customers.
good,"I loved to be the Geoffrey mascot for kids birthday parties . The supervisors and managers there were fun and were good managers . We kept bouncing around store managers because non of them would stick it out and the store managers we had were kind of lazy and didn’t do much of anything . They didn’t really know how to use there numbers they had for discounts and other things. One of the store managers didn’t know they had a key to the cash register drawers so I had to help him out and find the right key and help him get the drawers out of the registers. It was a Blast though to work for Toys R Us it was just a shame that the company went out of business , it was really fun there. That  was my favorite store and my favorite job. I loved it there very much. It was a blast to put smiles in kids faces and do there birthday announcements for them when they came into the store on there birthday."

good,"I learned how to communicate with customers and my coworkers, how to work a cashier, and how to bag items. A typical day at work would be me clocking in, getting a walkie talkie and looking to see what department I was assigned to for the day, and tidying up that department at the end of my shift."
good,Constant workflow on weekends but very calm during the week. Management was very friendly and accommodating to my schedule. Lots of walking and standing for extended periods of time.

Co workers were amazing and we communicated very well. Working around children was also fun and interesting. Overall this place taught me so much.
good,Was a really good place to work with a great atmosphere. Really friendly and helpful management team and loads of good colleagues to work alongside. Also very felxible with hours and overtime.
good,I enjoyed my time with TRU since it was open about how you did your job. You weren't stuck in one place and there's alot to do. It wasn't often that the day didn't go by with ease. The main problem was that the job doesn't pay much for someone trying to live in the state of California.

good,management were very helpful always willing to teach you. learn a lot. love helping people get what they wanted. good place to work for.Christmas hard
good,Everything was new to me at the beginning but once I got to no everybody and got to no my way around the store I was good people respected me as I did to them  I had my days but my fellow team members brought me up.
good,Empresa com otimo ambiente de trabalho excelente equipa de gerência grande flexibilidade
good,"I had to interact with a lot of children , it was a very fun experience because i was already doing something I did anyways except I was getting paid for it"

good,Really had a great time working here and would have recommended to anyone. Great people in a very wonderful  work environment. It's really too bad that they closed the doors.
good,"Toys R Us was my first job at as 16 year old and personally it was the perfect job, the hours were nice, all of my co-workers were very sweet and it was not too stressful."
good,Since I worked for toys r us it has been nothing but exciting and excellent to me. This place is Definitely a great place to work at! Would love for it to come back! You never get bored there is always something for you to do!
good,It was a wonderful place to work. I worked for ToysRus for 20 years until they closed there doors.It  was a place you could go to be a kid again. It allowed you to go to just look or experience the new toys as the store got them.
good,i was very happy to work for toys r us because it gave me more experience to go into this world and make a difference for all the people in the surrounding areas.
good,"I worked for TOYS R US for almost 18 great years!! I enjoyed working for the company. It was great working with the children and the parents that were looking for a toy or baby item but unfortunately the  CEO ran the company into the ground and put it out of business., 33,000 employees lost their jobs."
good,"This was my second job and I loved it! Great management, very relaxed and super fun place to work. Made amazing friends and everyone worked as a team. I would’ve stayed here for a long time if it wasn’t for the company going out of business."
good,Working at ToysRUs was always a new experience every day. I learned how to work in a customer service field along with working with children and elders alike. Management was kind and my coworkers were always fun and ready to work. Got to be a ToysRUs kid
good,"I worked for Babies""R""Us, a branch of Toys""R""Us, for a year and a half and it was the best experience of my life. Of course I would run into irate guests and poorly motivated coworkers, but you can find that at any job. Overall the company was a fun and energetic place to work. Making customers happy was an honor and being able to make children and babies smile by hosting events, telling stories, or dressing as the iconic Geoffrey the Giraffe. I love this company, the skills it taught me, the people it introduced me to, and the experiences it gave me. I will never grow up, I'm a Toys""R""Us Kid"
good,This company is no longer exists. They recently shut the doors earlier this year. It was a great company to work for and you got to meet a lot of new people.
good,Enjoyed seeing the new toys that were coming out - to prepare for Christmas for nieces and nephews. not permanent hours so some weeks didn't have any work
good,So sad to see it closed but glad i was able to work there. Amazing associates and management. If i ever needed help with something they were there. Was only there seasonally but they made me feel as i have been working there forever
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Toys R Us. The work environment was very professional, but we all treated each other as family. Working there helped me to learn to be more productive, be more efficient with my time, and it also helped me to increase my ability to handle multiple tasks at one time."
good,It was a great learning experience for me as an assistant manager even though I had little experience in the field I was still given a chance to expand my skills and abilities. It was tough for a young person with little experience but I work well under pressure and I excelled at my duties.
good,"Fast paced day with ""adventures"" everyday. Always something new to learn. Interaction with customers and associates. Learning the ropes on managing a store and writing schedule/payroll. Handling the cash office with daily deposits/ weekly. Preventing loss and handling theft. Favorite part of job was the Christmas chaos and the feel in the air."
good,"We all got along great.We would help customers out with problems and help them when needed.The hardest part of the job was keeping"
good,I honestly liked this job. It sucks that they had to shut down the company because now children don’t really have a plau store they can actually go to and find almost anything there. Other then that i emjoyed working here.
good,Serving customers is a breeze with the amount of support offered. If you are unsure of a of what a customer needs a simple phone call can connect you with another staff member who is more than happy to come and assist you. The management team were highly flexible with staff members with their commitments outside of work. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming to work each day surrounded by some of the nicest people you could meet from the new person who had been recently hired to the store manager who had several years under their belt.
good,"Toys r Us was a wonderful company to work for. Very sad as it closed its doors yesturday. Going to work every day with a clear head , being positive giving it my all. Making sure it was always a happy place for our customers to come and shop. I love working with people and giving my job 100%."
good,"gave me the opportunity to learn everything i could, worked as a team, all cultures worked together and united as one,  hardest part was starting out; you have to take the initiative to learn, connecting with everyone and becoming family."
good,A typical day at work consisted of cleaning each isle and restocking. The hardest part of the job was coping the fast paces. What I’ve learned from this job is team work and instant problem solving.
good,Literally the best job I've had. i was only seasonal but i wish i lasted there because it made me feel like a little kid and free. The customer were amazing and i had some of the funniest co-workers.
good,Fast pace fun environment.  Flexible hours and shifts.  Many different areas to learn new job skills. Holiday help always had new and exciting training possibilities.
good,"Es un trabajo duro, con mucho movimiento, y con unos jefes que te exigen, pero que tambien se exigen a ellos mismos, y valoran tu trabajo, haciendotelo saber y sentir."
good,Excellent environment with friendly and helpful employees. Priceless to see the excitement on children's faces as they enter the store and explore the isles.
good,Had a great team and had good work life balance 10 months out of the year. The company had great benefits and  I have seen a lot of people come and go and when they come back always say they miss the team.  People make it worth coming back to  TRU. Great company till it wasn't.  Had a great team and loved my job.
good,i did the Christmas seasonal over night stocking job for toys'r'us and it was a easy fast passed job. boss was lenient as long as you stayed on schedule.
good,Great place to work. Supportive local managers. Improved my customer service abilities. Great people to work with. Really enjoed the interaction with fellow staff members
good,"Be happy to work in toy store helping families , always enjoy coming into work. Great to put a smile on a kids face. Everyday working here helping kids is Christmas in their eyes"
good,"When I moved down to Utah from Alaska, I was out of a job. So, I started to applying to places and Toys R Us just so happened to be one of those places. I got hired right on the spot, because they believed I was right for the job. I was originally just going to be there as an overnight seasonal associate, and I showed them the most improvement and they decided to keep me after. The job there is very fun, I get to be with kids all the time, I loved helping people. The trucks were always a good workout for me. I am very sad to see that the company is going out of business. I would do anything to keep this job, but I unfortunately cannot. Working here has been an opportunity of a lifetime"
good,my short time working with the company was fun filled and very productive. i enjoyed getting to know all my coworkers and the customers were always very friendly.
good,"*Fun work environment "
good,"If you can find a Toys'R'Us that is still hiring for long-term employment, you check them out."
good,"I love working at Toys R Us because the environment is great , you being able to see all the kids coming and having fun. passing out birthday hats and specials for children' birthdays. there's POSITIVE vibes everywhere."
good,I enjoyed working there because it gave me the opportunity to be like a kid again by being able to play with some toys from time to time to display the item.
good,"the average day is great nothing stressful as front end, alot of customer interaction but its fun!"
good,"this was a fun place to work and see all of the customers come in a help to improve their day, especially the children.  However the company made some poor financial decisions causing them to go bankrupt."
good,"Great place to work"
good,Toys R Us was a good place to work.I worked part time and the hours suited me.The management always helped if there was probems and all the staff was friendly. Enjoyed working with customers and tried to be as helpful as possible with their needs
good,"I enjoyed working at Toys R Us for over 5 years, and I'm sad to see the company being liquidated. Toys R Us Headquarters was a fun place to work. We were surrounded by toys and worked with a great group  of people. I will miss the workplace, miss my teammates, but most of all I will miss the toy stores."
good,"A typical day at work on a truck day starts at 4 or 6 am, we unload the truck and work it all out before the store opens.  Once we open the store the focus is all on customer service and making sure the customer finds what they are looking for.  We have all types of training available to the employees to learn all aspects of the workings of the store so you can move up within the company.  They believe in training their employees so they can move up the ladder with in the company.  We offer on line ordering, in store pick up and ship to home."
good,"As an employee of Toys R Us, the years I served has given me  the opportunity to advance myself in various  areas.  Being  a team player. A great workplace of culture."
good,"I would highly recommend working here if the company wasn't going out of business."
good,"Teams really push you to do your best. Managers support and provide feedback on increasing productivity and continuing to do your best. Employees really create a fund and family work environment, making it a pleasure to go to work."
good,"Review hours, schedules and results from previous days business. Provide customer service throughout the day. As a store manager you must work closely with the management team."
good,I loved working for Toys R Us. If it was not going out of business I would still like to work for them. I am just doing this to fulfill the minimum requirements of this thing.
good,"I love the people I work with and the customers we help.  It's been a pleasure and an honor to work for such an iconic brand.  I wish that the company wasn't going under or I would continue to work here, perhaps in a different role."
good,Great company to work for. Pay was also good. I had a lot of opportunity to work in different markets which made my job that much more desirable. The most fun was playing games with customers and kids.
good,I enjoyed working here even if it was just for the holidays
good,It's a Saturday at noon the store is flooding with people there are multiple events going on. Very hectic every where in the store. I've learned over the years to keep calm no matter the stress level in the store. Usually the management never comes out of the office unless there is a serious issue. There is a lot of friendly relationship throughout the staff of the store. Trying to please everyone when they are trying to return things. When you have made the customers happy and found the items they were looking for.
good,"I loved my position, fun, fast paced, had the pleasure of working with many of our customers and was able to build a great relationship with many of them."
good,Toys R Us had a great team and was always on top of the employees helping us stay focused and prepared for the work.  I enjoyed my time there working for the company and look forward to going back for the seasonal position.
good,"Toys R Us is a fun place to work, with new opportunities for customer interaction every day.  Children and adults alike are able to have fun and play with the merchandise and team members in the store.  The management is fun-loving and are typical ""Toys R Us kids.""  It's true what they say:  they have never grown up.  The most difficult part of the job is straightening up the store after closing for the day, but the task is worth it, when you compare the fun that's been had throughout the day."
good,Being happy and and having a positive attitude is important at my job. I have learned to be a better example for my team when you treat people well they work very hard for you. I enjoy working with customers fixing issues they may have. The upper management at TRU they are awesome in helping if I have questions about something. The hardest part of my job is not being able to fix something on the store level and having to reach out to the 800 number you can set on hold for over a hour.  I enjoy the smiles on parents faces when they leave happy and satisfied with getting the best customer service my team and I could deliver.
good,"Fast paced, make new friends, grateful company to work for, if I had the chance I would go back 2 work there great benefits, management were fair reasoning was good"
good,Toys r us was very flexible and all the employees were friendly management really worked with you to the best of there abilities to make sure everything was good for you.
good,"As a cashier, i learned many things with videos games, bikes/motor sports, and clothing. Communication is key, asking how they're day is, if everything they find was okay, or if you could help them with anything else."
good,"I really like the interview; they make it fun, although, they do observe on how you would approach a customers and what would you say about their items to see what level the would be employee is and how to improve them. Then they will interview one person at a time; at least that is what they did when I first started."
good,"Wish I couldve worked there longer, but the holiday season ended. The management at the gastonia store was very efficient in keeping the store clean and running smoothly."
good,come in and achieve your daily goals while catering to customers. i learn that you have to be optimistic and patience and understanding to work at tru due to customers that may come in from a hard day.
good,I worked for my Toys R Us as seasonal for 2 holidays and very much enjoyed it. They were very nice and trained me (my first job) for having amazing customer service.
good,"workplace culture was like family."
good,It was my favorite job in the last 5 years of me working. My supervisors were amazing and absolutely cared for the company and their employees. They took care of us.
good,"I’ve worked at ToyRus and loved it, Unfortunately it was seasonal. Widest  and cleanest warehouse I’ve ever seen, they also great team leaders and manager. I recommend the night shift to whoever love warehouse job. Feel free, they are watching your stuff for you. "
good,"Una muy buena empresa para trabajar, muy buen ambiente y trabajo en equipo muy arraigado, los supervisores muy amables."
good,"The management team and staff were great! The environment is very comfortable and welcoming. Overall, great place to work! I definitely would recommend this as a place of work."
good,"Toys R US is a nice place to work. However, they do not offer enough work hours for a person that has a family to provide for.  This is also only a seasonal job so when the season is over your employment is over as well."
good,"Great place to work, you can never be down when you are surrounded by toys, kids and babies. Fast paced during season, very busy so time flies! awesome crew at Goodyear, AZ location. Organized and very hands-on and helping to all."
good,Toys r us was a very fun place to work. The workers are very helpful and fun to be around.  They have a lot of incentives and different ways of having fun on the job but also getting the job done.
good,"Awesome staff and really friendly. My hours have been from 6-2 or 7-3 with weekends off. This isn't typical of the store, just of my position. I like the job and its pretty easy to learn."
good,"great establishment, fun work environment, seeing the smiles on all the kids faces is a plus and really made my day. I hate that is was a seasonal job"
good,"Great atmosphere, wonderful staff, pay was decent, only downfall was the amount of hours that had to be spread out between at least 40 associates. Overall a very great job."
good,I've enjoyed my experience so far working here. Its a good seasonal job you get a pay raise the closer to Christmas it gets. If you have another job they are willing to work with you.  There is a chance you can be hired on permanently after seasonal.
good,"great place to work.  lots of advancement, good pay, hard work, friendly coworkers, challenging, flexible hours, always willing to teach and learn new tasks"
good,Loved everything about working at toys r us express . i worked every year seasonal in wichita falls as a second job. everybody was awesome. Especially Marlene!! WFTX
good,working night shift you will need to be on your toes and moving fast to stock the store. It can be a little hard at times but overall if you like toys and seeing what new ones are coming out you will enjoy the work. plus the discount is not bad at all it stacks with all others.
good,"Non-stop, fun filled days can include putting stock out, helping customers, greeting customers at the door and helping to break down deliveries. Each area of the store typically has 2 supervisors and a manager, meaning that you have a clear task to do each day."
good,with funny and enjoyable job environment .who are working there have huge experience  about customer service and good management. client come to the store first enjoying with their family then to buy.
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo. Buen pago, inestabilidad en los dias de trabajo"
good,"It was a great job I worked a the service desks and i.really liked the job. I hated having to leave,just glad I have that experience on my rese itbwill.always but a company think too work for"
good,"Everything was great there, but the hours were not easy when I lived 45 minutes away."
good,enjoyable environment and fun place to work.I enjoyed playing with the toys when demonstrating how they worked to potential buyers of the products.ITs a friendly place to work
good,The job was very fun all the employers made it fun because if you didn't you would have a hard time getting through the night. Management was strict but it was only for good work.
good,When i worked at toys r us it was during the holidays. So it was always busy busy busy. They would always call me in on my days off they needed alot of help. But i made alot of hours and got paid overtime so i didnt mind. The staff was really fun to work with.
good,Toys R Us / Babies R Us is a great place to work for your first job or as a seasonal position. But unless you plan on managing these retail jobs are not meant for long term. It kept me above water and gave me great experience.
good,All in all I learned something new everyday as a seasonal worker i simply enjoy going to work the worst parts was when the seasonal was over and everyone had to leave because of hours
good,A day at work was always fun. Everyday there was something new. The co-workers were extremely nice and assistive. It was quite easy to work there. The hardest part of the job would be keeping the store in order during the day when customers misplace items.
good,"This was one of my first jobs many years ago. I worked at night stocking the store shelves. The job was pretty nice, I kept busy during work hours. So time went by really fast. Good people to work with."
good,"I meet a lot of nice people I enjoy working  with the public, I ran the cash register, worked on the floor. greeting a lot of customers."
good,great I enjoyed working here the people are very friendly in a fast paced environment. I recommend the job to any one starting to enter the workforce.
good,Working here was fast paced and fun. Loved the customers and staff was nice. I would not work here again as there was not many chances to advance in company.
good,"Excellent culture and environment."
good,I loved working here seasonally. I truly enjoyed making the customers happy for the holidays. The interviews were really fun.   By working every year I was already trained.
good,"i loved working here however i would only recommend working here seasonally. during the christmas season you can make great money at toys, however after the holiday season, hours are cut and you are basically put on call."
good,"Fun place to work. Most days there is a constant flow of customers. Always a joy to see children's faces when they see the newest, coolest toys. Always something to do, stocking, organizing, ringing up customers,"
good,I liked working at toysrus even though it was just a short amount of time due to it being a seasonal postion. I feel like it taught me a lot about new merchandise as well as communicating with people
good,at this company we were just like family. we took care of the customer and the company took care of us. I loved working for my managers and this compay.
good,"I was only there for a seasonal job that was graveyard, but everything was fast paced I was always moving staff is helpful and friendly. Graveyard can be tasking if you want to keep a social life. haha but overall I enjoyed working there."
good,I had a blast working for the company it's just hard to balance their schedule around with mine while I was in high school. Could be more nicer in the building
good,"Estoy muy agradecida a Toys""R""us por haberme brindado la oportunidad de acceder al mercado laboral y aprender de grandes profesionales. Sin duda alguna, ha sido un año muy intenso, enriquecedor y de crecimiento personal. Estar en este puesto, atendiendo a un público, me ha ayudado mucho a ser una persona más extrovertida, sociable y amable. He adquirido gran cantidad de conocimietos: control de stocks, atención al cliente, realizar pedidos on line, control y gestión de tienda, reposición, apertura y cierre de tienda, cobros y devoluciones, alarmar mercancía, recepcionar y puntear mercancía."
good,"I enjoyed working for Toys ""R"" Us. The majority of the customers were very friendly. I typically would spend the day checking out customer purchases and returns. Great sales team and management.  Everyone made you feel like you were part of a family."
good,"Considering I worked seasonal time, everything was super fast moving. It was a pace that I had no problem with. Every single time I  worked, went by smoothly. Management and workplace culture was such a friendly environment, easy to get along with- very outgoing. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with unhappy customers because, I have a real soft heart. I feel bad for customers that didn't have a great experience while in our store. But the most enjoyable part was, lunch breaks. Our management is just that awesome and buys lunch for everyone. And when I say friendly and outgoing, I REALLY mean it. My co workers were all laid back and all had their own sense of humor. Learning to do my tasks as a cashier wasn't a hassle at all. My supervisors and managers are great teachers."
good,"it was a great job, decent hours, amazing employees. it was only a seasonal job so it was fun while it lasted. i did apply again after a manager asked me to and i was never called back though."
good,"-Coworkers were great "
good,Providing customers with fast quick outstanding service while maintaining jobs duties and tasks at hand. Handling online carry away items and managing shippment coming in
good,"Fun environment, a lot of hands on help. They never stop training you and working with you if you need the help. Great managers who are always readily available and help out when needed. Great HR who always help. Just a great place to work."
good,"Nice friendly coworkers,friendly management,great environment to work,loved helping customers find things,loved seeing all the new toys come in and stock them."
good,Fun knowing all the new toys that are popular.playing with toys. Free lunches from management. Others workers smilely and happy and helpful. Love. Beening cashier.
good,"Compensation is on the low side. However, they have the best management team. You are rewarded for jobs well done. Everyone is friendly and nice. I really enjoyed working there. Christmas and Holiday time was hard because of long hours."
good,I worked during the holiday season. It was never a dull day. Everyone was always excited and having fun. It a fast pace during the season but it's easy to keep up
good,"Very fun place to work. All the management is awesome, and very encouraging. The atmosphere of the workplace is very fun and fast paced. Everyone looks out for each other. Which is very nice. Especially when it gets very busy."
good,"By far the best job I've ever held. However with the state that retail is in, especially a toy company, during the time of year that people are not Christmas shopping it's hard to maintain a fulltime status."
good,I only worked at toys r is for a short time but I hate e to say my experience there was amazing. I love how everyone was so nice there but I loved most when the children run to the register so happy with there toys. I would work there again cause you feel a lot of love being there
good,I enjoyed working with toys r us alot....the employees as well as the customers were wonderful people to work with...probably best enviroment i ever worked in.
good,"fast paced environment "
good,"Empresa com colaboradores humildes, sempre prontos a ajudar, sempre prontos a ensinar."
good,"Enjoy working for this company very much. Learned how to merchandise and inventory product as well as ship and receive customer orders. Nothing difficult about the job, just a general retailer."
good,"A typical workday begins with gathering my gear, setting up the back and loading a pick list. From there I assist customers with large orders or generally pick orders and assist with stocking."
good,"They treated me great! I was able to attend school and work with the availability given.  It was a friendly environment and a hard working faced pace store. I was trained to operate a cash register and handle money, I learned to organize, stock, and work the floor. I gave customer service to every guest in the store."
good,Fast & slow days. Seeing families happy with their purchase. Learned everything. Fun and enjoyable. Back stocking can be somwhat the hardest.
good,"a typical work day begins at 6 pm as I work might fill. It involves splitting palettes of boxes and filling shelves as well as ensuring store presentation is up to standards. "
good,A typical day at work would be to greet the daily customer and the children . I would enjoy to help the customers out on the sales floor in a friendly and timely manner. When the customer are checking out I would ring up their items and process the customer payments.
good,"Started with the company doing security, learned a little more about the company and became the Main Receptionist /Switchboard Operator , learned a little more about the company and became a Customer Care Agent.....During my duration with the company, I became well commended by the Vice Presidents, Senior Vice Presidents and CEO's of the company. Honestly, I can't think of one negative detail about the company. Great place and great people..."
good,Toys Rus was my first warehouse job and it was the best 4 months ive had at work in the last 5 years. All the lads are great to work with if your good at the banter thing. Management where great always helpful and a good laugh. I learnt a lot working at Toys Rus not just at work but in life too. My most enjoyable part was everything about the job.
good,I absolutely loved working there and meeting new people it was interesting to see what's its like behind the scenes of a toy store and how.busy it was from the holiday season to the end of the year
good,I loved working for this company because they were very helpful when I didn't know what to do. My co-workers were amazing very helpful and friendly. What I learned while working there is patients. Some customers may be having a bad day and may become rude but I've learned that everyone is going to have their bad days so my job was to make sure they left with their problems solved. The hardest part of the job was assembling toys. The most enjoyable part were the customers and the children. Management was great
good,"Typical day at work, very nice and no complications with working, gained more cashiering experience as well as stocking daily shipments, management is nice managers are well cooperative and kind people, coworkers are very cooperative and very hard workers."
good,"I will come to work at 9:45 my shift starts at 10pm , i will clock in then i will go the back and start on the truck if we have one"
good,"Very fun place to work. Managers offer daily incentives for the person with the highest credit card openings which makes it a fun thing to do. In reality nobody wants another credit card but they motivate us to motivate our customers and it works. They appreciate their employees, we even get pizza on black Friday. I enjoy working for a company who motivates and takes care of their employees. The only thing I would change is employees should get more than a 10% discount 30% is good for the amount of work we do. It is a very big store, cleaning up after everyone making sure things look nice and standing all day really takes a toll on your body. The employees are nice you can tell who really enjoys the job and who just work here for money."
good,had a great time going hrough past memories of lego's and stuff. getting to sell people toys for tots was rad. I'd do another season in a heart beat.
good,"Was an over night position so the team was pretty lax,everyone respected one another and we collectively put forth the effort to make sure we met our mark as a whole each night."
good,"Good and fun environment to work in. Great place to start for a first job. Great learning environment as well , just overall a good place to work. Very much enjoy it."
good,"The managers were very friendly but not overly friendly . You're definitely expected to work & not slack off . As long as you don't slack , the work day will go flying by ."
good,"A typical day at Babies R Us is nothing like I have ever experienced. My management team is fantastic, they make you feel like you are part of a family, they do everything in their power to help you when you are struggling. They are knowledgeable about the company and have answers to every question I ask. My management team is the hardest working group of individuals I have been able to meet. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work for a company that allows fun within in the building to ensure the guest have everything they need."
good,Working at toys r us was fun for me. I earned how to use a cash register. It was busy around the holidays but it was also ooa fun friendly environment.
good,"Working here is actually pretty fun, interesting and simple. The managers and Long-term co-workers are always open to help out the best way they can. Of course once they seasonal times roll in, it will be tough on new-comers, but once you get a couple days in training, it gets easier. Same routine each day, but the only part that's hard about the job is that theirs always a change in the product location. that's so theirs more room for other toy's and baby products."
good,"Compañerismo, muy buen ambiente de trabajo y jefes muyyy agradables y respetuosos"
good,"Extremely joyous to work during the holiday season. Hectic, of course, but lots of fun!  Management would always jump right in on any issues at hand. Bit of a problem getting appropriate breaks, but all in all would work there again."
good,Toys r us is a good place to work always look after staff its fast paced and exciting. All co workers are goodnto get a long with and there is a great atmosphere when you enter store.
good,Do not consider working for Toys R Us if your energy doesn't match the energy of the customers. I definitely gained a better understanding of how interacting with the customer in a positive way not only benefits them but it benefits and reflects on the company.
good,Nightshift was extreme with great pay and good benefits. Many hours and shifts were needed so there was always work available. not a lot of customer service.
good,"The workplace was very fun, productive and very fast pace where you had to learn how to multi-task with many different task at once."
good,Wonderful environment. Friendly co-workers and managers. The hardest part of the job is around Christmas time when the hottest toys are out and they are on back order and customers get mad like it is your fault. The most enjoyable part of the job besides friendly workers and management is you get to play with the toys to make sure they work properly.
good,"Mi valoración del trabajo es: con mis compañeras el trato es bueno, aprendes a descargar camión y separar la mercancia por categorias."
good,My experience with Toys R Us was very enjoyable during my time working there. My coworkers were very nice and they were always there when I needed them.
good,Fun Workplace if you love kids! Benefits are not good at all. Hard Work is Payed off in words not in compensation. Coworkers are very nice and helpful.
good,"Managers are nice and understanding and encouraging. I learned how to sell credit cards, rewards cards and warranties. I have learned about the most popular toys and about electronics. The employees are hard workers (those who come to work). Over all a great place to work."
good,"Though I didn't like cleaning bathrooms as part of my job, the toilets and garbage cans weren't so bad most days, and the sinks and mirrors were never that bad. It paid decently well, especially considering it was my first job. Other parts of the job, including sweeping parts of the store, were actually pretty good. My favorite part of the job were my co-workers. Though they weren't very helpful, they didn't need to be, considering the work I did. They also made the job more entertaining. Management was pretty helpful as well. The hardest part of my job was working a 12-hour shift on Thanksgiving, especially since I had worked at a charity Thanksgiving dinner earlier that day."
good,"How to stock the shelves with the toys and help the customers while they were in the store. Management was understanding, helpful and they pitched in when we were short handed. The co workers was willing to help you if you needed it. The hardest part was leaving because it was a seasonal position and I had got close to a lot of people. The most enjoyable part was the seeing the children's faces when they cam and asked where they could find the toy they were looking  for in the store and when you showed them they thanked you and it was a sincere smile"
good,i have learn so much working at Babies R Us. i really am grateful for all the things management have taught me when i was there

I would, and have, recommend Toys R Us to my friends and family."
good,"Great environment, co workers extremely helpful, very fast paced and keeps you on your feet. Nothing better than helping a parent or child find a new toy. Hardest part of the job was having to tell people something was out of stock when the website said we had it. Management was great."

No one was ever excluded.  You would do a little of everything,, Stocking and cleaning shelves and floors.  Working registers and electronics area.. Doing returns or putting in online orders for the guests.  You did what the guest needed to make them happy.  Its a happy place to work."
good,Always moving with customers to attend to and inventory to stock and organize. Learned that customers are always in need of help but you must initiate the service. Management and co-workers are very helpful. Hardest part of the job to keep the store neat at all times. Most enjoyable part of the job is to assist customers in finding what they need.
good,Every one seems very friendly and is help full. I am learning customer service skills and learning cash handling skills.

good,A typical day involves talking to customers about products. this was my first job so I learned a lot about customer service and how to promote and sell products. Management were amazingly understanding of my school and sporting commitments and tailored my shifts to meet my needs. The staff were amazing and I enjoyed everything about the job.
good,Love every bit from the staff to the customers. Management was excellent. Nothing was hard about the job. Best part it was my first real experience working.
good,Toy'R'Us give me the skills in building and organizing and planing the on the whens and hows and i uses them today in every day life.
good,Enjoyed working with people and seeing the look of joy on parents and kids faces shopping in the store.  Training managers to enhance their leadership skills.  Typical work week was 40 to 45 hours Feb to Sep each year and 60+ Oct to Jan each year.
good,"Go there, clock in, and enjoy talking to people and the kids. People are so nice to work with there. They always show you how to do everything correctly and never forget you during the day to acknowledge you."
good,I enjoyed working there & would have stayed longer if it hadn't been for my family emergency. The managers were nice & fair. The other employees were easy to get along with.
good,A great learning environment. You get to see all the different toys that kids like to play with. The toys that you thought were every kids favorite was not every kids favorite toy.

good,: Seeking a position as where my outstanding analytical and observation skills can be utilized to minimize and wrong doing on property grounds.
good,"When I worked at Toys R Us it was during the Christmas season; so my main priorities were to make sure that we had items in the back that we could place on the shelves later on.  There were also times when I had to bring stuff from the store and bring them to the back to place them on layaway.  When I wasn't doing that, I was asked to go on a cart run.  The managers at Toys R Us are very professional but are very easy to get along with, the same thing can be said about the co-workers.  If I had to say what the hardest part was about working there was when I would be on an assignment from one of the managers and I would get bombarded with three different customers asking me where certain items were.  However; the most enjoyable part of working at Toys R Us was when I was asked to bring a certain item from the back up to the front and seeing the joy on a kids face when they saw me bring the item, like I was some sort of superhero."
good,"The normal working day it is very busy"
good,Fun and friendly staff. Great work environment. Being surrounded by toys brings the kid out of you. Kept a smile on the whole time I worked there.
good,"As soon as you enter work it will immediately demand you to be active and deal with customers all day. You usually handle customers base on what day it is and how busy it is. Handling customers doesn't come down to face to face, but also to answering calls. At most, you will probably deal with 30-40 customers a day, while on Saturdays you deal with a higher number. Co-workers becomes your best ally when it comes to handling many customers at one time, in which work can be evenly divided to make it easier and smoother. Most of my co-workers are always fun and entertaining to work with even on their bad day, you can always do a lot by helping them out here and there to make sure the job is done correctly. The hardest part of the job would be on certain days where staff members have called off and the duties are extended onto you, although I have been able to do everything and complete my tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job is actually the really cheesy part, customer satisfaction. When you make some one smile and thank you for your services, it gives you a feeling of self-worth and knowing that you solved their challenges."
good,"1-pm's conveyors and repairs                                                                                                   2-learned repair high speed sorter and scanners                                                                                                3-superviser facilities teen inspection all pm's done property                                                                                                 4-co-workers are good and do their job                                                                                                         5-The hardest part of the job is when Christmas time comes because it is very busy and a lot  of work has to be done to make sure everything is done properly so that the product can go to the store."
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced and alot of enjoyment, there was never a dull moment."
good,"I worked at a small store in the mall, it was calm and peaceful on the weekdays, you had time to really pay attention to your customer. On the weekends it was a bit more rowdy, but you still found time to focus on the costumers on the floor. I learned time management the best and how to deal with quick costumers the most here.My managers were absolutely fabulous, I've never been so comfortable around people that had the power to take my job away. My managers are all strong women I admire a lot. My co-workers were all really friendly and great, some didn't catch on as quick, but overall they were wonderful. The hardest part of my job was having someone else have to pick up my slack in stocking, I'm a very small person only around 4'9 so stocking and putting up stuff from the top shelves even with a ladder was impossible.The most enjoyable part of my job was the people, they all were unique and had different things to offer to the work place."
good,It was a nice learning experience working with the Inventory Management IT team.We delivered the project with 99% Customer Satisfaction Index.This project was about automating the Year End Inventory process across all the stores in Toys R Us.
good,"A typical day at work involved maintaining the store, manning the register, assisting guests, taking calls and at times watching the store. I learned how to listen to my gut and take initiative. Co-workers were fun and friendly. The job was not particularly difficult at any point and time. The most enjoyable part was unloading trucks."
good,"Even as a regular sales associate, the store manager knowing my background, let me participate in managerial duties, though I held no such title.  He knew my degree in accounting, and allowed me to perform duties related to my field that no one else in my position has been allowed to do.  The store helped me grow professionally and personally.  They expect the best of you, and will find where your strengths and weaknesses lye.  Mostly, they will help you improve on your weaknesses, so you are a well rounded employee."
good,Learned all about toys and got to know the staff and supervisors. The hardest part was restocking and finding where the each toy went back on the shelf when there were thousands of them.
good,I loved the job it was great everyone was wonderful. I was only looking for seasonal employment and got hired on full time had a few problems with the family and living arangements and had to let the job go otherwise I'd still be there

good,"Toys r us is a busy work place where you could be doing anything from re-shop, click and collect ,checkouts, down to security. But if you are ever stuck you have a great support team to help you out, from other co-workers to management who are always on hand to help."
good,"With this being a kids toys store there were always things to tidy, put in its original place, and re-configure. The neatness and speed in which an employee of this store needs to possess was actually inspirational. The fast-pace allowed me to get several tasks done simultaneously. You are trained to work the cash register, accommodate guests of the store, and keep up the look of the store your entire shift. The management is more than helpful, understanding, and leading."
good,"Toys R Us in Kennewick, WA is an amazing place to work at. I got along very well with everyone i worked with and i felt like i was part of a big family while i was employed there. Management always made it clear that they were there to talk to whenever i needed them and they adressed my concerns in a timely manner, my fellow coworkers were always very friendly, helpful and seemed really concerned about my overall well being even outside of the work place. I have made many life long friends at Toys R Us. The work environment is fun. The main focus is to keep guests satisfied and i truly felt that everyone worked really hard to provide guests with the best options at all times."
good,"A typical day at work mainly depended on what section you are placed into.  The hardest part of the job was being away from your family during Thanksgiving due to the early opening of ""Black Friday.""  The most enjoyable part of the job was when kids would come into the store and seeing the happiness on their faces."
good,"Helping out customers on a daily basis, I learned how to do the click and collect reservations, I enjoyed getting to know my colleagues as they were really nice people to get along with and also work with. The hardest part of my job was to deal with a angry customer. The part i liked the most out of the job was helping the customers to their needs and working with my colleagues."

good,"If the job wasn't seasonal, I might still be working here. Good co-worker and management was awesome."
good,"My favorite part of each day was seeing the children's faces. They were always just so excited to be there. I had a very good management team. hardest part of the job is the seasonal hours, but thats only if you take that on."
good,"This was my beyond favorite work. Why? The pace gave me an opportunity to be professionally active; it was like my breather. I loved coming to work and almost always asked for tasks to keep me going. At the start of the 3rd shift, the store closes and boxes are unloaded from the truck. The rest of the workers outside of the truck place the boxes in their rightful isles, typically on the same side before closing to keep it organized for customers. Depending on the amount of workers, groups are set in numbers in certain isles to focus on stocking until each isle is done in a timely manner. Once the truck was complete, truck workers would fill in with the stockers and remain on the floor until the job is done. Managers would check on each isle and encourage the speed, otherwise workers have worked over their shift until the entire store was complete before opening hours, although there have been 3rd shifts completed when the store opens. (Managers would be cautious of working over our hours, hence they have mandatory workers and I became one of them). This is where I learned teamwork and leadership, gathering the workers with encouragement if needed. I'd also ask the managers what was needed to be done ahead of time if it was possible. Overall, it was enjoyable to myself and hopefully to the rest of the workers who work for ToysRus. I would work here and do it all over again if I could, the coworkers and even managers develop friendships and eventually become like family due to the time 3rd shift spends until it's all done. I wish I had more truck experience, it's a thrilling skill."
good,Somedays I had my ups & downs but overall I enjoyed & Love working there
good,"nice place to work when you are young,pay and health insurance are not that good."
good,working at toys r us I had to unload a truck with merchantdise and load the properly on the shelves I enjoyed doing this and working as ateam with others to reach the same goal.

A very professional work ethic is prevalent in the Distribution Center and the Company. Breaks are taken at regular intervals. Special needs are accommodated. Management is transparent and cares about their workers.
good,"I learned a lot working at Toys""R Us ,but the most memorable and enjoyable part was seeing the joy of children playing with the toys. Management and co-workers were very helpful and patient when going through the interview and training process. I would say the hardest part of the job was during the holidays."

good,"Excellent company to work for, inventory management team, loading and unloading of trucks."

good,You get to meet different people and the hours are flexible.
good,"it was a great workplace, the co workers became like a family protecting each other when there was any issues. I learned a lot about team work and working with different type of customers."
good,"I didn't know much about working in retail, but after working as a cashier at Toys R Us I learned a lot. I enjoyed working here because it was mostly fast paced and the working environment was great. My coworkers were all friendly and helpful. I knew that of I didn't understand something they would be more than happy to help me. We all worked well in a team. I struggled at first with remembering every single detail and responsibility of a cashier but with time it became easy to the point where I just did it without thinking. My supervisors were also friendly and did a good job at keeping everything and everyone in line. I really liked that I wasn't standing at my register during my whole shift. I got to do a little bit of everything, so it was never boring. Overall it was a positive working experience for me."
good,"A typical day at work would be stocking shelves and unloading trucks that arrive with merchandise. I would start off the day by completing replenishment, bay audits, and item discrepancies. I learned how to build bicycles, store pick-ups, and collecting lay-aways to be sent to back for pick-ups later."
good,"I just started there, but what I've experienced so far is exceptionally helpful staff to answer any questions I may have. I have been training on the resister, helping guests find what they are looking for, giving the customers a great shopping experience.  The management there is great, very nice, helpful, and make me feel like part of the team.  This is my first retail job, its a change of pace but I love it.  The hardest part about the job is not knowing where items are in the store, but that will come with time."
good,"Worked on a cash register or worked with customers helping them find what they was looking for."

I also enjoyed communicating with my co workers and learning the different departments throughout the store. I gained extensive product knowledge about the items and brands the store sold. I enjoyed explaining a product to a potential guests and helping them to decide if that item was right for their, child and budget. "
good,The store was simply wonderful and had a very happy environment. I learned about how to use a Sapphire and maintain multiple stations at once when helping customers. The management was very kind and helpful. My co-workers became my friends fairly quickly. The hardest part of the job was probably cleaning the carts after a busy day since there was often garbage and such in the carts from busy parents. The most enjoyable part was that I was making people happy.
good,This job was by far the most fun job I have ever had. I loved getting to see childrens faces light up when they came into the world of many toys. I was able to play santa for quite a few children and it really felt good to be helping make kids' dreams come true. I loved the team that I worked with and the customers were always awsome.
good,"A typical day at work included good customer service, trying to make every customer happy, get reward members and credit card members. I learned that team work involves everyone and when one person isn't doing their job it is harder on everyone else. My co-workers were awesome and the managers were as well, even though I feel they could have changed some things to satisfy customers more. Hardest part of this job was dealing with customers walking out due to insufficient customer service. The most enjoyable part was seeing the smile on the kids faces getting their toys. "

good,I enjoyed this job and had tons of fun. I will miss this job very much. I was very happy with this job and i was able to help so many customers. I even dressed up as Jeffery the giraffe for the kids.
good,"I had no problem with showing up to work here. Everyone was friendly, unproblematic and understanding. My manger was completely understanding to me still being in high school and aligned my work schedule to match up for the days I was still in school."
good,Working at Toy’s R Us was great. I got along great with my co workers and was a big team player when came to anything they needed help with. I enjoyed seeing the smiles and the positive energy from kids when they’re parents bought them toys.
good,"fun environment to work at. got to work with all types of customer. They had questions I answered them as best as I could, if I did not know the answer I would ask someone."
good,If toysrus returned I would love to work there again. It was very sad when they closed and it was always a friendly environment. During the winter months things can really pick up but was still a solid place to work.
good,"I had a good time, liked the people easy going culture. The work wasnt too bad and the managers were friendly. I would recommend others to this job if i could."
good,I personally loved the company dealing with toys is more than the typical it’s just a toy ! it’s not about just the toys it’s more than just toys every meaning behind each happy customer is what really made us.
good,Har jobbat med barn och väldigt roligt att kunna ge dem bra service.
good,Toys R Us is a great place to work. I love working there cause I love helping customers and working with kids. Great managers and great employees. Best place to work
good,Cleaning bathrooms vacuuming and anything else they needed me to do trying to do the best I can never really had any questions at the huddle meetings I loved helping out.
good,"I was a stocker, so my job was fairly easy for most of the time, plus it's a toy store and I think we all have an inner child in us. therefore, I mostly enjoyed the environment and I was passionate about my job. I like seeing children happy and my manager noticed that so he would hear out my ideas and we worked as a team. Co-workers were great as well because the job was relaxed, but not to a point where no work was getting done. It was sad to see this franchise go out of business. It felt like I lost a part of me when it happened."
good,This is one place I truly enjoyed working at. Even though it was only seasonal the managers were always willing to work with me year after year with my pre set Christmas arrangements. If they were still conducting business I would definately go back.

good,Always a fun place to work with plenty to keep you busy. always changing depending on the time of year from summer time to Halloween and Christmas. being a big company there was always an opportunity to learn new skills and meet new people.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of organizing store merchandise by sections that were given to employees who had to maintain it throughout their day schedule while cashiers charged customers regularly and another employee worked at the bicycles section. I learned that retail often asks that employees work together often especially during holiday season. Management was organized but often they relied on regular sales associates to handle management problems. The hardest part of the job was having to assist impatient customers on the most busy days and losing the organization amongst the co-members due to poor management that day. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to rely on other co-workers at times to help you finish one job so that together, they could finish faster and move on to get the job done."
good,I loved working at Toys R Us it was a fun and welcoming environment the mangers were always happy to help and the staff also always helped when they could

good,Toys R Us was always challenging me to learn new things. It was a fun place to work and I met some amazing people while I worked there. Management for the most part was really good and they were always willing to teach me how to better myself. I started as a cashier hardly making any money or getting any hours to multiple supervisor positions then to a key carrier. I enjoyed my time with the company and learned a lot about myself while I was there.
good,"Working at Toys R'Us was a great experience, being able to learn a new aspect of business and the work that goes behind it to make things run smoothly."

good,Toys R Us was a great work environment and i thoroughly enjoyed working there. The management and staff were exceptionally friendly and was always there to help. The most enjoyable part of Toys R Us was the excitement on the kids faces when they see all the products. The main things I learnt were retail and customer service.

The managers in Toys R us were very nice and the staff made me feel welcomed. On a day to day bases I learnt how to confidently walk up to customers and help them or see if they need any help.

good,"Toys 'R' Us was an amazing place to work. We were a very close knit group of people, like family.The interaction with the customers was very rewarding. To work with expectant mothers through their pregnancy up until their children were school aged was incredible. It was an awesome feeling to help a child find their first toy, or find a toy they could purchase with their own money. It was also great to find the right gift for grandma and grandpa to give their first born grandchild. We had many repeat customers because of our excellent customer service skills."

All tasks were manageable, and if help was needed somebody was available to help you no matter the time of day."

good,Working here brings out your inner kid. Not only are you one of the first people to see the new toys out but you can't try them. Your able to give an honest opinion on how each toy works for you
good,A typical day there was either as a cashier seeing to customers or as a sales floor member stocking and answering questions on toys. The main thing I learned there was highly base efficiency with the days work. Like balance between talking to customers and other base jobs. Overall keeping the customer happy and sales flowing. Management for fine from how I saw it and had no real problems. As for workplace culture was fairly efficient and had great people working at times. Main downside was a lack of personnel needed more people. Hardest part for me was memorization of store product placement. Reason for this is items were constantly moved so you couldn't always pinpoint items. Most enjoyable was the people. Being both my fellow co-workers and the customers that came in on a daily bases.
good,"I started out as a temporary helping to set up a store. Within a year I was an Assistant Director. At five years I got my own store. If you want to app,y yourself the sky was the limit."

good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time working for toys r us as it filled out the main aspect that i look for in a job: being able to put a smile on someones face. The staff were pleasant and hardworking. You were able to have a friendly joke with the other staff and were always helpful when you required assistance. The customers were generally understanding and were pleasant to deal with although understandably there were times where they could be quite unreasonable. The management were always a pleasure to talk to and i never felt nervous talking to them about any issues that arose in the store. The workload was tedious at times but there was almost never any times where there was nothing to do.

I am a fast learner when it comes to computers and numbers. Working with my coworkers and manager is great because you work as a team. We communicate in getting our job done and experiences the learning of other as well as working in teams. The hardest part of working in a toy store is maintaining in order, organized, and having each toy in the right price. The most enjoyable part of working here is that you get to experiences the toys and working with parent in what toy there children will love or helping them find it for them.

I enjoyed all my time there, would have stayed if they had had enough permanent job openings available for the seasonal people, after season was done.  I learned how to check people out, as I had not done that before, easy to learn and do.  Met a lot of great people in co-workers and shoppers.  I would still work for them if they called me. The management was great also, as if I had a problem regarding the cash register, since I had never worked one, they would help me get through the bump and I would remember it for the next time."
good,"The hardest part of the job is standing all day, but it is a fun environment that is constantly educating you on new and upcoming toys and baby items.  I really liked Christmas time.

Company is forward thinking and open to new technologies to help improve on the business process."

When, I was working at Toys ""R"" Us, the work can be hard or easy at times but, I knew that we could complete any task or challenge that would step in front of us. It very welled show that our working environment had a lot team work to show in the work area plus if you knew your strategies and you had communication down then, you could pick up fast which I did very well. "
good,Get There You Work Hard In The Beginning Then You Can Coast The Rest Of The Night At A Cool Pace. I Learned Hard Work Pays Off. Management Was Perfect They Knew How To Motivate.

The co-workers were really friendly and helped me with any trouble I had with any task. The hardest part of the job was checking bags and standing at the front of the store for my whole shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with co-workers, merchandising using teamwork and communication."

The management is so great they are very flexible and understanding of one, all of the co-workers are extremely helpful to one another its like one big team. the hardest part of the job I would say is dealing with unfriendly customers but with patience and understanding we can over come the situation. the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you left the customer satisfied and happy with their visit at Toys R Us."

I have gained more knowledge of sales, electronics, registers, etc. My co-workers were fun to be around, helpful, and always willing to learn more."
good,"Toys R Us is one of the best places that i have worked.  I learned how retail is during the holiday season, in other words quite crazy.  In a typical day, you get to meet some quite interested people, fun people but still interesting.  I think the hardest part of the job was dealing with guests who thought all we did there was play with the toys which we really don't.  The most enjoyable part of the job would also have to be the guests some would come in and just tell you why they came in others would come in in a bad mood and leave in a great mood."
good,It was a great place to work. You will learn alot while working.

I learned that you need to know what boxes go in the correct aisles, because some boxes are labeled wrong. Management was amazing, and I have no complaints. My co-workers were very friendly, and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was remembering where certain boxes go for the first two to two and a half weeks. The most enjoyable part of the job was finishing unloading the truck and stocking the entire truck  with an hour or so left before we clocked out."
good,I was recruited while at my previous employer for several months before finally breaking down to stop in for an interview.

I learned that customer service is the number one priority of the company. Management was always hands on. They made sure that its employees as well as the customers were satisfied. My coworkers were friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was getting customers to apply for the credit card. My most enjoyable part was watching the kids walk out with their toys.

The management was really good. They were busy, but always had time to communicate with the employees. My coworkers were all very friendly. The most difficult part of the job was having to resist playing with the awesome new toys that would come in. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and learning about our products."

good,A typical day starts at 8 ends at 5 and involves interactions with various teams. I improved my analytic skills and learned how to use JDA software here. Management is very friendly and interacts with their team members on a daily basis. Co workers are very friendly easy to get along with.

good,A day at work was sometimes claming and busy being able to work with a team full on enthusiastic individuals who have the same energy as you & in an enviroment with a bunch of children willing to buy what they see. i learnt the basis of holding resposibility over children who would come in the store crying over toys they would want and comforting them to realise theres much more that the world can offer instead of whats sitting on a shelf. The most enjoyable part overall was meeeting new poeple and talking to different children & being ble to bring joy around them.

You get 45 minutes to contact them for a change so I tried to call. This was at 7 am, they said they were closed till 8 am. I called back after 8 like it said and was told they can’t help me and I only had 45 minutes. When I explained I tried she said I tried she basically said all well.

good,"Easy tasks, fun work environment, but ultimately we need more staff to help alleviate rushes of customers and to enable time off/shift coverage.

good,"Toys ""R"" Us was a great job. Too bad they're all closed. Working there I got to meet a lot of amazing people. The work schedule was very flexible with me while I was in school. They had pay incentives that I would take advantage of."

good,A typical day would start with me and my coworkers unloading the truck and placing boxes in the designated aisles. After the truck was unload coworkers would be divided into people who open stock shelves with the aforementioned boxes and those who do overstock. My manager usually appointed me as someone who did overstock since it requires accuracy and attention to detail. Doing overstock was the best part of the job and the worst part would be doing anything that was tedious and not task oriented.
good,"It was such a fun place to work for.  We serviced so many children excited about buying that special toy."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for Toys-R-Us, if they had not of filed bankruptcy I would of still been working there.

good,"My rating for the the company is accurate but since my official last day of work will be June 30,2018, but not accurate as of now.

I just keep going around making sure toys are located in the right section of store with the correct price. As I’m keeping up with organizing the store I make sure to greet customers and make them feel welcomed . I will stop to help customers with anything they need and make sure they’re needs are meet. I’ve learned the better customer service a company or myself provides , the more customers will continue returning and showing they’re loyalty. I enjoy being a part of an amazing friendly welcoming environment recived by company and employees. I love being people and having a chance to help customers and going above and beyond to make sure they know that they are very important and whatever they need help with I’m here to help."

From there one of three things would happen; either A: we take all the front stock boxes and scan them above each designated aisle or B: take each product out of it's box and organizing each item in each aisle, or C: organize and place back stock boxes in designated aisle. The management here is very friendly and helpful and aren't afraid to take time out of their time to  help you and show you the ropes of the industry.

The part i enjoyed the most about the job would to be, during break being able to relax and have fun and play with the toys. Always felt like a kid."

What I like about the job is you get have fun there while working at the same time."
good,"I am a “people” person, and when I saw guests coming in the store struggling, I make sure the customers come first and assist them with good manners and great customer service. I love to analyze things, so I know to talk to my manager or supervisor if I see anything suspicious or wrong. I am a blue collar guy who’s willing to grow within the company."

The hardest part of my job would have to be closing the store and having to stay over hours after my shift . My favorite thing about working at Toys R Us is being able to have learned about merchandice and now have the chance to give feedback on toys that customers don't know about and make their visit to Toys R Us more merrier. At  the end of the day, it's the management and staff that gives Toys R Us its name today. ( But also all of the toys ;) )"

I learned how to use a point-of-sales system, how to stock shelves and clothing racks, and how to do layaway transactions. Management was very helpful. There is always a manager or supervisor there to help if you are unsure of how to do something. The hardest part of the job was convincing customers to apply for the credit card, and also having items brought from the back of the store. When the store is busy, the BOH workers get bogged down and it takes a little longer than usual. The best part of the job was being able to interact with so many different people who are all there for different things, whether it's toys, video games, or board games."

good,"A typical day at work during the Christmas season was always quick-paced. Customers were flooding in from everywhere in Delaware to get gifts for their kids, cousins, nephews, or whoever else. I learned how to deal with hostile customers by simply remaining calm. The management was very organized and managers walked all throughout the store. The managers were helpful to new employees like myself. The workplace culture was very playful and cheerful. The store had many events hosted for children such as the life-sized Jenga game and having Geoffrey the Giraffe (the store mascot) come out and surprise the kids. Although I have learned how to deal with them, the hardest part of the job would be dealing with hostile customers. I learned to understand where most of the hostility came from, which was the fact that it was the Christmas season and parents needed to get the gift(s) that their kid(s) requested. I enjoyed completing lay-away orders. I have always been one to follow step-by-step directions and completing lay-away orders was an easy step-by-step process. It also seemed to make the day go by faster. Overall, this was a good experience for a first paid job. I would work there again for the next Christmas season if I had the opportunity."

It is a fun way to learn more about toy and baby items and the guests are enjoyable to help, for the most part. The best part of the job is getting to know the expectant parents and then seeing the babies once they are born. It is a very high-paced atmosphere during Christmas season, but the days fly by.

Working here allows you to work with amazing kids and making their experience one that they can talk about forever. Being a shift supervisor in the Babies R Us section of Toys R Us is pretty normal, on a regular day when I start, I have to first start by review the schedule to see who is on my team for the day and try to debate on if i have enough coverage for my shift, after i do that then i proceed to count and balance the cash register to get it prepared for the next person who is going to be on for the day. Throughout my time on shift I have to make sure that everything runs smoothly and make sure all of my guest that walk into the store is smiling and have no problem with shopping. Working in a big store people want you to know about every toy, electronic and baby item that you carry. I like to learn about the products we carry so I can better assist the guest. Product knowledge is one of the keys to a happy guest so they do not feel that you sending them from team member to team member."

I was first hired as a seasonal worker and during Christmas one of the busiest time of the year.There really wasn't any room or time to focus on training the seasonal associates so we had to shadow experienced co workers and just go with the flow. It was overwhelming at times because it was my first job ever so I didn't have previous experience with registers. Also, working out on the floor was not easy until I studied the floor plan and items by name/category.Once I got the hang of things I loved going to work, I even volunteered to put in more hours often. My team associates were like family, I've created very memorable relationships"

good,"Toys R' Us is an incredible place to work. The atmosphere is welcoming, the work offers you great experience in working with a cash register and in customer service. The employers make you feel as though you're valued and not just another employee they can replace should you decide to leave. A typical day depends  on the job you acquired but for me most of my time was spent keeping the store tidy and ringing customers' purchases. It's satisfying work, not too hard and offers experience with face to face interactions."

I soon then worked at the customer service desk and learned about how Babies R Us items were different from other stores. Our management was so helpful, they made sure we had the proper training, and they let their employees learn everything and anything. And every Friday, management would give us a status on how our store was doing and how well as a team we were doing. The hardest part about the job was keeping our aisle clean and tidy while so many children were running around knocking stuff over. Over all I enjoyed working with the customers and making sure they were satisfied before leaving. And seeing that they had a smile on their face."
good,"I was a student working in a project with the company therefore I came by weekly. On a typical day as a team we would go onto the factory's floor and communicate with certain operators to get their input on certain processes and its functions. We then planned our adjustments and would run our ideas by some of the Industrial Engineers in the Distribution center for their feedback. Each day the feedback was different, some days we took steps forward, and some days we took steps back, but we always learned something new.

Asking for donations towards Toys For Tots, and Stocking shelves. I quickly learned how to sign customers up for credit and rewards cards. The management and staff were very nice, easy going, and friendly. Upon approval for an R Us card, customers are eligible to receiving an extra 20% off their purchase that day. So the hardest part of the job would have to be explaining to certain customers who were not approved, why they didn't receiving the extra 20% off. It puts you in an uncomfortable position because it basically meant they had bad credit. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part was seeing all the happy children excited for Christmas and everyone in the Christmas spirit."

good,It was a seasonal job and of all the jobs I loved this one. I was a little sad to go. I loved working in a child environment. The most enjoyable part was seeing how happy the kids were getting a toy.  The hardest part of the job was trying to remember where almost everything was located for when someone asked. The people I worked with were so nice and friendly and the management were on top of their store. In previous jobs I say the opposite about the management.
good,"open/close, deposits, schematics, customer service, register"
good,A typical day at work was handling customer request while answering phone calls and keeping the cleanliness of the store. I was also responsible for racking up the carts. What I learned from that job was multi-tasking while working with team member needs.My co-worker helped when it came to reshop but they also can create more work for you.The hardest part of the job was keeping in mind the five  customers at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with cool emplopyees.

good,"Guest Services at Toys R Us consisted of the returns desk combined with the cashier register. I would answer the phones, do the returns/exchanges, run the cashier, work with money, improve store metrics, accomplish my everyday goals, and order the customer unavailable items."
good,"my typical day at work would to show up and to clock in on time every day i was scheduled to work. after being clocked in i head over to customer service to ask my manager where they would like to place me today. some times i would be placed as cashier or be place as floor associate. toys r us was my first job i ever had and for me i thought it would be hard to try to get people to sign up for our rewards or to be able to work the cashier. for me though i had a very friendly trainer and was able to pick up all the skills i needed and quick. this job is where i got my great customer service skills the customers weren't always in the greatest moods but being able to talk to them and help them made me realize that i actually enjoy helping others out and not only that , that i am actually great with talking to people."

good,"A typical day at Toys R Us I would have to say was interesting, main reason being I was there during winter season. It was always busy and there was always something to do. I learned quite a bit working at Toys R Us, mainly how to work the warehouse part of the store and of course polishing my customer service. I have to say my experience with management was amazing they were extremely helpful when it came to me not knowing something or when I made a mistake and above all they acted like higher ups. Co-workers are an almost different story of course some of them showed respect and a wanting to be there but there are always going to be those who just don't care and it sometimes became annoying. I would have to say the hardest part of working there was the fact that I really didn't get trained all that well so in the start of it all I was kind of fumbling and all that but once I got used to it and the more questions I asked the easier it got. I will say the best times I spent there were me at a register only because of all the different people I met and all of the stories I heard."

My managers were very nice and made sure i know everything before leaving me alone to handle store by myself. They showed how to sell a product that is not selling for long time. as example, if those items are on sale, i should tell customers about that when they come into the store so they will keep that in mind and maybe will think of buying it since it is on sale."
good,this place will always be the best employer I've ever had. good place to work.
good,I have really enjoyed working for  R Us Companies and all the associates that make them a happy family place to work. It includes Toys R Us Express and Babies R Us.

good,I learned to work well with team members and how to handle customers well. I was well equipped with data skills and communications that helped make the job flow easier.
good,"A typical day would be working on the register checking out guest, restocking shelves, inventory, pricing, and cycle counts. Within 3 months I was able to move to the electronics department which typically, they would not allow people to work unless they had been working with the company for at least a year. This was because it would get crazy packed in that section and there were many fans of games, that if we did not have it, they could get real rude. I was quick at my work and I knew how to get through to customers where it would benefit both my company and the guest. Many customers shopped on the days I worked only because I would always make sure they went home with the product or something similar. My manager trusted me enough to work in the electronics department alone, without a supervisor. The days I worked in the department no electronics went missing and everything was organized. My co-workers were great to work with and I got a chance to train a couple of them. The hardest part was changing price labels every time the prices changed. The most enjoyable part was being able to sell the most credit cards in one day which was 25, mind you the typical amount an employee would get in a day was 5. I always challenged myself and pushed for more."
good,I worked in the back by myself where I assembled products for display and for paying customers!

good,I would start work at 10am sometimes 9am if I had been offered overtime. I would sign in and start my usual day unloading the trucks which usually would take me up until around 12noon. I would then start the rest of my day loading the stock in to the correct piles and placing them neatly in their correct positions all this would have to be done in a set time frame.

good,"Helping with customer service, restocking and keeping store cleanliness, displaying new toys and gadgets."
good,I stocked baby clothes and helped customers find things they were looking for.
good,"Most days, I clock in for a 5 hour shift or longer. I hurry over to electronics and begin tidying the floor and serving customers. If there is already an associate on the floor, I take the register. Checkout is quick, and I constantly pull customers down to electronics from the long lines for checkout. Once we have a steady rhythm going, my coworkers and I breeze through the day. We keep the floor neat, bring customers games and other electronics, and send them on their way as fast as they need. The hardest and worst part of the job was working with customers that could not speak English. I only speak English and some Latin and Japanese, and we only had one or two people in the entire store that could speak Spanish. It was difficult, and because electronic purchases are so large, it is hard to not feel guilty when you absolutely cannot explain to someone a product. Most of these people were able to have their children translate, but it was very hard to be okay with the lack of multi-lingual employees. The best part of the job was definitely working with the customers and providing recommendations. I love gaming, and my father is a software developer, so I am relatively familiar with all of our products. It is very fun to be able to share in the joy of someone's new game purchase or send them out with a new tablet or phone to enjoy. Management is very helpful, and they do not treat us as lesser. We are all a team, and we all were able to work together effectively."
good,"This is the careere i wished I would have kept. I enjoyed serving my country. I was 18 when I went to the 1991 Gulf War. Saw alot of things I wish I didnt see, but I did what my country asked me to do. If i would have stayed in I would be retired at this time."
good,Working with families with new baby needs when i came to diapers to when children reach toddler ages.

good,"Help and greet customers, cashier, stock, and labeling/pricing. I gained the experience in how to manage money, I learned how to deal with different people,gain the knowledge of new products and how to keep organize and keep things tidy. The Supervisors were professional but fun and as far as the co-workers they were fun but we still did our job and made sure it got done. I enjoyed working at ToysRUs because it was so much fun and it was fast paced and I just really enjoy helping others."
good,"This is a place I wish I would have never had to leave, unless it was to be doing my dream. I learned so much about different baby items and toys that I never knew before. I had never received so many compliments before from anywhere I worked. The management and staff that I worked with were all wonderful and made this a great experience. I also loved being able to try out some of the items before they were available to the rest of the public."
good,"A trip to Toys R Us for anyone is a really big deal, as the company focuses on the desires of children and the needs of families.  In my experience working for this company I have seen families and individuals that return for not just the fun product, but for the friendly and personal experience they have with the help of Toys R Us associates and managers.  Going above and beyond what you expect from a retail employee is average daily work for employees of Toys R Us, and they really do seem to care what impression they leave on the family, the individual and the children they interact with.  The hardest part of this job is trying to meet the needs of each person while being responsible to many job demands at the same time.  Everyone deserves to feel special at Toys R Us, and each employee must balance how much assistance they can provide while attending to other essential duties.  The highlight of my day always was the smile and friendly interaction from my customers, no matter their age."

good,"By far my experience at Toys 'R' Us was amazing. While you will be expected to work hard the people and the atmosphere makes it so much fun. There is a well defined weekly schedule of tasks to complete. The management staff willingly listens to concerns and will step in to assist whenever they are needed. My only complaint is that at the beginning of the year employees must take a lot of online learning, and this can take over 3 hours to complete making it very difficult to accomplish your job and do the training on a short shift."
good,"Toys R Us was a great place to work under excellent management, but the pay is not worth the work you do."
good,Day to day it is fun to work at Toys R Us. management is very hands on and makes sure you know what you are doing. Great fellow team members. My favorite part of the day is making a guest happy.

I have learned a lot in the 6 years I have been with the company. The management staff we have currently are amazing. They are there to help you with anything that you may need help with. The hardest part of my job I would have to say is when I am unable to get the guests what they are looking for from either another store or from our website.

They give recognition to those that show great attitude and overall great job. This is a place I never minded getting called into work. I learned what it means to have managers that take the time to show you how to do things right the first time. 
good,"The job doesn't ask too much of you, although you can perform multiple tasks daily. You gain more responsibility quickly. Trying to finish a task in a given time frame and having to help customers, can be rough, but as long as you're tactful in your approach, you'll be alright."

good,"I worked at Toys R Us while in college; this was by far the best job I had as a teenager. The managers there were so willing to accommodate me and work with me, especially considering my constant schedule changes from semester to semester. A typical day at work included getting items out of the stock room for customers, working on a register, and ensuring that aisles were clear. The hardest part of the job was dealing with disrespectful customers who took their stresses and frustrations out on workers. The most enjoyable part was honestly listening to positive, fun music and trying out new toys."
good,i loved working with the company we were always doing something fun and always learning different things and doing fun stuff for the kids.

I would check on any hot items that came in, and what hot items were out of stock. What managers and supervisors were in the store. I learned that everyday was filled with its own challenges and to be flexible. Most of us worked well together and when disagreements happened that it would be settled fairly.I think one of the hardest thing is not letting other peoples bad mood affect your own. Helping someone find what the need even if it just to listening to them and putting a smile on their face."
