bad,Talk to one guy on the phone finally after 3 days I finally get to go in person and talk to him and the boss interview went well or so I thought I did told me within 3 to 4 days somebody will contact you to let you know the next step well it's been almost a week I heard nothing called text emailed the person I talk to and the HR representative not one response back what a huge letdown.
bad,"Got hired on to do ""maintenance"" and all I seem to do here is scrap sludge from a container. They assigned this guy to ""run the building"" with no management expirence. The real manager sits in an office in San Diego. They also get people to agree to this loan shark deal they have. You onboard sign a paper that says they give you 300 perdiem but when you leave they take it out of your last check. You work in absolute filth, your going to be skating around due to slippery floors.  DONT WORK HERE!!! This place has a high turn over rate for a reason!!!"
bad,Terrible place to work and very unfair it is not a good place to work
bad,Do not waste your time with this employer. Management really sucks and do not value an employee. You will get nothing but negative feedback from daily huddles.
bad,I was not satisfied with being a CPA or the lifestyle offered. Colfax was a good example of how bad the lifestyle could be.  There was a terrible culture and nobody seemed happy.
bad,"Cut throat only concerned with profit no concern for employ health they have a health care plan but don't alliw,time of to use it they also use intimidation tactics and have poor management they turn over top management frequently"
bad,"Complete lack of focus on quality and customer needs. Only 1 thing mattered; revenue, revenue, revenue."
bad,A neat job if you are in the field. You can travel the country but say goodbye to home when business picks up. Not much advancement opportunity. You'll stall out  unless you're in with a certain group of friends. Direct supervisors are clueless thanks to upper management.
bad,"This company could be a thriving industry and from what i was told by senior employee's, it once was. They need to restructure this company and get rid of about 1/3 of the unnecessary management. The product line is fantastic and it is very sad to see a long time company like this slowly sink because of bad decisions."
bad,"Strong believe in Policy Deployment processes"
bad,A company that is still working to find itself in a very challenging market. The company has good business tools but struggles to use them in an effective way.
bad,"The oil flush side of the company was good, Knowledgeable field technicians that are willing to teach. The oil mist side was not a good experience for me, they gave me a whole region with very little training and when I asked for the training to handle problems I either got the run around or the number of other field technicians that had their own arrears and were already overwhelmed."
bad,Colfax as it continues to grow with new staff and management need serious improvement in management and culture.  Hiring great talent but not sure how to lead that talent.
bad,"Good travel experience, "
bad,"Colfax Fluid Handling Inc."
bad,I like the abiilty to work independently and the people I met along the way. There was no room for advancement and the management was lacking which made it hard to know what your expectations were.
bad,"This Is a company that had an interesting bias culture that I believe was unhealthy for the overall culture of the company, they focused more on individuals than the overall company."
bad,"Colfax is really a good company but the atmosphere here is really terrible unless you've been here 30 years or more.   Management let's those employees have total reign over the plant.   Other employees with less time here get bullied and really have no voice here at all.   Was hoping new management would change the atmosphere here,  but they are aware of the conditions and turn their heads.   Really toxic and all employees with 20 years or less look at the pay and tolerate what we can.  I do not see a future here."
good,"Fast paced 24x7 company. Good benefits, good people.  Manufacturing environment.  Not a soft ware company, but you administer software that helps run the business."
good,"Minimal work life balance and upper management micro-manages. The location is in Monroe, NC which is a long drive from Fort Mill.  The Director of HR is a micro-manager."
good,The company is a sinking ship. They just laid off a lot of people on 02/19/2016 because there was no work. People running TLM have no clue what they are doing. They've been closing shops from Michigan to Maine and California shops.
good,"Colfax Fluid Handling is an organization centered on continuous improvement. Colfax is a customer focused, fast paced environment, and made-up of passionate people."
good,"More work and understanding of employee experience is needed before this is a good place to work.  Lack of leadership accountability is a major issue.  If you are cutthroat you can advance, if you are not willing to sacrifice others and want to be recognized based on performance and contributions, this is not the company to work for you."
good,La direcci칩n de la divisi칩n no comparte las metas y estrategias que el negocio est치 persiguiendo y los empleados no tenemos forma de aportar ideas ni soluciones que puedan contribuir al crecimiento de la organizaci칩n.
good,"Used to be a great place to work.  Amazing products and a culture of serving our customers.  Sales down year-to-year due to macroeconomic issues.  Continually hiring more SVPs while the knowledge base disappears with people who actually are getting the ""work"" done."
good,"My last experience with Colfax was working for an acquisition in the O&G segment.  They were not committed to local talent in Houston and as a result, lost some very good talent.  They have since moved operations to Charlotte NC, not the center of the O&G community."
good,This is a very productive and business oriented company that offers job stability.
good,"Overall they are knowledgeable with the products and pumping business. They own several companies and operate large manufacturing operations and products are made in Monroe, NC."
good,Being that this is an old company with an outdated shop it has a unique set of challenges.  Lots of room for improvement which is finally starting to happen. Overall a good place to work.
good,"Colfax Fluid Handling is a great company with a long established product line. Lately however, the scramble to make a change, any change, to normalize and rebound their falling stock prices have everyone from top to bottom nervous and suffering from low morale."
good,A job at Colfax while not the best is pretty solid. If you're squeamish around liquid poultry I wouldn't recommend it but other than that job is fairly and relaxing. The hard part for me would be the fact that since we are working with raw chicken and must keep it healthy we work in a freezer room day in and day out. Other than that management is fair and the supervisors and CEOs make it a pleasurable experience. If its one thing I learned its how to make chicken at its best.
good,Wonderful company.  Great learning and very challenging experience.
good,The employees are wonderful . Continuing education and advancement within are cores value but are not rewarded.
good,"understanding the needs of criteria job implication"
good,"Good work culture."
good,The Portland Valve team is a tight knit group. When required the group pulls together everyone on equal terms. This allows them to solve problems efficiently. Recently management changes have driven a large amount of the team away. Moral is lower than normal and we are working to pull in new members.
good,"A team environment, fast paced,international experience, Lean environment, friendships, safety first, large distribution network, complicated supply chain, transportation experience."
good,"Normal police patrol duties, there are a wide variety of daily duties along with investigations and community events that we worked"
good,"The typical day always started with a briefing with my tutor to review the work done and decide the next steps to do. "
good,"Great Associates to work with, some of the smartest Executives I've ever worked with. Challenging work every day and exciting opportunities."
good,Great training and room for advancement. People work as a team with little supervision.
good,"Great place with pay and per diems for those with no family. Many job opportunities with travel on the road. Company phone, credit card, and rooms while on the road. Paid travel also."
good,"Aprendi a trabajar en equipo, el horario me gusto mucho, Respetan mucho el trabajo,"
good,good people to work with. good pay.the hardest part of the job is the labor. the best part is the pay. manaagement is good to talk too.
good,Colfax Corporation is a strong global fluids handling company with great room for advancement throughout the many locations across the globe.
good,Se filtra aceite de tanques con gran capacidad a base de filtradoras.
good,Super gezellige collega's met positieve instelling. Altijd gereed om een handje te geven bij vragen en moeilijke punten.
good,"Labor is really hard and you have to travel alot, but great place to work, once you set up shop on a job-site it goes by really quick. People who worked there were great"
good,"Laid back, great pay, supervisor easy to get along with, co-workers in my dept majority age group 30+. There is no hard part of my job. The most enjoyable part is getting paid."
