rating,review
good,"Great benefits, can apply at other depts after a yr, room to grow. The training provided really doesn't apply, it's really out dated. You learn more once you are getting one on one training."
good,"Administrative staff, Client Associates, Financial Advisors, Bankers are wonderful. It was a great company that is now owned by Bank of America Corporation."
good,"It is good company to work, however the perks are not at par."
good,"I started with ML and survived the acquisition. During my time at Bank of America, I was blessed to have the opportunity to experience many facets of the organization's security teams. I learned a ton during my time with the bank and have no regrets"
good,Very competitive. Learn to pick up things quickly. Very fast paced. Company invests a lot in the training. Options to transfer within the same market easily
good,A typical day is reviewing claims and resolving claims. I have learned that you have to be positive and adaptable to change.  I like my job but it is hard to advance.  The best part about my job is building relationships with your co-workers and potlucks.
good,Bank of America was a very good introduction to the banking world as well as retail and sales.  You learn a lot more than you realize and can develop a lot of connections with small business owners.  Being a teller can get very old.  Working part time there is no room for advancement and little to no raises.  You have sales goals like everyone else but are the only role not to receive bonuses.  Stress differs on location.  Higher flow centers can be very stressful at times trying to move the line but also meet goals.  Overall it is a great job if you are looking to take on a banking career.  If you plan to stay part-time I would recommend a different job or only staying for a year.
good,"The day starts with a team huddle in the morning to go over the appointments that are scheduled for the day and to plan when lunches are best to be taken and when. Then the CSR's  get ready to open their drawers and complete all the tasks at hand. be prepared for many changes from the team market and from managers. The best part of the day is seeing your regular customers and getting to know them really well so that you can offer products that best suit them. After the day is done with customers there is still work to be done in order to go home for the night. It usually takes about an hour to an hr and half to complete. The hardest part of the job is when  you are the only one on the teller line and you get a long line of angry customers that need to be serviced. and there is no help provided."
good,Management was chosen on spur of the moment because several teams were developed. My manager could not read very well and would not learn the processes herself. Many team manager in department were the same. About 1/2 of the unit managers were the same way...they acted like they were entitled to be there (not for work).
good,I would go in and work hard to reach my incentive. The most part I enjoyed was meeting new people and taking classes to better myself. The hardest part of the job was dealing with negative people all the time.
good,"It is a quiet place, nicely decorated with a professional look. The other employees are nice. It does get busy quite often and you have a lot to do. They do require (or did when I was there) selling or upgrading accounts, credit cards, mortgages, etc."
good,stressful work environment and was required to perform many tasks with base salary that wasn't very competitive. Did not feel like i received enough support from management.
good,Collection of data and ensuring all clients received theirs payments by the due date. Cross-referencing documents with financial documents on a daily basis.
good,"I enjoyed being a teller. However, the job became increasingly about pushing credit cards and home loans instead of taking care of the customer. When you would get someone to agree to see a personal banker, they often had to wait over an hour for assistance."
good,I would have loved to stay but my contract ended. Was offered the position but I decided to take another position with another company. Management of great.
good,"I was let go from this employer after dedicating more than 12 years to their company.  I worked mandatory and volunatary overtime.  I was moved from departments and to different team leaders without as much as an interest in my opinion.  My most recent manager was terrible with  subordinates, micromanaging and sneaky in her tactics. I was granted a severance after my lay off that  has gotten me through the holidays as I was let go less than 6 weeks before Christmas so that the bottom line at the end of the fiscal year was healthy.  I was very loyal to this company and over the years gained many new and useful skills and expertise.  I could have been transferred to a different department or area instead of being terminated but they push the work to other countries where people do the work for less money, less benefits, and also less expertise and communication skills.   I am having to start my career over, after over a decade, in this economy with a family to support.   I am disappointed in what BOA has become in regards to its treatment of their employees."
good,"typical day at work: 9-6 full on day"
good,"I enjoyed working at BOA. A typical day started with meetings and centered on daily goals and any personal achievements. Many times the meetings would go left and end up taking too much time and this is crucial in an production environment. I learned how to multi task and work in a very fast paced environment. Management was ok but largely out of touch to the needs and demands of the job. The culture was open and accommodating to all ethnicity and genders. The hardest part of the job were the irrational production metrics as my and many department jobs centered around making requests for documentation or information. If you've called, emailed and faxed a request for information you could still fall short of production goals if the client simply didnt send the information so in essence you did your job but could still lose your job, smh. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping clients stay in their homes, attain home ownership or refinance to a lower rate thus helping them to live better."
good,"Great company with a lot of people, however, technology training was not available for me at least - Some Management did not complete college -  politics is too high across the teams and associates. No room to move up the management ladder. "
good,"In a typical work day, as a Customer Service Rep, we dealt with customer calls regarding their checking/savings accounts."
good,"Review closed accounts for settlement"
good,Stressful goals and management style.  Managers are not always well versed in processes.  Great benefits.  Team oriented.  Very competitive.  Fast paced quick changing environment.
good,I truely loved working for BOA. My initial manager was on of the best. She knew the  strengths of her employees and made sure that they were promoted accordingly. The last manager that I had which caused me to leave the company was a tyrant. She did not care and was only concerned about her bonus and looking good to upper management at any cause. We clashed and I was not the one. She blamed me for a mistake she did and that was a wrap.
good,"it was a good job to have while attending school but a teller salary on its own is not enough to afford the cost of living. the staff I worked with were great, but ive always been lucky to have great co workers."
good,"It's a nice place to work at, decent work life balance, and the people are nice. Unfortunately if you're a contractor you may or may not be moved to a full time role. If you do, then you'll need to move to Texas while the bank does not pay for moving expenses. In addition, there are many more contractors than there are full time employees it seems. Good talent is lost, simply because the bank won't convert them to a full time role or circumstances won't allow it. Also, after a year or so when the contract ends, they will need to hire someone else who doesn't have the experience of the bank's infrastructure as the person before, which in turn leads to a slow down in productivity."
good,"Technological innovation is not that fast at Bank of America. It can be improved. "
good,"If you're fresh out of college, 22-27 years old, this is the best place to work. They have a great rotation program and teach you a lot of advanced Excel skills and give you a lot of different product knowledge.  This program is cutthroat and the future leadership of the firm usually comes from there. However, for 27+ hired from outside the rotation program, and especially for parents, there is no hope of career advancement or raises.   Benefits for parents are minimal versus competition. Other Wall Street firms have onsite free daycare."
good,Great place to learn a lot about the industry. The company definitely has some great health benefits. The discount program is awesome as well. I think the pay can me more competitive though.
good,"Working her the mangers were extremely cut throat due to upper management setting extremely high goals, the threat of layoffs made it an extremely toxic environment towards the end of my time there."
good,"I enjoyed my time as a bank teller at Bank of America, my only issue would be the required quotas. I understand the need to let customers know that the bank offers additional products & services however, to force them to hit sales quotas, especially as a TELLER*, does a disservice.  I enjoyed interacting with my customers however felt pressured to force products & services onto them because there was a quota over my head."
good,My work and life balance was awful. We were overworked and under staffed and upper management didn't seem to care. I had great leadership with in my branch.
good,"Very chaotic, very unorganized, too political- good medical benefits- too many hours at work- the edge system absolutely horrible- in the phone with IT most of the time."
good,It is not challenging work but essentially meaningless. Little to no recognition from management. Benefits are good. Goals are easy to reach. Management is overall accomodating
good,Low pay. Low morale. No loyalty to associates that have been there decades. Lay-offs are a daily worry. The juice is not worth the squeeze. Best to look outside of Boa.
good,The company was good to me for many years.  Their philosophy related to remote working has taken several steps backwards which has cost them to miss out on some great talent. They are a very Charlotte-centric company.
good,I loved my job with the bank. I thought I would still be there but you never know what's right around the corner. They implemented a new computer system and it started processing some of the work. The more they tweeked it the less work we had to process.
good,"Low work life balance "
good,"Bank of America is a great company to work for. There are many opportunities to move to different departments but  is often quite difficult as it sometimes selected based on who you know not what you know. We are steady with business which allows me the ablility to learn more and show my time management and multi-tasking skills.  "
good,When I made mistakes supervisors would have an attitude. May times I would be stuck in an issue with no one to help me resolve it. I would be asked to go home many times with unreasonable answers when I asked why.
good,"Bank of america is a wonderful company to work for.  You learn many skills like multi-tasking, and interpersonal communication, and get plebty of experience learning about managerial tasks before moving into the position"
good,The work environment of the company is good. Its one of the fastest growing company and making profits. very hygiene   environment and one imp thing is women s safety and proving  the home pick and drop facility and food coupons.
good,"I was a teller thank to my co-workers I was able to handle the clients that came through to our branch but it was touch dealing with the people that lived in the area very rude, scary, and over barring."
good,"It is a good place to work. But growth is totally dependent on whom you know and where you are located. Good salary, benefits, but it is a mistake that they have taken away the work from home facility"
good,Bank of America was a pleasant place but the final supervisor i had was not a match for me. I was only on my team that knew how to do certain loans but it did not make any difference to him. My manager had no experience in doing mortgages.
good,"I came in as a subcontractor.  The culture was very business like, and stiff at times.  "
good,"As long as you maintain your goals and score card good then you'll be fine with management.  Customers are nice if you're nice but of course there is always that one bad customer every now and then.  This job is a good job the only thing I would not recommend is to become an Rb.  Rb's are ""in charge"" of doing too many things in the financial center and are not really appreciated.  They make only $1 dollar more than what a teller makes.  Besides that the management makes you feel unnappreciated.  Customers are the ones telling me that I'm an asset to the company instead of management.  Therefore, if you're going to go into a financial center setting then strive to either be a teller or a Relationship Manager (Personal Banker)."
good,"This provided the opportunity to work with some extremely smart people, and was great from that perspective. However, senior management were not in touch with the workforce."
good,I did not always agree with ways we were instructed to handle customers.  I was denied the idea to increase my hours to full-time and reducing hours of third teller.  I enjoyed my co-workers especially branch manager and teller supervisor.
good,"Inbound calls assisting mortgage borrowers with any questions regarding their mortgage "
good,"An OK Place to work. Many existing clicks and friendships dominate the teams, so there is difficulty to break the mediocrity to make something awesome. If you want to coast this is the place for you"
good,It paid quite well. A lot of activity. I liked working there. I especially enjoyed the people I worked with. It was a team environment. I went through several layoffs before I became one.
good,"Some managers have certain people they will choose to promote and don't give people who are in the role to advance in the career. Management needs to improve their promoting skills to not only people they know, but employees who deserve the promotion."
good,"Working in the Bank of America File Vault was a nice experience. You work with a great team and the work is not too difficult. You will be standing for long periods of time though, so you'll need to work with comfortable shoes."
good,"we would process and review appraisals, income and collections  to make sure everything was in order for the approval for the home loan..  We would work on around 50 loans at a time while answering phones and any questions that other team mates had..   The job was very high paced ."
good,"I enjoyed working at Merrill Lynch.  It is a great place to be a manager in; they have some terrific people working there.  I think once the merger between BofA and ML was complete, a whole host of new requirements were put in place.  Significant oversight and attendant paperwork became the norm."
good,"I loved working here...bc of the people. However we had to learn questions and the answers to these questions that really had nothing to do with being a teller...all for a surprise audit that happens yearly. It was so stressful during these months of preparing. Other than the harp of that, I loved it."
good,Typical work day included completing 20+ audits a day.Great benefits and work environment. Great place to work and advance in your career.
good,"A grat place to work, job stability is the only issue. There were so many changes during my employment period. Moving people around and letting people go."
good,"Overall, I would have to say Bank of America is a good place to work. As with most companies you are required to do your jobs as well as someone else. The work environment depending on Business or Consumer side is very different. Business side is more open to one on one dialect where Consumer side is more of a dictatorship. The working environment over the last few years has become very challenging. Like all financial institutions Regulations and guidelines have made it difficult to tend to the customer. Benefits are very good."
good,"this is a ok job enviorment, indoors mostly sitting 99% of your day. pay is ok, with ok bonuses. this job isnt for everyone"
good,Merrill Lynch is a great company. I appreciate the company's strong culture for client service.  However the work environment is very competitive. In additional the management team lacks support for professional development.
good,Data entry that needed to be done in a fast paced work environment. Needed to be detailed oriented to do the job as the information you were inputting was in regards to IRS.
good,"The environment i work in was very strict, we had to take test weekly and go to meeting outside my zip code, but i was able to handle it."
good,If you enjoy the sales environment. This is the place for you. But the company offers great benifits. But to advance you must be a top performer that is the only way to be placed in a different position.
good,"Merrill lynch has great training, but don't forget, at the end of the day this is a sales job with a lot of people that have ""made it"" walking around that make you either work harder or fall to the side.  There are a lot of politics in this business, but Merrill seems to have a good culture which is always connected to the headquarters office in NYC.  "
good,Bank of America is a great place to work and learn.  There are many different areas to move in to.. They  also encourage volunteering.  They give you the resources to learn.
good,"Firm and its management has changed greatly since my time with the organization to make a review relative. At the time of my departure, the Finance organization was great but changing as the business management was changing."
good,"I enjoyed my time with my staff and clients, but my commute was about 4 hours per day reason why I resigned, Tried to move but my intimidate boss was not very cooperative"
good,"I learned several processes within the After-Sale department. I worked with FHA, VA claims processing as well as the audit group .  For a short period, but continuously worked as a on - the - job coach to provide feedback and tools to help improve processes and associates goals / production levels."
good,non-stop calls from customer calling in regards to credit cards. i learned the in/outs of having credit and what impacts credit scores. management was seemingly unorganized. i love my co-workers they can be quiet pleasant
good,"Ability to work and provide exceptional customer service and is recognized by the customer via social media not only for oneself but for the Company, management and team environment."
good,Not a bad place to work but not the greatest. The benefits are pretty good and the pay is decent. Not much room for advancement in some of the departments. The schedule is subject to change without notice.
good,"With the ever changing environment, there is something new to be learned daily.  Management is professional,  knowledgeable and supportive. Opportunities to expand knowledge is encouraged."
good,"Nice environment for training; proactive and stimulating. Enjoyed creating educational environment with employees, getting good feedback from them as students and enjoyed training the trainer."
good,Good People to work with and for.  Learned quickly with the proper training.  Room for advancement.  Certain situations were MGR's are unable to contact for Management questions.
good,"As a contract worker, I found the B of A supervisor easy to work with.  No benefits for contract workers from B of A, hard to become FTE.  Contracted assignment did not last as long as initially stated."
good,"I am grateful for the opportunity that I was given to be able to work at Bank of America. I initially started as a temporary worker, but than was blessed to be hired full time. I thoroughly enjoyed my time when I was at Bank of America and the people that I worked with. I still keep in contact with a few of my old co-workers to this day."
good,"Management was not flexible with my schedule. There were many disgruntled workers.  Management only cared about sales and not about the customer experience. "
good,My overall experience with Bank of America was very positive.  Decent pay and benefits.  However there is little if any job growth or attempt from management to retain skilled workers.
good,"It was a great experience working there, sales training was very good, managers where typical corporate sales types, everything is for sale, enjoyed meeting new clients and make them happy with the productswe offered"
good,"A typical work day involves being able to accept routine and constant change.  I learned to be flexible and keep an open mind.  Positive interaction with management and co-workers assists in growth and meting required goals."
good,The pace wasn't fast enough for me but it was a great job with benefits overall. It's hard to get out of the banking center as well.
good,"BAC is shrinking it's presence in Jacksonville, FL and eliminating many mortgage functions. Bank has good benefits. Bank is shrinking mortgage exposure. Coworkers are excellent."
good,NA banking industry for BOA is different for all people and .demographics. Very successful company and wish nothing but the best for them moving forward.
good,"As we are supporting banking centers all over the world we have 5000+ branches so we support all branches."
good,good placce to work for. lots of employee benefits and advanment. good work envoriments. Lot of work and a fast paced envoriment. All in all a great place to work for
good,I have enjoyed working for Bank of America. Its given me the advantage of working with people of all walks of life. Customer service is a big part of the job and i enjoy interacting with customers.
good,"High call volumes, crunching numbers, learned customer service/financial administrative roles."
good,"Each day new subpoenas are assigned. I am responsible for handling a case load of about 80 cases. Ordering, filing, billing, and shipping the necessary for each case. The responsibilities include researching specific customer accounts and complying with the legal request in a timely fashion."
good,"Provided clients with information, data and advice, as well as respond to inquiries or complaints from clients as well as manage difficult situations with clients "
good,"The sales goals are unrealistic and careen development is non-existent.  Management only cares about daily sales and does not invest time in advancing your career.  Quarterly bonuses are small, even when you exceed expectations.  Good entry-level position to learn the banking world.  But, apply-out once you complete your 1 year."
good,"Fund place to work if you like interacting with difference people every day. But if you stay at the same branch for more than 2 years, you start to notice the same faces come into the banking center and they need the same services. The end of the day, you need to drive revenue that how you get pay for so you need to sale.  Goal is higher and harder to reach.   Co worker seen nice but they are not, when they talk about team work, just for saying but everybody is worry about themselves. I dont know about other branch but my branch is horrible regarding communication."
good,"My job has changed over the years, I loved being a charge off rep..I work 10 hours a 10 day taking calls and making credit decisions out of the que. I have been there for 18 years and would like to see what I can bring to a new company."
good,I worked overnight the entire weekend while I was in college. Needless to say I didn't sleep much. The pay was great at the time and opportunities for advancement or cross train were possible.I loved my team and the management. However because women make up 98% of the employees there was a lot of drama and cattiness. It sometimes felt like being in high school. The benefits were amazing and they paid for parking downtown.
good,"Bank of America offers great benefits and decent hourly pay.  The opportunity for advancement is there, if you can play the politics game."
good,Since 2009 it has not been the same place it used to be an awesome place to work. I don't know what changed. the pay is not good at all.
good,"Best item was the short commute to the office, a luxury in Los Angeles county.  Management was willing over my five year tenure to train staff on several different processes to keep them employed as long as possible until recently."
good,"Bank of America provides great opportunities to grow from an entry-level role to management and analyst positions.  Many of the larger call centers make an effort to insert fun moments into a daily shift to show their appreciation for the work that the associate is doing. They are necessarily requiring and provide opportunities for additional responsibility, especially if you ask.  Bank of America is a great place to work both for the person who just wants to come in, do their job, and leave, as well as for the person who wants to get more involved in their work culture.  They encourage volunteerism and most lines of business will pay from 2 to 8 hours each month for an associate to give back to their community.  They also support programs that make it easier for their workers to maintain a certain quality of life, and provide subsidized childcare facilities, gyms, and initiatives to improve the health of their employees through ""challenges"" that focus on nutrition and exercise.  I have been pleased with my benefits package."
good,"Call and assist people on their troubled credit items daily."
good,Provided car dealers and loan holders with lien information and payoff amounts.  Ranked #1 in credit card promotions. Work schedule was conducive to keeping personal appointments.
good,"I enjoyed working with my fellow teammates and other co-workers. I also enjoyed speaking to and working with the customers that I was assigned to. Management on the other hand, well lets just say that I enjoyed working under some of the managers that I was assigned to. Other managers had no business being manager due to the fact that they had no people skills."
good,"Day starts with different tasks, defects, trouble shooting "
good,"Was a temp employee there and management was fair, but typical call center environment. Cafe is on bottom floor and priced ok."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with our High Net Worth clients as well as building, growing and strengthening their relationship with Bank of America / Merrill Lynch."
good,Merrill Lynch is a good company that is trying to improve their Financial Advisor base.  Currently they are still ironing out the details about the best way to train advisors but it is a good company to work for.  They have good benefits and it is a great environment to work.  The company is more focused on their bottom line and whatever they have to do to get there.  They are not willing to provide the appropriate resources to individuals that are struggling but earnest in their efforts.
good,"only inbound calls from customers on small business , was a new venture for me that I developed so well in almost 2 years , no good management , good co-workers . The most hard at the beginning was be on the phone for customer service , since I've only done ob sales . The most exited experience was to get a lot more knowledge on banking market"
good,I was able to work at different location at times helping 20-25 customers a day this has shown me how to take of customers initial need first. I'm a people person so the best part of my day is working with customers. I look forward to new challenges and being part of a new team.
good,At this time the company has this department doing projects for compliance.  One will have to be flexible and willing to learn quickly about the projects.  Which is an assets to ones resume. My co-workers or great and willing to teach what they know.  The hardest part of the job not knowing what the next few months will be whether or not a job or a lay off.
good,"I initially handled processing second mortgages, from application to closing by gathering all needed information from customers and vendors, and loan officers. Once that department closed I was moved to first mortgage. Answering telephones, sending faxes, team meetings, managing customer files, and working closely with the closing, and underwriting department were just a few of the things I completed on a daily basis to ensure I turned out the best work. I had many customers call me to thank me for all my hard work to get them into their homes."
good,A structured place to work for a mainframe programmer. Always daily problems arise where analyst skills are involved to reach solutions
good,i have learned to work under pressure.Most of the tims we used to work under pressure.
good,Not bad job but would like to be compensated more for what I do
good,I have been working in team spirits handling many databases working on the routine day to day DBA works and also engaged in the performance tuning and troubleshooting.
good,took inbound calls for website support. help customers with unlocking accounts and changing passwords.
good,The later years  held the position of Customer Relationship Manager.
good,Answer phones and patch customers to their desired account manager. Light customer service. Learned how to be even more patient. Great management and co -wokers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with really snobby clients and the best part was making those same clients happy.
good,I like to work life balance through FlexWork program called MyWork(aka WFH).
good,The office politics were not great and alot of the managers acted unprofessional
good,"There is constant change here and being able to adapt to change is a must. The capability to know and learn different job functions is a plus because you never know when it is needed. My manager is very associate friendly and very attentive to your needs. The most enjoyable part about working there are your co workers, they help yo uget the day when all else fails. Comradery and friendship goes a long way."
good,"Recording ans consolidating data, validating links, and sending emails. I learned how to use different formulas in excel and how to merged together different data. My manager is really cool she is always willing to help me and learn with me. My colleagues are very interesting and very into the work they do. The hardest part of my job is meeting1 person a day because they are so busy. The most enjoyable part is when I finally do get a chance to sit and talk with them I learned many different things about the bank."
good,"Good benefit, I work for Bank of America overs 25 year I enjoy working and learn a lot from this bank."
good,"I loved the morals and culture at the bank, such as their strong influence on volunteering.  It's important to me to work for a company that has the same morals and values that I do."
good,"People were friendly"
good,"A great place to work. Merrill knows the market and has the personnel to back it up."
good,"It was a nice job, but I needed better hours to suit my life in which would also allow me to get back into school. I left to relocate to Ohio should I not be able to find a better opportunity within the city by the end of April."
good,"I learned that the Banks is never closed... I also learned how to stay on my feet in the grave yard shift... The hardest things about this job was working at night, and trying to stay awake at night and learning to sleep in the day."
good,"Fast pace, change and a well rounded place to learn. Bank of America has given me the skills to work in a low supervisor atmosphere as well as keep me abreast of different positions within the company."
good,"-Compose and maintain one page analytical summaries to field"
good,I learned a lot at this job. It was my first professional setting and it gave my career a good jump start.
good,"A typical day at work was analyzing information and determining trends to coordinate special projects that required extensive research to complete daily work tasks."
good,They know how to be better but they do not want to because they do not make money that way.
good,I was able to manage accounts from 5 different states. Work was stable.Managers were easy to work with. Not much growth job wise. I wasn't able to shine and show my true talents and abilities. I wanted to bring more value to the company. I felt lost in the corporation.
good,The hardest part of the job was doing the daily analysis of the derivative work but it was quite knowledgeable and experienced part.
good,"count money "
good,"My time at Bank of America had enormous amounts of opportunity to utilize your skills in real scenarios. The constant need for innovation and  ""outside of the box thinking"" was refreshing. "
good,"fast-paced, evolving environment.  Productive , detail-oriented. Friendly, courteous, family-oriented."
good,"Good company to work for. Like all companies, the work environment is not without flaws, but the opportunties are great, and the the people they hire are very nice."
good,"Great company to work for if you have no life, friends, family, etc. It is extremely hard to get promoted.  A very very political place to work for.  You do not get properly compensated for the amount of work they ask you to do.  Sales goals are insanely high and alot of pressure to make goals.  Your experience with the company depends on how your manager is, I have had great managers and horrible managers and work life is alot less stressful with the great managers.  The only HUGE plus is the benefits, fantastic benefits.  of course, i love the banking hours (9-5, 9-1 at some locations on saturdays, off work sundays and federal holidays)."
good,Fun work  place  great place to grow in the company and great benfits
good,They promote individual growth. Able to learn from different teams. Allow advancement within the company.
good,"-8-9 hour days"
good,"When I first started for Bank of America, I instantly fell in love with my job and couldn't wait for what the next step would be. I was quickly promoted to a Teller Operations Specialist after six months of working for Bank of America. When I first took the position of Teller Operations Specialist I was very excited to be in management again, was working for a great team, and had a wonderful leader. I was also able to balance my work and home life, and it allowed me to still spend time with my children. Over my last year at Bank of America, the bank began to undergo changes, the job duties kept coming, but the recognition, drive, and support for leaders in the banking center, and in the market began to slowly decline. I was responsible for training the tellers, tracking their referrals, helping customers with service complaints and issues, ensure that all bank documentation was appropriately filed and all daily reports were up to date and printed in the event we received an audit. In addition to those tasks, I was also responsible for our cash order, balancing and maintaining the main vault, and servicing our ATM's. Furthermore, I was responsible for employee documentation, schedules, and time off. In April, the bank decided that they were going to remove the Teller Operations Specialist position and I was laid off."
good,"My role requires an unceasing entrepreneurial self-starting drive.  I spend 80% of my time prospecting for new clients.  Those efforts largely consist of cold-calling and over the phone presentations and proposals.  The remaining 20% of my day is centered around investment due dilligence and analyzing macroeeconomic news.  The most enjoyable part of the position is its never ending nature, there is always a fish in the sea waiting to be caught.  The hardest part of the job is the consistent failure rate before success."
good,"Work work work......... "
good,"The people I worked with were First Class. The Best."
good,"I am currently a college senior student and working at the bank over a year. Honestly, I have learned so much at the workplace, especially my communication skill improved. The job required a lot of efficiency and accuratecy, however, the downside is the job is far way underpaid. If anyone is like me, who is still a student and wanted to a part-time job, I would recommended you to apply for the teller position, otherwise you might want to consider other banks because you would not earn enough to support youself or your family. Overall, I like the work culture at my branch, everyone is friendly and helpful,"
good,"Balance Final HUD-1 settlement and set up wire for loan disbursement"
good,"BAC is a good company  to work for with many different advantages."
good,"BOA, is a great door opener for anyone looking to enter the professional corperate world. The hardest part of the job would be meeting company goals, lack of strong leadership and lack of staffing."
good,"I like with the people I work with. We just don't have enough work to keep us busy. "
good,"A typical day at B of A varies, each banking center is unique. Some days you are bombarded with customer related issues, others bank related. You're constantly training and studying for semi-annual ""audits"", which can be stressful because pass or fail of this audit reflects directly on to management. That being said, management is constantly on you to study during slow time and at home. For the most part, most co-workers are easy going. I've had my share of shady co-workers but then again, who hasn't. I think the most enjoyable part of the job is the customer interaction. The people you work for can be annoying with their demands but there are a lot that begin to treat you as a friend. I built a lot of relationships with customers that grew to the point where they would bring me food or gifts. I was always reluctant to accept, but they always insisted. "
good,This job has helped me alot in improving my technical skills. My people skills and communication skills has improved a lot through this job. I am also required to achieve certain referral goals everyday and I have done so successfully. The hardest part of the job was referral but I did not stop trying and meet and exceeded every single that was expected from me.

good,"In-bound call center for mortgage loans. It would get busy and calls would come in back to back,it made the day go by faster. I learned different aspects of mortgage such as the insurance,taxes, and coverage. I enjoyed working with my co-workers as a team. The manager was just as helpful when it came to helping make the team better for performance. Customer satisfaction was our goal and we got awards for that. The hardest part was when I had an irate customer on the phone and had to transfer to the right department for complaint because I wanted to help solve the issue. The most enjoyable was when we had events because our center was the highest in customer satisfaction overall for the month!!"
good,"Work was very repetitive, but that was the nature of the assignment. Coming from the Midwest to Miami, FL, I was exposed to a very diverse group of associates and had the privilege of learning about the Latin culture and expanding my Spanish speaking ability."
good,Great Company to work for
good,The work days can be long
good,"This company offer good benefits. However, the level of stress is ridiculous."
good,"I started with Country wide and they put over three months of training in mortgage. Once it switched to Bank of America the education didn't stop. You get allot of knowledge because the training and application of that training never stop. The job itself is stressful because deliver allot a difficult messages throughout the day. I understand where the costumers are coming from so I don't blame them. Since you are the voice of Bank Of America mortgage to that person, they unload all they have on you. If you have tough skin its a good job. If you don't you'll be miserable. On the down side, there are allot of constant changes to policy. This is not so much the Banks fault, rather constant government guideline changes and investor rules always changing. This means Bank of America creates policies on the fly. No time for beta testing so you find out the problems with it as you go, but that's banking. If you can't handle it, its not for you. The other current problem is job security. If your in origination its still there, if you in default servicing, that's drastically changing. It affects the environment to. There is no advance notice. When you used to not mind coming into work because of the activities and social environment there, now its cold and kind of oppressive. It's work hard no fun so your not the first to get laid off."
good,fast work place and got along with everyone. enjoyed working with everyone and everyone was a team player.
good,"During my time with Bank of America, I was able to grow myfixed income and derivative product knowledge, knowledge of Risk and P&L reporting, and overall understanding of financial markets. The company enabled me to grow myself as an individual employ and as helped me develop myself as a leader and manager of people."
good,Great play but management treats you like numbers and not people.
good,long commute
good,This company is an overall great company to work for. There is a huge variety of employment and is world wide. The benefits are excellant.
good,"Bank of America, N.A. Charlotte, NC"
good,but its not and the Financial advisors position has a one percent success rate
good,"The company pays for licensing and rudimentary training, which is a big plus in the financial services industry. Once series exams are completed the company lets you off leash to start your sales career. The sales goals are through the roof and set up in a way to all but ensure your exit from the firm within the first 12 to 24 months. The goals are to the advantage of the firm; you the salesperson bring in your personal network of assets to be let go with minimal cost to them. Your non-compete forces you to leave those assets with the firm and move on with paid licensing and your feet wet in the sales industry. Good luck!"

Created daily, weekly , and monthly contests to promote teamwork."
good,Bank of America has one of the best training programs for new employees
good,"The corporate culture and focus is filled with the right words, but the actual follow-through on those words is sorely lacking."
good,"Lack of effective leadership is so prevalent in large corporate culture that I'm pleased to have accomplished as much as I have. The final years of my tenure with the back were in a technical support capacity, having worked in numerous customer service, sales, and supervisory role over the years. I witnessed nothing but a steady decline in the quality of the workplace, due to mergers and takeovers, and did my best to adapt to the constant changes. The so-called leadership only became more removed from the actual work being done, and mired in constant meetings simply isolated themselves from what was actually going on. Typical of most large corporations today."
good,Bank of America works with employees to achieve work life balance. It depends on the group you work in how much flexibility is allowed.
good,"No room for error, policy and procedures are to be followed at all times. Strong emphasis on sales goals and customer service."
good,I didn't work there long enough to really rate the criteria properly
good,"Post Closing at BOA was a new program implemented for the multitudes of mortgages BOA had purchased. I knew there would be changes to the guildlines and procedures during this temporary assignments once the ""kinks"" were worked out. Adapting to constant changes (for me) wasn't a problem. It was expected; even with the first group of employees hired, I was amongst them, we assisted with new procedures to our productions and exceeding our office daily goal. This enable new hiree's to understand what procedures they needed to follow. The hardest part of the job; receiving a conference call from our branch in California on Thursday just before 4 pm stating our department had to change all the notaries and witnesses on the LNA's. This was a project that amounted in the 1000's and 90% of the printed documents had been Fed Ex to the California office. Most of the co-workers complained (to me - it's a waste of time instead of working to find a solution) but, I knew it would take abit of time, since all the documents were saved on the computers, it was just a matter of 'find and replace' the changes necessary and simply emailed those already completed documents back to California while the remaining documents were changed, printed and then Fed Ex. Granted, some of us worked overtime to make the changes, but the project was completed at the end of the next day. That challenge was the most self-satisifying part of my job."
good,Crossfire Consulting
good,"Typical workday consists of listing properties on the MLS, making informative decisions on repairing and rehabbing, ratifying contracts and working with QA department to ensure accuracy, negotiating offers, following up on Escrows and guiding files through the close of Escrow.Reading pivot tables, Excel spreadsheets and analyzing data."
good,"hours worked great for family time, management at the beginning was outstanding until the bank went into a different direction and started caring more about the company and money than about the customers."
good,"this place offered many great benefits and job training. however, it was poorly managed as my manager no longer works with the company. there were paid vacations and sick days, which made it easier to schedule things outside of work."
good,A typical day at work for me is when the systems or running slow or down..
good,It was a pretty cool place to work the pay was a little low for the work load but I loved my coworkers. My manager was a little lazy and taught us how to open accounts and do other managerial duties.
good,• eCommerce Production
good,"8 years of experience in banking on my resume are from working at Bank of America. Unfortunately, it was hard for me to move back up after I decided to go from Assistant Manager to Personal Banker.

good,Reconcile all the suspense transactions from the suspense account and create a journal entries to reclass the suspense transactions to the proper account.
good,"A typical day: A high level of production, with minimal errrors is expected."
good,"Not the most challanging work. Not a lot of opportunity for advancement. AVP, VP, SVP are a dime a dozen, titles are pretty much meaningless there. Great work life balance though. Pay was all right, but very little raises while employed there."
good,A typical day at work is routine and the time goes fast. I learned how to handle my customers up to boa expectation. Management is always there to ask questions or to help better employees. My co workers and I help each other with our strength and weaknesses. The hardest part of my job trying to reach and help every customer I come on contact with. The most enjoyable part of my job are the customers I am able to help.

good,ok place to work with good benefits.  locations are all over the globe so locations are convenient. Some managers let employees work from home.  steps for success are confusing.
good,"Started in August of this year and I got to say it’s a lot of information to remember during training, which lasted for two months.  You have two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch.  It’s difficult when there’s so much you don’t know and you struggle to tell the customer why their card was blocked or what’s going on even when you don’t even know.  Lots of angry customers, which puts a Strain on your mentality"

good,I had a great team of accounting representatives.  Our jobs were very detailed oriented with numbers but we managed to enjoy our jobs! Our management team worked at unity in the team.
good,"The work was easy for me. There were 10 hour days sitting in one place. Some complained it was like jail bc you're expected to stay in your seat all day. I was fine with it bc I'm not much of a socializer. It was a production based job so what do you expect? My concern was the back pain and carpal tunnel from sitting and repetitive motions. Also, a 3rd party came in and outsourced the dept. We all were forced into taking a position with the new company or lose our jobs with no severance pay. We still work our same positions but horrible benefits, no raises, and cut out certain holidays. That didn't sit right with many of us. The morale of the dept really took a big hit."

The merge of Countrywide and Bank of America was smooth - I loved the Countrywide way and I loved the Bank of America way - what I didn't love was the CHL legacy upper management didn't conform to BAC's management policies.  I was terrified of my boss' who initially were legacy CHL employees."

good,Processed and reviewed 7 to 10 loan modifications daily.  I learned banking guidelines rules and regulations.  Management was stern.  Independant workplace culture.  The hardest part of this job was the 100 mile commute. The most enjoyable aspect of this particular job was helping costumers save their homes.
good,The size and diverse business lines made it easy to follow new opportuties outside of your current functions.  This allowed them to retain their talent while giving the employee an opportunity to explore new interests.
good,"I left a few years after the crash in 2008.  The culture changed after that, but before that, working for Bank of America was the thing I was most proud of in my life."
good,Employee friendly company. Offers plenty of industry specific training and support to the employees. Good fit in case you are looking for proper work - life balance.
good,"Getting badge for the day "
good,"Busy but supportive working environment. Good if interested in credit card banking sector and starting on telephony, so a lot of talking to customers on the phone. There is a sales target aspect and some time constraints in the amount of time expected to resolve issues."
good,Being able to interface with customers is a skill set that can be enhanced with the training you are given.  Getting them into the products they need is a skill that they developed with perpetual training.
good,Unrealistic expectations for Financial Center Ops Managers and not enough compensation for the job load. You’re expected to perform your role along with every other role in the financial center. You pretty much do more than what the actual manager does for half the pay.
good,"Overall my years with the bank were very rewarding.  They offered tremendous opportunities in flexible and/or remote work locations.  With the push in the industry to move worker back into the office, it created problem for those who were not near  ""core"" location and who could not up and move again.  So unfortunately those people either moved on to other companies voluntarily or were RIf'd."
good,"-Management was not great, lots of backstabbing and throwing each other under the bus. Management also not well-trained in leadership skills or how to handle difficult situations."
good,"Clients are always a key focus. Customer first enviroment. Can be fast paced at tmes. Cold calling, appointment booking, working wit partners is a must."
good,Bank of America closed many of its locations and laid off many people in the Ventura county and greater LA area.  Bank began to use vendors for loan processing and underwriting.
good,Good benefits but a bit difficult to move up the corporate ladder. Workplace culture is friendly and management is helpful. Leaned a lot and will be able to use the tools learned in the future.
good,I enjoyed working at Bank of America but seeknig career advancement and found another good company. I would work there again. Needs to work on their company culture.
good,"A typical day at Bank of America was passing out mail and checking queues for quality purposes.  The hardest part of the day to day job was dealing with each personality on any given day,  The most enjoyable part of the job was the celebrations and milestones we had together throughout the many years."
good,Culture is very accepting and welcoming. Work well done is recognized and rewarded. Management is responsive and approachable. Typical day is mostly spent communicating electronically.
good,"serviced commercial clients with accuracy and client delight. commercial contact center is JD Power certified. Bank maintains Associate Satisfaction , Company Culture and core values."
good,"It was a good experience realtionwise, but I didn't enjoy the tech part in the bank since it was quite robust and I did not get to do a lot of fun stuff."
good,"i worked with credit call services where you take calls, collections, process payments. the best part of the job was getting off early when you made goals."
good,"The company has Good Benefits, the company has good management support, the company has the ability to see internal job openings and to apply for those positions."
good,"I didn't work at an actual bank, I worked at one of their processing centers. A typical day at work was pretty simple. You clocked in and were told what to work on. My specific department I was basically a file clerk. I went through forms and filed them. But I was able to go to two other departments to be cross trained and learn those departments as well. The management and supervisors were phenomenal. They worked with us. The hardest part of the job would have to be when we had busy seasons. People would be doing all kinds of different tasks and you really had to pay attention and listen to your supervisors. Best part of the job would have to be how nice and easy everyone is to get along with and how much they appreciate your work, which is something I have never seen at any other job. A personal thank you after every shift. That amazed me."
good,Bank Of America's  corporate culture provides a stable environment for growth.  It is quite easy to get lost but also good for stability and security.
good,The technology at Bank of america is phenomenal. Sales goals are high with pressure from upper management to exceed those goals and fulfill the behaviors.
good,I worked every part of a mortgage loan.I started in foreclosure went to Reverse mortgage then to Loan closing. In that time I learned everything from how to  Originate a loan to how to close them
good,Pay is decent but be prepared for constant change with goals getting more aggressive with every quarter and policy and procedures constantly changing...all this with out enough visibility as to why
good,"Our diversity makes us stronger, and is essential to our ability to serve our clients, fulfill our purpose and drive responsible growth. We recognize the potential of every employee by actively encouraging a diverse and inclusive workplace — in thought, style, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, disability, culture and experience."
good,"Bank of America is a good place to work, but not for slackers. Show up, do your job and advancement is likely. Many internal advancements are possible for those who show commitment and talent."
good,"While I enjoyed the people I worked with, on a day to day basis, I felt I had poor management. It created a cut-throat atmosphere, and made it uncomfortable and stressful, to be at work. I am a hard worker, and take pride in being able to work well, with most anyone."
good,I have worked in Fraud for 16 years while I was raising two daughters. It allowed me the hours to fit for my families schedules. I also attended Kennesaw State University part-time while working full time when my daughters got to an age that I was not needed as much. I graduated This spring with a Bachelors of Science in Criminal Justice. Bank of America offered tuition assistance which I was able to use for the last two years. I love the commute I live four and a half miles from the call center in Kennesaw.
good,Bank of America is a top bank in the world with best in class employees who put clients' interests first.  The company has a discipline approach to driving responsible growth and operational excellence.
good,I've worked at two different departments and have learned quite a bit. For the most part you can transfer departments every 12 months that way you are continually challenging yourself if you want to.
good,"Was an all right place to work, nothing too exciting or too bad. Monday through Friday 9-5, come in do your job and go home. Isn't much to really say about working for the bank."
good,This was a good part time job. The hours were perfect for my school time. It was only a part time job. It requires sales of accounts. It was good for the timeframe I needed.
good,I am not at liberty to discuss my career at this time with the organization. I would still recommend the company to anyone who is looking to learn banking.
good,"Worked with phenomenal people in the office. Everyone is willing to help with any issues at all. No drama, great communication - everybody supported and recognized all effort and accomplishments."
good,"I've worked worse places, but it's BOA. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the pay was better than fast food or retail. That's all I got really. It's okay."
good,".it was a decent paycheck and good benefits but a lot of overtime and heavy pipeline of loans, need to be able to multitask and organize your time. Good dependable job with steady paycheck and ability to earn commission depending on how many loans you closed and booked each month."
good,"great employee network associations and team collaboration on projects, good ability to voice your opinion and add content value.  Able to work across various lines of business"
good,There was not much room for career advancement within the company. Other than that it a good place to work and the benefits are great. It is a great place to start out.
good,Nice people and great team to work with. My managers gave importance to career development and ensured that I was given the opportunities I wanted to pursue. Working hours are pretty flexible and you can work from home when needed.
good,"Fast pace work environment "
good,good work environment for a 12 year run with Bank of America. Staffing was downsizing in the mortgage industry and I got caught in a reduction in force.
good,"Overall the job itself was easy, but policy and procedures were constantly changing and didn't benefit the employees and in a lot of the cases the customers. I learned a lot about credit and finances, rules, and regulations throughout my 12 years working with the Bank. Workplace culture was strict in some departments, others were more laxed, but overall Quality, and Job performance requirements were much of the same across the board in all departments. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain consistency with the clients when the policies and rules were inconsistent with the  Bank. Over all I would have stayed with the bank if there were a more broad array of opportunities in the Atlanta market that I could have applied for."
good,the benefits are great but is a giant corporation so it run like that there is no guarantee at any of the jobs with BOA ..............................
good,Last manager I had while working at this company was not the best.  She was very rude and not willing to take any feedback from her associates.  Left about 5 years ago
good,"Typical large US corporation. The culture of the Bank has been changing recently, but there is a lot of day to day bureaucratic things that come standard with working at a large bank."
good,"I enjoyed my time (10+ years) at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  At this time, I am looking forward to the next challenge in my career post BofA Merrill Lynch."
good,"Many perks when you work there, but you are in sea of cubes, and sometimes treated as a number, and not a person.   Left when BOA decided to move out of the mortgage game as much."
good,"The benefits are amazing at Bank of America. 2 weeks vacation, insurance, free banking. everything is offered just by being at least part time for the company"
good,very stressful demanding and work culture was not always the best practices used to achieve goals sometime they boarder on the line of not being ethical
good,Working at Bank of America allows for career growth and helps build network for growth and other opportunities.  The knowledge from working at Bank of America helps for future growth.
good,I had a really good experience at Bank of America. This is where it started for me to be able to grow and learn so much more about banking. The opportunities that I had here made it possible for me to receive my promotions with Wells Fargo.
good,"Potential room for growth, however if your good at your job it seems you are more likely to be kept in your role. It makes it much easier on management,"
good,"Daily customer experience, sales, operations focused.  The ay starts out with huddle and continuous coaching of team while spending time away for conference calls on training and operations."
good,A typical day at work would be very boring but the day goes quick. Lots to do keeps you busy and you are always learning new things. If finance is your things then this is definitely the job for you.
good,"I was not at Bank of America very long to give a fair rating, only realized that I am speaker and people person and got a job in television and continued speaking."
good,"A very large, cumbersome organization at times. People are down to earth and willing to help. You are able to find your mentors and those who can sponsor your career advancements."
good,I learned  and gained a lot from the company. A typical day a work a depends sometimes it busy and other days are slow. Management is supportive to your needs. Its very diverse.
good,"Good corporate culture bank to work for with job stability. The company is takes compliance and privacy very seriously. Other than that, very professional culture. This opinion is only for home loans division."
good,There is nothing I will make in a public statement on this company. I don't want to say anything that event in the least probability would get me sued.
good,I contracted at the bank so I cannot really say anything about the way the company was as far as the employees but overall my experience was positive.
good,"At the time that I worked for Bank of America it was under the old umbrella in which I enjoyed working for them.  Once the merger took place things began to change within the organization, some negative and some positive.  Not that I didn't like what I was doing.  I still liked working under the Bank of America logo. Even though I have not worked for the organization for quite a long time, I still have respect for the corporation."
good,"As a temporary employee, I did not receive the benefits that the permanent employees received but permanent employees do advance quickly and receive a raise when they advance."
good,"Bank of America is an excellent company to work for in any site. Company really takes care of their people, nice benefits and fair treatment from management. I'd recommend this company to anyone looking for a great long-lasting work experience. "
good,"I started there as a general line teller, after awhile I was made an express line teller, then I was given a fellow to train, then I was transferred to the Vault to work directly with merchants as a vault teller."
good,"A solid place to work. People are helpful and want you to succeed.  Work environment is very serious, yet not intimidating. Can be difficult to navigate the vast organization at times."
good,"Bank of America paid their own employees well, but we were paid by Carlton which didn't pay much for this position.  Many employees who left Carlton but worked at BOA actually returned to BOA as BOA employees."
good,"Establish relationships with future Bank of America Mortgage customers. Maintain all customer information pertaining to the closing of their first or second mortgage and lines of credit. Handle all customer service with the customer as well as order and review all mortgage documents to include, but not limited to, HUD-1 Settlement Statement, Deed of Trust or Mortgage and Note. Advise customers about the various products that may benefit their needs. Schedule and complete closing packages. Underwriting authority up to $250,000.00. Calculate loan to value and debt to income ratios."
good,"This company is wonderful with it's employees, until it becomes unprofitable. I worked at the industrial park on the back end so their was no customer interaction, but this was during the sub-prime housing crisis and our VP was in very bad health which effected her job performance (but had reached an untouchable position). All in all, great company, horrible circumstances."
good,Work Culture has been explicit respecting diversity in inclusion . The most enjoyable part of work would be the freeness to explore new ideas and bring in a difference.
good,A typical day at work was usually that you learn something new every day whether it's how things are processed or how quickly things can change.  The workplace culture was great.  A lot of respectful people.  The hardest part of the job was not having the abitlity to help clients with everything.  the most enjoyable part was the people.
good,"It has been a really long time since I worked for BOA.  I do not remember much about this job, I just remember liking it and liking helping people and allocating currency to tellers and balancing the branch.  I like challenges and it was a challenge."
good,I spent 17 years working for this company. I would have stayed at the job if it had not moved out of state. I was well educated on my position and enjoyed the research that was required of me. I felt comfortable in the position I was in and enjoyed the company of my co workers.

good,"Good people to work with, productive and fun place to work at, I will definitively tell people who want to go and work at this place to go ahead and apply for openings."

good,"decent benefits, lots of opportunities to learn about other lines of business."
good,Good experience working at Bank of America. Large company with lots of opportunity for advancement. Very diverse with many locations across the country.
good,A Great place to work.  Work life balance.very important and the company provided this.  Management communicated effectively and challenge colleagues to bring their best day forward.
good,"I got the internship and I really never thought that working in private investment was challenging at all. But I was completely wrong. I was really challenging, but I learned so much about private  investments. It was definitely a great learning experience."
good,"I’m the type of employee that doesn’t play around, I start working the minute I come in and don’t stop working until everything has been taking care of. My job is very stressful and is because mostly everything that is required to do my job is so manual, this has been a concern for me because having a manual process there is always room for errors. I have been looking for other positions within the bank as I love working for Bank of America."
good,"Enjoyed working with the BoA team.  Too sad that they have to sale the Data Center.  Enjoyed the working environment, team and location. Would love to work for this team again"
good,Good place to work. Employee friendly work culture. Believes in Team work. Helps individuals to implement their innovations and ideas into the projects to improve the quality of the products.
good,"This position is in a call center, receiving calls from customers about their accounts.  These calls are back to back, only time we do not need to answer calls is when on 2, 15 minute break, and one 30 minute lunch."
good,Appreciated the help of my colleague in getting acclimated to the duties involved with being a contract editor. My only regret is that I could not continue working there.
good,"Merrill is a company thats very efficient and client focused. There's frequent mandatory overtime which is great for your check, but can be inconvenient for your personal scheduling. Management is open to ideas, and understanding."
good,"This company no longer exists in that location, but my experience there was positive overall.  There was a good employee atmosphere and management was fair."
good,"It has been a good, not a great experience so far. I have been expecting so much more out of the experience, but things have moved in fits and starts."
good,"Hours at BOA are very long and call can be stressful. Bebefits are great, they offer dental, vision, 401k, and paid off vacation or aick day. Co-works are always willing to help."
good,"Smart People Good ethics Good management, Safe environment. Large focus on diversity.  Large focus on innovation and the bank of the future."
good,"Typical call center life... very fast-paced. Your customers set the tone for your work day. The  process of servicing customers could be tedious. Overall management played a supportive role, so in the event you needed them they were there. If not they typically didn't  micromanage. However, management was really big on quality"
good,"Interesting and personable place to work. Typical day of continuous production of meeting and exceeding expectations.  I was able to cover for my manager when they were absent in the position of Team Lead. Assist with training new employees in the Bankruptcy department."
good,"Working for Bank of America, like any other job, has its pros and cons. For example, because Bank of America is such a huge company, there's plenty of opportunity for advancement. However, management tries to get as much out of you as possible, leaving you feel (at times) like they think you're less than human."
good,I was with the company for over 15 years. The company trained me well to be a business professional. 
good,Industry leader in the financial services sector offering a wide variety of products and opportunities.  Solid financial support roles and opportunities with ability to gain exposure to multiple areas and partners.
good,"overall it was ok, the pay was good, the benefits where great, but other then that it sucked in the call center, talk about micro managing, if you want someone to count how long and how many times you have to use the bathroom and everything you do and speak once you walk in , then it is for you. no creativity and personality, they wont let you sell the way u want"
good,"Just understand that the major banks have intense reporting and meeting requirements.  If you're looking for a place to spend the majority of your time as a treasury consultant then JPM, BAC, and WFB are not the place."
good,"Good benefit, low pay. Micromanagement, stressful work pace, high goal, but doable. a lot of cold calling and emailing, sometimes difficult customers."
good,"This was a fast paced environment, being able to assist customers and help them with their home payments was exciting then shortly I was asked to train to be an Underwriter for the company. It was a great experience to do so."
good,I refuse to say anything about my position as my job title will be shown publically. Why am I being required to do this. No one would tell the truth with their title being shown.
good,Bank of America is an institution where everyone has to drink the cool aid.  It is taboo to speak out against what comes from the top brass which makes it tough to get things done given the lack of willingness for associates to speak up.
good,"Work on multiple priorities in each day with no downtime to spare"
good,"I worked for a specific team that took really good care of me, so my experience was amazing via dog whispers. Up a few more levels, management reorganizes and finds petty reasons to cut back. It is reflected in compensation, job advancement."
good,Great opportunities to keep growing with the support of direct managers. Maintain flexibility with the changing marketplace. Manages risk vs. reward trade-offs effectively.
good,About what you would expect.  Bank hours.  Worked independently as Merrill Edge advisor.  Very little peer support.  Expected to do bank service work like issue debit cards and open bank accounts which you don't get credit on your scorecard and takes away time from prospecting.
good,"If you are good at office gossip and politics this might be the job for you at least at the location I was at. I did learn to not get involved in the politics but if you don't this might single you out as an outsider. The management and was literally in bed with one another but again this is the location I was at. I can not judge Bank of America as a whole because I honest believe this is a great place to work if you can position yourself in the right department. Hardest part was when they decide to move my position to Jacksonville, FL and outsource anything that request a person to be physically there to HP."
good,I found BofA and AML as a best place to work. And they provide decent amount as salary. But as AML is a critical application the work life balance is not really possible in my role.
good,Bank Of America is a place to learn and get hands-on experience in the latest thriving technology in market. Usually there will be stern timelines for most of the deliverables.
good,"My Operational Risk and Compliance roles were my favorite roles within the company. I was able to develop my analytical skills, while supporting several lines of business in such a high paced environment.  I learned to adapt to change. Every test that was developed I had to learn each new process, systems, policies and procedures. Presenting the results to our executives and being apart of the improvements was very satisfying. I enjoyed making a difference. "
good,It was good working at MSCI. I would recommend it to friends although stress level is very high with good salary and employee benefits. Overall learning and work experience was excellent.
good,"Competitive, fast-paced environment but also stressed teamwork and excellence. Worked with very smart people and enjoyed the breadth of information available at a global firm."
good,Everyday the rules/regulations changed. We had to stay on our toes to get the job done. the hardest part of the job was not being able to satisfy every caller. The most enjoyable part was the incentives and employee appreciation they offered us.
good,This position was during tax season so it was long hours and a lot of work. Mainly the shift was fun though. Not too many days that there was no work.
good,working at bank of america is amazing experience if you want to grow in financial sector. everybody is very helpful and very good environment to work but sometimes too much of work.
good,Good place to work but depends on groups. Some group has a very good project management and some groups do not. So it depends and good luck.  Good benefit and good salary.
good,"working for the bank was great because i was able to work with people on a daily basic and with banks that were in my network, and also to be able to train those employees to achieve their goals then they came in a change regions and the manager had no idea of the product"
good,Many times i was only teller with line of customers out the door. Getting to know regulars was nice. Must be able to multitask all the time. Have many opportunities to do volunteer work for the community.
good,Hit your sales numbers and there is nothing to worry about. Advancement seems to be dependent on factors outside of performance and can be out of control of employees.
good,This was a decent job plenty of opportunity for overtime. standard basic pay was to low and commission wast enough for the amount of calls taken on a daily basis.
good,I enjoyed working at Bank of America! As a new member to the banking field altogether I felt like it was fairly easy to learn the ropes. I was immediately placed as a Merchant teller right after training which made me feel pretty confident that they believed in my skills.
good,"Great people at all levels of the company - joining makepositive is like joining a family and everyone is supportive of each other and has a great time together"
good,"Responsible for all aspects of supervision associated with hiring, leading, coaching, developing and managing a group of staff within a motivating environment to achieve performance goals and service metrics."
good,Not a fun place to work for and poor training...or I should say no training at all. Very confusing pay structure. It takes some time to figure it out.
good,The job was a fast paced job but there was no room for advancement.When they laid off employees they did not try to find jobs in other departments for their employees
good,"I enjoyed working for Bank of  America, gained a wealth of knowledge in the Loan Origination space.  The stress free  team environment promote cohesiveness .  Everyone is treated with respect and integrity.  Wonderful work experience!!!"
good,"A typical work day included review an analyst of EEU phone calls. I learned to not place value on things unseen, and to go for what your heart desires."
good,"i enjoy working here, the products are decent and so is pay. the issue i have is their corporate culture, it's exactly what you think it would be. the clients made this job really fun, but the management teams will beat you over head with ""everything is for the client"" but when an issue pops up they hardly put the customer first."
good,This company ahs alot of opportunity for growth. As long as you work hard you can move around the company but it may take a while depending on what position youre trying to get.
good,good company to work for. They have flexible hours and good benefits for employees. The job can be overwhelming at times because there is alot of change but the company helps reward for that.
good,We were a collections call center for Bank of America with very intense goals to reach for delinquency.  Call volume was heavy and the job was stressful.
good,interact with customers and try to establish relationships with new and existing clients. try and get walk-ins to sit with me so that I can profile them to see what needs I may fulfill with the bank's products. make telephone calls to new and existing clients
good,Bank of America is a nice place to work but not a place to move up the ladder quickly.  A person will have to start from the bottom of the ladder and then slowly move up the ladder and make the big bang bucks.
good,Company has unlimited opportunities with a sales environment that gives satisfaction and development if you put your focus on it.  I would recommend this company
good,"A typical day at work consisted of accurately keying in electronic monetary items as fast as possible.  I learned working for Bank of America is very important due to the handling of many customer's accounts and the posting of their money.  "
good,Left when there became too much pressure to make loans that were not in best interest of customer. Bank was going through period of rapid changes at the time.
good,Have to be very proactive depending on your team you could succeed or fail. Management could be hit or miss. Lots of turnovers. Goals are high depending on your assign center.
good,"Good company.  Need to work hard.  It's a large company and with that there is a lot of politics, but for the most part, people are really nice and work well together."
good,It’s a good place to work but it is demanding.                       It is hard to find life work balance with the schedule.         Offers shift differential.
good,"Nations Bank bought a local bank called Liberal in Brazil. At the same time, Bank of America bought Nations Bank in US. The overall process was a little bit confused, worsened by the NYC attacks in 2011."
good,good company overall. The benefits are great but the compensation plan could use some work. the work environment is very stressful because they use quality control as a weapon to take your commissions or job.
good,I am thankful for the longevity of my career at Bank of America. To say I've been there for over ten years is a blessing. Management has always been encouraging and saw the best in me.
good,"The company is a great company, but there is a few (management) that make it not a enjoyable work place. The main focus is closing many sales per day."
good,"I worked at several different banking centers over the five years I worked for BOA. Consistently, my colleagues and bosses were kind, including, and ensured a cooperative environment for customers and employees.  Typical day includes knowing security procedures intimately, handling large amounts of cash, dealing with safe deposit boxes, heavy face to face customer interaction, customers sometimes get nasty but my colleagues were always there to provide a help when it was required. Hardest part of the job is the difficult customers. Easiest part of the job is the money handling. I didn't care for the half hour lunches but some supervisors would let you take an hour if you needed it to run errands depending on business needs. Part time employees receive time off and health care, which was a huge plus and one of the reasons I stayed so long. I worked two jobs, including this one, while I was in grad school and they were flexible around finals times. Sales are a part of this job and toward the end of my five years the goals became unrealistic but for the most part achievable."
good,"The job it's self was fun and rewarding for the most part. Management left a lot to be desired, but I loved working with the customers and helping them get their issues resolved."
good,I particular enjoyed this stage of my career with Bank of America because I was more involved with associate development and becoming an liaison between associates and management working to improve associate moral as well as the customer experience
good,"Always aspire to be a better version of myself each day. Working at Bank of America along with other organizations throughout my years of employment has help me understand one of the biggest challenges companies face all over the world is building and sustaining a strong talent pipeline. Not only do businesses need to adjust to shifting demographics and work force preferences, but they must also build new capabilities and revitalize their organizations as the economy continual change."
good,"Keep in mind, I worked at BofA a long time ago, so I'm sure it is different currently.  My employment at BofA ended 10 years ago, but when I was there it was a good company to work for."
good,I worked in customer service so spent most of the day on the phones to customers. the most stressful part of the job was dealing with irate customers. the people I worked with were always supportive and helpful.
good,"I loved working as a teller; however, I believe training could have been improved. I better overview of the products were were suppose to sell could have been reviewed more closely."
good,Challenging and intense decision making for clients who rely on their income and financial performance. researching and being involve in investments  and more.
good,"Seems like a good place to work. But when the stock prices drop, bad things happen internally."
good,Learned management skills. Learned to work in an always changing environment. Opportunity to work with a close-knit team. Relaxed working environment.
good,"the job is cool like all the other county jobs "
good,"It is a great place to work, however, there is a lot of stress depending on your branch. Some managers are great while others are a challenge to work with."
good,Bank of America is a great place to experience cutting edge technology.  The governance processes are very mature which provides structure and reliable outcomes.
good,"When your project is complete and becomes mature, then watch out. Some ambitious managers are looking for opportunities to replace current working process/application under the name continue improvement."
good,good place to work to start a career. Good for someone looking to learn about banking system. Good benefits for employees. Very competitive and fast paced environment.
good,"it was a part time job and I learn a lot things over there, however and it came the time for a full time position they did not have at the time I needed, My manager was good and the branch team was great. The only reason I left was because I needed more hours and a career advancement. I had a very good experience."
good,Technology Operations teams are all fast paced and more work than employees. Managers are flexible and supportive provided  work is completed.  Practicing work life balance is a must in order to succeed.
good,I was proud to work for BAML. Overall a great company with good culture and values. Empowers employees and supports career development with internal and external training programmes.
good,The pay was okay however the benefits outweighed the pay due to the size of the company.  There were incentives and everyone I worked with were great people.  We had a great team.
good,typical mortgage experience.  managers were always trying out new procedures and most didn't work.  morale was never very high.  and bringing in a fussball table won't solve this problem.
good,This was a great place to work.  Management encouraged you to strive for positions that may take you from the team.  Encouraged you to reach for your dreams.
good,Merrill Lynch was everything expected when I took the job as a stock broker. It was fast paced and intense. A lot of hours with potential for great rewards.
good,"Good work-life balance."
good,"A typical day starts at 9 AM daily and depends on work may have to stay 6 PM, some time has to provide release support in the weekend. Generally the work culture is good."
good,"Hi, "
good,The work area and work culture is good. For people looking for a carrier in banking sector can join this firm too. The company provides good perk too with policy which are more beneficial for employees.
good,They stress selling. You can only sell to the same people just so many accounts. Customers get tired of having accounts pushed at them when they come in for simple transactions.
good,The most hardest part of the job is to handle a large amount of data and to maintain accurate data. little stressful to handle but quite challenging on the whole great experience.
good,"Not the best place to start a career if you actually want to learn and grow. Laid-back, lethargic culture of ""do the minimum and go home"" with such a degree of specialization in individual roles that it is hard to gain experience. Too many layers of management and low comp for more junior employees."
good,"Merrill Lynch                Somerset, NJClient Service Representative                 February 1997 – January 1998 Worked in a call center answering calls regarding financial accounts. Assisted clients with their investment and IRA accounts and provided stock quotes. Mailed statements to clients and blocked stolen or lost visa cards."
good,I can not speak for the entire BOA corp but i was working at an credit department for Bank of America that was out sourced to canada. as you might know BOA does not operate in Canda.
good,"Been over 7 years since I've interned there.  Summer training for intern was great, they flew us down to North Carolina for a couple of days. Great opportunity to meet fellow interns and establish rapport that may come in handy while on the job.  However, once we received our placement, learning to navigate BoA was a convoluted.  Largely due to size and business silos"
good,Great Place to work if you are passionate on sale and hitting your goals. You need to find your own way out to move up as the career development lacks in resources.
good,"•	Administered financial market databases and applications; analyzed existing financial trends and market data and made recommendations to improve financial performance in the telecommunications industry."
good,I like working for Bank Of America and would always recommend my friends working here. This is a well balanced place between getting the job done and maintaining the right work environment.
good,I enjoy working working at BoA but the org changes are stressful.  You never know when you might lose your job.  It's not a healthy way to work.  If a dept is being laid off allow someone to apply for other positions
good,Nice place to work. Great team and had a good technical co-workers. Manager was really understanding and technical. Overall  one of the good places to work to learn the Risk.
good,I worked there as a temporary employee for about a year. It was quick paced by they treat their employees well. The pay is a bit low to start but advancement is possible.

good,I really liked working for the BOFA project. However their work timings were little odd. But it was a friendly work place as I was with Accenture working a BOFA project.
good,"stressful atmosphere when I was there, but workplace was great and benefits was awesome , most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with, family oriented ..I would have never left if I did not get laid off"
good,It is a good company to work for if you like sales. Vacation selections are usually not that great; goes by seniority. Company has changed a lot due to mergers etc.
good,"Excellent benefits and always room for advancement. I worked there for many many years and although I had to leave for many personal reasons, loved the benefits offered"
good,"Good workplace culture, organized, follow all policies and procedures.Extensive training provided as compare to other banks, cooperative and supportive colleagues. Benefits  are great but salary is low as compared to work required."
good,"Work culture was not great. Managers are not passionate and not many qualified individuals around. Also the office is quite remote. if you do not have a car, commute is a big problem."
good,"Bank of America is a great place to work when it comes to the benefits and salaries received. However, when it comes to upper management and the goal oriented workplace, it puts a damper on job. Instead of focusing on customer satisfaction, Bank of America drives off of sales while customer satisfaction takes a back seat."
good,"fast paced call center, scheduling changes every 2 or 3 months, mandatory work days with no prior notice.  Opportunity to do other duties for advancement but not recognized by advancing role or title on permanent basis."
good,Great place to work for. Management is supportive. Company culture is engaging. The hardest part was the location of its offices in southern california. Best part was employee development.
good,Answer all calls at management level. Keep customer or release them. Try to fix all financial hardships with bank guide lines and financial needs. Insure services is at customer level needs. Give them options to make them feel important to there financial needs. In sure them that they can get there and meet there goals.
good,"Bank of America is good place to start and network to a career within banking. Be prepared for contest change of environment but always looking to keep workers employed,"
good,"Very hard to enter management. Constantly changing targets. Pay is OK, but locations are awful. Lot of work for seemingly little reward, particularly when it comes to bonus structure."
good,It was a fast-pace day and I learned how to work a mortgage. Management could have been better. The position  was not hard once I learned how. Working in a call-center is not easy.
good,Working here has been a great learning experience and a joy. Management is awesome and the work culture is free. No pressure. Meeting with Clients and meeting the deadlines is always challenging and fun.
good,"Within the banking center, the atmosphere can be quite challenging.  High volume of customer traffic demands high attention to detail, sense of urgency, and the ability to handle stress. There is a lot to learn about money, compliance, federal policy, etc."
good,"i would sit at my machine and post checks. i learned 10 key real good, management was good if you did you work. hardest part was reading other peoples writing on checks to post correct. the fun part was down time when you actually got to talk with your friends."
good,"Bank of America was a good place to work. I learned a lot about the banking industry. It was very regimented, but good learning experience for me. Overall, it was good."
good,I was there over 5 years . Started in a certain department and ended leaving from that department. Very competitive. No loyalty to employees with time in. management changed not for the better. Cut throat environment
good,Working at Bank of America differs very much depending on what your role is. CEO is very focused on meeting marketing expectations by cutting cost which can be felt across the entire company.
good,working at bank of america in sales can be successful and borderline lucrative. The only trade off is you need to work a lot of overtime to hit stretch goals which will impact the time you spend with your family
good,"For the project consultants were hired to work on, we were assigned a specific application to modify and a Merrill employee to work with."
good,While working in this summer internship program with Bank of America I learned many great things about how the business world works and functions. It was mostly desk duty filling out excel sheets and shadowing the district manager in meetings.
good,Great company benefits and incentives. There was alot of management and regular employee fratanization. Other than that great work envronment. Upper management very pleasant and professional.
good,Overall great experience. I was exposed to different industries within the corporate credit department which increased interaction with upper management. There were some slackers on the team that went unoticed!
good,"It was wonderful to be part of this company.  You will learn how to utilize your time between interviewing the customer and reviewing, processing and credit check at the same time.  It will enhance your patients and customer relationship skills.  Although, I enjoy engaging with the customers the management is lacking encouragement and support."
good,"Excellent opportunities to achieve career goals in a very diverse, collaborative environment.  Opportunities to advance and move across functions and lines of business."
good,"The benefits are the only reason I still work here. Great medical, dental, and vision. They also pay a portion of daycare and reimburse you if you buy a fuel efficient car. It is extremely hard to advance in the company."
good,"A typical day at work includes trouble shooting issues."
good,Working at Bank of America wasn't good but it wasn't bad. I hated working in the office (not their fault) but the pay was actually decent. Management didn't know how to manage but overall a decent job.
good,"I enjoyed working here. The only issue is that this company has many lay-offs. If not, I would still be here. It was a cool place to work and the pay was good."
good,"Company always attempted to relay a positive attitude, from the Management team.  They would always encourage community involvement. The atmosphere is always professional."
good,"BOA is a good place to work at, there are many lines of business to move into.  However, they are very micromanaging and due to the work demand there's hardly any time off."
good,"The job is relatively simple, management is overbearing. It's a sales job, so you are only as valuable as your current sales numbers say you are. That should be expected in any sales job though."
good,"Very good  training, nice   middle management is awesome, upper management  sorta sucks  location where I was is now closed..They are keen on recognition and lots os food events"
good,Bank of America is a great place to work the compensation is great. The Financial center is a call center environment.  Heavy call volume. Their quality control is very challenging therefore after your probationary period you better be on your A game or else.
good,"Very busy work environment ranging from service to building relationships to uncovering needs of clients.  I have learned a lot about building relationships and understanding customer's financial priorities and goals.  There are lots of multi-tasking and this job is fast paced along with follow-ups.  You get a 30 minute lunch as your days are shorter during the week with Fridays being a 10 hour day.  Work most Saturdays with a day off during the week, allowing for Dr.s apt and other errands without the weekend crowd.  Very nice company to work for with a vision of helping clients meet their financial goals and guiding them down a successful financial path.  The management team is demanding, but with the right leadership in place, you can enjoy working for them with the encouraging words and guidance."
good,"very collaborative environment, a very diverse group of employees, excellent technical and business skills. opportunity to grow takes longer than other firms but scope and breadth of learning is huge."
good,"Good company, Good benefits. Friendly people.There is opportunities to advance. Teller are professional and ready to provided excellent customer services."
good,"it was a pretty good place to work, it just became a little overwheleming when my husband took ill and i was unable to continue to give 100% to the company. the benifits were great until the company went overseas."
good,They provide several areas of training designed to make you a well rounded advisor.  They make you focus primarily on insurance and annuity based products.
good,My success in my last role was an indicator of my commitment to excellence and my understanding of what it takes to be a great representative of the company
good,Large bank with many moving parts. Work is very busy and can be stressful with not efficient technology system.  Some parts of the bank is better and some parts are worse. Many opportunities
good,"better work schedule, well paid time off and good coworkers. Company care about workplace safety and other non-compliance issue. organized and well compensated."
good,"I worked for Bank Of America at Alorica it is stressful sometimes."
good,"portfolio management analysts "
good,Banks are getting rid of employees and replacing them with machines. There would be over 50ppl in line and 3 tellers at the window. Management encouraged us to send them to an ATM or online banking.
good,"Help customers open and manage their bank accounts and finances"
good,Bank of America is an excellent employer as they a diverse and enjoyable group. You can truly learn a lot by working for this company and have certainly done so in my years with the bank. Definitely a lot of opportunity if you get your foot in the door.
good,They have gone from a big company to a much smaller since I started in 2008. I was fortunate to get lots of experience and appreciated all the time and effort put into my development.
good,"great place to work for, if you are upper management. downside, micro managing, Line of Business is never happy.  Great Benefits and generous with vacation time."
good,"I was in an operations function, and Bank of America was a great place for an entry level position, however not a lot of opportunities for growth and advancement."
good,"Check processing department was a detail oriented job. Goals needed to met inorder to continue working. Perfect job for someone who works well with no immediate supervision, and has a strong attention to detail"
good,"It was a good fair place to work. I would recommend BAC to friends and family.  However with the new management / director from this year, there have been many changes and lay offs."
good,"Overall, Bank of America is a good employer.  Consistent organizational changes (sometimes on an every-other-month basis) has a tendency to create an environment in which top priorities can change without notice.  A bit more consistency would create greater associate satisfaction."
good,"Was always learning something new, especially about fraud activity and trends. Management was always helpful and informative not  general answers. Learned to work happily in a very diverse workplace"
good,The management does not ask the people that work on the floor what can be done to improve work flow and what systems are needed for that departments specific loan status.
good,I like working at Bank Of America. There were lot of things to learn from the investment banking perspective. Though it was hard to figure out why budgets justifies the projects.
good,"Great company to work for.  Benefits are fantastic. Training is great as well. Sales required. If you are looking for a company that will provide opportunity for growth and promotion, this is a great place."
good,Contract firm with good employee support. Fun events as well as good pay. Bank of America cut contract rates across the bank and Signature ate the difference.
good,"Great Opportunities, very old school and conservative mentality. Technology is archaic at times. Firm says millennials are important but doesn't do anything to help them unless their parents are rich."
good,Good company with very good benefits. Just a matter of getting proper compensation and a decent position. Working inside the bank had cool perks like days off and hours worked. Call center...SUCKED.
good,"management are great to work with but sometimes it really depend what branch you're working for. Very great coworkers, enjoy working with and helpful when needed."
good,"fun workplace, good pay & benefits. the only thing that fluctuated were the sales, some days were great other days were rough. but it was one of the metrics needed to be met"
good,The culture of Bank of America was great when I was there.  The call center atmospher was busy and enjoyable.  The training that is provided is excellent.  They make sure you are equipped to do the job.  I learned how to be a collector.  The job was high pressure but I was able to get all my calls answered.  I enjoy talking to customers.
good,Bank of America is a good place to work. The management is up to date on the financial market place. Managers should be more proactive to the application process of subordination to insure the process is done in a more timely manner
good,"Good company overall, they could have better training programs. Management could set more realistic sales goals for certain clusters and branches. Strong Sales culture."
good,"Cox overall is a good company, there were some issues pertaining to true growth within the company. It is similar to other competitive companies. I loved the people."
good,They are a great company they reward employees with different things but do expect a good days work. Good people. Good learning experience. If I didn't have to relocate would still probably be there.
good,"management wasn't great although they don't train very well, i have learned lots from experience. my coworkers were nice and fun but management seems to pick and choose favorites."
good,Bank of America gives lots of people a chance in the banking industry. there are lots of departments and plenty of room to advance. Bank of America strives to keep the morale going while making sure good performance is key.
good,"Very Professional,allowed me to develop as a Manager and challenged me in Product knowledge as well as being able to adapt to daily changes.Oppurtunity to engage with many skilled professionals."
good,Bank of America overall is a good place to work.  It just happens that I landed in department that shows favoritism.  There is no since of security in this day and age.  You have to wonder if you will be the one eliminated with the constant changes.
good,"Fast paced no room for error must stand and get everything right the first time. Precision, Time management and execution skills are paramount for success"
good,"As a member of the Business Intelligence team, I am responsible for managing the design, development, implementation, management and support of critical enterprise BI reporting. I also lead the designing phase of solutions to develop ETL solutions with SSIS or T-SQL to populate the data warehouse from source systems and transform unstructured and disparate source data into clean data for downstream analysis."
good,great place to gain some experience. good benefits. middle of the pack in regards to pay. a lot of moving pieces if you are in support. constant changing unless you are in production.
good,You must be a self-starter and rely on other colleagues to find solutions to your questions. The people and benefits are excellent. It is the closest to running your own company while being an employee of a corporation as you will ever find.
good,"good workplace culture, but as a contractor the company limited the length of my contract and tried to force me to take unpaid leave (furlough). Management within IT were pretty good."
good,Good place to work. Lot many people are working here for long term. There is possibility to learn new technologies. Working culture also good. But Role change will take lot of years.
good,"Reviewed Financial Plans and returns"
good,Manager is the Boss and Boss is always right is the policy of BOA. Job security also depends on your manager. Work life balance is not so good as internal mobility and retains female employee is just show case jargons
good,"....The pay is good and you can grow within the company, just very strict learned many customer service skills working here. The vacation pay is awesome they give you a month paid *"
good,My experience was that BofA was ethical and employees cared.  There's always a bad manager here and there and it was no different with Bank of America.
good,"The closing of Bank of America's site in Lancaster, CA caused more than a thousand employees to be displaced.  BofA should have assisted their employees in finding other positions within the vast number of other sites they own either in the same state or out of state."
good,Meeting goals was always a team effort in any department of Bank of America. Most of my basic managerial skills were obtained from the training at Bank of America and their Six Sigma approach. The work culture was professional and organized.
good,Loved the operations side - dreaded work everday in the retail centers.  If you like feeling human and appreciated this may not be the side of the business for you.
good,interns get to work with Advisors and work with them on preparing and learning about client positions as well as complex wealth planning strategies. The company looks for sales oriented individuals and not for Financial or wealth planning backgrounds.
good,"Goal orientated work environment, able to work independently however team around to offer support. Great Training provided which cover all aspect of job."
good,It had many things going for it. If you were not a number one rep at all times and be able to multi task this job is not for you. You have to listen to them tell you things at same time of listening to a customer on the phone tell you the issue they were calling in about. The most part the job did have it pluss sides they worked with you and your family
good,"Great opportunity for promotion, advance and learning. Good job if you are a student, Bank of America will work with your schedule. You can always feel appreciated."
good,i enjoyed helping the customers and building relationships with the customers. it is a fast pace environment. i learned how to help customer manage there money and keep track of their finances. systems were great.
good,"Lack of room for growth, however overall it is a great company to work for. Strongly approve of upper level management, but growing regional takes years longer than going external and returning."
good,"The people in my team were the best, everybody helps each other and the management was the best, my manager and the upper management the process and environment was excelent"
good,Great experience if you are looking to build on your customer service experience. It will give you the opportunity to work with many different customers and handle their daily transactions.
good,"Working there was a pleasure. Management was very professional. The hours of operation was perfect, no nights, weekends or holidays. Would love to work in banking again"
good,"It has its ups and downs.  The one thing I never liked was the fact that management would always be changing, there was never any stability between managers and never any communication.  Transparency was never the strongest suit of BofA, nor was it even a concern from management down to the employees."
good,"I had a good career @ BofA.  I would work for them again if the right opportunity presented itself.  It was scary to think of being let go due to layoffs, however i still feel they care for the employees will being."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Bank of America. Sad that it all had to come to end. I have no regrets working there as the staff was great and the company had awesome benefits.

good,"Competitive but collaborative environment, encourage mobility across the platform, generally good people, company seems to be well positioned for the future"
good,Bank of America is a very fast pace company to work for and process can change from day to day.  You must be open to change when working for BAC.  There are many lines of business with Bank of America.
good,"Overall colleagues and culture fine. Work was intensive, but provided great learning opportunities."
good,"Numerous projects w/in one department requiring you to stay focused and ready for change ."
good,"Nice place to work, there tends to be a lot of favoritism in the different branches however..   There is multiple opportunities to move in the company."
good,checking/savings account maintenance. multitasking. resolving customer issues. filing complaints. incentive earned based on customer surveys and call time
good,"I worked here for a short period of time. I really liked the job and all the cash handling, but I hated the sales aspect of it. We were pressured to try to sell customers credit cards or new accounts even if they didn't need it. If we didn't ask every single customer to apply for something we got in trouble."
good,"Long hours, relatively mundane projects, not much upward mobility available. Not particularly state of the art systems and lots of problems with legacy infrastructure"
good,"The benefits package is great, 401K and health insurance. Advancement is slow, during promotions everyone is high energy and makes the day more enjoyable."
good,A fast paced place to work with plenty to do.  Easy to get lost in the complexity and the sheer size of the place.  Not as much opportunity to move up as initially represented.
good,"the company is awesome. great company to work for management is awesome . you are force to take vacation . this is a everlasting job. I hopmmlml;,;,ll;njjnjnjl;"
good,"Very good company to work ,fixable working hours and work from home option also there on need basis, freedom to change your technology and can gain good domain knowledge."
good,Band of Amercia was a good place to work.  I worked independently as well as on a team.  This job expounded on my ability to be very detail oriented.  Provided good pay and benefits.
good,"Good place to work. Productive and fun place. A Lot of benefits employee will get like free lunch and work from home, but due to change in management policies has changed."
good,It is a good company to work for over all. The benefits are excellent. Some of the managers are horrible but workable.I learned to patience  with this company.The work place culture is pretty good. I would recommend the company
good,"Good benefits, time off if needed and very little hassle if you need time off including calling off sick, if you need or desire to work non traditional hours they have several shifts you can work, good people"
good,Put in the time and hard work and you will get out what you put in.  Visibility can be high and rewards can be fruitful.  There are plenty of roles that can suit your desired direction and bank presence is virtually everywhere in terms of ideal location for work.
good,"Sometimes it's a very quick paced intense environment and you must be able to keep rolling and help your fellow tellers as well (when replenishing supplies, getting the line down, buying/selling cash, etc). Also you must be mindful of opportunities for the bankers to make their sales goals, and refer as many customers to them as you can. How well you do your job determines how hard everyone else's job will be."
good,Gives you the tools to manage your success and control compensation. Can be a little stressful at times due to the size of the bank. A lot of planning goes into charting out the path of your career.
good,"Bank of America has a culture driven towards the client needs, the bank makes their relationship managers go thru continuous training for AML, RIS MANAGEMENT, CUSTOMER SERVICE, FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND so forth."
good,"Decent compensation for getting thrown into chaos.  Things would be sideways, followed by improvement, followed by scraping said ideas and returning to a general state of chaos."
good,"The typical day at work involved resolving customers' queries and concerns over the phone. "
good,"Financial Portfolio Manager of commercial real estate assets totaling over $300M in loans.  Full accountability and responsibility to create value through origination, development and disposition of holdings.  High level negotiations and legal contract reviews with guarantors and legal counsel. Knowing that a maximum return was gained through integrity provided the best outcome for all parties involved."
good,Each Day can be different. There are many things to do within this company. Creating policies and procedures and processes.
good,"Great environment, there js a great balance of work and personal life, not much of a team building environment, as long as your work was completed no issues."
good,Processing Mortgages is a lot of stress. I learned how to multi task and get a lot done. I learned a lot of my customer skills as well as computer skills here.
good,"Over the past few years, Bank of America has worked very hard to improve its available benefits as well as the culture of work/life balance.  The latter has been a little slow in developing. Departments are notoriously understaffed, while certain management levels are being filled with inexperienced and, in many cases, under-qualified personnel. "
good,"•Data Entry, Audit & verifying client information (homeowners insurance, property taxes, etc.) using EDGE, AS400 & LPS Systems."
good,"While at Bank of America, I have learned a lot throughout the last 17+ years.  From being a Collector to being a Call Center Manager to being in Governance and Risk, I've always known there was something new behind each door.  The work life balance can be difficult, but the flexibility that is offered within most positions, has been a savior.  Banking is a unique industry, and has changed tremendously over the years."
good,"Fun multinational environment. Lot of young crowd, but after a point work is routine. Good opportunity for growth."
good,"The major problem with Merrill Lynch/ Bank of America.  Is that it is too compartmentalized.  There are too many areas are not working towards the same goal.  Banking and brokerage departments while they both handle money, they handle it differently.  Understanding that issue will help the company move forward, but there is too much money and time dedicated to the legacy issues underneath"
good,"Really enjoyed my co-workers. Management was not as friendly, however, I was always able to make my quota as far as  meeting or exceeding procedures set forth by management."
good,"Workplace culture is more relaxed and it's a great place to learn some life lessons that they don't teach you in college. You need to be forward with where you want to go career wise, because no one is going to tell you ""I think you'll be a good fit here.."". Benefits are good, however pay is determine by the market and comp is determined how the bank does overall. Being in the back office you don't see that  comp as good as someone in the front or middle office would."
good,"During my tenure, there was significant changed made from starting with Countrywide Home Loans and being taken over by Bank of America.   This takeover was very cumbersome."
good,"If you dedicate your life to work and focus on your career,  you can go places. Try not to get stuck on the phones. There's a lot of opportunity and the management is pretty decent."
good,Very face paced. You would take approximately 75-100 calls per day. There is always a chance for advancement. They also do quarterly sports activities to keep work moral high.
good,Limited pay and permanent placement was hard to get with in the organization.  Lots of Contract positions with temp. agencies available.
good,"Bank of America has the best technical talent that I have worked with.  Bank of America attracts this talent by paying well, and great talent attracts great talent."
good,Bank of america has a well establish business structure. Excellent benefits but no salaries.They have a good training every day about products and benefits to clients offers.
good,Overall the company is a dissent company to work for. Where I was located the management could have been trained better. The pay for working there could be better considering the company.
good,"as a manager is a very busy schedule. most of the time i don't have time to eat and upper management doesn't seem to care about there associates. while things constantly change and more work is added to your plate, the pay is not increased to match the work load"
good,Great benefits and incredible intelligent and motivated individuals. Very busy and fast paced environment-- must be willing to work hard and stay late to get work done. But well worth it in the end.
good,what can i say about the boa that has not been said before. we do so much for the community and there is something for everyone. not a day goes by that i feel like i dont make a difference
good,Loved the people and loved the daily task. The people from my leaders to my fellow coworkers loved the job and always seemed to be content with their duties.
good,great work environment. good leadership and organization from the company. The company is fair and reasonable and you will learn great customer service skills working for this company
good,Worked there for 35 years.  Good opportunity to learn how to make referrals for the products to meet customer needs. Great people to work with
good,Working for Bank of America has it's pros and cons. The Bank offer great benefits and cares about it's employees health and well being. Working at Bank of America can be stressful and management focuses on numbers rather than overall production.
good,"I learned many things while working there. I learned how to multitask in a busy, fast paced environment while handling a lot of cash. Learned how to converse with customers and listen when needed too. Learned how to handle customer complaints and direct them to the manger if I couldn't answer it. Overall working at Bank of America taught me many things and my manger made it more enjoyable. She can be a reference if needed as well."
good,"Productive, informative, rewarding. Great company to work for with tons of growth opportunity. Highly aggressive sales goals would be the only set back I see."
good,Bank of America is a fast-paced environment that is always changing and evolving. Co-workers were highly motivated and talented. The hardest part of the job is to accept change.
good,You will gain insight into derivative workings and expertise in documentation. You will also learn how to navigate corporate america and your individual work is largely self-governed.
good,The Bank is a Professional Environment where they make it easy for you to learn and exceed with your current role. There is stability and growth within the company.
good,Relaxing atmophere while providing customer service to customers also solving problems and providing them with solutions.
good,"I like being part of a team....always proud to represent the company I'm working for ."
good,I have been in my current role for about 2.5 years and although i love the culture or where I work there is room for improvement. The compensation needs to better reflect the amount and quality of the work we do. Management also does not clearly communicate with the associates. Benefits are good and there is a lot of ability to move around despite not having a clear path for advancement within my current role
good,I was fortunate enough to work with such a great team who was so willing to help me out with anything. The team was so supportive and it was great environment to work in. I was also able to have a flexible schedule which allowed me to be able to work at my own pace and get things done in a timely manner.

good,"What I most enjoyed about working at bank of America was the Sunday football season everyone seemed to have football fever, which made the hardest part of working on the 1st and the 15th worth it. Co-worker's were really understanding of the daily help needed to keep up with all FDCPA and state regulations to help prevent any violations to the bank, management was also very good on getting and giving all needed guidelines to keep in regulation. Learned more about mortgages including short sale, deed in lieu, and other ways to save or let go of a home then I ever thought I would. A typical day at work could be very stressful or very easy going depending on what each call was like and how it was handled, I personally do my best to never take it personal which helps the day go good."

good,"Great management team, cares about employees well being . learn new things in the banking industry.. upbeat enviorment wonderful co workers"
good,"Working from home, most days started at 7 am reviewing new email communications and participating in meetings via teleconference.  There was much time spent on following up with applications to ensure they were on track to complete the various federally-mandated (Sarbanes-Oxley) risk and compliance review deliverables constantly coming due.  Identification of risks before Audit would find them and the development of action plans with milestones to address the open issues was a daily ongoing effort.  Multi-tasking was needed in order to keep up with the various deliverables, and also to review/respond to email and to take additional required compliance training on an ongoing basis.  The hardest part of the work was that, frequently, one had to walk a fine line between allowing applications to get their regular software (and hardware) development/maintenance work done while also getting them to complete the mandated compliance activities.  Management was supportive most of the time, but they were also caught somewhat between the need for rolling out (time to market) or fixing application functionality and delivering on the compliance requirements.  Co-workers were geographically far-flung across the U.S., and some were in Asia and Latin America.  Most enjoyable was to have risk/compliance issues remediated while maintaining a good relationship with the most impacted people."
good,"Working here had allowed me to hone in on my team-working abilities as well as further my career options. "
good,Worked here for 2 years. Culture is so-so. Comp and benefits are amazing. ME close hours can be brutal. Overall an okay place to work. I will probably be here for another 3-5 years.

good,"Upper management not so good...Mid management great to work with, co-workers great to work with.  Events for staff (Town Halls, etc..) was a great touch to the day to day work place."
good,Great environment with freedom to get your job done. No micro management. Excellent training. Relaxed environment even though fast paced.
good,the manager's are very constructive and always want you to do your best. there are both very capable people and few not so capable people.

good,All in all Bank of america was okay to work for. Management could have been better. I enjoyed the new friendship I made there.
good,The job involved reviewing loan modification documents and deep-diving to figure out the complexities of what stage the loan documents were in and why.  I enjoyed the research aspect of the position.

good,My typical day of work consisted of helping customers manage their accounts. My management team was always so helpful in training and molding me into the teller I needed to be. My coworkers were the most fun after work when all seriousness was put aside. The hardest part of my job was alerting a customer of negative impacts on their accounts. The most enjoyable part of this job is knowing that a customer's need where met.
good,I gained a wealth of management training and knowledge that I can carry with me the rest of my life. Working for a large corporation had its perks. Never a dull moment and always a learning curve.
good,Everyday is repetitive facing the same problems with the same people. The biggest downfall of the company were the referalls and the upper management.
good,"This job required focus and concentration, due to the high level of money involved.  I loved my co-workers, and I learned a lot about financial institutions and how they are ran while working there.  I had a lot of responsibility for what I considered a less than optimal amount of pay, but I did love my job.  I loved by customers and the relationships I developed with them all."
good,"Not sure if Blue School is still in business, I enjoyed working with the kiddos there. A very rewarding job to see the progress with some of the long term kiddos."

good,"Great company, excellent working conditions, good benefits, plenty of challenges and lots of internal opportunities"

good,Excellent benefits. Started with Bank of America after college. Great place to start a career. Lots of resources and I learned a lot about building a book of business.
good,"I manage a team of 25 direct and indirect associates and my major role is to manage the daily risk of what my team executes.  The team executes various types of elective corporate action events, such as tender offers, cash and stock mergers, etc.  The best way I have found to describe what I manage is to parallel the process to the input of trades into the stock market.  Execution of elective corporate action events is the equivalent of entering a trade in the market and the risk associated with that process.  Valuations of some of the deals executed reach into the billions of dollars based on the client base I support.  This is in addition to managing migrations into my group as well as offshoring, managing people, adhering to regulations and audit requirements, in addition to driving change to improve processes and limit risk."
good,I really enjoyed my career at Bank of America in Chandler Arizona. I started with mortgage and really want to move the direction of my career back.
good,"No benefits, frequent layoffs, everybody scared environment, nobody talks to each other, over engineered applications for what they do, very long and strange onboarding process"
good,Bank of America is one of the best places to work. The managers and the co-workers are very supportive on training and help individual to succeed.
good,I would work for then again. There is a lot of opportunity at times I wish I had stayed and gave it more patience. I was in a position that was created and morphed out of control. Unfortunately it wasn't realized until after I left how overworked I was even though I verbalized it.
good,"Typical 8 hour work day, high paced and competitive.  Attention to detail is a must.  Co-workers are great and always willing to lend a hand."
good,I worked for Countrywide for over 8 years then was sold to Bank of America.  I enjoyed working with mortgage refinancing.

good,Typical call center job. A lot of your day depends on your approach. If u want to clock in and just get a check it can be just that unfortunately.
good,"I managed a team anywhere from 8 to 85 resources depending upon the project.  My largest project was the conversion of the northwest and California to a common enterprise deposit platform.   The consisted of a mixture of associates, contractors, and offshore resources.   I was very fortunate in that I had an excellent staff to work with which made my job as a manger much easier.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with ever changing budget requirements as well as in recent years the great change in government regulations."
good,A typical day of work consisted of morning huddles with all associates to review the branches overall performance to ensure higher levels of customer satisfaction. Throughout the day processing  clients transactions accurately and reviewing all teller works to be scanned and forwarded out. Management was not great due to lack of effort in my opinion. The hardest part of the job was having to multi-task and complete all procedures before closing while being short staffed often. The most enjoyable part of the job was creating customer relationships and bringing the highest level of satisfaction.
good,"Oriented customer service, Advise on opening of accounts and investments. Constant training and motivation throughout the workday. We had a great team, but what I enjoyed most was the deal with the customer."
good,Culture varies with the level of professionalism. The atmosphere and management are also dependent of the type of band job. the closest you get to the top the more likely to see the company's culture reflected in every aspect of your job. The further down you wil only experience the thoughts and beliefs of the manager in turn.
good,Called customers who were past due on automobile and mobile home loans in order to get satisfactory payment arrangements. Offered programs to cure the delinquencies if eligible. Negotiated with customers to make satisfactory arrangements to bring accounts into good standings as soon as possible.

good,No comments other than great working environment. Benefit and compensation are also great.  I love working for Bank of America.
good,The overall atmosphere was good at the company. It is the type of company that if you really want to work your way up you are going to focus your career heavily on sales since without that you will not be able to move up.
good,Great place to work with an ever changing environment.  Company makes you feel at home when you arrive at the office.  Supportive management teams and aren't there to look over you shoulders and micro-manage.

good,"Met a lot of great people, became friends with many of them. I had a great team that became a little family, loved going to work everyday. Learned different types of management skills and programs that I believe increased my knowledge. I had a great manager that was fun and gave us clear instructions on many of the job tasks. Unfortunately there was too many departments being redeployed and it brought a lot insecurity and low morale. Bank of America was a great place to work."

good,Bank Of America was an awesome to work for they offered great benefits.

good,very stressful and if you are a teller all they care about is bringing in referrals. I really liked it when i was part time but then i was basically forced to be ful-time.
good,This was a job that showed me I did not want to enter the stock market. It was a good learning experience though.  The culture wasn't for me either a little to uptight. Work life balance was normal though.
good,Bank of America has a great culture but I found the organization to be very large and difficult at times to find other opportunities.

good,"Bank of America has been a good company to work for for the past 8 years. During the past few months changes have occurred which cause customer dissatisfaction leaving the retail employees in the forefront without the resources to embrace the changes. Therefore, from branch managers to tellers and everyone in between we experience quite a bit of resentment from our account holders, which has made it a bit challenging to retain clientele. If it wasn't for personal relationships developed between employee and customer, we believe the changes would not only impact the customers but employments as well."

It was a good time work in the Factory Development Team and practice collaboration with Associates who also felt empowered and were held accountable for assigned tasks.

good,"Being a ""Relationship Banker"" (Personal Banker) at Bank of America, it is required to meet daily goals and be able to uncover financial needs according to what is revealed from the customer. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to assist customers in either saving money, whether it is through balance transfers, auto loan refinance, or even mortgage refinances.

good,They have a program called MyWork which allows you to work from home or from any location.  I enjoyed the interactions I had with my fellow associates while working on several projects. The recognition structure is excellent.
good,"I enjoyed working at Bank of America for the most part. It allowed me to develop myself as a salesman and as a manager. Sadly, you ran a 50/50 chance of having a fantastic manager or an absolutely useless one. I had managers that would be there supporting their crew putting in 50+ hours a week and had others that would put in 20 hours a week and use their time at work to get haircuts and run errands or go out to lunch with friends. This was troubling for the employees, as many times the branch managers are necessary for performing critical functions such as overrides and approvals for transactions that could not be completed normally by an assistant manager or banker/teller. Other than that, it was a great company to work for with fantastic benefits. I also felt like the employees of the retail side of the bank were looked down on by the investment and corporate sides of Bank of America, and were not assisted in a timely fashion when important tasks needed to be accomplished for clients. Lastly, I felt that the company constantly backtracked on promises in regards to incentives and goals and would coincidentally change them or find an idiosyncrasy that allowed them to lower or completely remove bonuses that had been met previously. My branch and many others were subjected to constant staff cuts which sometimes meant there were only three employees at a branch at a given time, which meant long wait times for customers. Customer satisfaction was added in to your incentive and of course this was a detriment as many customers left unsatisfied at the long wait."
good,A great company if you are looking to start a career in the banking and financial environment. If you are looking to get ahead.

""The only constant is change""  which is a very true statement.  It helps you learn to leave problems at the door outside of work, for example, each call was different from the last.  If the previous call was challenging there is no way I was going to let the next customer hear that in my voice.  It was a different person, different scenario."

good,"An Innovative company.  Changing to be more competative."
good,"Working at Bank of America, is a challenge but its an amazing challenge because I'm getting to know new people and understanding their values in life. In addition to their value, would be their money and some customers don't know how to save or invest and its my job to inform them about the products we have to make it easier for them to save or even easier to help their day go by faster with the products we do have as a company. My managers are always willing to help out when I do struggle with certain products, but the point of their help is to help me so I would know the answers later on with other customers. My co-workers stand right be-side me so when we do have questions for each other we can always ask each other for help and that's part of having teamwork because we wouldn't be able to do it individually, we need each other. The hardest part, I will honestly say, are my referrals. I'm not the best seller, but I will not give up on becoming the best seller. I was always taught to never give up so if that means staying in school to educate my mind and staying at work longer to do better at work that's what I will do and what I have been doing. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people. You will never know who you can meet and being able to put a smile on their face after they leave my window makes me feel better as a person because we are all human trying to do better in life. No mater how hard it may get, knowing that I can make it easier for someone by giving them a smile and giving you answers you need to make it easier, why wouldn't I do it? Its a life"

good,"At BOA I would say a typical day at work in my department was enjoyable for the most part. I had the opportunity to work and build a rapport with different investors on their guidelines. Our management team was more easy going kind of laid back, but got the job done. They allow you to work independently on your assigned project with little or no supervision as long as the job was completed. I enjoyed working with my co-workers on my team everyone work as a team to get the job done. I would say the hardest part of the job would be communication with the clients and the Line of Business at times. In other words sometimes the guidelines and procedures was inconsistent and some discrepancy from time to time, but it was not anything that could not be solved.

good,"I enjoyed working for BOA however, I was a little taken back after my promotion.  I felt I was lied to about what was expected of me and almost feel as though I was ""thrown to the wolves"".

good,Working at Bank of America for the past 13 years has been an amazing experience.   I have learned so much from Fulfillment starting out as an mortgage processor to managing a team of 10-15 associates.  In January 2011 I was re-deployed to Loan Servicing due to a business need and have been there up until 2/2014.  The environment was outstanding and the teamwork was great.  Unfortunately the volume was extremely low and the company had a reduction in force.

good,It was great working with a company leading in Innovation and Technology.
good,BFA give plenty of opportunities for growth to their employees.

Holding associates accountable for thier own job functions simplifies managing and keeps functions simple.Coworkers were a good group,knew thier jobs and interacted in and out of work.Hardest part of the job for me was not being able to reward associates at year end when the deserved more compensation and budjet did not allow.Best part of the was balancing everyday knowing everyone done thier job and helped each other in doing so as a team."
good,"The day begins with a huddle, which sets the tone and focus for the daily goals to achieve. As customers begin to arrive, it is my job to ensure they feel welcomed, valued and that we can meet any additional financial needs they may have by directing them to the correct associate. I also observe associates doing their daily tasks and provide mentoring and coaching to assist them in realizing their personal goals. Always celebrate small successes! I take on difficult customers/circumstances that may need additional escalations and reassure the customer of our commitment to get the matter resolved. At the end of each teller's shift, my Teller Supervisor will debrief with them. I will debrief with our sales team and gather production numbers from all associates to record in daily reports that need to be submitted by the end of the day.

good,I learned how to calculate the net asset values for different funds and produce the required monthly reports.
good,"Had worked with many a great associates and managers nationwide.  But, having worked for this company for 20 years (2 as a contractor) I had observed that this company does not truly value the daily workers, who worked their fingers to the bones for upteem years to make that bottom line or meet those demanding metrics, only to get laid off (too often) and without prior notification so they can prepare their family of the worst, emotionally and financially.  Fortunately I was not one of those weary soles who had to experience that awful event, but had moved to other departments within the bank to avoid that possibility when the scuttlebut was in the air.   I left this company because of the demanding metrics and inability to move forward from the position I was in at the time.  And becuase I, after nearly 20 years of excellent performance reviews and becoming SME in certain application areas, and because my last position proved to be more of sales related event which caused me to obtain non-average (does not meet??) metric ratings, I am not able to be rehired by this company. It's unfortunate that a company looks at your last metric rating versus your overall ratings to determine your worthiness."
good,"In order to thrive at this sophisticated and complex financial services organization, employees must be highly-skilled, committed to long hours and professional excellence and ... demonstrate superb judgment."
good,Said the company is gone it was a wonderful place to work. Merrill Lynch is not the same place since BOA took it over. They try to keep the same environment but BOA flexes its methods and ruins the work place.

However, BOA gives everyone the opportunity to achieve personal goals and grow."
good,Good company been with them over eight years in three different departments. Met a few good people and learned a lot through this company but now ready to explore different opportunities/companies in the Atlanta area.
good,"Looking for a new challenge."
good,"While there are certainly some management issues with the company, overall, it is a successful and powerful name in financial services with a multitude of resources that allow it to be competitive with its competitors. There are certainly many layers of bureaucracy which can affect the way tasks are accomplished but for a company of this size, it has certainly performed well in my opinion."

Through this position I have a better understanding of mortgages and escrow.  All co-workers from management to team members are great to work with and gives you a family like feel.  The hardest part of the job is being screamed and cursed at by irate homeowners.  The best part of the job was knowing at the end of the day you was able to assist others in a time of need."

Management was a huge lead by example role and also, encouraging to myself which helped me advance as well and as quick as I did.

I have gained a lot of knowledge from this company from being an over the top teller, personal banker responsibilities, what goes into the book work and handling the vault.

Part of our role was to manage risk by monitoring agents as they read the Federal Trade Commission and the Fair Debt Collection Procedures Act scriptings when processing payments, payoff demands and setting up automatic drafts on accounts.  I had the opportunity to facilitate various trainings such as service release loan processes, mortgage customer service and a new technology initiative for payment reversals.  I would have to meet with my team in huddles, and what we called iKnow sessions which were to update the associates on changes in procedures.  I would have monthly one on one coachings with each of my direct reports that were prescheduled and meet with them throughout the month via side by sides and coaching sessions.

Coworkers were fun, and we all got to know each other. The hardest part of the job was leaving. my time ran out and no job. I enjoyed the challenge."
good,Home retention is a high paced environment.  Systems should be updated to reflect an easier workflow.  Currently associates must work from multiple systems at one time.  Information does not feed across all departments
good,"I currently work from home.  I find this more productive than going into the office. I start at 7:30/8am and check emails from the weekend.  I then go through of prioritizing what needs to get done for the day and even the week. Since I am on the East Coast, I am usually on before my peers and even my manager. I create schedules for training projects, handle reports for the line of business and my manager, I also am the go to person for things. I have a wealth of knowledge on process, procedures, and systems that current and past peers will reach out. I also perform beyond my roles and responsibilities to help with projects."

good,"The position is primarily a sales role. The new advisor is expected to make as many cold calls and cold walks as it takes to bring in as much money as possible. The requirements are extremely high, but the reward is high (if you can make it). If you do not meet your quota, you are cut from the company."
good,customers do not always want to talk because they are being forced to talk to a live rep
good,I found the work rewarding and the staff satisfactory but lately we are downsizing the staffing models and I find it tough to take care of all the customers with the lack of staff. all in all the associates do a great job at staying customer centric.
good,"Typical day starts with reviewing email email correspondents and online notifications of service and system updates. I learned allowed about team work and maintaining a competitive spirit. Direct management always inspired me to grow and develop my self as well as ensuring that I have all the necessary tools to perform my job. The most interesting part of the job is the people, different culture and perspectives of both co-workers and clients. The hardest part of the job re-establishing certain clients trust"
good,"I never worked as a banker before. This job was very interesting but it was little intense when I needed to take care people's money. I needed to encourage my staffs to introduce, promote and selling the banking products to customers."

I received a lot of knowledge working in the Tax, Insurance & Escrow department and being a Customer Relationship manager. I learned the different programs for modifications, escrow, tax and terminalogy and how I could best assist homeowners. There were times that my job became streneous with having to decline a homeowner that may not have qualified for any loan assistance at the time, that sometimes become hard because you want to assist them all, however you have to go by guidelines & realize you aren't going to be assist everyone. The most enjoyable part of my job is being around people that has the same goal as you and that is resolving homeowners concerns. The Bank of American managment team is a group of people that is learning to grow within the company and some have more work then others as trying to be more personable, other than that working for Bank of America was a great opportunity."

I learned from management how to deliever a difficult message and see if there were other avenues that we could explore. There is a lot of team workin my line of business and we help each other as well.
good,It's was a good company to work for with good health benefit and programs for all the associates.
good,My typical day at my current banking center is very chaotic.There are a million and one things to be done and most times it is up to me to ensure things are done. I have learned that teamwork is extremely imortant. I have also learned that strong leadership is neccessary. All members of the team need to feel valued or work can become stressful and hostile. The part of my job that I find most difficult is knowing what is expected of me without being told. The most enjoyable parts of my job are interacting with customers and helping my team reach its goals.
good,"Easy and mundane. The staff was sometimes a bit overbearing and liked to complain, but otherwise a good starter job."

The hardest part of this job was also showing someone else how to do my job knowing I would be loosing my job as company was moving the call center to Washington State."
good,I've learned that there is not always just one best solution to solve a problem. I've learned to work on many projects at the same time and to pay close attention to deadlines and details.
good,Really enjoy working with clients.
good,My experience withing this particular team/department was that the manager pretty much judged you immediately. He would not take the time to listen but instead it often felt like a monologue instead of a dialogue. In my department my manager came across as superficial and didn't seem to care about personal life matters. Very rigid and non pliable with his thoughts and reasoning behind work and home life.
good,Enjoyed working as a team member for wire transfer projects. Duties covered various tasks depending on what was needed at the time.
good,"Enjoyable work environment, management receptive to associate ideas and productivity enhancements."

good,I work 7-4 by choice so I can leave early enough to pick up my children from school and dodge the heaviest traffic.
good,"I currently work for Bank of America and I have earned my lending authority as a credit analyst, as well as become a licensed mortgage processor. I can adapt to the ever changing economy and have extensive knowledge in full auditing for processing government re-finance loans. Working at such a large company can be difficult due to the fact it's hard to stand out in a large corporate office. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I am constantly learning new skills that I can use to help clients."
good,"The job itself was not to bad or too stressful. The managment was not too bad easy to handle. I learmed a lot of the collection techniques that I think are great to have coming from such a great and well know and also respected company. The co-workers, I didn't too much care for after a while it felt like a high school a little. The hardest part of the job was that there wasn't a hard part at all. It was all very doable and enjoyable."
good,I enjoyed working for the Director when I started. He single-handedly created a great workplace culture and also encouraged focus on tasks at hand.
good,"Very laid back environment, but very focused and productive. Responsibilities were easy to learn and required the utmost accuracy and attention to details."
good,"This was a high paced, driven and exciting position. Each day included document review, client interaction, transaction processing, follow up, research plus much more. The group of people I worked with were wonderful, supportive and some of the smartest people I know-they were family in some cases too. The best part of my day was talking with clients."
good,"This is a big company, so you need to be aggressive to work towards the top."
good,"I learned a lot of telephone ettiqutte from having this job. There is a way of speaking to customers via phone that is quite different than in person. You have your facial expressions to help out when you are showing a friendly side. On the phone, you have to pick your voice up to sound friendly and make sure your tone has a sense of empathy when trying to sync with the customer. I didn't like breaks being shortened because sometimes my conversations would run into my scheduled lunch. It was my problem meaning my hour would then be maybe 40 minutes because the call ran to long. I learned a lot about the stock market as well as trained my customer service abilities to adapt to any circumstance."
good,A good team workers. This company has a good benefits for its staff and an opportunity to move up.
good,"We are afforded the opportunity to participate in meaningful discussions and subsequent implementation of best practices to promote client satisfaction.

good,I was able to learn a lot. Had a lot of exposure to different areas of the company

Then i would go through tickets in the queue and attend to them as best as possible ensuring to work productively as to not have tickets pile up. I learned many troubleshooting skills for the more knowledgeable co-workers as well as how to set up cell phone plans under Bank of America's Corporate lines, and how to back up data from multiple devices onto new more efficient computers. Management was great the one supervisor who over saw our tech team was always willing to back up her team when ever customer issues went beyond our control. This made the team stronger and more confident in what we were doing. All co-workers were willing to lend a hand when ever possible. If someone from the team had seem a particular issue in the past they would usually be more then willing to shed some light on how to solve the problem at hand."
good,"Department was shut down totally. Unfortunately, the bank did not train employees to post to another position within the bank. A six month severance package was nice but we would have preferred to be transferred to another department. Very little job security consideration we gave the bank 15+ years of service."
good,"Each day is different, full of its own challenges and resolutions"

good,"Nice pay, uninformative training program, understaffed, challenging daily goals, room for advancement."
good,I would have to say that working at an in-store branch is more relaxed than working in a stand alone banking branch. The dress code is more leanient and also the tellers all have the ability to open and close customer accounts.
good,A typical day in the Mortgage and Loan department consists of daily changes. Communicating with people all over the world can be rewarding for ethical and moral reasons. Also knowing that you're possibly making a difference in someone lively hood is so cool.
good,"Bank of America is a great place to work. The staff is focused on customer satisfaction and handling transactions quickly and efficiently while providing customers with a memorable, warm experience every single time."
good,New company had a lot of kinks to work out.
good,Everyday was a challenge and a joy. I got along very well with my co-workers as a team but was expected to work alone which I did very successfully. My manager was the best manager I have ever had the pleasure of working with. Doing what was right for our customers and making sure everything was fast and accurate was fulfilling.
good,"My position was mainly Data Entry as it related to mortgage reviews. The compensation was slightly above average for the skill-set required. I started as a temp at $12.00 p/hr, and after almost two years left making $13.65 p/hr. However, based on the rate of merit increases it would take a substantially long time to break the $35,000 salary range. For the compensation and work environment, I would still recommend BOA HL&I."
good,"Such a fun, energetic but yet productive place to work. I believe the call center closed this year though."
good,Work is mostly documentation - Six Sigma.
good,The firm is not what it used to be but is still a strong option for those looking to build a business in Wealth Management.

good,Process collateral documents for loans. Learned how to process loans.
good,"I came to Bank of America (NationsBank) as a trust officer and over the next 18 1/2 years, I worked in any area of the trust department that I was asked.

good,"Great experience gainer, assisted clients with their brokerage accounts. Great co-workers to work with and talk to."
good,"Wonderful culture at Merrill Lynch & Co. prior to BofA buyout - wonderful esprit-de-corps. After the Bank of America buyout, the 'feel' of the company began to change dramatically, and the sense of Wall Street began to be diminished by the giant of Bank of America."
good,Company has great intentions but it is so inundated with processes and procedures that they miss the big picture. Great automated tools but storage was always a problem. Couldn't build VMs because they underestimated storage. Getting added storage took 6 months.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me looking at my email, checking to make sure what updates have posted for managed products, answering calls using my headset, and keeping a call log of what what discussed over the phone. I have learned the value of patience and how to explain a task so the other person understands what I am saying. The hardest part of the job was to help people who were not willing to listen to my guidance. What made my job enjoyable was finding a solution quickly for those who were frustrated. The attitude would change from frustration to gratitude instantly."
good,"BOA is a friendly place to work. The organization's commitment to the community is very high. Blood drives, United Way (just to name a few) are a common thread for Bank of America. The mortgage servicing role is one that is very detailed and fast paced. This I love! Helping customers understand bill statements, processing loan updates, etc are very enjoyable parts of the job, especially when customer satisfaction surveys come back 100%, like mine."
good,Enjoy Working at Bank of America Overall great company to work for.

good,Good Company to work for. They seem to really want to help thier achieve thier career goals.

good,Large organization on the cutting edge of retail financial services
good,It's a nice environment to work in. It teaches about the different things you can do. You just dont have to stop at one place you further your career in different positions. Some times they pay for your traveling. If you are in school they help you with atleast 30 percent . Childcare they help you with at least twenty percent
good,Bank of America is really strong about their core values and they do everything they can to accommodate employees.
good,Bank of America was my first real job right out of High school. It was a good company to work for. They closed my center down and relocated the Center to CA.
good,received 2 awards for performance employees great to work with
good,Enjoyed working here. Excellent benefits and working conditions.
good,I had a great 21 year career at BOA. It satisfied all my work needs but because I was at a remote location the chances for advancement were not very good.
good,"Priorities are always servicing clients first, not sales. The executive team is very receptive to employee feedback and concerns. BOA also encourages career growth for employees."
good,"Nice work culture and nice pay out to experience outside candidates. Benefits like Parental Insurance, Educational reimbursement and work life balance."
good,Very results oriented environment where there is a lot of individual work to achieve stretch goals.  Management expects production quickly and there isn't very many mentorship opportunities to learn how to develop business.
good,"Fun place to work on the 3rd Shift, manager, and supervisor are pretty understanding and flexible of your time and understanding of your personal situations. They are knowledgeable of their position as well as yours. This work is based on production, however, they stress the importance of quality ""vs"" quantity of production"
good,Company has a competitive benefits package compared to other institutions. Most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to help clients better their financial lives.
good,Plenty space for internal movement. Maybe too much upper management causing things to get a bit congested. Good work/life balance overall. Wish they rewarded hard work more than they do.
good,"Its a good place to work."
good,It depends on what department you worked in. I worked in a few different call centers and one was bad the other was ok. Just depends on leadership. Its a roll of the dice really
good,"I loved working at BoA for the past 4 years, the people are wonderful and are highly involved with their community. The only issue I had is that there was at least 1 “Re-Org” every year that I worked there, I had 6 different Superiors for the time I was there, which makes it hard to have a clear understanding of the direction of the position or feel confident in the stability of position."
good,"I worked at Bank of America for 13 years. If you weren't in management or friends with management, your concerns didnt matter."
good,This was my first recruiting role and learn really quick to hire for hight volume customer service roles all the way up to Branch Managers.  The technology was amazing.
good,If you are competitive and a good salesman this is a great fit for you! Just be prepared to always wonder if this is the day you lose your job. If you dont make the minimum sales requirements you don't earn your seat!
good,"I worked on several highly effective teams in my tenure at Bank of America. Team members were in India, Canada, Mexico and from coast to coast in the US. Bank of America is a good place to work."
good,Plenty of room to advance your career.  The company works hard to provide diversity and inclusion.  There is a lot work and a lot to learn.  There are a lot of different places to work.
good,"You will find great team to work with them but employee benefits are very less even though you have to work a lot. overall is nice place to work. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Bank of America.  It is has a good work environment and management was very helpful with training.  The training was hands on training versus sitting in a class room for 5 weeks.  I liked working here,"
good,The people made it fun but the customer support is not there.  Customer yells at the bank and your performance is effected by it.  Although you were appreciated and had good convo they let you take the hit for the company's performance.
good,"All around nice culture, fun environment, days can some times be long but the management does care for the most part. Hardest part is the constant rules updates as the department is new."
good,"I spent the whole day in management meetings. I did not have a lot of work to do, so it was flexible to go and shadow someone. I learned a lot from this company."
good,"Poor Knowledge Transfer, and little help from tech lead, which makes it hard getting started there."
good,The hardest part about working at Bank of America is continually striving to better serve our clients' needs. With constant changes in technology it can become difficult to keep up with how to best service the client.
good,It’s a great place to learn but no or to little room to grow in the company. Everything is based on how you sale and your judge on your numbers at the end of the day .
good,Good Experience to work with senior staff but the technology stack is very old but really depends on the team. I got to learn a lot about how to deal with clients and how to communicate via proper channels.
good,"When I applied for bank I was ecstatic to work there. Its a great place to be, the benefits are wonderful and its great money. They offer alot of networking programs and opportunity to grow there is high. However, it can be macro managed, and sometime you find yourself during your managers jobs because they don't want to learn how to do it. Other than that it's a pretty cool job."
good,The workplace culture is very focused on integrity and diversity and inclusion. Employees can bring their whole selves to work every day and expect to be accepted and included.
good,"Colleagues were supportive and nice. However, most employees need to work for quite a long time. It is hard to promote. Salary is around the average in the market."
good,Bank of America was a good place to work. I would recommend the company to anyone. They have a lot of benefits the best one for me was child care reimbursement .
good,"The site I worked at was fun but also very productive. we would have potluck lunches play games but we would also insure that all of our tasks were completed during the work day. This may not be typical throughout the company though. my experience was a good one. only bad thing I would say is, that for the work we did I believe we were under paid"
good,Good vacation and insurance and banking Benefits at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.  It is a decent atmosphere and culture and one should be able to maneuver within corporation to find job security.
good,BOA has a few different sites and depending on the support site you go to will determine the experience you have with the company. Also the engagement is a bit unorganized.
good,"Fast  paced  and  very  competitive  with more  and  more emphasis being  put  on goals,  metrics,  and  mitigating  risk for  the  bank..............."
good,"I have nothing to say.  I was always told if you have nothing nice to say don't say anything at all.  The job is temporary, not permanent and we never know when or if we're going permanent.  They expect you to be there a whole year as a temp before deciding if you should go permanent or not."
good,Customer-facing majorly. Opportunities to participate in sales and operational activities. Roleplay opportunities due to limited staff. Cross-platform training.
good,The culture is corporate and the industry is Finance so it's hard to get too exciting with material even in the Creative Departments. I will say they try to give employees a good work/life balance and there is room for advancement.
good,"i worked in many different positions and was able to learn and progress. overall the company is great but like every corporation it is about bottom line "
good,"At Bank of America you'll see plenty of people every day. Some happy, some not so much. Either way we're tasked to help them complete their transactions as quickly as possible so that they can get back to their day to day activities. As a teller when the line is long there's can be a no talk policy to help quicken the pace and lower customer wait times. This can be hard with regular customers with whom you become quite familiar with. When processing over 20 transactions per hour mistakes can and will happen. Following the money trail is crucial to keep a balanced drawer, and this can be extremely stressful. If you're a people person you'll love getting to know the people you serve. I've found my favorite taco shop, car detailers, mechanics, carpenters, and many other professionals all on the job. Lastly be prepared for attitudes. When dealing with so many people eventually you're going to get an upset customer, and it can get pretty scary when someone is upset about money."
good,"The bank has great benefits, work life balance is important within most groups, employee and community engagement is promoted. Career advancement can be challenging if you don't manage teams."
good,"Culture is switching to sales heavy culture outbound calls, managers pressuring to get sales otherwise scrutiny on not selling. Being forced to write a sentence that's not needed."
good,"Too much micro management. Very slow to adjust, Overall good work place with good benefits. Most managers are down to earth and approachable. I would recommend BoA overall for sure."
good,This is a large corporation and your time here is partially what you make of the opportunities provided within and outside the firm. The hardest part of the job is the reorgs that seem to be happening more frequently. The most enjoyable part of the job are are the teammates.
good,"If you like to be micromanaged and scolded this is the place for you! This department is for someone right out of high school or just as a resume filler.  I took this position to get  my foot in the door and have the opportunity to advance but I lasted 4 weeks. I was questioned from everything to stepping in the hall to take a phone call to why i went to the bathroom so frequently. This department is a revolving door. I'm totally use to working in call centers, I have been in that type of environment for 10 years BUT THIS DEPARTMENT has to do better. It's a fantastic company,  the benefits are the BEST I've seen in the industry  but I refuse to work in an department where I am treated like a child and not an employee!"
good,Had a very good experience .Great company to work for and great benefits. However certain location's lack diversity in management .Also no job security for lower level associate s.
good,"Bank of America needs a more Diverse Culture,  One Culture Reigns and the rest are contractors.  You're not likely to get hired on full time.  Do the work and move on."
good,Great benefits. Co-workers are like family. Get to work remotely. 401K match. Online classes. Team building events. Flex schedule. Immediate managers easy to work with.
good,I started my banking career with Bank of America and they helped set a high standard of customer service and sales skills that helped me advance in my career.  This is a great company to start your banking career.
good,excellent benefits. very fast paced. I just do not like working the second shift thats all.  If it was on the first shift then I would not have any problems with Bank of America.
good,"I enjoy the day-to-day challenges that are offered in this position and the variety in the work load - no two days are ever the same.  I enjoy the ability to work alone, creating my own goals and objectives while furthering growth.  I enjoy visiting with the clients and helping with their needs.  However, management of an office is a crucial factor in the overall atmosphere and general employee morale, which can lead one to re-think where they want their career to go."
good,"Good place to work and start off with a good job, worked with school schedule and the people were great, Customers were always wonderful...……………………………….."
good,"You can exceed your goals but still be told there is areas you can improve. A lot is expected out of you to sell clients on products and services with no follow up. Company pushes for good surveys and promise clients everything until they need something. Management is not willing to roll up their sleeves to help you, if you cant figure out how to do something, you're on your own."
good,"I've been with the company for over 20 yrs. It is a wonderful place to start, grow, and retire. There are many opportunities. I would recommend Bank of America to all."
good,Ability to work from home.  Autonomous responsibilities.  Collaborative work environment.  Felt it was hard to move up in the company because there was no mentoring atmosphere.
good,Culture changing from client and employee first to bottom line driven. Cost reductions without technology and scale will eventually lead to increased risks and client dissatisfaction.
good,I worked at Merrill Lynch and Bank of America bought out Merrill Lynch. I loved working there. Till I got pregnant. The bosses seem mad at me because I had two children 13 months apart. It was a wonderful place to work till I got pregnant. At the time I had been married for two years but was treated like I had a catchy incurable disease when I got pregnant.
good,this is over 24 years ago Merrill Lynch is no longer the same and i am sure the culture is much different - I have been exposed  to may different aspects of the financial industry since then
good,"I was on a closing team when I began and we funded home loans, very busy environment with a lot of overtime.  Moved to the RESPA Remediation position (our whole team) when the regulations changed.  Found that very challenging and rewarding."
good,"The company is stable however there is not much growth and pay is typically low.  there isn't a lot of growth. it's easy to make a lateral move, however moving up isn't likely."
good,I learned about investor requirements. Management was very helpful and considerate. Workplace was a bit strict but fun. The hardest part of the job was learning about changes and trainings.
good,"Bank of America was a good company to work for; however, they would not compensate in my opinion for the job you were doing. I do not have a lot of complaints about BOA."
good,Bank of America gives you proper training in your role and occasionally the opportunity for advancement. Depending on your role you will be certified for whatever you need to properly perform.
good,"A typical day at BOA has many moving parts so you must be able to multitask."
good,"Typical day would be attending scheduled meetings all week, with Business management teams, Developers and Architects on testing requirements for various projects.  Providing updates to upper management of current projects (testing metrics), reviewing any defects with team and pulling all vested resources together to resolve the problems."
good,"Good work place culture. People typically kept to themselves. Management was very supportive. Decent benefits. Loved the cafeteria, quiet room and gym"
good,"typical work day involves interacting with clients, improving relationships with clients and looking to grow business through sales."
good,Good place to work in nice location.  Large organization with autonomies within departments.  Technically savy with advanced management.  Good culture.
good,Nice diversity. Good schedule. I had great Manager in my project  but later on he was replaced by some one very young and unprofessional. It was nice experience anyway. I will recommend BOA.
good,I spent several years here and had many good memories working closely with very skilled and very intelligent people. I was able to advance fairly quickly based on my ability to communicate and learn new applications and systems in short order. I value the people I met and the experience I gained as a result of my 13 years here.
good,I had a lot of fun working until my department closed. Then i was switched to a call center which i didnt apply for. Work was too stressful calls were back to back. Ended up quitting because nature of work.
good,"As a branch manager, you create the culture for your staff. You learn quickly what is important and what is expected of you from your leadership. You collaborate with your staff to maximize opportunities throughout the day."
good,"Like any corporation, there are many great leaders and people who mean well. But also like many very large companies, there are so many layers of leadership that things get lost in the shuffle. "
good,"Overall, Bank of America is like any giant corporation. The many layers of management: Executive, International, National, Regional, Market, and finally local branch/office management can make any company seem heartless, disconnected, and lacking empathy for employees. While Wells Fargo was caught doing the wrong thing because their corporate structure couldn't let them see the trees through the forest, Bank of America (and others) are not better - they just haven't been caught. The same problems with HR are probably still going on: That is, report anything to HR and YOU are seen as a trouble-maker versus trying to help the company be better. Otherwise, it's a good company to work for. Just don't expect anything will change or get better. Take your pay and benefits, go home, and keep that fake smile day after day."
good,Nice culture workplace. Great schedules. Many mentoring programs. Hardest part of the job would be dealing with access issues. I have learned many things to help advance my Career in Mortgage.
good,The management was very supportive. In the technical support role the training was basically on-the-job but there was some individualized training as well.
good,"I started the PMD program at ML and it was very difficult. You had to wait until after passing the Series 7 to organize your prospect list and by that time, I had lost contact with many of them. You had to get 10 meetings per week. There was a lot of training, sometime too much and poorly timed. Ex, you got 10 hours training on the Client Management System about a month before you could get access to the software. The goals were hard to make, especially if you were not on a team. Only 30% of PMDs make it through the program and I think those are the ones on teams."
good,"Worked in Wealth Management, culture was to process Financial Advisors client's product orders quickly and accurately (opening/closing new accounts, check orders, credits, etc)."
good,BOA started to move jobs from my area to offsite vendors in and effort to save money after the economic crash.  collections and call centers are the most easily outsourced areas so it had a huge impact.
good,"management and peers either make it an enjoyable experience or an awful one. You learn a lot and but if the management is helpful and likes you then you'll get promoted, instead of basing it on your overall performance."
good,I liked the people I worked with and team culture in Concord CA. Middle management are responsive to employee's development and needs. Health benefits and the Gym was one of the good perks.
good,"This company is definitely driven by sales. Employees are expected to exceed goals while the company continues to make changes that help them track data  but makes it more difficult for the employees to perform their jobs well. They do offer amazing benefits such as paid maternity and paternity leave, paid vacation and sick time, partial childcare and tuition reimbursement, medical, dental, vision, 401k and life insurance."
good,"I worked for Bank of America for 19 years, expected to retire from there.  Then again, another merger and I was laid off.  Bank of America did take good care of their laid off employees.  I was very pleased with the severance pay and classes they have offered."
good,"I enjoy helping customers with their financial lives through this job. Typical day would be to assist clients, follow best practices and continue to sell products. The downfall is that it is still considered a retail job and you have to be there if someone else calls out. Your job is determined based off sales performance versus work ethic."
good,Portfolios were large and sometimes unmanageable. Training and information was either non-existent or overwhelming. Some business decisions were implemented and then scrapped because they did not work and should have been better thought out.
good,"Large company.  Because of that, there are a lot of tools and resources available to employees to assist in overall career growth.  Thrived in the environment as a person."
good,"Some managers are great, others are not. Can be a petty environment. BOA does try to compensate by free picnics/events to help with lack of compensation"
good,"Overall, their were interesting projects that I was associated with and aside from the small bumps in the road, the teams I worked with always came together to get the job done."
good,I enjoyed working for BofA but they were very strict regarding attendance which is why I no longer work there. I don't remember really having an issues while working there.
good,"good place to work no job security"
good,Very nice company to work with. CEO really cares about the employees and the employees are allowed to share their thoughts.  Company is always striving to do better. A normal day there is always busy. Nice colleagues.
good,"Briefly describing Bank of America is difficult given the wide range of products and jobs that are part of the organization.  In a business continuity role, with which I am most familiar, the requirements vary from day to day and week to week.  While some weeks will be extremely busy and rather stressful, I saw a fair bit of variety in what I had to do.  Life was rarely boring.  The bank is very serious about supporting a diverse environment, which I think does strengthen the organization."
good,"It was very fast paced, I enjoyed working there until we had to work overtime of which we were never paid just to meet our goals. I learned a great deal from mortgage applications refi's, Balance transfers to just maintaining and deepening relations. Customer service covers everything and I enjoyed helping people. The hardest part of the job was taking peoples paychecks through overdraft fees and unable to help."
good,"I worked there for four years.  When I came in I had to ask the lead what I needed to do that day.  Often I would have to do several different jobs every day.   I did enjoy most of the people I worked with, but having to switch jobs several times a day was irritating."
good,"Working at Bank of America was very educational and rewarding for me. I was mentored and was assisted in bettering myself"
good,"Mainly I took calls, helped resolve Customers concerns or complaints, sold Insurance to them to protect their credit cards, and did credit increases. We were timed on each call, very stressful, had to up sale a lot but we made $11.25 an hour which was the best paying job I ever had. And the management was helpful and friendly, but the Center had to have employed 100 people by the time a year was up to keep it open."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy because of the type of job that i had.  But, it was very rewarding.  I was able to help a lot of customers with their financial needs."
good,"As a group lead in a Lockbox department, a  typical day would be to pass out the work (mail) to extractors to process for the day. Answer any questions the extractors may have. Fix Opex machines as needed through out the day. Pass out Express mail received from the mailroom. "
good,Very diverse company and have very detail training and learning lunch sessions....which was very informative.  Work life balance was always great but during the summer months only.
good,"excellent company, enjoyed my years with them. my first job, was with them for 20 years till the department was closed. one of the best company I worked."
good,"I had to assist clients with their checking/saving accounts. This can be a fairly easy task but sometimes difficult, because you are dealing with money and clients can be stressed out and sometimes rude when their financial status is not currently where they want it to be."
good,"Worked almost a year here and since BofA took over, it seems compared to other financial firms, pay is a bit below average and discounts on health benefits isn't great. Still costly compared to previous employers with smaller firm. I would think since bigger and more well-known company, cost of benefits would be better. "
good,Bank of America as a company is an awesome place to work for however Bank of America Houston is political and it is all about who you know versus your job skill.
good,"Fair benefits package"
good,"I worked for bank of America 20 years. Some jobs were cool, some were boring. Bank of Americas pay sucks big time. Bank of America is always laying off people . Has great benefits."
good,"I went to BOA only to maneuver my way into their Finance division. I got a job in the call center servicing small business accounts then transitioned to commercial banking. Once there I took advantage of their tuition reimbursement and finished my Bachelor's in Finance. Turns out 99% of their financed based roles are in North Carolina and NY. If you have sales experience there are tons of opportunities, especially in CA. Although they promote within, they understandably only hire based on hard experience. The problem is, it almost seems as you have to leave and come back with experience to get the job you want."
good,"The work that I did was very easy,we worked in groups,and we all had to be very detail in the job that we did. I did  data entry of by verifying the six components of a check.Checks documents to make sure that they were credit cards payments and not copies before they were deposited into customer accounts."
good,Bank of America is a good place to start a career.  You can learn a lot by the training opportunities they offer and it can be really good for you down the road.
good,Unfortunately due to me being a temp I was not allowed in any activities that Bank of America was giving to there employees. So as a temp we did our own luncheons to make us feel at home like everyone else.
good,The day to day routine is to contact/establish new leads and to follow up with existing leads to book the loan. Establishing more leads gives you more opportunities to increase loans booked. The hardest part of the role is meeting and maintaining the sales criteria on a monthly basis. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with very supportive teammates.
good,It is a very efficient place which is also a positive environment with a sense of unity. It was nice delivering mail to workers and also being able to ask workers on the trading floor about their job
good,"Good position for someone who can dedicate their time to the job. School and out of work life may conflict. You have a meeting in the mornings, you're expected to keep certain currency levels at your register to ensure loss prevention."
good,When I worked here the bank was known as U.S. Trust Company.  This was/is a Wealth Management bank.  I was very happy here. The culture was really great.  There weren't to many of us so we were like a family.
good,"My experience at Bank of America truly helped to launch my professional career, especially in terms of building my confidence and my ability to interact with others."
good,"I enjoyed my work processing FHA and VA Government loans and Quality Analyst.  I feel that my manager utilized my skills with excel and powerpoint to build our reporting system which was distributed to company managers.  I have learned a lot while working with Bank of America, and I feel these skills would be useful to any company."
good,"With the sheer size of the organization, opportunities are boundless if you know how to use the system. Typically managers are supportive of those who are looking to move on to new opportunities."
good,"Great atmosphere to work, with an open office concept. Management are courteous and friendly, the organization values family and team bonding. You are in charge of your own success."
good,"Great place to work, starting out. Meeting people on a daily base , group activity’s, sales, hardest part of the job was making sure no robberies , and stay safe."
good,Productive and collaborative workplace. Friendly and flexibility environment. Job work and life balance is very good. More often team events to enjoy and relax.
good,The company was great to work for but attrition combined with increasing workloads prevented extracurricular projects from being completed which is the main way to advance.
good,"Pull reports and assign accounts to be audited. Assembled teams of employees to work together to assure that each portfolio was complete before the end of each day."
good,I don't not want to fill out a review for this company. It won't let me skip this part in the sign up process or i would've. visit their website if you want info
good,"I started as a regular fraud specialist, worked myself up to a different position within a year and then became a team leader /supervisor. I had 20 people under my management."
good,tremendous amount of focus on compliance and adherence to policy. Not a lot of risk taking in terms of encouraging employees to innovate or go above and beyond for customers.
good,"The Bank culture is drastically changing and it is reducing staff as it attempts to steamline its line of businesses to stay comptetitive."
good,"Company Lacked job advancement . Other then that i enjoyed working for the company. spent the last seven years working there. i would recommend this company to someone who is only looking for it temporary,"
good,Work days vary but as a personal banker can be very stressful. The managememt was always in control and ran the organization  by micromanagement. I did enjoy my time working at Bank Of America though they provided excellent benefits.
good,My last position was as an Operations Analyst which was most interesting & challenging. I enjoyed it very much. Prior to that I had worked part-time as a teller by preference. Also enjoyable because of my co-workers & customers. Management was typical for a large corporation but my immediate supervisors were very good. Hardest part of the job was confronting people accused of fraud. Most enjoyable was being able to help local managers keep on track with policy & procedures.
good,"Working for this company has been a journey and one the I'll never forget. Most of the time the work is steady and then others when it's extremely difficult to accomplish. I've learned to never give up, start on tasks as soon as you can and double check your work before submitting. The environment of working there is one that will last forever, being that friendships & networking was created, I'll never forget them. It was a pleasure working for the company, I will take all the knowledge that I've gained and apply that to the next company I am able to provide my services for."
good,"Excellent Diversity and inclusion program emphasize "
good,"People on the team I was on, were fabulous to work with and we all had the same goal, improve the environment to become more stable.  Team members of other teams were just as helpful and we all worked together very well!"
good,"Fast-paced environment, tightly regulated, a lot of documentation limiting deliverables. Challenging adjustment from brokerage work culture (Merrill Lynch) that I came from."
good,Bank of America provided great benefits in a stressful working environment. Support was given with limited training. Long days with minimal overtime available. Great starting job for data entry.
good,"The role was an excellent beginner role into investments. It gave great opportunities to learn about 401K's, cash management accounts and more."
good,"Working at Bank of America Merrill Lynch had been a challenging yet rewarding moment. "
good,had a great experience working there. tough to survive cause there are chances of making mistakes. but if someone interested in wealth management business surely it is a great firm
good,High paced environment; very demanding. Benefits are incredible and is a big part of the reason I have dtayed so long. Management environment very political but if u work hard you will do well. Left due to department elimination
good,"Career advancement and training, good leadership, good benefits and work environment. work from home."
good,did not like that I worked 10 months and was fired in one day without a cause...went home on Friday without any warnings found an email at home telling me not to show up on Monday and no reason for that
good,Began as customer call center for CD/IRA.  Department then transferred to Checking/Savings then closed when entire center moved to Texas.   Local management was great but corporate structure didn't get us.
good,really enjoyed working at BOA benefit's were amazing I had some great co workers as well as managers and I would love to return one day to try all the different paths they provide at BOA
good,Good compensation and benefits.  Moving to agile and open work space which is not well received by employees but it will save the bank money.  Insurance is competitive.
good,BOA was a great place to work! I would still be there if my department didn't close! If I had the chance to go back I would! BOA is still a great place to work at!
good,Part of Bank of America legacy banks.  Led team of Financial Consultants working in bank branch locations to consult with bank clients on retirement and investment needs.
good,BOA was where I received most of my training as a Real estate mortgage propfessional & it was where i developed a love for this industry. I still have friends that work for the company.
good,Great environment and staff that worked there. Training was very well organized. The company provided so many resources for their workers.  The schedules were very flexible.
good,"With the increased scrutiny of the regulatory environment, everything is a fire drill and all tasks need to be completed in an abbreviated amount of time.  Sometimes time constraints seems unrealistic to develop a solid response."
good,"After 12 years, I have learned customer service, different computer software, team work, and how to be more productive.  The toughest part is meeting the hourly goals for each task.  You have good days and bad and they usually balance out.  I have developed some long term friendships with coworkers, that I wouldn't trade."
good,"Pluses: The inhouse technogy and approach to team work are very impressive there. It is nice to work in a team of very bright people and learn to understand the works of the technology. "
good,"- Good company to work for."
good,Benefits are average for the current market. The bar has gradually been lowered for all companies in the past ten years. What was once considered below average benefits is now considered average as costs have increased. The culture is mostly good. There were some executives and management that came over from Countrywide that were willing to cut corners while I was there.
good,"Greta place to work part time and get some extra cash. Employees are friendly and warm. The company is big in of itself, but you don't feel that it is since you work at local branches."
good,I worked primarily for Merrill Lynch which included an extremely corporate and regulated environment which I do not particularly care for. meetings were by the book and we were required to do training monthly which had no real connection with day to day operations and was used for compliance purposes.
good,"Tuition reimbursement was one of my favorite duties at the bank."
good,"The salary is quite good, but bonuses are not.401k investment options are comprised mainly of Merrill Lynch products. I would rather that the company offered best in class (as rated by Moody's, S&P, etc.) for each type of offering since there is no defined benefit plan (as with most non-government jobs) and employees must invest a good portion of their earnings for retirement. The work is interesting and my co-workers were extremely nice. Overall, this is a good place to work."
good,Fast paced work environment at large fulfillment center. Friendly coworkers and great benefits. 
good,One of the best companies to work for for training in the financial field and to start a career.  Learned many valuable points of information about the field of work and about myself.  Very stressful and number oriented jobs and must be able to set and accomplish goals.
good,"Was hired as a portfolio underwriter, after 6 days was reassigned into the Credit Risk department to provide forensic underwriting on defaulted loans.  Wanted to return to front line underwriting when the market improved."
good,Typical day: 7 touches day of including reviewing a new file ; addressing new documents / information for existing files ; submitting completed files & hoping to pass audit .  Production driven.  Upper Management completely disconnected from the little peeps.  Workplace Culture for the most part is up beat .  Hardest Park of the Job: passing audit .
good,"Good place to work overall. Lots of benefits. At my location management was horrible. Felt like I was in kindergarten because of micro management. No positive reinforcements, had daily group meeting and we would get grilled everyday, heard manager was fired about a month after I left."
good,Good place to start a career.  Room for growth when in junior roles.  Work life balance ebbs and flows depending on role.  Compensation growth has not met expectations.
good,"Ran out of advancement opportunities, and lacked in training to take skills elsewhere. The motto was to be a better place to work. Casual Attire everyday was a plus."
good,management only cares about making money in their pockets even if the team is difficult to work with.  they'd rather let good talent go than try to confront a problem and try to fix it.
good,"Some folks take an unearned title to another level and feel they are superior to others.  "
good,"Was usually the only one working the teller line unless one of the intermediaries was helping out. Coworkers were nice, but there was no connection between each other. Pay was good and benefits are nice, but very boring job."
good,"It was a pleasant time and I learned valuable lessons. My largest drawback was that I was hired for an assistant role, but due to the production levels, they removed my position and I was placed in a seasoned role, which was difficult since I was not given the proper time to learn the role, accommodate my duties, and train others to bring me the necessary leads. It was too much for someone with no experience to succeed with the higher output necessary to keep the commission/performance based demands of the job."
good,"job sponsors you for financial licensing.  Job is stressful sometimes and not exactly fun, but a really good position for stability and benefits, and pay is reasonable."
good,"Typical day was to login, host various turnover calls, and put out fires. The good side was satisfaction when a good hard day was completed. Very dedicated co-workers"
good,Had a great manager and great people on the Financial Team that I worked with at Merrill-Lynch.  We all got along together and worked together to get the Project done.
good,I was a teller. I handled deposits and withdrawals. Mostly typical teller duties of handling cash and making sure all was accounted for and in order. Management was very nice.
good,"I liked what I did, was pretty good at what I did.   I still have multiple friends from there.   The biggest downside was their mid to upper level mgmt.    We were routinely shifting how to do certain tasks in a different manner than what we were doing een though what we were doing was fine."
good,Bank of America has good benefits.  They could definitely improve on pay and opportunities for advancement. There is a fairly good work/life balance.  My position has been pretty stable.
good,It's a good platform to gain knowledge and become expertise with values. It has good culture and good salary packages. It ensures employee safety and provides many knowledge gaining training sessions.
good,"Probably no longer a very good place since it is now Bank of America but it was a great job when I was there in mid 1990's.  Tellers had the most difficult job, dealing with impatient customers who would expect you to know them and gripe if you asked for i.d. before handing over several hundred dollars to them. Management was very supportive tho and always backed us up for asking for i.d.  One rude customer even had their account closed by management because he thought he had to wait too long then we declined to cash his check when he didn't have proper i.d. and he flipped us off as he drove away. I got a bonus one quarter for outstanding customer service and insurance was available for part-timers. We could purchase an extra week of vacation. Main drawback was that Mondays were so busy and in the drive thru we worked 12 hours on Mondays to accommodate the extra traffic.It was a part-time job while my kids were small and I got excellent reviews and recommendations from the branch manager but still couldn't find another job within the bank. Think they looked down on tellers even tho I have a BS degree in business."
good,Everyday is a challenge and a learning experience by providing solutions for goals with internal & external customers.  Managing Financial Centers  by educating and coaching Personal Bankers to provide Business solutions for business clients.
good,no comment   on this company  at this time.   don't really have any thoughts on this company .  needs improvements. .....................................
good,Love working there just wish it wasn’t so demanding and stressful. As a Loan Officer this is how th business is. But I fed that my manager really didn’t like me. July 2017 I went on vacation to Ghana with my family. From the 1st to the 22nd. Went back to work on the 24th of July. I was written up do to me not producing for the month of July??  Very frustrating I was on vacation. His excuse this is procedure.
good,Bank of America is a great company to work for. I do feel that sometimes management choices for hiring new associates need to be thought out more and training within to groom associates to become managers needs to be made a proity of they want to keep the good talent they have. The work is simple but attention to detail must be a priority.
good,"Very good learning , work environment is good, office work culture is good. "
good,"It's an awful industry. No company truly cares about the people who work for them, but I did enjoy better benefits than other places and had some amazing co-workers."
good,Please review resume for a job description. My resume explains the job functions of my position at Bank of America. the position is very challenging and rewarding.
good,"I loved working at BOA, however I didn't like it when over the years good people who were doing a great job were laid off because there was a person in India that could work for a lot less money.  I saw lots of co-workers leave over the years."
good,"Bank of America is a great place to work. It has great benefits and resources for their employees.   It is a place that encourages networking and career development.  However, there has been a lot of shrinkage at this time."
good,"Allows you to have a work life balance,  provides transport facilities.. Provide mid day meals..have great maternity benefits.... Fun environment.. Reachable hr team.."
good,Very tough to make money doing mortgages due to strict guidelines.  Too many mortgage applications turned down. The people I worked with were very nice & helpful and the bank  was good
good,"Take advantage of the opportunity and learn financial topics, use it to improve your resume and grow either with the company or outside doing something better."
good,"It is a tough job, especially trying to find new clients.  However, it is rewarding to be able to help people with their finances and Merrill compensates you well, if you do a good job."
good,"A typical work day is to sign into your work system, view your emails for call back and documentation. Once emails and documents has been uploaded and attached to the clients file make yourself available and start taking calls to help a client find or refinance their home. I learned that follow up is an essential part of customer service, without follow up customers are not aware how you value their business. The hardest part of my job is being patient while waiting for a call to come into your line to assist new client on obtaining their housing needs. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I can help a family obtain a favorable results when applying for a new home for their family and refinancing a home for someone so that their children can go to college."
good,It was a okay. Job was part time and pay was efficient. Co-workers were cool and the job was not stressful at all. Stay organized and follow the legal requirements
good,"A Day consisted of a pipeline of customers needing everything from document verification to confirming packages had been notified. The most enjoyable part was i was able to build a relationship with the customers, ensuring they knew I had their best interest in mind."
good,"expected daily sales, overall it is a good place to work for as long as management is respectful of associates. Must be full-time in order to get promoted."
good,It was a good company. It was my first job I learned many new things about the corperate world.Work experience was also great.As i said it was my first job i couldnt compare it with other organisations.
good,"Merrill Lynch Relocation offered many benefits by way of classes in New York City.  I learned a great deal from their seminars and classes.  The job itself was good, although management was somewhat vague in terms of being clear about what they expected.  All in all, however, it was a good job."
good,"High stress, constantly undergoing reorganization. I had some 22 different bosses in 16 years with the company. Laying off a large percentage of older, more expensive workers, and hiring younger, cheaper ones. Huge shift of talent to competitors."
good,"The work environment, benefits, and schedules are wonderful. The problem with working there are the pushy sales goals. They make it very stressful to achieve sales goals."
good,"Good location. Co workers were nice, hours were very good pay was competitive. I would recommend that any of my friends that are looking for a job look here."
good,"Good benefits, good paid time off/vacation/sick leave.  Very little chance for advancement.  Game of Thrones cutthroat social culture with heavy bias towards favorites from management.  Some management very good, some management VERY bad.  Pay wasn't very good.  Liberal indoctrination."
good,"One of the good things about B of A is they are one of the few companies willing to train people newer to the industry.  They have an excellent training program for their positions. The pay is not as competitive as their competitors due to the amount they spend on training.  If you're trying to get into banking or the financial service industry, this is a great place to start.  While the wages are less than competitive, their benefits are superior and they provide 3 weeks vacation standard.  Management was hit and miss.  However, they do get rid of bad managers eventually.  Job security is above average, although they did have layoffs. However, the trend when I left the company was to lay off more and more employees and pile on the work on those who remain.  Also the monthly goal (read ""quota"") of production kept increasing to the point that it was out of reach and meant you would not longer receive your monthly bonus, and was therefore a pay cut."
good,"Decent place to work, People were nice. Management was clueless. Pay and benefits were fair considering the work. Moved operations to Texas only reason I am not still there"
good,This was great starter job for me. I learned a lot bout banking and operations. The on the job training taught me so much.  I also develop a lot of friendship that I still cherish to this day
good,Bank of America has a lot of great benefits and opportunities. The problem is that mid level management does not follow the directives form upper management which leads to confusion.
good,"I was a teller with Bank of America, it was Part-time and fairly easy work, sometimes slow , sometimes busy. The only negative I had was as a teller you had to have a quota on ""selling"" or recommending services that customers would have to agree to do in order to get credit for offer. so especially in a drive thru teller a customer will not want to set up an appointment to speak with a representive about a savings account or whatever..but if you didnt offer or they didnt agree to speak then you didnt get credit for that attempt. and you have to have so many agreements or can get wrote up. this was back in 2011-2012 so not sure if same rules apply. otherwise i liked it."
good,Every 6 months - keep laying off technical staff.  The cuts are now so deep that it is difficult to achieve any business results.  They hire many contractors who come and go.  It has been a good place to work but increasingly hard to stay positive about the situation.
good,"Good place to work, but since purchased by Bank of America more concerned about Merrill Lynch cross selling bank products than about helping Merrill employees."
good,The company had a good benefits but very stressful because of competitive with other banks.  They have a goal that needs to be reach everyday no matter what.S
good,"Working at BankofAmerica/Merrill Lynch is very interesting since the BofA side of the house is laid back and I would say slow paced, and ML is just the opposite. I am stuck with a mix of both cultures and prefer the ML side of the house since I don't have patience for wasteful discussions and over analyzing simple solutions to problems."
good,"Lacked respect for management."
good,Bank Of America is a great Job. With my lifestyle I recommend to advance in my career more. Bank Of America isn't giving me more opportunities in the workplace. I want to go into a job that I will love to go to work so therefore I can perform greater.
good,High Pace position that demands patience. I enjoyed the company because I gained valuable customer service skills that will be very useful in my customer service career moving forward.
good,a typical day is busy I was doing data entry all day . I learn the importance of accuracy. management was nice and professional. the other employees was nice very helpful. there wasn't really anything hard.
good,"I'm fairly new at bank of America, although, I was given 2 weeks vacation it's hard to get off. Also, they do not allow 1 hour lunch. It is a good job."
good,"As a telecommuter for many years, Bank of America provided a good work life balance. While I may have worked more than 40 hours per week, this was offset by not having an extensive commute."
good,"This could be a great place to work if managers were more proactive with helping associates advance instead of hindering growth. Some managers do and others don't. You don't know what you are going to get until you get with that particular manager and also, when applying for other jobs within the company, make sure to ask the recruiter questions if you don't get the position you applied for."
good,Could be a better working environment. Requires sizeable diversity hires. Great team! Worked with a great manager. Would work for him again if under different circumstances.
good,"People are  highly skilled and  focus  on deliverables. Decent compensation . "
good,"Loved my branch manager, loved my district manager, hated the hours. Working six days a week is not worth it to me. Pay was decent. PTO was generous. Benefits were affordable."
good,This job came along as the right time in my career. It wasn't stressful but there were great people to work with. Creative ideas were appreciated and promoted
good,"This was a nice job placement and the management was supportive and hands-off.  The facility was downtown and in a great location for services.  All in all, a nice place to work."
good,"Change in management was very often, hard to keep employees and hard to advance. Had great benefits and paid vacation and maternity leave was structured well"
good,"Room to Grow, Unless the moved the department to another state. Job security, management always willing to help and they offer tips how to moved up in the company"
good,Keyed in check amounts for processing and payment on a daily basis.  Had to key in several basket of checks per night that I worked.  Very load environment.
good,I worked here for over 24 years and it was definitely a learning experience.  I made lifelong friends and will never forget anyone there.  There were times when it got frustrating but overall it was a good experience.
good,"During my tenure at BOA, I enjoyed it.  Unfortunately like most during 2009, I was downsized and was left with no help in finding employment after being at the company for a long time.  Over the years I realized no job is secure."
good,"Cold-calling prospective clients, answering questions surrounding sound investment prudence and planning. How to moderate risk. The importance of forming a plan to guide oneself and/or family through uncharted waters, etc. All plans can be revised as situation changes (Alloys)."
good,Bank of America is a decent place to work. The management could definitely use some training in terms of communicating better with their staff but job security is a plus.
good,"very  fast paced, you need to be a robot, not possible to do all of what they ask per day. come in at scheduled time but do not sign in earlier then scheduled time, do your work on training and morning huddle and prepare for your day, check appointments, training still try to complete, make calls, answer phone, be ready to do notaries as needed, make sales quotas and be in lobby to greet customers as they come in. It is a great company as far as daytime hours, the best of benefits it is just that banking has changed so much that it is too advanced for a lot of the customers that do not agree with change."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Bank of America because of the competitive environment that keep me busy. I strive to be one of the top performers and to help the clients to the best of my ability.  My typical day consisted of reviewing files, obtaining documentation, working with realtors, appraisers, county associates, title companies, and borrowers in order to close the loan for the client."
good,"No room for advancement. The clients that I help make it all worth it. Management is on our side and will do anything and everything to help us succeed. There is just no moving up in the company, however."
good,Many things need to be balanced and the employees must be highly motivated to succeed. Merrill Lynch builds a strong and friendly culture but bosses are not afraid to put their employees on the hot seat regarding production.
good,Management is cool and overall understanding. I will say that the layoffs are nerve wrecking. They are forcing me to write stuff so I am just doing this to move on
good,Great benefits/ little to no growth opportunity. The role relationship is not hard at all. Its fairly easy but competitive which makes sales exciting. Growth is the most major concern.
good,"Bank of America is a HUGE work environment. It is like working for the federal governamnet. Therefore it is meaningless to talk about how ""good"" or bad"" a place it is to work. It will largely depend on the team that you work for and especially the work ethic of your immediate manager. I was fortunate to have a good manager. But have seen both extremes in other groups. "
good,"Company was great years ago with a lot of benefits. "
good,This job provides a lot of hands on learning. The learning curve can be slightly challenging in the beginning; however it levels off after time. Great place to work for those just beginning a career path.
good,The bank really focuses on career Development (manager level).Great culture wonderful environment. Very much so a change company I would suggest working here if you were looking to be more diverse in knowledge and skillset!
good,"typischer Amerikaner"
good,Very little room for advancement/promotions.  Lower salary compared to other employers for same position.  Great work/life balance and flexible work arrangements available when needed.
good,"Nice people, and very good benefits.  The compensation is lacking compared to industry standards.  The benefits--PTO, medical, and flexibility is the draw."
good,"answering questions on banking"
good,"Good place to work ,central location in Dallas/Fort Worth. Good energy and good team. Large campus with several large work streams in multiple buildings"
good,"Great culture and good place to learn and contribute. The company offers good flexibility at work so as to maintain work life balance. Great exposure given in terms of learning new soft skills and job specific skills."
good,"Outstanding daily communication with daily clients and great opportunity to advise prospective clients in their banking needs."
good,Sorting mail and processing payments of various forms. Being able to read and follow instruction is key to this fast paced environment. The ability to work well with others is a plus as you work in close proximity to many other people with one goal.
good,A typical day of work is high pressured to achieve our sale goals. I learnt a tremendous amount from the training program there. Management culture is truly great.
good,"Bank of America is an amazing corporation to be apart of!  The benefits they offer their employees are amazing.  Their training platform is very extensive and prepares their employees for the job they are hired to do.  Management is hands on and supportive.  "
good,BOA is great with having fun and showing employees that they were grateful. The matrix system set up to try to maintain good performances is unforgiving and responsibilities are dumped off on employees without sufficient preparation.
good,I managed the small business department in San Antonio/Austin consisting of about 25 professionals and staff.  I learned project management through the formation of the department and I learned to relate to business owners.  Management was ok but a bit more concerned with image than internal work flow.  Hardest part was convincing management to be open to new ideas.  Most enjoyable part was developing staff and seeing them advance in their careers.
good,Typical day was greeting all clients coming in.  Your had to lead the line by uncovering product needs.  You were on conference calls talking about what strategies worked and meeting corporate's  expectations.  Benefits were amazing and hours were set everyday when everyone left the building with security.  I met lots of great Bank of America team members that had been with company through changes and stood strong behind the brand.
good,I enjoyed working here and would work there again. Management team were great and I enjoyed being part of the team. I learned alot from work at this company.
good,It was an ok place to work as a temporary assignment. I would go back and do it again next year for tax season. the only issue was the management could have been a little better.
good,I was afforded opportunities to take on new tasks to challenge me and increase my skillset. My voice was offered an opportunity to be heard by the ears that needed to hear it. There are many opportunities if you are willing to work to align yourself to be eligible.
good,Feel at home. Not preferred for freshers. For female associates it a very secured organization.pays a very good package for the experienced. Better choose the company having experieced.
good,"The pay was great, training was very helpful once you were released to work independently and the employees were very welcoming as well as helpful. I would love to have another opportunity to work there."
good,"If you're lured there by being converted to full time, don't be. They pay contractors well, but extensions and conversions are very rare. It is possible, however. So good luck! I still love and valued my time with BofA. Great people and very intelligent peers."
good,"Get to the office turn my systems on, as there are many. Walk over to get coffee and get back to my desk in time to start my day. That means I get to work very early."
good,BOA was a nice place to work until they laid off the entire site back in 2013. They are greedy like every other big company but I miss the people the most. They kept the job fun.
good,"Management and HR policies are orthodox. Slow career and monetary growth, No Bonus, Cab services. Quarterly Team Lunch/Dinner. Good Thing is nobody cares what you do through out the year"
good,The office I worked for closed. Overall BAC was a great place to work. The manager I had was dealing with a lot of personal issues which she let fall in to her professional life. She acted on emotion far to often and created a bow to me type atmosphere. However the rest of the staff was excellent. We always exceeded out goals and the pay and benefits were decent.
good,"This was my first post graduate level position.  Learned a lot through my experience here, growing professionally and personally.  Working across various departments and teams in order to successfully finish projects was a delightful experience to be apart of."
good,"Some challenges can exist with work/life balance. The culture in the workplace can be tricky at times, however; overall, a great place to learn, grow, and build a career."
good,This job was a great opportunity in a small town. It was my first job after high school and taught me professionalism and valuable costumer service and cash handling skills.
good,"BOA is a great company, with great opportunity for advancement. Skies is basically the limit. However it will be a challenge and you will be put to the test. Monthly goals are expected to be hit and that can be stressful. You are on the constant go."
good,"As an IT contractor with Bank of America, daily activities included PC refresh, upgrade, and deployment of devices (laptops, tablets PDAs) to local, and remote end-users. Most of the upgrades was from Windows XP to Windows 7 - paying particular attention to Outlook mail, and installation of software applications to end-users specific needs utilizing SCCM platform to achieve this function."
good,"At Fleet Bank and Bank of America, I learned and honed customer service skills and telephone communication skills which have served me well in subsequent jobs."
good,I had a great boss and staff to work with. We all helped each other reach our goals and strive to be the best we could be. If the management higher up in the company wouldn't have changed I would have stayed longer.
good,"everything you expect in a massive, lumbering organization. they provide you access to bank products at slightly more favorable terms. the wages make that immaterial."
good,Good job just wish it had been more long term with more shift options. Good ability to advance and move up withing the company.  Fantastic training and supervisors.
good,Due to low pay in comparison to equal positions at rival companies the retention rate is low. Great foot in the door to the business of finance. Management is easy to work with in my personal experience.
good,"The atmosphere at this place was great! Although it had a call center feel, the various activities that went on daily made it a very pleasant place to work"
good,"BankBoston (now Bank of America) offered great learning opportunities which I enjoyed. My experience began with being the beta site for testing and then rolling out new technology to business units. I then took over the reprographics requirements on a national level, which expanded into the printing industry in New England."
good,Worked as Quant Business Analyst in Capital Markets IT. Decent learning experience. Not much opportunity for advancement if you are contracting though. Limited Exposure to desk. High amount of bureaucracy often impacting production.
good,The relationship with clients is one of the most important parts of banking. Responsibilities come with a guideline to follow. Confidentiality is a must in baking
good,"I'd recommend this company for anyone interested in pursuing a position with great career opportunities both within the department one works for and others. "
good,"A typical day was hectic as a Banking Center Manager. We started our day with branch opening procedures followed by a daily huddle with the team. The day consisted of operations, sales, client servicing and coaching sessions with the team. Management was tough and unforgiving at times. the most enjoyable part was building relationships with customers."
good,"Large company so challenges are expected but communication is extremely lacking.  Teams work in a silo and not much understanding as to why certain things are done."
good,"Great Place to work with right department and leadership teams."
good,Bank of America has tremendous benefits for their employees. Really forward thinking in that area. I was given full pay for 12 weeks of paternity leave.
good,Working here can be a lot. There are a lot of rules to follow and management sucks. The assistant managers don't but from my experience they always bring managers in from places other than banks who don't know anything about banking.
good,"Corporate culture is friendly and promotes teamwork. People are generally nice and less cutthroat than other banks on the Street. However, compensation is below market, bureaucracy can become frustrating, and sometimes feels like management lacks direction."
good,"productive workplace learned a lot regarding phone service, the bank was very helpful in assisting me with certain personal issues...the lunch room facilities could use some work"
good,a lot of work sometimes no breaks and you basically are the manager and do everything even atm fixing not just teller so be prepared even if your pregnant
good,"This job was located in Plano Texas the work was very rewarding as well as satisfying. It was a temporary contract, however we were told it was temp to perm in the beginning. That was a disappointment to most of us"
good,"It was great "
good,I worked there for 5 years and I really enjoyed all of the connections and friends that I have met along the way.  I would go work there again.
good,The benefits that is offered within this company is great. Throughout the years they complete an assessment on how to improve the benefits they offer. They are leading the pack with their benefits.
good,"Great flexibility and intelligent colleagues, challenging work and heavily matrixed environment.  Ability to develop in role and expand to learn outside of day to day role and responsibilities.  To continue to grow in senior capacity, need to be on East coast."
good,"The environment in which I worked dealt very little with the public, I missed that to some extent. I worked on the midnight shift and received all my training on the job. When our 3rd shift manager was gone he was not replaced which left the staff virtually un-supervised for approximately 6 years. This led to an inability to accurately review individual accoaccomplishments."
good,"good job to start a career and grow from there, definitely not a job for the long run. Same routine everyday and same type of clients, not a very fun environment."
good,"Call center was fun to work in because of all the nice people I met there, Management was not very well trained though. A typical day consists of at least 100 calls a day in bound."
good,"Too many promises of advancements that were not kept, too much favoritism.  Managers that could make you feel ""small"" based on the way they talk down to you ."
good,"Bank of America was an excellent company that provided great benefits. I have able to learn about checking/saving account, mortgages and, most important, credit cards."
good,Typical day required many cold calls.  The training was designed to maximize sales efforts to deliver complex investment strategies.   I enjoyed discuss financial services that we offered. The manager was an portfolio manager and had a excellent financial model.
good,"If you were willing to play along with the corporate mumbo jumbo then this was for you.   I learned a lot from the upper management in regards to being concerned with layoffs and firing.  However, I was unable to find an avenue for advancing my career in a way that I saw suitable for me and my family."
good,"This is a new department and is in the process of continued growth.  You are required to obtain your lending authority prior to underwriting loans.  The testing process is challenging and does not adequately prepare you to underwrite outside of the testing environment.  However, I have become a much stronger underwriter as a result.  The management team is growing and will become a good team one day.  The hardest part of the job is learning the new guideline changes and the new system.  The most enjoyable part is definitely the campus."
good,"Typically, I would dread coming into work because Bank of America did not want to hire another teller to help with the workload. We had complaints from people in line because we take too long since there is only one of us working from time to time. I learned a lot from this company. I definitely am able to schedule appointments with people even if they don't seem that interested. I try to make them see the benefits in certain banking options. Management was okay but they did lack in scheduling the right amount of people in the office. My coworkers were like family. They made me feel welcomed when I first joined the team. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we would have pot lucks for lunch. We would have everyone come together and make something they love. It was a great experience."
good,"overall great company to work for. enjoyed time i spent with the bank, but merit and productivity is not what makes you valuable to the company. would consider wormimg in amother deoartmebt if the right opportunity came along."
good,"22 year career where I learned a lot and shared experiences with a very large family of co-workers, but got caught up in the cost-saving measures of corporate layoffs."
good,I love working at Bank of America as a Teller. The benefits are great. Even for part timers they have full benefits. However the sells goals are annoying. Depending on your location one may have more or less success.
good,"The Company would re-organize every 3-6 months, reevaluating what projects they would work on.  This meant that time, money, momentum and other resources that went into the project the last time the decision was made from the last re-org occurred were wasted.  Lots of meetings with upper management to get your opinion and listen to your ideas, but each meeting seemed like it was starting fresh, and that they hadn't listened to anything listed the last meeting."
good,"Working with customers who have been escalated to the office of the president & ceo regarding their mortgage accounts"
good,Good work life balance. Pay was a little on the lower side. Good people overall. Department did not have a sold vision for the future. Communication could of been better.
good,Bank of America served as a great transitional place of employment. I definitely could see potential in remaining employed and advancing in my career.
good,Management was reliable and open to suggestions. It was a very inclusive workplace that valued diversity.  Co-workers and management had a good relationship.
good,"Over the 32 years I was employed there I had many different roles, both in and out of management.  I enjoyed the changing world though each reorganization meant a different focus.  Unfortunately, the last reorg determined that working virtually was not an option (though I had done so for 10 years)."
good,"A typical day at Bank of America would start with security opening and closing procedures. We would then process the night drop deposits and handle the teller buying and selling of monies to and from the vault. We continuously provide customer service thoughout t the day and at the end of business perform closing procedures. This job taught me alot about finance, human nature,  and cultures,  and most of all customer service and interaction ."
good,"This is a great start for young kids, college kids or someone content w/ no advancement . The job itself is very easy outside of dealing w irate callers at times but overall not bad. Call center environment so be prepared to be confined to your work space and to work one weekend day . Managers are ok but again don't expect to move up quickly."
good,"Great company to get your feet wet. being an athlete and working in a high stress environment,  it keeps you grounded. Like I said great place to start, not a good place to stay."
good,"working at Bank of America can be fun as the processes are streamlined and module oriented. A typical project development cycle is followed and a proper release management is set up."
good,My ideal work place would be in an environment where the co workers are like family. A place where there is room for growth and the employees and employer respect one another. I enjoy working at a company where we can have fun sometimes and there are rewards and incentives for a job well done. I enjoy managers who spends time with each employee from time to time to discuss their strengths and weaknesses.
good,Overall the Bank is a pretty decent place to work. Compensation is rather low compared to peers such as Wells Fargo but retirement benefits and medical benefits are good.
good,"I was a sales associate and I was made aware of their focus on sales the first day I started working in this company.  They have a strong drive to sale anything in their branches.  There is always a sales meeting to go to or a sales conference call to tune in to.  I used to get on a conference call every day after the end of the day to report my sales to my manager's manager. I have been in banking for several years and I understand that sales is a very important part of the bank, but in this company, it feels like that is the only thing you have to do."
good,"Must be self-motivated, outgoing, and willing to sale products and offer services to clients in a way that encourages them to WANT to pursue with the offer."
good,"Bank of America uses MetricStream's Audit Planning,Issue Management and other products in order to make their work to be mitigated from risk. "
good,I grew up at Bank of America. I'm living proof that you can work your way up at the bank. I was fortunate to have very good managers and mentors that drove me to keep searching for ways to improve the efficiency of day to day operations. There is not much work life balance within my department but the work is very self fulfilling. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my peers and direct reports on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job is the red tape involved in getting simple decisions approved.
good,I lived in texas when I started there and moved to Michigan about 2 years later.. I was able to interview for the branches since there was no corporate positions available
good,The bank has amazing benefits and really cares about the health and well-being of its employees. The bank has an epidemic when it comes to retaining quality talent as they so often believe it is easier to get someone younger and cheaper than worry about longevity.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job involved interacting with customers. I also enjoyed teaching others and cultivating a team environment. A typical day of work included many duties. Some include, opening/closing of banking center, coaching staff and performance reviews, greeting customers as well as helping resolve issues or concerns in a timely manner, opening/closing of consumer and business accounts.  I learned how to be diverse in dealing with the consumer as well as a growing staff and constant changes to company policies. In my opinion, the hardest part of the job was getting used to so many management changes and styles. The company as a whole did things quite differently from store to store."
good,This use to be the BEST place to work and over the course of my tenure it became the worst place to work-YES the pay was GOOD however I was in management and no work life balance before the close of the sites. The company NO LONGER cared about their people-
good,"Pay was good, management was sub-par, was being managed by someone that didn't have experience on my team.  On the job training was the main way to train, very poor training"
good,"Management was all over the place, could never get a straight answer on anything.  Good pay though, if not working in a sales role, the jobs are not very stressful"
good,The benefits were good and the vacation and sick time was a plus. Pay not so much. Management as always can be better. Kind of fun environment.
good,Merrill doesn't care about employees whatsoever. You are simple a number and do not matter unless you are a top producer from your first day.
good,"My time at Bank of america was fine i learned a alot about numbers."
good,beautiful work environment thriving market loads of potential from a growth stand point.. it was a great experience sales environment loads of potential to advance
good,At least until they sold us another company. They made a terrible decision without thinking about how it would be for the employees and their families. Now we are all suffering.
good,If you enjoy the call center environment then you'll like this place. the structure of their business isn't the greatest. Leadership is more of the problem than the solution.
good,"The Mortgage Department doesn't have leaders who can make decisions.  They are in a content state of change.  With the downsizing you are contently having you relocate desk, "
good,"Bank of America is a good company to work for"
good,"Bank of America is a good company to work for"
good,"A typical day at Bank of America is very fast paced, with a lot of attention to detail. I have learned to love working as a team , we are a family and together we try our best to make our stressful days go by fast."
good,The company is a great company to work for.  The benefits are hard to match anywhere else.  There is a great diversity within the company and there is lots of communities you can become involved in.
good,The company allows you to grow and challenge yourself. The job allows you lean all the consumer products not just single line of business.
good,"have learned a lot by my peers and group of different managers, although it could be a challenge when not performing to your expected goals."
good,Good place to work. I enjoyed working with good people.They have good healthcare coverage. They have too many levels of managers.
good,"call  volume between 30-40 calls daily, assisting anywhere from login issues for website to account balances and fees."
good,I enjoyed working on the project and team I was on.  Very smart and dedicated people.  I like the work I was doing as the a PM and was treated very nicely.
good,"Bank of America can provide a multitude of growth and development, most which requires independent initiation.  Excellent source for networking and Career Pathing.  While compensation does not stay competitive with the industry there is a fair amount of work-life balance, team synergy and (depending on your department or line of work) opportunity for advancement."
good,Manage a team to exceed our customers expectations by delivering to them the benefits and values of our products and services while managing risk.
good,"Promotes within, many different LOB's you can learn from.  Not much formal training even for the entry level positions that do need it."
good,"Bank of America forces you to pay attention to detail, so that you may follow all goals and guidelines according to the bank and government's policies. Here you will be challenged to meet quotas and sales goals that are placed upon your financial center team.  It is a very goal oriented and competitive environment with a lot of checks and balances. There is a lot of customers that you will be able to interact with and the job wills you to get to know the people you serve."
good,"Goals for sales are ever growing and before the mortgage crisis, there was no cap on mortgages! The more you sold, the better.....this is why things happened the way they did."

La dirección tenía una excelente relación con los empleados, y estos últimos son mayoritariamente gente jóven. Lo más difícil es lidiar con algunos clientes que por ignorancia, pretende que sucedan cosas con su dinero que son prácticamente utópicas. Lo que más me gustó fue el ambiente laboral, los contactos que generé, y la cantidad de amantes del fútbol que allí había"

As an organization we have dedicated ourselves to becoming a financial center of influence for clients and delivering some degree of financial progression. each day hundreds of patrons come through our doors looking for some manner of financial assistance and that's exactly what we do for them. Working in a community like this has taught me countless things about the world of finance but even more about customer service. The indispensable skill of being able to not just interact but actually relate to people from all walks of life."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with but did not like the office culture. Not very engaging and stuck in cubicle all day. I felt like my managers left me out for the wolves and the training program was inefficient.

good,"When I was first hired at Bank of America the key thing that made me love the job was the fact that it was so easy to move up and establish a career that I could enjoy. Management was good, the sales goals were fine, the clientele was savvy, and I enjoyed my work. It showed in my dedication and performance. But then BoA decided to change their policies which, I would later find out, was a regular occurrence. I'm not talking about small things here or there, I mean that one day in our daily huddle the manager gets off a call with his boss and tells us that the company as a whole are no longer hiring tellers. They intended to move to a more credit union style of financial institution and slowly phase tellers out. This ended up backfiring against the entire company because the situation snowballed into having a dangerously understaffed workplace. The staffing issue was fixed, but we never managed to repair team and clientele morale. Since then I've decided to make a career for myself elsewhere."

The hardest part of the job is standing in the same place for hours on end doing the same things over and over.

Alot of times the transaction were on line merchant who billed under another name. When it came to finding out information to assist the cardholder co workers made it easy to ask a question and quickly wanted to assist the customer themselves. Management was always good on keeping us abreast on the new changes with the company and coaching as needed. Most enjoyable part of the job was looking into the transaction and be able to give a sound and confident answer to all questions.

However, now that I've been with the team for over 3 years I'd like a more challenging role with more responsibities.  I am stuck with bank metrics of being over qualifed because I have a master's degree, but under qualified because I have only been in my role for 3 years."
good,"Interesting job being part of Single Point of Contact position as part of  Bank of America home retention assistance. Each day was different due to constant regulatory changes. There were no major problems with management or co-workers. Overall, management did a good job  keeping employees informed of changes. The main motto was: Do The Right Thing for homeowner. It was great when able to deliver the news that terms of mortgage had be modified. However, no one enjoyed telling homeowner that they did not qualify for loan modification based on information they provided versus investor guideline. The main thing learned was making sure homeowner had all information necessary needed to decide the best course of action financially for family short-term and long-term."
good,"The day starts with our morning meeting. Things such as operational updates, company news, sales goals, marketing updates and risk topics are discussed. When the doors open the BCM is ready in the lobby to greet the first clients. The goal is always customer satisfaction and being readily available to assist with problems and escalations. As a BCM it is imperative to understand daily and monthly sales goals and getting the personal bankers excited about meeting those numbers. It requires the entire team to uncover opportunities as well as our offsite partners. The challenging part about this position is juggling multiple responsibilities as well as meeting deadlines. Although it is hard, it is exciting as well. Time management and the ability to multitask are key. In addition, to sales the BCM is also responsibility for risk and operations management. Adhereing to policies and federal guidelines and executing operational excellence is very important."

If the pay was better I would have continued to work there. It's not a bad company to work for overall. They will require hard work, and have a great deal of micro managing from mostly all levels of management.

good,"Everyday at Bright Horizons was different. Although I was the head teacher of the ""School Age"" classroom, I had a new group of children almost daily. It was busiest around the holiday and summer months when I had a full class (10 students) which was a great experience because I would create a lesson plan for the week incorporating one theme. I also had the pleasure of visiting in and assisting both the toddler classroom and pre-school classroom. I was so grateful that I was able to collaborate with such talented and dedicated teachers. The most challenging part of the position was that I did not have the same group of children everyday so I had to make sure I was accommodating to the type of leaners I was getting on a given day. The most rewarding and enjoyable part of the job was meeting so many children from ages 1 month to 12 years old. From the physical and mental development at each age to the new things learned at each age, it was pure joy to be a part of a school small enough that it almost felt like family."

good,Looking for better Compensation/Benefits. But Bank Of America is good.
good,"Great co-workers and management at our site. Upper management decided to shut down our entire site, 130 people out of work."
good,"The people working at the company are friendly, and the work/life balance is good. Management is okay and accommodating if you need something however, don't expect very good compensation. Sometimes even a promotion comes with a very little bump in compensation."
good,"Its one of best company in terms of Work environment, Job Satisfaction. The only thing which missing is Employes benefits in monitory terms."
good,I was responsible for calling clients and helping them resolve inbound transfers they had submitted. Resolving was any thing from signatures to getting accounts opened.
good,The role of Client Associate does not allow for any flexibility in hours or in working remotely. There are little opportunities for career advancement for that role.
good,"In my last position there/Helpline I answered incoming calls from 27 states' branches from their internal employees regarding questions on policies and procedures to assist their customers."
good,long-term relationships with current and potential customers in the community. Enjoyed working in Downtown Detroit.
good,"A typical day at work included the overall running of the branch. Making sure all tellers were in early and had their stations ready to receive customers very early. Then the rest of the staff comes in before the doors are open to the public.  Submit reports to management regarding sales transacted, compliance to bank regulations,etc. Make sure that all staff reach their sales goals."
good,A typical day is usually not too stressful.  You can learn a lot if the opportunity is presented.  Co-workers are very nice and there nothing to hard about the job. I really like the flexibility the job offers.
good,I did not work for Bank of America (Then Nations Bank) they made the loan to build the big Projects that we were to build in Both Countries.
good,A typical work day is constant deposit for commercial customers as well as make referrals to private banker for new accounts to possibly be opened. Met week goals and monthly goals.

good,"Professional environment with new information provided everyday, daily meetings and training. Performance was based on team/Individual productivity."
good,I have learnt a great deal about financial markets and controlling.
good,Job security is scares. Management is everyone for themselves.
good,"A typical day at work would be receiving inbound and making outbound calls and following up with customers on a 7-10 day business. Building a relationship with customers with mortgages that are in default. Review financial documents and assist homeowners with a modification, short sale or deed in lieu. The work environment was great. The co-workers and managers were wonderful to work with. I really enjoyed working for this company."
good,"Inspection Report Analysis for defects using CPSC and AS400 systems"
good,"great co-workers and manager. "
good,"Was a great place to work up to the point that they decided to switch the entire building/work force to a customer service call center. come to find out that happens every 18 months to 2 years. You sign on for a job, you work it for awhile then they come and tell you that your position is changing totally and you can take it or leave it."
good,"Bank of America has a very outstanding training  program before putting you out there to work with the customers.  The working environment was great.  Also, the benefits were great, wasn't there long enough to comment on the opportunities of promotions.  The work was busy, we had mortgage loans coming in everday when I first started working in the pipeline, which made the day go by faster."
good,Good Company to Work For.  Good Benefits. Supportive Team environment.
good,"Bank of America is a pretty good company to work for.  They do truly make you feel as though they care about you as an employee. I have had the pleasure to meet some very nice people at this company.  This is the first company I have worked for where people actually remember you and speak to you after training is over.  Although I like the company, I do not enjoy the position I was hired in to.  The training I received focused so much on sales that it left myself and others from my training class without some needed knowledge on the basics of the job.  The sales goals in this position are extremely high so it can be quite stressful.  I am sure I would enjoy staying with this company if I had a different position."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked, they made it easy to come in and deal with the bureaucracy of work places that I have come to expect. I learned a handful of valid skills as well as information in the foreclosure market."
good,I learned alot while in managment. The area managers work closely with you to develop you for success.
good,"A very fast paced environment.  Had to multi task and have ability to troubleshoot quickly.  Very stressful and demanding position."
good,for a banks its a good place but pending the manager one may have it help or hurt ones career.
good,"My typical day at work involes signing on to a computer, getting my money out of Vault. Once I am setup I am able to help customers with their banking needs. I help with Deposits, withdrwals, Balances and answering questions about their banking needs. Also being able to work well with Manager and co-workers is very important. The hardest part of job is sometimes not being able to help a customer with all of their banking needs. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing happy customers."
good,I loved going to work here. The people I worked with were atrocious but the work was FASCINATING. I had customers that would sit and wait just to come to my line! I loved my work when I was at BOA and I would still be working there if I had not started school and had my son!
good,"Overall I was satisfied with Bank of America, during my time there. I just wish that there would have been more room for advancement."
good,The job was exciting I learned a lot from working in the mortgage.
good,great pay and good enviorment but sometimes unresponsive supervisors and permanent employee ONLY type of events kind of makes you feel alienated
good,The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the day to day changes of the mortgage industry.
good,Great place to work. You can truly learn something new every day. Amazing people to work with. Very fast paced call center.
good,"Researched equity and fixed income instruments, and provided marketing services including organization of files, calling prospects, appointment scheduling and other administrative tasks."
good,"Long hours"
good,The workday involved dealing with constant change. Every call was a unique experience and required attention to the details. The banking industry is in a constant change as regulations change or are updated. One of the key skills is utilizing resources to provide up to date information or solutions to help customers through difficult situations and get the most from the bank.
good,I learned how to manage accounts and always enjoyed being around my co-workers. The hardest par of my job will be leaving all of my friends and co-workers because they are my extended family.

good,"Default litigation portfolio up to 150 cases, highly stressful and report driven environment."
good,"Typical day, you can have up a full lobby of clients waiting to be attended. They are very sales driven expecting a sale from every customer. I personally enjoyed the fast pace environment. Makes the day go by much faster."
good,"The branch I work in is great."
good,Managed the loss mitigation department for the consumer loan division. See resume for additional details.
good,"Awesome except for mangament, yeah you have to deal with rude customers and lazy employees but you""ll have to deal with that where ever you go."
good,"You could learn a lot from the company and they are heading towards the right direction. Management depends on who you work for, sometimes it gets stressful when leaders are not on the same page and lack of communication. The hardest part is transferring to a different department. The best part is the benefits"
good,"The building is fairly new, and energy efficient. Definitely one of the best buildings to ever work at in NYC."
good,They offer many great benefits to help in life situations and compensation is also one of the highest ever received.
good,"In my most recent position within Bank of America, my primary role was to act as a liaison between our high-end clients and our Business Technology partners.  I supported the initial research and troubleshooting on complex technical issues reported by our clients and presented my data and analysis to our project managers and technology teams for resolution.  Once steps to resolution were determined, I worked closely with the client from beginning to end until resolution was met and the client was completely satisfied."
good,"Bank of America is a good company that has provided me the opportunity to further my education while providing for my family. On a typical work day it is required to sit for 3-4 hours at a time while taking inbound customer service calls."
good,"Working for two Head Executives in International Banking in NYC is not for the weak.  This job was face paced and the expectation was that you would work overtime anytime needed.  The schedule hours were 9-5, but it wasexpected that you would be there from 7am to 7pm to get the job done and to keep the excellent salary and earn the annual bonuses.  Not  a great fit if you have small children."
good,"Enjoyed everything about the work place, but moved from that town."
good,"I review lot of data everyday and deduce meaningful information from it.I am doing analysis at Business, Performance and Strategy level over here.I learned lot about banking domain and also have been managing L1 and L2 teams spread across various locations.Having a really good time working with my colleagues apart from enjoying my work. The hardest part of the job is to predict the customer behavior. And the most enjoyable part of the job is working with lot of data everyday and interacting with the client."
good,TEMP POSITION THROUGH A TEMP AGENCY. I wish there was a position available when the project ended.
good,"I was a temp at Bank of America. It was a great experience, however I was just a temp. I would work for Bank of America again given the chance."
good,"In a typical day I would review 150+ loans:"
good,I spent the day helping people set up online banking and walking them through setting up their accounts. I learned how to work a computer. I never saw management. 
good,"Responds to customer questions concerning products, resolves a variety of customer service issues, and processes sales transactions."
good,"I enjoyed working for Bank of America. In my twenty plus years, bank management was good to me. I had a good job and good co-workers.  When I retired in 2011, I needed a change in careers. I have completed that change and I am now ready to step back into the corporate environment. A typical day for me as a Sales Analyst was never typical. I was the first point of contact for Business Banking clients. This meant to handle any implementation issues or engage in a sales request. The hardest part of my job as a an Analyst was learning the different personalities of my Client Managers but it did not take me very long. They were just very different from each other. My co-workers were great and we all worked as a team. I had a great rapport with my clients and I would say that was my most enjoyable part of the job. Management overall was great and I had several mentors that were upper management. I really enjoy working in the banking industry and would like to do so again in the very near future."
good,"I have worked for this company for several years. Started part time teller while I was in college. Company gave me the opportunity to advance and learn and promoted to New Accounts, Loan Officer and Preferred Banker, where I managed loan portfolios, handling all Real Estae and consumer loans."
good,"A typical day at work involves a lot of SQL development, running routine reports and producing documentation. I've learned a lot about business analysis at the bank. "
good,Very detailed. Never a dull moment. Huge company. Always busy
good,"I am part of a great team, everyone supports one another and our Business Partners that we support are great to work with."
good,"Started as a mailroom clerk. Advanced to a position of a research analyst reviewing production statistical data and submit recommendation for procedural improvements. Attended several management seminars and became Operations Manager of the Procurement Svcs., department. Have worked with very good and hardworking staff. The hardest part was to learn that after nearly twenty years of service, the BoA sold your department to another company because your department didn't generate revenue."
good,The company provided valuable lessons on confronting rejections and how to convert service to sales.
good,BofA was good while it lasted. The job can be stressful at times.
good,"Adjust fees on promotion offered. Notate the online collection system, and set promise to pay date."
good,"-Open new accounts to prospect customers in the bilingual-Spanish sector."
good,Great Group to work with.  Management and Associates were like a team.
good,"The managers are good but most of the time, promotion and pay decisions go above your direct managers resulting in employees not being as happy an/or not feeling properly rewarded. In such a large company, a lot of politics is involved and it takes a long time to get anything done/approved as it goes through the process."
good,The selling of banking services in a down economy is not any fun the goals keep getting higher and the stress is always on.
good,"The company provides 3 months paid paternity and maternity leave, child care assistance, tuition assistance."
good,"Bank of America is a good company, but with the economy the way it has been, things change frequently for banks in general, which causes varying stages of mass layoffs and hiring.  The work that I do is satisfying, but there is always a feeling of anxiety that they will lay off our entire team regardless of performance.   There seems to be no method to restructuring with respect to layoffs. For example, they decided they didn't want a specific location anymore and laid off everyone that worked in that building - these folks worked for many different teams, including some from mine, and some of them were top performers.  You'd think the goal of restructuring would leave you with a more qualified staff as you trim the under-performers, but with this seemingly random selection, they are not only letting strong performers go, but the the strong performers that are left start looking elsewhere because they don't want to be caught on the wrong end of one of these mass layoffs."
good,This IS MBNA and the comments made regarding this company are as previously noted.
good,"Company has been through multiple mergers and has finally got back to core fundamentals...lending."
good,"I have always enjoyed my job. I took my job seriously and I treated everyday as a new challenge. I started as a clerk and over the years was promoted as an operation team lead in the management team. I learned to focus on customer work, ensuring excellent quality of work is being delivered by myself and as well as my team. I set high expectations for my team and increased productivity gradually monthly. Met customer expectations by providing work with efficiency and accuracy. My team members worked well with each other. "
good,I enjoyed working for Bank of America. They had great oportunities for advancement.
good,"Working for BACFSC was a really fantastic learning experience. I learned how to have business etiquette very quickly. BACFSC showed me how to do many things in the mortgage industry which has improved my overall stature in the business world as I am now considered a professional in property preservation. The only negative thing I have to say would be the management. I did not have a single manager that could answer my questions and train me properly. Most everything I learned was through trial and error. With that said, it taught me how to have better analytical and research skills."
good,"The hardest part of this job was feeling like there was nothing being accomplished. The process was not a very productive one. I enjoyed the people I worked with. We all got along and everyone was very nice. There was poor management, they micromanaged everything we did so it was hard to have the desire to go beyond the minimum with big brother constantly watching. Overall I would not change my Bank of America experience for anything since it taught me much about life and how to work in a professional environment."
good,I enjoy a fast paced job and my current position is exactly that. I like the fact that I am consistently busy. There is always something to do. I enjoy showing associates and managers become more proficient working with Bank of America Home Loan Servicing.
good,"Company has very helpful and friendly staff, job security is questionable. however overall the company is not bad."
good,I enjoyed my time with Bank of America and made many good friends. The environment has changed with the new federal guidelines and makes it difficult to enrich the clients understanding and availability of products. The change of hours from an eight hour day of 6:30 am to 3:00 pm was changed to a ten hour day of 9:00am to 8:00 pm and made it extremely difficult to spend time with my wife and family. The pay was average and I had reached the top of my payscale and had nowhere higher to achieve.
good,"Provide basic service and information to customer, help with overflow if needed, establish retain and deepen relationships with customer and potential customers"
good,"Employees were encouraged to learn and utilize new skills. However, there were so many meetings to made it difficult to get work done in a timely matter."
good,"A typical day at work involves me directly working with customers to build relationships, undercover and satisfy their needs through the sale of financial products and services; Spending a majority of your time on the sales floor leading from the lobby, by greeting customers, directing them to the appropriate areas of the branch and ensuring that the customer's needs are met; Ensuring the audit/compliance procedures of the center are followed, while maintaining the highest level of customer service; Establishing the staffing schedule for the branch and assisting with teller recruiting and performance management activities; Supervising and coaching teams on the proper behaviors, sales techniques, service expectations and compliance guidelines, while modeling the same; Ensuring completion of regulatory compliance and training specific to sales and service responsibilities for branch associates; Managing difficult situations with customers and providing clients with information, data and advice."
good,This place is fun to work with evolving organizational standards and technical strategy
good,"• Handling Build and Release for Many Java , dot net based applications within the aggregate schedule."
good,Gave me a chance to use my excellent communication skill. The ability to work well with outside vendors
good,Hopping back and foward between the teller line and the platform side keeps you busy throughout the day. Gives you the opportunity to be a well rounded worker and learn more. Co-workers look up to you and go to you for advice often. Management depends on you to work deligently and confidently on both sides.
good,Good work life balance.Bad work culture. Overall satisfactory.
good,It was a nice company to work for pertaining to benefits and compensation. The health benefits were outstanding. Management in the fort worth call center was not the best but overall the company as a whole was a great company to work for.
good,not mircomanaged-great co workers and supvsr-hardest part of job is getting departments to work together
good,"The usual work day consist of reviewing Mortgage files and analyzing them for any error or over charge to the customer. I work closely with my team members for extra advise on any problems that might be a risk on the file. I also work hard to ensure that the fees access to the customer is reasonable, the hardest part of my job is when we have fees that don't make sense or the loan is not correctly prepared before I receive it. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that we as a team are able to adjust the problem and keep the cumstomer in their homes without proceeding with the foreclosure process."
good,"The schedule was flexible, I had the choice of working one of two shifts. Benefits are available for part time employees. I went through a few weeks of training to learn the products. Management was available to assist with any questions. There a quotas to maintain and I was evaluated monthly, which could be challenging at times."
good,"We would start each day with a morning meeting about our productivity, and where we stood on our quota. We would motivate each other by encouraging each other and helping each other out. We had small competitions and we always had each others back with difficult situations."
good,great working environment only downfall is that your schedule is subject to change at the drop of a hat.
good,Company has good benefits and format. In my area advancement has not been promoted. I've been give a trippling workload with no promotion and no advancement oppertunities. This is all for my area; however they are putting the companies growth before it's employees development/growth.
good,Being my first job I gained a lot of experiences and met some fantastic people. If I would have gotten the opportunity to stay longer I may have advanced and enjoy my work sadly the company was bought out and the new company decided to disband the California offices.
good,"Most of my work is done by email, fax and phone. I research several bank systems to gather and organize documents for case analysis. I interview witnesses and report my investigative results to my supervising attorney. We discuss the details of each case to determine if we have a strong or weak defense. I prepare Settlement agreements and work directly with outside counsel for finalize discovery responses and settlement documents."
good,"offers benefits for part time employees, paid holidays and good hours of operation."
good,"This is a great place to work in that the benefits are great, I enjoy working here."
good,". daily interaction with customers, other departments"
good,"Good experience and learning process due to the different clients to be help during the day. Every day was different one. Customer Service, and Selling Bankingto the other."
good,My position was doing a variety of duties. I most enjoyed dealing with our clients and hosting client events.
good,"A typical day was getting to my desk and managing my portfolio of over 600 customers to help figure a way to stay in their houses. I learned much about the real estate business and foreclosure, as I often had to think of creative solutions to help solve customers difficult situations. Management was overall mostly new, but generally sufficient and, in my observation, do their best to help their employees. My co-workers were mostly great, and the teams are very interactive and help each other in many ways. The hardest part of the job was the fact that my position was a new one that was created from necessity, thus it was not as organized as I believe it should have been. I had over 600 accounts that I was responsible to call every 5 to 7 business days-hardly an efficient way to work. I do not believe this was necessarily the fault of the company; everyone was just put in a very difficult situation due to the vast numbers of people struggling with their mortgages in a tough economy. The most enoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers all over the United States and the excellent benefits offered by the company."
good,"I am a Corporate Recruiter at Bank of America where I have learned tremendously over the years. Not only do I recruit, I am also a coach, mentor, trainer and project manager. I've worked on several projects and completed successfully."
good,"Every day we scheduled audits of a team of 34 in a high volume, to best meet the volume and cotinue to be submitted and completed with excellence and continued support to our team members that were attempting to secure loans for their clients. A great deal of reporting, dissolution of problems, character balancing, alot of different personalities, ever learning new rules and regulations, tons of training of associates to best do their duties. Assisted in bringing the department up from the grass roots, to a highly efficient and well running machine."
good,Good work life balance. Motivating and challenging and dynamic work environment.
good,Enjoyed the co-workers but company culture was promotions were based on friendships other than performance. I brought the company more profit than any other associate yet was looked over for promotions due to not wanting to hang out outside of work as I prefer to spend time with my family instead.
good,"Great company to work for if you plan on staying in financial services. From a fulfillment standpoint, excellent job security in the right industry (mortgage) etc. Good management overall, very high work load but compensation is good."
good,Not a bad place to work. There is a lot of training and coaching involved to ensure that you are doing your best.
good,data entry keyer. keyed checks and micr line. this company change my shift start time too much. some managment was not so good to work with. very easy job. wonderful co-workers.
good,"In production you may hold many titles and duties in a day. I managed many projects by demonstrating office skill such as scheduling, organizing and tracking processing, answering phone, filing, mail opener and sorter, restocking supplies and extracting incoming remittances, data entry, ten (10) key, account receivable and payable, shipping and receiving, remittance/lockbox experience, computer and office machines experience but most of all being a team player. Working as a team to complete and meet daily production had it moments of fun and disappointments. Making sure all items processed in timely manner and before deadline can be hard for everyday there something different but completing a day demands brings joy."
good,Good experience in growing a business significantly over a 5 year period.
good,"I enjoy my experience here immensely, unfortunately, it is a temporary position."
good,I loved working here. It was a temp job was the only downfall.
good,great opportunities. good work environment and good people.
good,Each day varied depending on work load. I've amassed a greater knowledge base as it relate to the mortgage industry. Managing is an acquired skill that remains open for ongoing improvement as it relates to the management staff. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and it was always nice learning from each other. Hardest part of the job.....well there were normal challenges like any other workforce but nothing that could not be conquered. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things.
good,"It a very nice enviroment to work, everything you need to adequately perform your job is provided.good people"
good,"I generally open new accounts, work a teller window, resolve customer service issues. I am a notary public for the State of Michigan. I have had supervisor override authority since 2002 for high risk transactions."
good,The was a sound company. The company was not a good for me at the time.
good,A typical day could get rather busy and keep you running to the point that you may not even get a lunch break. You learned to smile through it all and keep it moving. I have worked with some that were great team players and some that were not. I learned to pull the weight so the overall job and tasks were done regardless of whose responsibility it may have been. At times those efforts seem to go without recognition. Not knowing what each day would bring giving that loine of work could be unnerving at times. For the most part it was a great work experience and the majority of co-workers were great.
good,"A typcal day at work would include cashing checks, making payments, depositing cash or checks into customer accounts and making withdrawls for customers. In addition we would refer customers to platform associates for additional bank products. I have learned how to work in a fast paced enviroment and how to professionaly deal with different customers. I have learned how to work closely with co-workers and giving and intaking 360 degree coaching. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet all day and not having a chair to sit on. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know some of the customers better and getting payouts at times if the company made it's goals was an extra bonus."
good,"Determined and high pressure working environment, ability to advance into management positions"
good,A typical day is receiving 20 calls from my homeowners requesting information about their home loan assistance request.. I advise them if documents are being requested and what documents are needed. If all documents are received I would stack the file and route to underwriting.. If a file has been placed in foreclosure I would contact the homeowner ingoing them of this information and the foreclosure attorney information.
good,Good place to work and enjoyed learning in the daily activities
good,"Working with people is always stressful, especially when dealing with their money. The traffic was very busy and we lacked the proper number of employees for the work load. With this being said, scheduling was done appropriate and on time. Benefits were fantastic along with the pay, though the ideology behind the sell, sell, sell was very demoralizing."
good,"Working at this company was a typical 8 hr daily workshift that included servicing customers and mitigating loss. I learned skills such as time management, having a good work ethic and how to become a team player. Management was extremely helpful when seeking advice and guidance. Coworker we friendly, sociable and helpful. The hardest part of the job was learning how to adjust everytime the company changed job focus, we would have to change our schedules without sufficient notice and have to do training in order to take on the new position. The most enjoyable part of the job was the incentives and rewards."
good,The day usually starts with the updates of the process and barges in towards chatting with the credit card clients on a three concurrency.
good,"The work life balance was a focus from the company but not always widley shared with all employees. Although vactions and sick time were always a priority to the company. The work environment is high pressure and the training time is not always truley given to you as needed. Although my experience with Bank of America was short lived if you are purley looking for benefits and vacation pay, Bank of America is for you!"
good,fast pace with heavy volume of calls per 5 hrs a day night and day talk to exisiting customer's to make balance transfer from one card to the next card also maintaine professoisnal state of the art product in banking need of our customer's
good,"You have to be at your desk at 7:45AM and work to 6:30PM, sometimes longer. The day typically consists of answering calls from FA's in the field and providing them with any troubleshooting inquiries or selling them Alternative Investments. You need to understand the different products we offer and how to implement them into client portfolios. Everyone who works on the desk is great and gets along well. You must be able to work quickly and accurately under stressful conditions."
good,"attention to detail, customer service, standing the majority of the day."
good,"Great peers with good direct management. QA is insane with another QA over that QA. Plus, management must QA you as well as Legal. So, you must have QA 1 out of 7 calls."
good,"Work area cohesive to production, co workers on edge a lot due to uncertianity of job security. Advancement is great and training from the company is continous and put together well. Management new so unsure of structure."
good,"the most enjoyable part of bank of america was the customer interaction, i loved spending my day talking with customers and helping them to get the most for their money"
good,Bank of America offered a great balance of challenging work assignments and advancement. It was a fast paced environment and associates were rewarded based on a meritocracy.
good,There are so many areas of the financial industry to engage in for a career path. Bank of America offers a wide range of opportunity.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Bank of America was the interaction with my peers/clients. Having worked in Marketing and the consumer bank our departments were responsible for having rallies, tracking and reporting employee campaigns. Implementing days of caring events in the community, implementing fund raising events for the associates of Bank of America benefitting the March of Dimes and Heart of Florida United Way organizations. I worked for Executive Vice Presidents, Presidents, and Vice Presidents of Bank of America and learned to adapt to different management styles. Each day was different when I worked on the consumer side. I took many customer service calls from disgruntled customers and helped to turn them into happy customers. I also was responsible for ordering supplies for the departments and paying invoices, prepared reinbursement requests for supervisors and employees of department, and monitoring when associates were due for performance reviews. The hardest part of the job was when Bank of America changed its position on sponsorships and contributions and the dynamics of the department."
good,Bank of America is a great company to work for and there is a great chance to advance and grow within the company.
good,Worked for MBNA just before BOA purchased it- which MBNA had been able to stay on its own because they were a better employer
good,The salary and benefits are great. Management about the same as every where else.
good,"Great place to work, worderful experience. Takes fortitude and tough skin to excel."
good,Job Security -I was with the company for over 25 years was a good worker always felt job security was there until I was layed off. I guess you get in the wrong job and the right time and your gone.
good,"Enjoyable and responsible job that could be done from the comfort of my home office. A challenging job where I believe I was able to make a difference in the quality of a small portion of the mortgage loan portfolio and the appraiser panel by using creative, problem solving techniques while still functioning in a competetive lending environment. For me the hardest part of the job was trying to reconcile the numerous rules, regulations and adherance to standards issued by Congress and outside agencies, (that I was required to follow personally by law); with the differing and somewhat contradictory directions and motivations of other associates."
good,Worked there for a long period of time. Was ablel to advance to a higher position. Worked with a few different managers. Helped to facilitate business for 18-40 branches/ managers at a time.
good,Great company with no job security. Alot of office politics not enough team playing.
good,Learned many different roles in my 12 years with the bank. A typical day at work consists of reviewed mortgage files and preparing closing documents. Once that is done we work closely with title companies to coordinate the closing of mortgage loan for our customers.
good,"My five years at B of A was characterized by strong leadership and a supportive environment, even while the organization at large was focused on integrating the many bank acquisitions it had undertaken."
good,"Bank of America is an excellent place for employment,they were encouraging when it came to me advancing my education,management had excellent communicaton skills with its employees, co-workers and managers were very helpful and knowledgeable,friendly and pleasant place to work,unfortunately I was laid off and have missed it terribly since."
good,I give this company a four because the workload was great; cameras were everywhere-not a problem; worked during most tax seasons continuously; location was within a decent distance
good,"The company itself is good to work for. They offer great benifits and great bonuses. The only draw back is if you work in a call center. The stress comes from the customers and the constant interaction. That though is the nature of the job, so if you can handle that stress, then yes definitly BoA is a good choice."
good,"Management is often uneducated and misdirected in goals. Company would suffer less if management underwent a proper education in leading others through mission, not sales goals."
good,This position involved great pay and benefits. It was nice to getting to interact with the customers for the most part and the staff was pleasant. The only stressful thing about the position was the sales referral part of being a teller if you did not meet your quota.
good,Employ friendly. Correct place to learn new technologies.
good,I had the opportunity to show my ability in tackaling huge projects. The work flow was quite busy and I performed very well.
good,"was able to learn how to always do the best to please the customer. Before the corporate change, they were really a great place to work for. just didn't allow people without a degree to move up to branch manager positions. don't know if that has changed."
good,"I have worked at BOA for over 6 years and I love it. I am looking for a challange and for advancement. This company is notorious for hiring outside of the bank instead of hiring from within. Otherwise I am happy and comfortable with the work, production, goals, and team I work with."
good,It was a very good company and learned a lot while I was employed there. Met a lot of great people and made many great connections.
good,"The advisers and general staff in this office did a great job of finding a comfortable work-life balance. There was work to be done, but staffers didn't shy away from a good lunch or occasional after work drinks."
good,Co-workers were amazing. Forget your emotions. Customer first. Smile a lot. Do not take the burden of customers home. Surveys is all that makes or break whether you stay there
good,"My supervisors were great along with my co-workers although it has been many years since I have worked there I hope the company is still the same."
good,Overall enjoyable company to work for have worked in banking over 20 yrs and BofA was the best ran from associate perspective. Compensation was fair but not the best.
good,Your typical 9-6. Hardest part of the job is growing within the company when you’re meeting all goals and don’t get recognized. I do enjoy the work but would like more recognition and more opportunities to do more and show my capabilities.
good,I enjoyed my time as a contractor at BOA  I met some great co workers and enjoyed my position  I would definitely go back if I had the opportunity and they were definitely very accommodating to family issues and problems
good,"Working with Bank of America was a pleasure. Work hours and benefits were outstanding, only down side is they are making a lot of changes were they are removing tellers and cutting back hours."
good,"Typical days at work varied depending on mail volume.  Had 5 hour work weeks, had a few 40 hours work weeks.  Boring repetitive job.  Sat at computer typing all day was uncomfortable.  The management was nice.  I learned that I am not good at sitting for hours at a time quietly typing."
good,"After 38 years of service, I had a great blessed run why i was there. Its a good place to work at. Its what you make from it. Some management was great and some not. The benefits are great! They do believe in family. Meaning if you have family problems they do tey and understand.  Just dont abuse it. Try to have good work ethics and you shouldn't have a problem.  The pay was ip and down when i was there. "
good,"Bank of America is a huge company involved in many things, some jobs and some management teams are better than others, but overall it is a good place."
good,Long days in a fast paced changing environment. Ability to progress in the organisation if commitment is shown and pro-actively approach potential problems.
good,"This is a finance company that values bottom line.  If you have the background and skills that they need, you will be rewarded and advance in the company."
good,"Good money, however the branch manager at that time was lazy and didnt know much. GOOD thing is that she was not my direct manager. They have a good training program the"
good,"What I can say About this company is that they do care about their employees and offer chances to advance.  I went thru a staffing company, pioneer recruiting that would praise your progression."
good,"tried to make it a less stressful environment. monthly food days.  contest and dress up days. they have monthly recognition meetings, to reward employees for exceptional performance."
good,"Great company, strong core values.   Work hard, learn to collaborate and understand multiple verticals in the company.  The work can be stressful but you are required to be a strong producer."
good,"This is an entry level position, long hours. Day begins with market open and ends when you are too tired to cold call anymore. Training program was not helpful."
good,There were many changes during my last 3-years.  I had a new manager (last 6-mos at BofA) that wanted to micro-manage me even though I had  been successful in my role for 18-years.
good,The buildings are spread out across uptown and you have to go from building to building for meetings sometimes. The pay is high compared to other industries. The benefits are great.
good,BofA has a wonderful array of people working there and most are willing to listen to your thoughts and concerns. The management leaves a lot to be desired but the workers are great.
good,Bank of America is a great company for anyone that's a self-starter and puts emphasis on continuous growth. The diversity of roles across this expansive company provides a solid career foundation.
good,Great opportunities for someone just starting in the work place and for moving up in the company.  The training offered from beginning as teller to/or Branch  Manager is great to ensure that each new associate is ready for their new role
good,"Overall a good company to work for. They are hiring less tellers, so the current ones are getting overwhelmed. They promote from within, but they want you to go through every step on the career path regardless of your experience. If you are a teller with years of management and sales experience, they still will not let you go from teller to relationship manager or any other position that you may qualify for. You have to become a personal banker first, and the pay difference isn't much at all."
good,Overall good place. Management is not always fair.  Benefits are better than most places. It is very hard to move up but they are trying to improve with new programs.
good,I was good at my job customers loved the personal service  and I  enjoyed helping them with all their financial questions.  I  was good at doing mortgages but they no lo get do them in the store by the personal banker.
good,"If you are a go getter with the intentions of success, this company is for you. BOA provides a number of opportunities for personal and professional growth with tons of educational resources."
good,People stay at the bank for a long time they have had a lot of people to start working there right after high school and retire from there after 25years or more
good,This was a stressful call center work environment. The benefits of the company are great. I started in sales then transferred to preferred sales. I worked here for three years.
good,"Satisfied with company overall. Satisfied with growth opportunities. Benefits are declining overall from when i began with the company, but pay is competitive."
good,"Challenging work.  Very collaborative environment.  Many subject matter experts, on both the technical and business sides,  who are always willing to share their knowledge and experiences."
good,"Fellow Employees are great, helpful and relatable.  Free lunches, great café and acceptable facilities.  Focus is on production, can be stressful.  Underwriting/Processing System is difficult to navigate and slows down production.  Example:  Takes 17 steps to input appraisal information."
good,Nice place to work. Enjoyed the job and people. The hardest part of the job was when we were at peak times. The workload tripled and there was a lot of overtime.
good,Has a very good time getting to know the industry better. Worked under very good management that was very helpful. Coworkers made the workplace very fun to be in.
good,"I worked for Bank of America for 3 years. My experience was positive most of the time, but the call center environment is about the same everywhere. I had worked for financial institutions in the past and I was very confident in that sense, but call centers seem to be challenged by a lot of contradictions: quality calls vs handle time, delightful vs compliant with bank regulations, angry & pushy customers vs customer satisfaction surveys.  Employees have to keep a balancing act to hopefully get incentive at the end of the month and deal with customers who are unhappy for reasons that have nothing to do with the effort employees will invest into their customer service level."
good,"Had a very great experience interacting with customers and peers. There were ongoing training to develop your interactions with customers and peers. Least of my interest was there was not enough room for growth. I learnt a lot especially when dealing with different customer personalities, made a lot of difference on how to deal with customers and the many ways to deal wit complications head on."
good,BoA lumped Consumer Finance companies together without due diligence and directions every time the acquired a new bank.  This caused friction between the new and old executives of those companies.
good,Working for BOA is a aweome! Be prepared to work 6 days a week. Work hard and you wont go unnoticed. Rules change everyday so they have online training you do weekly.
good,"Decent job, was a fast paced job made work go by fast, would go back if given the opportunity. Would recommend, management looked out for employees, coworkers were always laid back"
good,"Corporate climate which can be appropriate at some positions but local offices miss the community connection with their customers."
good,"Some departments are like fun startups and others are behind and mismanaged. Even though the company is huge, you still feel like you are heard and the company cares about you. There's a lot of opportunities for advancement but it's easy to get stuck. Pay could be better for such a profitable company."
good,Started in IT at Merrill Lynch during the transition period for the BOA/Merrill Lynch merger. The cultures and systems of the two companies differed to the degree that conversion was critical. Management instituted several programs encouraging employee feedback and engagement collaboration/adoption. I enjoyed being an integral part of the process.
good,"I had the opportunity to learn a new skill for 2.5 months.  I was nervous because the development tools were new to me.  The Applications were new.  As soon as I got everything figured out my work ended.   "
good,"Career advancement; is available bt networking is your best bet. Heavy relying on technology, you can help and watch tech replace you or gt ppl skills"
good,Worked in the back office for many years. Offered different activities from work to get involved in. Employee entertainment participation to balance work.
good,"Great work culture. Very diversified environment. Latest technology."
good,"As a telecommuting contractor, I didn't really feel like I was part of the culture here. I enjoyed my required duties and felt that I was appreciated."
good,"I worked with some great people who wanted to be successful in their Job. "
good,BOA was a great company to work for overall.  There are lots of different jobs to do and you can learn a lot and have a great career there.  Pay is somewhat less than other bank companies in the area but still competitive.
good,"Well?  It's a Bank of America.  It's a giant bank with a corporate environment and mentality.  It's the people/ coworkers that make the difference.  Maybe I got lucky with my coworkers, but we had a great working relationship/"
good,the work load was ok but the company seems to be needing some update in technology and software used not up to date the management seemed overwhelmed with changes in the laws.
good,"Excellent Company to work for, benefits are excellent, just can be micromanaged a bit... Also, many Responsibilities is delegated down to the Mgr, and you really do not get support from whom you are reporting to... "
good,"Typical corporate environment.  Had a lot of great perks like ability to work from home, and flexible hours, but seems to be shrinking its footprints in California."
good,"Was great people, upper level management is detached from a day in the financial center. was a platform sales associate, but they are cutting back on tellers, but the clients necessitate tellers, so this position inundates you to be a cash handling associate."
good,Good place to work in charlotte but a place that definitely is better for non-performers than the higher rated individuals. A good place to coast like any other bank.
good,"BOA is a great place to learn and grow, however they like keeping you in current positions hindering advancement. I have grown and learned from the company, however i feel as if 2 years is a great time frame to continue on my career path"
good,My last position with Bank of America was very stressful and demanding.  The managers started to lose interest in their jobs.  What had once been a dynamic hard working productive team became a nightmare.
good,Worked 2 years in wealth management call center. Fast paced and stressful environment. This department was a revolving door and new hires either advance in 1-2 years or just leave the firm completely.
good,"opening "
good,"Average mid-level  managers.  Various lines of business executive leadership very capable and competent.  Lower level managers and supervisors were generally capable but not as supportive. Culture of ""me"" first..."
good,"I was appreciated by management for my effort and skills that I brought to my work. I was at times promoted quickly and was given free range to make decisions and regularly offered my opinions on how to improve our processes, which most of the time were adopted."
good,This was my first job out of college. The location I was at was great. People were great and the management was wonderful. They cared about our well-being. There was plenty of overtime to go around.
good,My time at Bank of America was great. Even though there is constant changes. You are able to manage and adjust.  Daily meetings and mentoring and coaching.
good,"i loved working for bank of america , fair pay, great benefits, paid holidays, medical insurance, and many more benefits."
good,I enjoyed the job and the team members. the work was always fun with new things to lean everyday. The daily meetings helped us to know the goals and helped us to stand on track
good,"It has been over 10 years since I worked there. The bank has gone through some substantial changes, therefore I  can not accurately comment on its current culture."
good,"Great atmosphere to work, Reliable colleagues and always willing assist. Very challenging but rewarding. Very functional and innovative company. Overall score 8"
good,"If you are looking to move up quickly within a company, BOA will give you the ability to do that. Hard work and dedication to your role does not go overlooked."
good,The pressure to meet sales goals and company requirements began to be stressful due to the lack of customers walking in side the banking center with all of the online resources customers have
good,"We were out for a Retrospective ceremony. The team was experiencing the transformation from Waterfall to Agile. I introduced a game known as One Time-frame."
good,"a day you need to make sales in order to hit your target and get bonuses. also you need to make calls and emails and appointments. "
good,"Loved my time there, could not have asked to work with a nicer group of people. Their willingness to assist with issues as well as to try a new approach to tasks made the project i was assigned to a breaze."
good,Very peace and happy enviroment. Management always was there to assist and provide extra support if needed. They worked with your schedule so it gave us flexibility to manage work and family life.
good,"Great opportunity to start a new career but after a few years, it’s probably best to move on. For those on the tail end of the career spectrum, great place to bide your time - very status quo and not much advancement opportunity outside of headquarters."
good,"Now trying to push banking products vs financial planning with a goal of having all clients with a checking, credit card, and more.  It’s hard to solicit a client who does not have interest in a checking account and credit card."
good,"The company culture is consistently about knowledge perfection and furthering skill base, in both voluntary and company-need re-org's.  There are great perks and good benefit packages.  The management structure is solid. However, as with any company, the individual manager environments can vary between lines of business - a pro/con scenario that has negatively affected the balance of manpower at times.  Overall, I would recommend this company to anyone, looking to prosper, both professionally and personally!"
good,One of the best place to work for.  Benefits is good.  Management is fair.  There are opportunity for growth and advancement.  Bank of America is one of the best place to work for.
good,"A typical day included reaching out to BOA customers, and working with them to rectify their delinquent accounts. The hardest part of the job was the negative comments and feedback from customers."
good,"Overall, a great company. they really take care of their employees - discounts, benefits, work-life balance etc. There are always opportunities to move up."
good,"Typical day of work is coming in to work reviewing case load for day and and prioritizing cases by sla . Learned the time management is the most important skill needed to be successful. Work place culture centered around departments success in meeting departmental goals."
good,Enjoyed my team. Did not enjoy the direction of the company. Did have great benefits and pay was competitive. Did not have much of upward mobility for career development.
good,The culture is self learning and communication is challenging across the board.  The organization changes every 6 to 8 months. The overall benefits and employment opportunities are excellent.
good,"Management is good, people are nice to work with.  Customers are demanding but that is usually how it is in the Financial Industry.  Glad to have been a part of their team."
good,The day started by reviewing files to see if all items were collected from the borrower. if not reach out to them and requested items needed. once all the item needed were in the file send the file over to U/W so they can approve
good,It’s a good place to work but being a contractor has its cons because you never know if you will get hired on or not. The atmosphere is relaxed and is easy to get work done. The team leader and supervisors are very friendly and helpful.
good,"Love it. They had to relocate a year or so after I was there, but the job was awesome. Fairness, treated all people of all backgrounds with respect. The managers did not feed into office gossip or irrational write-ups and micromanaging. It was business and you were treated like a professional no matter your job title or education. They were always willing to help others and to recognize good work and rewarded their employees well. I wish I could have stayed with them, but they relocated."
good,"Excellent Financial company work for It's imperative that you be organized, know your products, can multi task and keep your clients informed through out the mortgage process."
good,It can be difficult to moderately difficult depending on which unit you work at. It is a huge company and there are many different branches to work at.
good,I enjoyed my time at Bank of America. I truly valued the mentoring that was available to myself and my coworkers. I was allowed a flexible work schedule for life/work balance.
good,"I learned a lot about working in a multinational corporation sharing different ideas and perspectives. Superiors do their best to help you fit in. Constant feedback is given to help you succeed in your role. The most enjoyable parts are the interactions with a diverse group of people, you always learn something new."
good,"Pors: BofA interview was not basically a matter of experience but with what you can do.An opportunity to learn new things."
good,"The project management team had a high turnover. There was constant re-orgs and some managers prioritized in getting promotions rather than ensuring a certain change was done. The constant reshuffle meant everyone had to constantly looking out for other opportunities or risk of getting cut. My team was dismantled and I was assigned to work for a manager who lived out of state. Difficult to get career advancement as a result. The benefit, work-life balance were great. The pay was mediocre compared to industry average. Would have preferred working fo a company with a more competitive & aggressive culture."
good,I learned a lot in how a kitchen operates in real life verses working in a kitchen for school related purposes. this job was very informative of how a commercial kitchen is operated.
good,Cruise line commission escrow operations for travel agents. the workplace culture is banking culture and getting used to the way that things are done at a bank is likely the hardest part of the job.
good,"Paid training "
good,"great place to work if you want Sundays  off and if you in nigh classes. team mates are great .its a sales driver environment so if you not comfortable talking to people about their finances, this is not he job for you."
good,"Fast paced, need to be able to speak up for advancement opportunities."
good,"A large portion of my workday would be spent talking to clients and resolving their conflict (giving very clear instructions). Also managing case files and following-up with clients as needed.  Information security is very big in the banking industry and it is constantly changing. Therefore, keeping up with certifications and classes is a must."
good,"Good place to work, team environment, work life balance is good, telecommuting program is good, time off is good, good office environment, decent commute"
good,Glad I worked there but would never go back. Corporate requirements were contradictory and caused stress among employees that detracted from customer service.
good,"A typical day was busy day."
good,"Depending on the immediate manager and department Bank of America, NA is a great place to work. Overall the bank really strives to give their employees the tools needed for personal and professional success."
good,Positives: Solid compensation with very good benefits. Hours are great too. Negatives: High stress/pressure to achieve constantly increasing goals with less customer traffic. Overall compensation not very good unless performing WELL above targeted goals.
good,The Operations culture was very employee focused and the leaders were strong. A lot of emphasis was placed on employee development and communication. Future planning and goals were communicated often and to all levels of employees.
good,"I found a great career at Bank of America.  The main downside was the lack of job security since layoffs are a regular occurrence.  But the company offered excellent opportunities to plan my career, gain knowledge and be recognized for my accomplishments.  I grew up through the ranks at a satisfactory pace (i.e. from a consultant to SVP within 3.5 years."
good,"It's good company, join once and enjoy the facilities. Here you can learn and develop your skills, apart from work you can also involve in other social services and take part in games etc..."
good,"Bank of America was a good place to work, it just didn't work for me due to medical issues. I can only vouch for the department I worked, but management is fairly decent."
good,Great company but so large that good employees can get lost within the crowd. The company needs to focus more on ensuring that they have the right Leaders in the right positions.
good,"I worked in Bank of America for 11 years I loved the innovations in technology and training available for employees, excellent benefits package and education programs."
good,"Bank of America is a great company if you are into business management. The benefits are amazing. This is the reason I have been there so long. I would recommend The Bank as a good launching pad for people who are just starting out in the working world. If you are business minded and ambitious, you can go far."
good,"B of A was a great place to work for the most part, once you promote off the teller line.  However, they keep eliminating positions and pushing the customers to perform digital options.  Technology is really a wonderful thing, but many clients still prefer to come in and speak with a live person, and Bank of America is reducing staff so that these clients get fed up with the wait times and leave for other banks."
good,Meet with clients to find their financial goals and how we can help them achieve them. Work with mortgage loan officers for home needs and small business specialists for business needs
good,"In my third and final position at BoA. I placed outbound calls to over 200 customers that were assigned to me. To assist them in the process to modify there home loans. It was my job to get them through the process in  45 days or less. It was very stressful and over whelming, and I never new the final outcome  of whether or not they  were granted the modification."
good,I enjoy working for Bank of America. They have a very professional work place. There are opportunities for advancement and they have good benefits but the pay raises are very regulated.
good,assisting customers with their transactions the environment was mostly positive. there is a necessity of staying on task and being cautious of cash handling procedures
good,Loved working with the people there and met so many helpful individuals. Was very high stress job as you are handling life changing events for Clients.
good,"i have mixed feeling about the way i was treated.. i believe is the management and not the company as a whole that made me feel this way. It was easy to see that if u didnt have a liberal view on topics that you quickly became black listed of sorts, they was quick to say you are being insubordinate if you didn't agree .. that is the shame of it. But that aside if that could be resolved i most like would still be there.. but i am not the type to just lay down because someone say so .."
good,"I am still looking for work working temp service,  when they have a job open.  It's hard for us old people go find a job...  Bank of America gave a lot of training we have some very nice manager's who keep us on are toes of the time and what areas of important improvements you can't go wrong..."
good,"This was a foot in the door kind of job where I started off in the mail room and worked my way up to Branch Systems Administrator.  If it had not been for the opportunity to interview with The Dobbs Group, my advancement opportunities would have stopped there."
good,Bank of America is a great competitive global company to work for. That brings along different avenues to advance yourself educationally and develop yourself as a brand
good,I was fortunate that my managers were encouraging and supportive of career growth. BofA offers a wealth of training materials and programs to learn about other facets of your position.
good,"Committed to advancement"
good,Good place to work.  Bank of America cares about their employees.  The different teams I’ve been on have always seemed to have a group of employees that all get along and are happy to help each other.
good,"very strong productive position. manager pushed you when needed and encourage with how to achieve your goals. much feed back on calls that you took and gave feed back on how well you did, what could be different and what the outcome would be."
good,"Bank of America does a lot the community allowing associates give back.  They really focused giving to communities they serve."
good,"Daily meeting, followed by working on assigned projects, and addressing concerns as the arise. Management pretty flexible and accomodating to hear opinions."
good,"Overall great work place"
good,"The job is very fast-paced and you have to be good at multi-tasking. I'm in the Spanish bilingual role. Most of the calls are Spanish but sometimes you'll get days where it's balanced out with Eng & Span calls. You have to be quick and pay close attention to your calls to ensure no mistakes are made and that quality does not fail your call when its reviewed for not following procedures. Our policies can change day by day so you have to always have the policy relating to your call pulled up on one on your screens to make you're following everything correctly. Your calls have to average under 5 minutes and your customer surveys now have to be at 88% satisfaction for your numbers to be good for the month. You have to be fast and efficient with your calls all while trying to get good surveys from your customers. It can be hard because you can't please everyone and sometimes you'll have those days where you can get fee after fee after fee call where the customer yells at you and you have to keep your composure to not get a bad survey. If you get a survey with a 1-8, it drops your numbers so painfully low. Getting 9 or 10 surveys is what you have to aim for. It is doable. Most people get the hang of it after 3-4 months on the job. It is very stressful, though. I am ACTIVELY looking for another job to leave this position."
good,"The first 10 Years were with  BAML were great.  I had a lot of opportunity to learn a lot from Infrastructure, to dealing with Clients to providing guidance to the people working at the locations.   It was a great while it lasted."
good,"The employees, the staff, the people make it a great place to work! Incredible benefits, strong compensation, all make it worthwhile to work for Bank of America."
good,"The job is pretty standard. It is quite boring and the management there seems to forget what you did the day prior if they dont think you ""have"" what it takes to advance. They dont much care how well you do at your job but rather focus on how much they like you."
good,Workplace culture is awesome except for productivity depts. The Bank's culture for quality & service is stressed but management stressed quantitative.
good,"Facing corporate challenges daily.  Global information security, regulatory compliance and customer service are top priorities.  Corporate business model puts big pressure on executives and rewards them.  Finally recovering from years of paying penalties and fines.  The company is in a constant state of reorganization.  Many constraints and some opportunities for advancement.  Overall a good company to work for."
good,"Over all a great place to work. They will make sure your are working with in the Compliance Guild line, "
good,"Great part time job. I had no complaints. I was there for 13 years. I would definitely go back in a PT capacity. The managers were ok, a little power tripping but nothing that was terrible."
good,"A typical work day was to get your mortgage documents from the que and start reviewing them for errors and accurate information. Nice place work, A mixed culture, some jobs were based on production which should not be, pretty much co workers and managers were nice to work with."
good,"The company as a whole is a good company. The department I worked in was a little different. You always had someone watching over your shoulder and even though I worked with HELOC's, we still had to do sales. We always had to offer credit cards and insurance. You always had to rebutle if you received a no. The management wasn't the best but it just depended on who you had."
good,"Working in the cash vault is a little different from the typical banking job, going in to work in the late afternoon then working until the work is done. Could be 11 PM or might be 2 AM. But I enjoyed working those hours, and liked the camaraderie. Bank of America was a good place to work. The benefits were good, and the management was good, up until the last manager anyway."
good,Bank of American and I have been on the same level of service and we have been to this dining room dining area and service is great and service is excellent and
good,Strong push for sales; high closing ratios expectations; not meeting all goals; the best part was the team effort to achieve; management was very hands on and goal driven
good,"Even though our pipelines were over 300 loans, It was very fast paced but enjoyable place to work. My favorite part was all my customers, and assisting them in obtaining the home of their dreams."
good,"The current culture of the company is changing with more overseas outsourcing involvement.  The customer driven projects and stability of the customer are still top focus in all major areas of the bank - deposits, credit card, investment services."
good,a place where you are rewarded for great work. Do good and you will see good. But there is very little opportunities to advance without moving out of town.
good,"They mold you into the associate they want you to be. I feel they limit the entrepreneur spirit due to the rules and guidelines they have. Making you rely on their business model, in some cases it makes you fail. Overall its a decent place to work, hard to advance within I feel."
good,"Good opportunities for entry and line level leaders to grow, great place to network and connect in Financial Services industry.  Recommend a good place to start a career"
good,Good environment to work. Cafeteria onsite. Incentives to hit your goal for the month. Great management team. Training was quick and i learned alot about fraud
good,"BOA is a wonderful institution.  Very stressful during rush hours but enjoyed meeting people.  Wonderful staff and excellent service providers."
good,This information is private. I do not wish to share information regarding any company I have worked for on line. It is unethical to serve as a requirement that a review must be completed.
good,"I absolutely loved my job at B of A.  I was a FT employee.  Comp was base salary, discretionary annual bonus, and benefits (all competitive.)"
good,Working at Bank of America has been a job that I've enjoyed thoroughly. The work culture is amazing. The staff get along with each other so well. Everyone is eager to learn new things as well as providing help to other employees when necessary. The downside with working here is management. And that's not necessarily the company in general however there are a handful of managers who make it extremely difficult to work with thus making the work environment very toxic to both employees and customers. I've learnt to adjust accordingly. Overall the company is a great company and there are so many benefits and assistance available for its employees.
good,"I worked for the bank for 10 years and I was proud of what I did for my customers. I was extremely was successful always producing as one of the top 4 sales people in the company for at least 8 of the 10 years I was employed. "
good,"I assisted associates and customers in the home loan collection division.  Mostly with homes in foreclosure. I would determine,  by their income if they were qualified for a repayment plan, modification or to sell the home. "
good,"I worked there for 10 years and learned so much about banking and loved working with the staff and customers. The hardest part was being over looked for promotions by people who were promoting ""friends""."
good,"nothing bad to say about the company, I had a good team and good management. I got along with everyone and it was close to my home which was a plus for me."
good,"Bank of America provides great benefits but the job security is not the best. They did offer work from home, however, in the recent years they were getting people back to office"
good,"A friendly environment...team member are all way will to help and answer question. The fact that supervisor trust you and do your job and did not pressure you,"
good,Great place to work with very good work life balance.  Management gives its associates the ability to have increased say in daily activities that drive overall business.
good,This is a great place to work depending on where you work. The management teams are what make it great. The try to be open and transparent when implementing any changes.
good,It really depends on the department/ area of the bank you are working in  on how your experience will be but for me it has been a great company to work for overall.
good,"I've learned how to manage mt time better.  Also how to  be sympathetic to our customers and co workers.  I enjoyed assisting customers and mitigating bank risks.  I did not like the time frame, metrics, that sometimes did not allow you to fully service our customers"
good,"Looking forward to be promoted. at least increase employee salaries who's with been with them for long years, Need to pay attention to their employees. Need to oversee employees growth."
good,"Great company, with a lot of opportunities to grow throughout the organization. Their benefits package is virtually unmatched in terms of what they offer employees."
good,"Enjoyed BofA, but not my 2 hour commute one way. If transfer option was available, would have never left!! Great customer centric culture, great team work!!"
good,"I am in as a temp with no prior experience and started in the call center. This is very common and gives everyone a chance to develop regardless of their background. Our department has grown exponentially during my 7 years with the company. When I came on my line of business was 2 teams out of 5 total for the dept on site in Jax. We're now 5 teams out of 11 in Jax and we have an entire floor in our building. That has lead to much improved career progression from entry level up to mid level manager. "
good,Your success truly depends on the competency of the bankers and their willingness to refer clients to your office. Your success also depends on the center you are placed in.
good,"Great benefit, 3 weeks paid time off, health dental insurance,"
good,"Mortgage Servicing as a whole reduced their operations as the mortgage meltdown reduced and issues were mitigated.  This left the massive increase in staffing to now needing reductions.  Layers were cut across the board, and for the most part the initial cuts made sense and reduced the bottom 5%.  As time went on and the cuts continued, the focus became job relevance/need.  What was once a booming environment with crazy growth to resolve the mortgage crisis had resolved back down to a minimal amount of folks with not much growth potential.  Overall the culture was amazing and they treated all their leadership and employees well."
good,La actividad de atención a clientes en el call center puede llegar a ser un poco abrumador por los tiempos de conección
good,"Did not really get along with my co-workers, I  am not sure if it was due to my sexual preference or not, but I did not feel very comfortable to this job, especially the location I was hired for. The location I trained at, I absolutely loved my co-workers and the environment."
good,"You could get lost in the shuffle at a bank this large. I loved remotly managing the ATM network, I loved being an analyst in Network Support. BOA was a great place to work"
good,"Bank of America was was a great place to work for 19.5 years. While there were many days, weeks and months where I felt overworked and abused, they did pay well in general. It was a fine line."
good,"I learned about a lot of front office procedure and operations."
good,"Can't complain, the benefits are good. The only thing is working 6 days a week kind of kills it, very little time to spend with family. Goals are also high, and if you don't hit %100 of your goal, you won't bonus."
good,"A typical day at work was going to my desk and start up computer and programs and take back to back general customer service calls and only off the phone for breaks. The management is pretty fair but hard to get their attention sometimes do to their own overly active daily schedule. The workplace  culture is pretty nice you make friends fast since switching teams or time shift can happen frequently and alot of potlucks and specialty days like national sandwich day or ugly sweater day during the holidays. The hardest part o the job is the constant change in rules, policies, and programming and dealing with unhappy customers and if you don't meet your stats it can cause a ripple affect. The most enjoyable part of the job is your team and being able to help customers and hearing their gratitude and getting good survey remarks. Also having a good competitive wages, and benefit."
good,"My memory of the Brea operations center was the in-house cafeteria, fitness room, showers and lockers. The benefits have been the best offered by ANY employer I have worked for. However the pay was on the low end"
good,"Bank offers you the opportunity to grow and learn, we encourage the ability to work as a team.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to build relationships ad succeed together.  The downside is the constant leadership change, people seek stability.  If you can't deal with change this is not an environment for you."
good,Bank of America is the kind of company where you get out what you put in. It is the type of environment where the customer's needs are placed foremost.
good,"I worked in the Loss Mitigation field which I was familiar with. Training was very slow and unfortunately boring. Th job was good once I started. Basically, it was doing much of the same I had done it was just getting use to the systems which was very quick."
good,"Seeking challenging and responsible position that would provide opportunity for professional growth"
good,"OK place, no fun elements, like get togethers, common room etc"
good,bank of america is an awesome company to work for and i worked in two different departments while i was there and i loved both of them i was treated well but the pay could have been alot better out side of that i really loved my time there until i was laid off. i would definitely recommed this as a great place to work.
good,"None that i can think of, but i have to have more characters than i have. So I am just randomly putting in words to get to what I need to do. I hope you find this helpful"
good,"Bank of America is an awesome place to work great experience for customer service and learning about mortgages and foreclosure and short sales. Great pay, great bonuses."
good,its a banking domain and its is very challenging and fast paced sometimes and overall i have enjoyed working here. I like to thank my team here for their support.
good,"Company has it's drawbacks but offers amazing benefits even to part time employees. The only issue I have is that raises are not consistent, and promotions are harder to come by than you'd think with a company that has high turnover. Company looks more to external hires for advancement then to people who've worked for them for years."
good,"When i first started at BoA I was labeled as a workout specialist, in turn I spoke to customers about their financial information, collected data, did the underwriting and ran those numbers through the home loan modification tool."
good,I enjoyed a successful career @ bank of America.  My time as a mortgage loan officer/call center was very financially rewarding and supplied a efficient and rewarding work environment.
good,"In general, working at this company provides good work and life balance, and many opportunities to learn. Coworkers are friendly, management will listen to different voices. Good place to start a career."
good,Good position for sales. the focus for sales along with customer service did not mirror each other well when focusing on all products available to customer but is quickly matching up within the next few years.
good,Goal driven environment and a fast-paced setting.  Opportunity to advance and ability to work across the country in various Bank of America locations.
good,"I really enjoyed my early years working for this company. However, after the 2008 financial crisis, funding of critical efforts became challenging and created risk in the environments."
good,Very stressful to work in a bank environment. Every day is a challenge that can be turned into an opportunity. From cross selling to customers to servicing them as well as operations. Upper management is all about sales and numbers.
good,"Management was very unfair, you were rewarded for the work you did, however decision were made the the higher ups and not by your reporting manager..."
good,This position was very enjoyable and fast paced. I enjoyed the management and the knowledge that I gained while employed with Bank of America. I would definitely recommend someone to this company
good,I was not at ML for very long.  My job was in an area (insurance) not familiar to the some of the resources and management I worked with since it is an investment company.  So there were cultural challenges for me.
good,"Overall its a good work culture, but little to no growth of moving up after years of working diligently and honestly. The benefits and management are willing to listen but it seems to be tough to make any headway for a promotion or significant increment in pay"
good,i can definitely say that they have their stuff together and its a good place to work for. very corporate environment but steady work and reliable. i miss this company!
good,"Typical computer based office work. Customer service via the phone"
good,"You have to be self motivated, very little supervision needed. Meet and exceed all assigned productivity structure. Client orientated to provided top resolutions to escalation issue. Able to work with management to reach resolution within and expedited time frame. "
good,There were challenges due to system issues. Not enough support from management to do your best job. Tried to push workers too hard and great workers left as a result.
good,"good company to work for,  learn a lot working with great people and learn new technologies.  I think company listens to your ideas and feedback.   there is a work life balance."
good,"The organization wasn't bad to work for, I think I would have liked it more if I was a single/no kids person. And as a manager I was hourly. Overall it was okay and had room for growth."
good,"It is a good place to work with really good benefits for someone young that gets to be a Band 5.  Getting to Band 4 is seemingly impossible.  If you're not getting taken of care of with big bonuses in your first year, your bonus will never go up and opinions as to who is 'top talent' is already decided.  You're best off working for a few years and jumping ship to get the salary bump and advancement, then come back after two years if you miss it."
good,I spent 11 years at BoA and its predecessor Texas banks and was a very good experience. Culture was very nurturing and collaborative and everyone was eager to help one another. Managers really influenced the culture in their areas and the 'happiness factor' did vary from department to department.
good,"enjoyable workplace, good management, corporate cutbacks until they finally laid off everyone. before that that benefits were great, pay was good, ample vacation time"
good,My job at Bank of America was interesting to where I got to learn a multiple different mailroom duties along with flexible hours as allowing me when I available to work as I worked a little variety of day and evening hours.
good,Very good place to work.  The GTO team promotes collaboration within different groups.  Management is very supportive and the firm promotes really good work-life balance within the entire organization.
good,I began working at Bank of America very young when I first moved to Florida.  I moved up throughout the channels and learned a lot.  I left for an opportunity to work from home.
good,I never would have left this job if two things had been different - new manager was overbearing and controlling and we were priced out of the real estate market and had to move somewhere we could afford a home.  Usually located in large cities in downtown areas which means long commutes no matter where you're at in the country.
good,nice work environment is available but low wages is the worst part of working at bank of america. moderate benefits and paid time off is available as well as sick days
good,Good working environment. I loved how there was a cafeteria on site. The management team was average. I would definitely work for this company again if given the opprotunity.
good,Good and Fun loving. Employees are secured n safe especially for lady employees. Coming to work environment stress free work. Have too many extra curricular activities to avoid the stress. Have too many policies n standards. The only thing is the salaries are not good @ BOA.
good,Bank of America is a great place to work. They made me feel like a valued employee. I had several jobs in my 20 years of service. There are always advancement opportunities.
good,"Unbalanced work place.  Mainly management, sometimes very stressful and a lot of job uncertainty.  No job security.  Never knew on a day to day basis if you would have a job."
good,"Just a job.  Very Cut Throat."
good,Learned a lot about banking and credit cards I use in my private life. Enjoyed doing onboarding of new hires and branding Bank of America to new hires
good,"I worked this position part time while in college. It was great paying job for someone who is still in school. The hours weren't the most flexible as most banks are only 8-5 and some have you work a mandatory Saturday morning shift as well. All and all, it was a great place to work time as a student. I would recommend to a friend"
good,My day consist of document research inline with bank and federal regulations. I loved my last manager. The boss prior to her was very poor and was not well liked by the staff and other managers.
good,"Good work culture. Not good for h1b visa holders but work culture and client managers are awesome to work with."
good,A typical day in Financials would be receiving 200-400 calls a day answering questions and handling mortgage accounts for customers. you are responsible for their accounts making sure escrow and all bills are paid ontime and adjusting escrow depending on yearly amounts.
good,"I was with Bofa for 3 years in the U.S, best job I've ever had, management was great. I then got transferred to Brazil and didn't last a year there because I quit. Management was THE WORST! And the HR just terrible. Did not assist me with issues I had and didn't seem concerned to address the situation, hence my disconnection from the company."
good,"Challenging Role with high expectations and excessive deadlines in some circumstances. Management style not consistent throughout the organisation, Good morale."
good,"The job was very unbalanced.I am a very hardworking,strong,fast paced individual..I look for a company that offer career opportunities and advancement.I am also very dependable."
good,I liked working for Bank of America however no room for advancements so looking outside the bank in order to have a chance to advance back into management position
good,Started working here and now it's time to move on. Not everything I hoped it would be. Overall not a bad place to work. Just need something different.
good,It was a great place to work and I probably would still be there if I wasn't laid off. the job wasn't overwhelming and you weren't micro managed. I was able to advance in the company.
good,"I personally don't have any complaints working for BofA.  Overall, it's a good company with many excellence benefits.  However, I'm in consumer banking so the working weekend hours are sometimes tough to handle."
good,Work culture is very good. I would like to consider BOA for my next opportunity and certainly not a contract job. I would be interested only if it is full time employment.
good,Unfortunately I had to mark 1 star for job security because our Center closed. Other than that little fact the company as a whole was a good place to work.
good,"Great bank to work with and good teams and processes. Work culture could be better. Since its a bank the work culture is very traditional, unlike tech companies."
good,"When I was with Merrill, Lynch, there was a lot of work to do and there were no limits on overtime. A typical day at work was making sure all customer accounts is updated and taxes are being withheld "
good,Bank of America typical day at work is pretty typical. I definitely praise the company for being more in tune with employees allowing us to pretty much dress how we'd like and reminding us of course as in any place of business we dress to impress when we have company. There were plenty of OT opportunities but of course schedule wise you were less fortunate depending on seniority certain perks as far as the more convenient time slots to work and vacation bids would put you at the bottom of the totem pole but this company does such a good job of balancing things out. The hardest part was the inconsistencies with implementing certain procedures and the manner in which certain management personnel would take it upon themselves to implement and emphasize. There were cuts and times of uncertainty as far as job security based on what the company felt was necessary to minimize or clearly cut out.
good,"good company, you get a lot of support. Lots of benefits and resources at the corporate level. A friendly and collaborative environment that is less cut throat and better work life balance than the rest of the street.  really smart employees Culture, people, networking opportunities, working groups- everything comes together to create a holistic experience."
good,"Good opportunity, allows you to learn a lot about the financial services industry and investment management/ financial planning. This position allows you to build your own wealth management practice or join an successful existing team."
good,Great people and culture. Employees are very nice and helpful to each other. The company has a great brand and huge presence throughout the US.  Must be dedicated to complete for success.
good,"The company grew too large with acquisitions and cut vast quantities of good experienced people to trim the workforce. The people making these decisions to cut the workforce hold millions of shares of stock and their primary focus is on raising the stock price, not retaining experienced talent. Job security is not good, constant waves of layoffs."
good,"I enjoy working for a busy branch, time goes by quickly.  The trainings are superb and continuous.  Opportunities are great and they will help you meet your career goals."
good,"Very busy daily environment, learned a lot of new stuff daily, good management to work with, fun and very diverse workplace culture, and love all the staff members"
good,The culture at Bank Of America was very diverse. A day at work was me coming in early to get overtime and to get a start of working my loans my manager was great and would work with you when it came to issues with kids and family. I enjoyed working  with customers and helping them however we was laid on off on 9/26/2017.
good,I  work at bank of america as a temp worker. It can provide a very good working place for me and the people working here is also very nice and friendly.
good,"check appointments, take care of customers concerns and requests and focus on the opportunities and financial needs of the customers. Only sell customers products that will better their financial needs by asking questions. The hardest part is getting calls in to followup on customers. I have set time aside in the slower part of the day to make calls. Most enjoyable part is making customers happy and they remembering you and come back to see me."
good,"I do enjoy this place of employment, however, I wish that I was paid more. I do take advantage of the medical benefits which are wonderful. Management is good depending on the manager assigned to you."
good,"The people were very nice, however there is not much opportunity for advancement with a small PWM firm with no financial licenses."
good,"Poor Management in some cases but overall a great company to work for if you can manage to dodge lay offs which happen often. You can advance with this company if you work hard and know the right people. If you happen to get a manager who does not like you, then good luck."
good,My overall experience at BOA was good. Management could be improved but overall it was nice. The typical work day consisted of arriving and jumping into the system. The work environment was great. I was able to meet various people and learn various jobs that will afford me to be a positive team player at a new company.
good,"The benefits are the best in the industry. The issue is that they manage by reports primarily. They do not offer flex schedules or a work from home schedule which is odd compared to competitors. It is very much a call center feel, lacks the professional feel most are seeking although they are looking to make changes."
good,"Bank of America is definitely an interesting place to work with lots of diverse technologies and processes. If you don't like one organization there is a chance you might find something else you like in a different one. It does have a corporate feel, and although they are trying to modernize their workspace, they still have a lot of processes that are slow and it can take time to get access to things or get approval to use some technologies. The current organization uses offspring a lot which makes doing some things a lot harder - development conversations on a phone are much harder than in a room with a whiteboard."
good,work is constant and never boring.  The culture is geared to helping everyone succeed. Management is looking for everyone to give their best whenever they come to work. This job can be stressful as it is a constant challenge to be your best in a stressful industry that is tightly regulated.
good,"Overall I had very positive experience working at Bank of America. Exceptional clients,  past paced work, positive attitude. Workplace culture there is inclusive. My favorite perk was car service for late hours."
good,"In a typical day you'll be responsible for developing new retail mortgage business for a retail branch location. This included actively pursuing leads generated through branches and referrals in order to secure new mortgage sales. Prequalify prospective home buyers and advise them on financing options. Provide guidance to customers throughout mortgage application and processing activities. Gathered and processed all necessary documents to ensure successful application process. You'll be reviewing financials ie. tax returns, 401k, pension, retirement income, W2 wage statements, etc. as well as work with branch managers, personal bankers, tellers, loan processors and underwriters to communicate mortgage opportunities. Overall, if you're comfortable with strictly commission, its a great place to work. If you're new the industry... good luck!"
good,"The Collaboration and Certification Lab is a fast pasted environment, that has more work than resources, however manages to get results of new deployments achieved."
good,For me personally it was connecting with my day to day customer and meeting their needs weather it be teller functions or inquiries or even a simple conversation to brighten their day that was the most enjoyable for me during my time here
good,"My work was as a contract and I was work at home 100%, so it was relaxed atmosphere, but tend to work additional hours every week.  Did varying task and manager was great to work for, but all things change"
good,"For a Career with Banking, Bank of America provides a great deal of learning with a great work/life balance.  Operations Leadership provides good direction with great teaching and coaching. Sales Direction can be very numbers driven without the same teaching focus as with operations."
good,"good job to have good benefits good environment all the details of a good job. Business just shut down and everyone was let go unfortunately. Managers were mostly understanding and organized,  friendly work crowd of people. Computer usage daily made it simpler to navigate through certain job functionalities."
good,I enjoyed working with customers to save their homes from foreclosure.  I learned a lot about different types of mortgages and loan modifications.  No room for advancement in this position.
good,"The system we use should be updated, referrals was a bit too much as I was a teller not a banker. Management changed often and the environment could be challenging sometimes."
good,"I spent over a decade at the bank and loved the culture. They are known to reduce workforce several times of year though so you need to constantly move departments before you get laid off. Great pay, great people, great benefits. Wish they didn't gave such a high turnaround rate."
good,"Our daily work functions was very busy, we had 24 techinicans onsite at one time and downgraded to 7 technician onsite due to budget cuts but the work load was alway there.  I supported the entire uptown charlotte and was station at the back office. Every year was a learning process due to the new software applications being push to our clients, as well the new  desktop /laptop and tablets that was being dispatched to the clients.  Our new manager is very micromanage, the workplace culture is nice. The hardest part of the job was trying to accomplish the daily tickets coming in with a short staff. The enjoyable part of the job was getting the job done and seeing the clients happy."
good,I have no issues with the company or my current role. I'm looking for more advancement opportunities.  The bank has great benefits and promotes diversity.
good,Bank of America is a good place to work.  I was hired through a leadership development program. This program was developed to adequately train recent college grads in all aspects of bank center operations.  Work/life balance was good.
good,"I sit at a desk and take incoming check fraud claims, u can bonus each month but to do that u have to have good survies fromm clients, call time has to below a certain time, and attendance"
good,To advance most of the time it not what you know it's who.It can be competitive.but overall my team are like family. My department can be a bit stressful due to the nature of the job.. but I enjoy my job.
good,Role required the use of my licenses although you are called upon to perform other sales duties which you are over qualified to perform. Management treats you fairly and are there to support the advisor when needed however there may be a difference in opinion when it comes to standing up for staff vs client.
good,"Overall, It was a great place to work for, I established great skills and personal relationships there. My position was outsourced and I wasn't prepared to relocate at that time."
good,"not a sweat shop, but goal oriented, worked on system to define parameters for collections system using TSO, DB2, VSAM, Cobol."
good,Sales oriented position. Had to perform on selling products and customer service was very important. You could only work 40 hours per week and had different hours each day including Saturdays.
good,can be stressful however clients were nice great benefits for customers however pay is very low compared to stress for sales goals that must be met each quarter
good,Working there was good. I had good people around with different diversity. Making coming to work easy. That was my third lay-off. My work day was to assign cases and resolved them within the service level agreement time.
good,"Great work place and learned lot about banking domains support system."
good,"Great hours, peaceful environment the culture was great, team oriented.  Bank of America volunteers a lot in the community.  You can have the opportunity to go to school."
good,"Good Pay scale"
good,"Fast paced and can be stressful at times in the mortgage department. However, there is room for cross training as well as opportunity to post for internal positions."
good,"I worked at Bank of America for 30 years.  I filled many positions and enjoyed every one.  It is a large company with many opportunities for advancement.  However, there is not a comfortable feeling of job security."
good,"Very sales focused but great opportunity for advancement if desired."
good,"Great paternity benefits, child-care reimbursement, health, dental & vision!  The company has a wide presence in many communities and many opportunities for career-minded individuals."
good,"It was a great place to work, They did a reorg structure that is only why I left. I did a lot of different types of jobs. This is a great company to work for. I enjoyed everything about my job"
good,The Bank is a good place for people that want to see really good really good IT Security Controls. Everything is based on a formal risk methodology. Very stable they do use a lot of contractors. I was one. That is not all bad.
good,"Overall a great place to work at. Lay offs due to low production. Otherwise, the 12 years spent working were exciting. At the end, Eleven of us were laid off because the company lost the work flow."
good,"I learned a lot about sales, especially when I was promoted to sales service specialist, and was very successful in that role.  It was great learning about customer needs and helping them with products offered through the bank that was beneficial to both the client and the business."
good,"This was my first full-time job after graduating high school. It was a great place to learn how the world of corporate America works. Great benefits, thorough training."
good,Prefer not to respond regarding a typical day at work. See resume for what I have learned. Prefer not to respond regarding management and workplace culture.
good,I've learned a lot about different businesses being in charge of the merchant customers. The manager is great and outgoing. He pushes you to do your best. I enjoy networking with people and serving the people in my city. Work can be exhausting especially standing up all day for eight hours. You aren't allowed to sit down unless you're on break or lunch.
good,Bank Of America was a fast paced workplace. It allowed me to utilize my skills and apply them to be honest and fair.  The numerous challenges that I encountered forced me to make the most empathetic decisions in my life.  Although I was in a tuff field(mortgage loans) I studied the positive outcomes to better assist my family and friends.
good,"from when you arrive to when you leave, minus lunch and breaks you are tied to your desk. if you use the bathroom ""too much"" you get spoken to because you werent available to answer calls from the most ignorant people in the world."
good,"there is a lot of  repetition in the job but the crew you work with makes up for it. they have benefits, and the potential to get raises.  You also work in other departments like shipping and receiving so it keeps things interesting."
good,"I have found myself at a road block without the ability to relocate. The opportunities to move up are extremely limited in Tucson. There are plenty of opportunities within consumer banking as well as other lines of business if one would be willing to relocate even as close as Phoenix, however, I am currently not able to relocate."
good,They are a great family company with great benefits to full-time employees. Not so much for contractors. Friendly and relaxed work environment with jeans and sneakers. Production is everything at this company.
good,"During my time with Bank of America, I enjoyed the learning opportunity of being in Fulfillment.  The position was a great position but became very challenging during the housing market crash."
good,Most everyone is friendly and helpful. Good team players.                                       They should allow more work from home (WFH) opportunities. Don't punish all work from home associates because of a few unproductive WFH associates.
good,Its a very big company that provides a lot of opportunities to its employees.  You need to be able to network to assist your chances of getting movement in your career.
good,"Busy work place, good people to work with. A good understanding of the work.  Great training facility. Not everyday is the same; the work is streamlined, but understanding the situation can be challenging."
good,"BAC has tremendous flexibility in work schedules.  It's demanding, but when you get your work done is less important than what you get done by the deadline."
good,"I started my work day by reviewing emails from the the previous evening and responding to any and all request from the Customer Service Administrators. This task provided me an opportunity to handle multiple task and create balance within my job function at Bank of America. Management was fair but lacked effective communication from my perspective. I worked in an Friendly environment which made the workplace culture fun to be in. The hardest part of my day was meeting deadlines but, this was also the most enjoyable part of my day as I always met any required deadline from upper management."
good,"Bank of America was not a bad place to work I have two different experience.  "
good,"Job security. Great benefits and you can be crossed trained. You get tuition reimbursement, childcare reimbursements, on the job training. Company picnics, different discounts. It's great room for advancement."
good,"Bank of America accessed your progress each month and had monthly meetings to awarding high performers."
good,No complaints about Bank of America. They have given me a great structural foundation regarding business. The day to day activities are monotonous but the work must be done and my team is filled with amazing individuals.
good,A great opportunity with a multitude  of  avenues / departments to expand your work experience.   Policy and procedures do change frequently.  Lateral transfer or more common than promotions.  Benefits are very good.  Managers are stat driven but fair.
good,"I retired after 20 + years due to management changes, felt like I was taking 2  steps back for every step forward.  The company was more concerned about cost cutting than customer service and the employees."
good,"Each year each manager rates their employees from high to low. At certain times a year those at the bottom are considered to be terminated due to a ""reduction in force"". When you move from one manager to another you are at great risk of losing your job due to no exposure or sponsorship. Technology roles are always at risk of off shore out placement."
good,Bank of America was a very strong bank with great people leading their teams. They have a very knowledgeable team in the credit areas and their bankers have proven track records.
good,"This is a very collegiate environment.  Everyone gets along and works together to get the job done.  It is a strong work family, with flexible hours, but very meaningful work."
good,Great benefits but not a healthy lifestyle work environment. Managers like to micromanage associates and don't recognize their pass achievement  at work
good,As a relationship manager an individual is expected to open accounts meet sales goals. When the branch is slow you will be required to make phone calls to get clients to into bank. The training is sub par and the management varies depending on the location.  Central Valley $20.50 pr hr
good,"Great company to work for.  Great management teams.  Always looking for improvement in the work force, such as project management, various departments."
good,The incentive plans are designed to take money away from the bonus for those who work in the financial centers. Tellers are being reduced and the staffing situation is getting worse everyday. Too many changes too fast.
good,"They have a multicultural atmosphere, they embrace all people.  I acquired new skills working in receivables and deposits and was content with my position.  Due to labor shortage I am no longer employed. The enjoyable part of the job was having opportunity to advance, the tuition reimbursement paid 100% of college expenses if it was job related.  There was always employee rewards and lunches for a variety of things throughout the year. A ton of opportunities to volunteer with a lot of non profit organizations."
good,Great company but had a challenging supervisor that had no real interpersonal skills that led to a very difficult relationship. Had great supportive peers

good,9 to 5 Bankers Hours is a huge bonus for work life balance. Average pay.....Commission structure was unrealistic. Too many restrictions on prospecting new Clients
good,Enjoyable working with multiple vendors on application that brings joy cheer and challenge to work in the conducive environment like no other client..
good,The job was very stressful. We had a production board in front of you stating how many cases you cleared that day. It started out with only 12 cases a day then it the numbers kept on climbing so that was very stressful .we only dealt with corporate accts which had a lot of different problems in it because there could have been at least  three other researchers that already worked on this case before you get so you would have to figure out just what they did and there was a time limit on the case so the was very stressful

good,"US Trust is a great company to work for however being owned by such a large parent company in Bank of America has its advantages and disadvantages. Decisions are made at the top of the house that seem to strain US Trust while promoting other lines of business. I greatly enjoy the people I work with as well as management. With that said, management can be improved dramatically with a bit of managerial training, in my opinion. Personally I like all of our managers (including those I do not report to) however professionally I believe they have made a few missteps along the way."
good,"Great place to work on your customer service skills.  Learned a lot about financial side of life, and aspects of it."

good,The bulk of my training as an admin asst was learned here.  I had terrific management and strong leaders.  We worked as a family for a long time here until our office was shut down.

Make the proper management adjustment for the client in order to meet there financial needs. As long it meets the bank policies. Work at management level. So we will do everything in are power to get things right. Listening to the client expand what the branch manager, customer service and sales agent did wrong. The most enjoyable part was fixing the problem. Calling the right department or staying with them until the problem solved. Give them Ideas on oh to ask for or how thing can get solved. So problem never happens again."
good,"a typical day at work was sitting all day inputting alphanumeric data into their computer system, two breaks, 30 minute lunch. we got weekly or daily production reports. I had never had a job doing data entry before so I guess I learned to do data entry. the management was strict yet understanding and kind. workplace culture was quite and harmonious and busy everybody working to get the job done. I can't think of what the hardest part of the job was for me but the most enjoyable part of the job was all of it for me just sitting all day and quietly typing away and getting paid for it, loved it all."

In the very first quarter that I was required to meet quota goals I placed not only first in my district but rather top 5 sales efficiency in the entire northeast.  I was able to provide great customer service that lead to supreme sales numbers.  I entered a banking center where the manager and other personal banker had been working together for over 7 years and my success took a toll on the relationships I had within the banking center.  I enjoyed every day with the clients I dealt with and will always miss the people I met and still am in contact with to this day.
good,Great global leader to work for with a non-combative culture that encourages global collaboration.  It is client centric with an enormous emphasis on going the distance for the clientele.
good,"Good place to start in the industry, there is a high degree of burnout and can be repetitive. Great learning opportunity and lots of thing to do in the company."
good,Here we can learn core banking functionality.But as a fresher you can't learn much here.Any other access other than banking sites will not be provided.And you have to work in very old technology.
good,"The benefits and time off was great, sick time is allotted separately which is rare to find, however don't go over or you'll get occurrences which can lead to termination. They  do try to make the environment fun with activities. They have programs to help you become a leader, but working in management was high pressure. You would work weekends, nights, and on your days off. There was no work life balance as a manager."

good,Great place to work. NOT micro managed. Great benefits if hired as a permanent employee. Everyone was willing to help with problems and/or procedures.
good,Very busy workplace. It helps to remember peoples name and faces. Speedy and accurate transactions are best. Long hours on Fridays. You have to be knowledgeable of products and accounts to best fit your customer.
good,Busy but friendly atmosphere . Love the people I work with. Decent benefits. Difficult to get raises and job advancement regardless of recognition of work skills.
good,I feel that for a company of this size they should be able to do more for the employee as far as showing appreciation.  Seem like they try to get away with doing the absolute minimum with that regard.
good,Busy and repetitive. I learned to be more opened to learning new tasks. Heavy days were hardest. Friendly employees. The management was based on favoritism so some employees were treated differently than others.
good,"Mortgage Underwriter, selling all bank products, worked with Wholesale ad Retail.  Internal and External customers was great to deal with , which made the job enjoyable. Management will be mgmt., I expect nothing less,"
good,"Overall, the experience was positive.  It took a turn when they reorganized the mid-level management team.  Ops on one side, sales on the other.  The overall experience from a leadership standpoint was okay.  You had control of your branch and owned all results that came out of it."
good,"Excellent corporation to be employed.  I was with Bank of America for 21 years."
good,"This is a challenging job. It's very demanding and drains you. The company is  huge and therefore there is never a quiet day at work. One need to constantly study and learn to keep up with the technologies being used,"

The coworkers are very helpful and accepting of me.The job can get a little stressful if machines are not properly working right and mail is not open correctly. I enjoy being self sufficient at work just knowing the job and working till end of your shift."

good,"Be ready to handle a lot of customers, especially through people skills and professionalism. It's fun if you have a good skill set in people skills."
good,Was a good company to advance.  Company has changed a lot over the years.  Seems like they got away from caring about the customer an all about how to reach the sales goals. Can be very stressful and people start turning on each other.  As a leader you are expected to put work first and family second.

Lots of training enrichment, leadership opportunities, and career navigation for those with long term vision for staying with a company.  Terrific benefits and enlightened HR policies.  Supportive to families.  Compensation is generally below market value with increasing responsibilities, but offset by benefits and (mostly) job security.  A leader in financial services industry."
good,"Depending on the area of the bank and the management, working for the bank can be very challenging however; if you happen to work for a professional that is flexible it can be a wonderful experience.  There are training components every quarter that you will have to make a score of 80% or above to pass the course which will be documented in your review.  I had a wonderful team to work with in the various areas of the bank. "
good,"Frequent changes in management strategies leading to unhappy situation. Unprofessional treatment by few senior managers. Place is full of long standing senior people, who act like monarchs."
good,"Typical day at work is getting the job done with team work"
good,"Bank of America was a very good company to work with the possibility of growing"
good,I learned about business and consumer credit cards as well as Consumer Banking. I assisted consumer and business customers with payments and agreements on their accounts.

good,"The hours are great, the benefits, even as a part-time associate, were great, and they show appreciation to their associates by giving little things like tickets to games. Moving up in the company is not hard as long as you work like you have that in mind."
good,I have learned alot being their. Training is not great and management does not not speak up for you.  Schedule has been flexible.  They do not promote within the company.
good,"Bank of America has a good corporate culture.  The working environment is great.  I was able to work from home full time for almost four years.  This granted great flexibility of schedule.  The pay at BofA is also very good.  However, BofA job security is less than desired at times.  I have had many friends laid off over the years."
good,"I loved Bac it was just time for a fresh start with a new company and to make more money."
good,"Great place to work and grow in the Financial Industry.  I have gained so much experience working with others, building relationships and managing systems and processes."
good,"Challenging place to learn, grow, and deal with constant change.  Great coworkers but management can be a challenge to deal with.  After years of mergers/acquisitions, the company is in desperate need of updating its systems but is unwilling to make the necessary investments until regulators force their hand.  Challenging environment that I find fulfilling but constant reorganization attempts leave everyone worried about being the victim of the next round of layoffs."
good,Worked at Bank of America and legacy banks for 24 years. Lots of opportunities early on and great work/life balance. Economic crisis of 2008 had a negative impact and eventually resulted in my position being eliminated in 2016. I mostly had great managers who mentored me and guided me. Had the misfortune of ending up working in Boston for management based in Dallas and I believe that had an impact on my departure. I would recommend Bank of America as a place to grow and gain experience.

good,Was able to learn a lot from people with varying experience. I learned about how different teams operate and how they assist clients in achieving their goals. The hardest part of the job was identifying what more I could do to help the team
good,"My day is fast paced, there is little time for co-workers or associate connections, only a hello and good bye. There is no time between calls. I multi-task between 4 to 10 systems to investigate information from all callers. Most of my time is spent with cardholders resolving credit card issues about blocked cards.  The rest of my time is about reporting fraud claims.  If time is managed well and also accurate, there is potential chance of a bonus. "
good,I work as a satellite employee in my group supporting 7 lines of business as a data steward and liaison.  My typical day is attending four or five meetings by phone discussing IT and data projects that are being worked on to improve overall performance of ow my client's business processes' function.
good,"Overall Bank of America (BoA) was the best employer in my job history. I worked with a lot of great people in a professional and generally friendly environment. Being that it was corporate headquarters (Charlotte NC) the number of employees you may interact with is large. Due to this, plus the geographic dispersion of the workforce and the frequent management re-organizations (count on at least once or twice a year) it is not the place to foster a tight, well integrated team over the long term.But there is a lot of opportunity to move laterally across the different functional areas of the bank."
good,"On  a daily basis we are required to complete our exceptions report which could be from 10 pages to 300 pages based on the day of the week. Review, research, and make adjustment to corporate accounts. Monitor and update escheatment item.  Locate review GL account for adjustments to the banks and clients accounts. Covering and assisting my teammates when they are out sick or on vacation which can sometimes be the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that we work as a team and function like a family."
good,"* fast paced"

good,"A good place to learn and improve one's professional skills, a good work culture and friendly nature with colleagues. overall a very good experience."
good,"Working for Bank of America will prepare you for any work environment. Training  is second to none. I enjoyed my tenure at Bank of America. I loved my customers and always found pleasure in helping my clients achieve their personal goals. The hardest part of the job was the constant change; however, change meant an opportunity. Management had a lot of turnover.  Constant change but one learns to adapt."
good,"The Wilmington De site is very nice and comfortable. Nice working areas, clean, spacious. People are friendly and seem to have a nice work/home balance."
good,"Great environment, leadership, flexibility.  However, layoffs based on undisclosed criteria are far too frequent.  Rationale for selection of layoff candidates does not seem to have any rhyme nor reason."
good,"A typical day for me starts of with a quick rundown of my inbox.  We have our daily stand-up at 9:30.  Some days I have meetings in the morning, otherwise I am able to get some development done.  Our work flow process is in the form of JIRA's that are picked up and worked on following an AGILE strategy.  Additionally we have large items for which we form teams and are given a set period of time, in my case, 4 months for the first AngularJS applications we built, and 5 months for the second AngularJS / Scala application we build, which I am still currently working on to move to production.  My coworkers are a pleasure to be around and our domain is relatively flat in the sense that everyone is easily approachable, regardless of their title. The hardest part of the job would be that there are times where the job becomes stale on a day to day basis because of redundancies in application support and a lack of java items to be worked on.  The most enjoyable part of my job, being my first industry job, is the amount of knowledge that I am able to absorb from the long time professionals that still work here."
good,"Excellent work culture, great support from management,recognise people for their hard work."
good,"Nice benefits like sodexo card, cab facility, etc.."
good,"I was very disappointed with this position, when I was finally hired they were in the process of down sizing which means a lot of employees really were down and unsure."

good,"Every Day was starting with assisting customers on their daily needs and once the issue was taking care of, I was looking for any opportunity that the customer might be benefit of having it in her life. Very fast-paced atmosphere which sometimes I did not know how times were passing by. I have learned about time management and working under pressure without losing my temper which is a great experience for me."

good,"Good company to work, learning along with fun at work. Got opportunities to migrate few process and meet new people and lean new things. Which help to improve my self."
good,"during my time with bank of america i learned a lot. One of their number one priorities is that all associates are well educated in debt about the area they will be working on. They offer Additional advanced learning through their CBTs programs for anyone who would like to learn beyond what they do daily. Depending on the department you work, they also allow paid volunteer time to all associates. Great way to contribute to the community. Overall its a great company to work for."
good,I was selected many times to lead projects which gave me the opportunity to learn multiple functions and participate with many groups and how a position all comes together.
good,The days were similar however never the same. Everyday was a new experience. We provided excellent customer service while receiving and redistributing cash efficiently. 360 coaching which helped everyone become better. I learned various sales techniques that I can use throughout my career.

The hardest part was when we became a contractor for BOA. Co workers were like family, you spend most of your time with them then your own family. The most enjoyable part was when we became Mortgage"

good,"Merrill Edge is growing at a rapid pace.  There is a lot of opportunity for advancement.  Since they are growing so fast, they are in need of experienced leaders and managers."
good,"This was the most challenging job I have encountered in my work history due to the uncertainty of the job itself. The company was going through a lot of changes and financial difficulties. So, from day to day we as employees didn't know what to expect or what would change from month to month."
good,Very good job got started when i was 19 but dont work full time if your going to school. job also has alot of gaols so get use to a manager on your back about every thing.
good,"It's a large financial organization, so change is slow, growth is stagnant, and there's a consistent fear of layoffs.  However, there are great people who work there, generally management wants to do the right thing, and no matter where you work, it can always be worse, and it can always be better."
good,Global company that is a leader in the financial services industry. Provided industry knowledge and work/life balance.
good,"A great place to work, if you are focused and dedicated to the mission.  Great people to work with.  Management expects people to step up and accept responsibility to get the job completed.  New opportunities occur almost  daily making for a dynamic environment."

good,"Depending on Financial Center, plent of work and tons of regulatory information and procedure."
good,"Gained valuable knowledge about the financial industry by conversing with employees, attending meetings, working on projects, and simply observing day-to-day activities."
good,As an Inbound Associate I learned a lot about Home Equity. Benefits are great. Potential to grow within the company once you have you foot in the door.
good,"I was lucky to have the opportunity to work from home for many years, but this is something no longer being offered frequently. The team became family and everyone worked toward a common goal, but constant management changes made it difficult to maintain an exceptional work environment."
good,Enjoyed working there and the people were always very helpful but was too limited in changing shift hours and only two ways to get a raise.  Yearly or getting hired to a new position.
good,"My shift starts at 7 am to 4 pm. I worked for Bankruptcy department. My main course was working with Attorney. Dealing with bankruptcy cases, like Chapter 7, 13. When Debtors don't make their Mortgage payments on time or late... that's when we file Motion For Relief. During the time that I was working there, I learned to be patient with Customers and help them out as much as possible. Hence, I really enjoyed working for Bank of America. Everyone in my department are friendly. We work together as a great team!! Getting work done and accurately. The hardest part in my career was getting laid off, I thought this career was forever...but I guess it went down since the Bank's loss so much money on Mortgage business. Everything went upside down."
good,The department I am in with Bank of America truly is supportive of Men and Women with family. Recognition is truley apart of Bank of america values.
good,"Good place to work, good potential for advancement.  The benefits are par with other large organizations and the culture is a positive on for the most part."
good,"Bank of America is focused on developing deep relationships with customers by learning their needs and offering real solutions to their needs. "
good,"You need to be knowledgeable, supportive, have initiative, sense of urgency, lead by example and then inspect what you expect."
good,I enjoyed working here. I was so upset that they laid us off. I would've still been thre if it wont for that big lay-off I 2003.
good,quality and productions not hard to meet if stayed focused ; co -workers supported one another; enjoyed working and networking with other business partners
good,"Use to learn something new everyday."
good,"It was a fun fast paced place to work. We focused on the customers and put them first over everything. I would audit documents and file them answer phone calls and transfer them to the correct person or department as needed, as well as taking care of their banking needs. I truly enjoyed this job because we were busy and we still made sure we had fun. We had a great team of people who supported and kept each other focused on giving the best customer service possible. This job was never dull because I learned something new every day. I have a strong passion for the operational side of things, which I got to explore as well. I got to help train and coach associates. The part of the job I didn't like was how much turn over there was and how we always seemed to be short staffed. We always made the best of it and gave outstanding customer service but it was trying at times. Im excited to start a new adventure."
good,"Loved working for Bank of America. The overall culture was great including employee guidance for future advancements. "
good,The job is easy and the people are nice and have been in the department for years so they have a lot of knowledge. Alot of places to eat for lunch since it's downtown. Mainly alot of seasoned employees not a lot of younger people.
good,"I never thought that I would pursue a career in Banking however, I learned a lot of skills that helped me become the person I am today. I enjoyed working for Bank of America it paved the way for me to advance my career in other fields as well as Banking. My hours were 7:30 am to 4:30 pm which I loved. It allowed me time to attend school in the evening time. I loved the fact that they had daycare & tuition reimbursements. The benefits with Bank of America were very good. The hardest part of the job was getting laid off because the entire department was outsourced. I loved all my co-workers like they were family. On a typical I would check the supply list to see if any supplies needed to be ordered. I would check for faxes, voicemail, email. I would check to make sure the visitor's log was completely filled out. Then I would also check to see if there were any customer discrepancies that needed to be researched. I would make my rounds greeting all my co-workers and managers. The managers were nice I just wished they invested more time into getting to know their employees on a more personal level so that the employees felt needed and that they were important. I also wished the managers knew how to physically know how to do the work that they were assigning to the employees instead of only knowing the what the procedures state."
good,Company was a decent place to work. The staff was great and enjoyable to work with. The opportunity for advancement was not too good. Helping customers was rewarding
good,"I am a top performer and I like my job. I have an awesome team and great benefits. Management rating depends on who you get as a manager. I have had wonderful managers and not so wonderful managers. My manager has been changed 5 times in 3 years and 3 of those changes have just been in 2015. I feel as though job security and advancement opportunities also depended on the manager at the time. If you are a single parent or the main parent raising your child the schedules available are unlikely to be what you need and despite what you are promised when you are hired, the schedules are not easy to change later."
good,"The BOA Greensboro site is a great place to work. I learnt allot about world class customer service and the company did help develop my leadership skills. The only bad thing I have to say about the Greensboro site is that advancement opportunities are rare for the department I worked in (Call Center environment).  To be specific, I wasn’t able to post out to the other departments or gain the managerial skills I desired.  Overall, I would rate BOA 3 ½ out of 5 stars because of the efforts the company makes to keep team moral up, recognition programs,  monthly incentives and the  pride I have for working with a company that sincerely gives back to its community as it relates to volunteerism and donations."
good,"I was only there as a temporary fill so I didn't to experience the full benefits of a Merill Lynch associate."
good,daily check in with group and rally before start of day. Had to be accurate for every transaction. I learn a lot from this line of work. the most difficult part was standing almost 8 - 9 hours a day with very little break time to rest the legs.
good,You get to work with clients from all walks of life helping them with reviewing their financial goals and retirement. Its all based on sales numbers and your success will depend on the branch you are assigned to cover.
good,Bank of America helped me professional grow and develop my leadership and business knowledge.  There are a lot of opportunities that exist but might require you to re-locate to a different market.  I loved the people I worked with and in most cases Senior Management was amazing.  Expect a lot of change within the organization.
good,Productive place to work.  Great benefits. Continuous training.  Shift hours available and lots of overtime.  Diverse community
good,"Good for a large company - moving more towards doing more for less so pay is pretty bad and does not match their expectations for quality. Good management overall but HR is not great. If you are a manager, they just take any word from an employee and you are guilty first then have to prove your innocent. I felt like I was a criminal for a false accusation but had no support from HR at all."
good,I really enjoyed my internship with this company and learned a great deal.  The managment was knowledgeable and professional.  It was a great learning experience and gave me insight into how markets work.
good,"Good place to work , the people are nice and will challenge you to be the best. The culture is very diverse and everyone works together to get things accomplished."
good,Two different systems needed to provide customer service for internal/external employees. It was ok until management wanted to merge other teams duties on the floor to the safe deposit box team. Now the whole site is no longer located in the state. They consolidated the department & moved it to Kansas.
good,Nice Company. Work Life balanced. Promotion in the company is very tough if u dont have good repo with manager. Frequent Org changes hamper too much to band 6 and 7 employees.
good,Nothing to add.  Retired but not fully willingly as area of business began cutbacks.  I was working from home for 10 years and all telecommuters were not offered additional employment without relocation.
good,"I worked there for almost 10 years and had a great run. It is a typical large financial services company and the leaders who work there have large egos too. There is a ton of inefficiency (as you would suspect with any large company) and the culture has changed to more of a ""kill or be killed"" mentality."
good,"Overall, if you like a high stress level, always changing this is the place. The leadership team tries to add perks like ice cream socials and other activities but you are still responsible for getting things accomplished even if your day had interruptions."
good,Good firm. Has great tools and focuses on goals based wealth management planning. Merrill Lynch is a great firm and has tools and resources to manage your book of business effectively.
good,This was a very good learning experience but the branch where I worked (Houston Galleria) had me working more domestically than internationally and I am always looking for opportunities that let me leverage my language and photographic memory skills.  I speak 8 languages and love building international sales channels and building sales teams all around the world.
good,"Getting my day started by organizing my tasks in the morning as to priority: I learned to stick to my plans that are important in order for me to get all my duties done.  "
good,Call Center environment.  Learned exceptional listening skills & call buffering skills.  Management very busy but helpful.  Co workers funny but very professional.  The hardest part of the job is the most enjoyable part of the job giving superior customer service externally & internally.
good,"good place to work, room for growth, company advancement. plenty of support from senior management, a one team atmosphere, mean all partners work together to assist our clients,"
good,"The Bank has become very metric driven over the last two years, I had a piece of that as I rolled out some metric tracking initiatives.  As with other employers, employees are asked to do more with less and cost cutting is a large focus."
good,Very fast pace work enviornment. Can be stressful at times. The hours are inconvenient and senority does not matter anymore.
good,Everyone is nice and professional.  Moving up within the company can be a challenge at times.  Overall it is a good place to work and improve your career.
good,"While I was laid off, the company is still a very favorable place to work.  the culture was diverse and open communication for most management levels."
good,Challenging but lucrative and rewarding career. It is fast paced environment. Team setting is ideal and most of my co workers are professional and are very friendly.
good,There will be plenty of opportunity to learn and grow. You will work with highly skilled professional colleagues. You will need to be a good prioritizer and multi-tasker.
good,Work life balance isn't too bad for most of the teams. Room for career advancement.The senior management is sharp and well informed but some of the day to day managers are lacking knowledge to lead teams.
good,"I enjoyed this opportunity. "
good,Middle management is solid and have a good idea for how to let employees work with minimum supervision. Very few opportunites to advance within the department.
good,"overtime was available"
good,"My years in Bank of America were filled with lots of learning. A typical day would be of 9 hours at work which involved supervising and training few associates, processing loan documents as well as auditing and quality checks on different processes, My co workers were a cooperative lot and management was good too. The hardest part of the job was auditing other associates for six sigma quality. Work environment was a friendly one."
good,"Unfortunately, if you work in a sales role, everything changes every 3 months as far as pay and hours.  Also, new upper management is streamlining different roles into one position, so you will be doing 2 separate jobs at the same time, sales and customer service."
good,"I am responsible for the administration of a monthly incentive program for a line of business within Bank of America. Each month I would have a ""adminstration"" period in which I would focus solely on managing the incentive process and certifying the the amounts to be paid to the associates were correct based on the sales data available.  When this period is over, I would then shift my focus to creating and updating reports on performance metrics so that the line of business executives would know how the plan design is affecting associates performance.   I would also monitor a ticket queue into which questions could be submitted regarding incentive the plans and processes. I would be responsible for researching those requests and responding back to the submitter in a timely fashion.  I am able to work from home and am trusted by my managers to perform my duties with minimal supervision."
good,"The hardest part of my job is putting 9-10 hours of work in an 8 hour day. My biggest challenge is working the number of exception tickets that I receive each day. I process on an average 45 tickets per day, then trying to work in analytical work such as next days analysis for capacity vs. call volume per interval. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting all of my work completed each day. Working on analytical projects and seeing them implemented and become successful. Working analysis for the next day showing call volume by intervals along with capacity and after the next days business seeing that my projections were accurate. Having the executive leadership team notice my work and having trust in my work. Another enjoyable part of my job is creating schedules for schedule bids and having associates bid on them timely and successfully."
good,"Being one of two personal bankers was always busy. "
good,Bank of america was a nice job i really enjoyed the time and the people there the only problem i had was there was no room for advancement
good,"While I love my job, I have always considered myself an operations and customer service professional, not a sales person. Daily I interact with multitudes of customers ranging from paycheck-to-paycheck clients to million dollar business owners.In addition, I work with my team to maintain organizational and compliance standards. I have learned how to be a productive part of a team while maintaining individual goals. The hardest part of my job is doing the right thing for the customer but having to think about how it impacts my sales goals as well. I love my team and will be remiss to leave them but we are all heading on different paths, many of which are leading away from the branch-banking life."
good,"My department was created to clean up mess created  by mortgage crisis so positions were specialized and did not lead to any growth within the company. The job entailed a considerable amount of repetitive research and was production focused, however as time went on and the mortgage crisis was ending  it became clear our days were numbered and an atmosphere of tension developed. Management was very understanding about this and did their best to prepare us for the inevitable. I learned a great deal about all aspects of the mortgage industry in a general sense."
good,"14 years of continued development and preserving excellent products that meet customer needs. Worked with world class diverse talent associates that enables us to deliver high quality products and services.  I've learned how to be flexible to work with complex and team-spirited environment wherein every member of the group is given encouragement to participate, get the support they need and share each other's end results."
good,A typical day at Bank of America included processing findings for potential loan approvals.  I thoroughly enjoyed the call centers friendly and positive moral. I found however the most challenging part of this position to be conversion from a part time employee to a full time employee.
good,"Good company, ability to move up if you are well liked. Management isn't really clued in to knowing all of their staff. A lot of people work their entire career there and creativity isn't really embraced."
good,"I learned a lot about the mortgage industry and how unstable can become. I had wonderful management and my co-workers were great as well. The hardest part about my job was leaving but it was also the most enjoyable because of the continuous layoffs going on. The morale of the company has fallen. Although I was happy to leave, I am glad I was able to work there and gain so much knowledge within the business."
good,"- typical work day consists of email requests, day to day processes, and resolving issues."
good,"I've enjoyed my ten years at Merrill.  I'm able to use my education and experience from previous employment, and enjoy good salary and work life balance."
good,"Great Company with great benefits"
good,fun work environment with friendly co-workers and management team. Daily audit and assisting team manger to stay in compliance with legal notifications.
good,"Bank of America has the best treasury services available.  Customer Service struggles at times but overall they provide very good services,"
good,"At Bank of America, our purpose is to help connect our customers and clients to what matters most to them. Every day, we’re proud to partner with 57 million individuals, businesses, and communities, bringing them our skills and expertise to help make their financial lives better."
good,"If you have career ambition, but not at the cost of family life, this company is ideal.  Decent (not great, not bad) benefits."
good,"A typical day for me begins at 6 am ,in a production environment I've advance as far as I can go the hardest part of my job is working every weekend.the most enjoyable part is the extra things I have learned , we have and excellent on the job training program."
good,"Getting to work at 6AM, checking my emails, voicemails, make a to do list, and follow-up on any calls or emails from the day before. After getting myself organized, I would start going through my portfolio make calls and send emails to resolve any violations or complaints made on a property."
good,"Bank of America is a generous employer.  You have the ability to improve your position, knowledge and training through their online Learning program.  Room for advancement is limited to the departments in which positions are available, as all departments do not have advancement opportunities.  Overall, a great employer."
good,"Good Company, Not much to learn and repetitive same task"
good,"Every one worked well together. I learned a lot of great things at BOA, overall the people I worked with were really great. Management could use more attentive skills to learning how the process of work go versus just giving directions and not actually knowing how the process goes."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Bank of America. I was given the privilege of tele-commuting which turned out, for me, to be a wonderful blessing. I was able to learn a great deal from a fantastic group of peers. We all pitched in to help each other out in many circumstances."
good,"Structured project environment"
good,"You will work harder than you ever have before, but there are some great benefits.  Lots of room for advancement and career growth, but can be difficult when you are looking into other lines of business."
good,My day to day employment at bank of america was good. I have gain  knowledge of the company and also the use of the different systems used. Management was good and helpful at times. My co-workers were great. The don't think the job was hard at all because if it was something that I  didn't know or understand we would get the proper training. The most enjoyable was being with a company so long and being with the people that i have worked with.
good,"Great place to work, learned a lot while there. Great pay/benefits. Enjoyed troubleshooting the library hardware and serving as instructor for our department."
good,"A typical day in the office is reviewing operational management routines: production, accuracy, timeliness, inventory and aging.  Tremendous work has been completed in terms of regulatory hurdles and compliance to ensure quality of process has positive impact on investors, executive leaders and customers."
good,The group I spent most of my time with at the bank did a good job of considering work/life balance and making sure the voice of their employees was always heard.  Great teammates who made the work day enjoyable.
good,"it is a good place to work, good culture, compensation, learn a lot."
good,"A typical day at work includes taking client calls or written correspondence and following through on their requests. Those requests may be to request discretionary money, research of transactions, or investment questions. Additionally, a typical day included reviewing accounts to ensure they were being administrated according to document provisions. Reviewing accounts to ensure there were no overdrawn balances and to correct any overdrafts as appropriate."
good,"Share your dreams and go far. The culture at BoA is great. You will learn about the customers in your community and build relationships and trust with the brand of BoA side by side with you. The co-workers help create a family oriented atmosphere full of exciting competitiveness. The hardest part of the job can be the high turnover rate due to numerous promotions within and transfers to different markets to excel. Yes the company comes with great opportunities but with those opportunities also comes a lack of organization and miscued steps to fill those positions left behind. The most enjoyable part is the education you share with the customers you have come accustomed to build a relationship with. They truly begin to feel like cousins, uncles, aunts and part of an extended family that you feel obligated to share every piece of knowledge you know with them. The smiles you get and the stops by the bank just to bond are the greatest part. On numerous occasions customers would say hey i was in the area and just wanted to stop by and see you and catch up. Those moments when you go on vacation and you come back to sentimental notes left by customers saying they missed you and how was your vacation."
good,"I have been a dedicated associate for 22+ years which in itself speaks highly of the company. Bank of America offers a competitive salary and many excellent benefits including tuition reimbursement, child care assistance, medical, dental, vision, and life insurance. When layoffs are necessary Bank of America does very well in re-deploying associates to other areas of the bank before just letting them go."
good,"I have been working for Bank of America for 2.5 years and continuously strive to understand the Curtailment process through all the new changes and new system updates. My goal is to achieve/maintain 100% accuracy, meet and/or exceed my production requirements, and become a top performer on my team. I have received 3 Silver awards this year for Loss Prevention within the Curtailment Appeals process."
good,"Great experience in learning and skill building, but not a place that builds security.  Wonderful peers and management that allows a great deal of support.  Professional attitude instilled. Location was beautiful, and it led to productivity in the work place."
good,"A typical day will be reviewing products, preparing the day ahead, make phone calls, interact with great people. The best part was celebrating the successes with coworkers. They closed the department and I had to move on."
good,"Underwriting 5-7 mortgage loans per day"
good,"Long hours and constant management of internal resources (Legal, Credit, Audit, Compliance, back and middle office) and client expectations and ad-hoc situations 24/6 internationally.  Worked with many significant money managers, hedge funds and CTA's.  Managed 20+ people in multiple offices.  Enjoyed managing a cohesive highly motivated group of individuals.  Hardest part of the job was extensive travel with time away from my family."
good,This was a call center environment. I managed a team of up to 25 associates. A typical day was coming in and making sure that all associates were adhering to their schedule and remaining compliant with education and the policies and procedures of their role. Once a week I met with my manager and my peers to put together a game plan as well as give a pulse check of each teams current performance. I then went on to manage the ability of my team and motivate them through my findings in reporting as well as forecasting where we have the ability to end the shift. The hardest part of the job was motivating all of the associates based on what is important to them while remaining focused on what is important to the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was not only accomplishing that task but being recognized for such an important accomplishment.
good,"Everyday was a busy day in the life of loan Modification"
good,"They set you up for failure. I worked there for 8 years. If the benefits weren't so good, I would have left a long time ago. The make sales goals ridiculously high and yell at you and threaten your job constantly."
good,"Heavy in-bound and out-bound call center activity was the norm. My primary function was first party collection's on luxury recreational vehicles, boats, and air planes. Assisting customers in either negotiating payment of delinquent account or surrendering of collateral to the bank. Performing various loan modifications and extensions to assist customer's in the resolution of their delinquent accounts in lieu of repossession. Assist fellow co-workers in closing talk off and collection of payment's."
good,"The majority of my experience at Bank Of America has been good.  I have learned a great deal about Operations Risk, BASEL, Capital Modeling, and honed my skills as a leader, program manager, and project manager.  Where things have fallen down is around defined career growth, evaluations, and bonus."
good,Excellent work life balance including remote work from home for certain positions
good,"I learned a lot about the workplace environment, managing my time, enhancing my attention to detail. I built a foundation in mortgage with a background in all loan types."
good,"This workplace had amazing benefits, just not the best job security because of being in the mortgage/banking business."
good,Solid company to work for.  More opportunities for advancement in metro areas of the country.  Solid training programs and benefits designed at furthering your career.  Outstanding tuition reimbursment program.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Bank of America. Unfortunately the bank shut down our division and let most employees go. I was provided a new job within the bank, but it was not a position I was familiar with and not too interested in."
good,I support compliance programs and processes within the GTO group. I have learned to lead from where I am by supporting my leaders and my teammates. The best part of the job is assisting the customer and to do all that I can to ensure the customer obtains a great customer experience.
good,"Sales/Goal oriented position, However. goals set are reasonable to achieve.  Big bank who offers a wide variety of avenue to advance into."
good,"Conducted financial research for consultants."
good,"If I decide that I do not want to share anything beyond what I shared in the comments, why is it critical that I share ""10,000 words or more"" or else I not be able to move past this point? I would love to know the critical nature of sharing every detail about my work experience with any organization especially considering any other work experiences already posted here I - like many others -  will NOT read it as it is the reflection and personal experience of others who may or may not have left/be leaving the organization for a myriad of reasons and as such are subject to post both good AND equally poor reviews of their experience."
good,A professional environment were everyone was working together as a team. I learned how easy/complicated tax documents can be. the management there was also great it made me feel very comfortable.my coworkers were also very easy and fun to work with mainly because it was a lot of them in my age group
good,"Overall ok company to work for. Oversee tellers (balances, order money, vault custodian, etc)."
good,my typical day would be to answer calls regarding customer issues managers were ok depending on who you spoke with some were there to help others not so much
good,"Productive and research, customer support environment, various work assignment with customer satisfaction."
good,Overall a company that is ideal for advancement in the financial industry.
good,I enjoyed working at Bank of America; the managers were friendly and knowledgeable. I learned a lot in the position of Foreclosure Specialist; and had wonderful co-workers.  There was a lot of reading and reviewing in this job but I didn't mind.  Most enjoyable part of job was getting to know all of the wonderful people I worked with.
good,"Great place to work for compensation wise. Flexible with approved time off, enabled me to attend to family business and allowed me to make up lost time, so that it did not affect my take home pay."
good,"Company is good to work for. For the most part, employees are very professional. Management is hit and miss."
good,"I enjoyed the mathematical  part of appraising real estate.  Also liked enjoying my colleagues.  I also liked working with the data programs, analyzing data, enter into the computer, then add objective text to determined value.  I also like the autonomy to take the necessary time to be accurate whether it is unique which takes a little longer or those that fall right in to place and are completed at no time at all."
good,"My work day was typically 12+ hours with escalation resolution, back to back meetings with peers, clients and business partners.  I also spent time with my direct reports to increase morale across the team."
good,Management set very clear goals within this company. Working for this company you know what is expected of you and you are rewarded for doing just that.
good,"Great benefits, Going through a lot of changes at the moment. Good work life balance. Decent pay, hard to advance though."
good,"Everyday opens with me facilitating a 9 am production meeting. Quality, client concerns, and daily goals are discussed. A spreadsheet of the quality of prior workday is compiled and reviewed daily for Dallas, Boston and Atlanta sites. Speaking with client representatives and clients daily to ensure we are meeting their needs and rectifying any issues. I engage our project management team to make sure new systems will accommodate the needs of clients. If not implementing alternatives to make sure the needs of the clients are met."
good,"Sign Officer of Foreclosure Documents, Reviews and Approves Legal Foreclosure Documents"
good,"a typical day at work"
good,This job was a challenge for me . Management was great and it was a positive workplace
good,"a typical day at Bank of America for me is Settling loans that have had a modification on their mortgage loan with Freddie Mac. I've learned several things about the settlement process with Freddie Mac including but not limited to how to enter loans into the Freddie Mac Bypass system, how to submit loans into WorkOut Prospector, send LMTW's, how to clear Doc Defects and reading the WorkOut Manager. Management and co-worker have been great. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendships I've gained. The hardest part of the job is leaving. I have really enjoyed working and getting to know how Bank of America works. They are one of the best places I've worked. convenient"
good,"Worked from Home the last 3 years.  Logged in and worked out of several ticketing systems on various platforms, interacted extensively with co-workers and other department associates to resolve issues covering everything to logon issues, security, access provisioning \ de-provisioning, account creations, group creations, share creations, applied permissions and various other tasks or projects. Had supportive managers\supervisors who were very helpful.  Had great co-workers and were easy to work with and enjoyed working from home but did miss the social interactions at times although we did manage to get together occasionally for the folks who lived in the Dallas area."
good,"Customer service, daily interacting with customers. Learned how to use different type of bank products. Co-workers are nice. Hardest part of the job is trying to cover sales. Not all customers accept, so it gives me a bad rating. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers get what they need."
good,"My time at Bank of America has truly been a great work experience, I have truly been blessed to have the coworkers that i have had , its been a great environment to grow, we helped we each other grow as professionals through constructive coaching and through the hardships that we all know banks have through certain seasons of the year. most enjoyable part of the job for me is knowing that I was there to help that customer when all other banks were closed or when they couldn't help them with their problem and I was able to find a solution and made it even productive for them."
good,"Bank of America on a typical day is fairly routine. You arrive, set up your station, and assist clients. Despite the job being a little monotonous I have gained a lot of knowledge about how financial institutions run a business and all the federal policies and procedures that need to be abided by. Something I have learned about myself is that I am far more organized and better at multitasking that I thought. Everyone I have worked with is very respectful and always a team player. The hardest part of the job will vary for everyone, but mine personally was pushing credit cards and accounts on customers. Pushing products just makes me uncomfortable. The most enjoyable part of the job are the relationships you build with customers."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy for me because of the shift that I worked.  The calls were back to back.  Very intense were most of the calls that required detail documentations.  What I learned working in the customer service department with B of A is that daily I had to come in with a calm and pleasant attitude because most of the people I spoke with were literally on the verge of a financial break down and did not want a challenge they wanted assistance and understanding.  I was fortunate to have had 6 of the best managers bank of america had to offer. They kept the job alive with contest and challenges that allowed us to do our job and to compete with awards. The teams I were on had various backgrounds and everyone utilized each persons strengths to assist them.  The hardest part of the job for me was the limits that were assigned to me.  Although I may have the answer that a customer needed, if it was not within the scope of my position I would have to pass it on and cause additional concern to the customer.  The most enjoyable part of my job was having customers call back and  request to speak with me to make sure everything they needed was completed."
good,Work/life balance varied from time to time depending on demands.  Learned a lot.  Worked with good people.
good,"MBNA Marketing Systems, now BOA was a great place to work. Great potential for career advanced and financially rewarding! Towards the end, goals were set at unattainable and became too overwhelming."
good,"Clients are heavily assisted throughout the mid morning being assisted with financial reviews. Teller assistance maintains providing cash, bank checks and also other services for clients. I've learned that everyone is not the same and have different problems. Each customer shall walk out with what they've came for and a smile. Management also provides fast and assuring assistance for transactions and services throughout the day. Co-workers often work together to achieve monthly sales and operational goals. The most challenging part of the day comes once an average work day is over. Clients need more assistance even in a more crowded, fast pace environment. I enjoy customers that are happily welcomed to come back for our service. No matter how difficult a situation is we are here to help them each step of the way."
good,"The position that you come in as may not be the position that you stay in. Like I said before, there is also changes going on within the bank. One you get a taste of another department its makes it so much harder to get adjusted to the previous department that you came form."
good,"10 minutes before opening the branch we always had a briefing in which we planned the day ahead, this location had a busy foot traffic so it was very important to be brief and management was always there to assist us and to show us different ways to have a conversation with the customer and be more effective by managing time more properly."
good,"This was my first years at Bank of America.  I had great management.  There no fear at that time about lay offs or so many changes .  The programs we offered were simple and we were able to approve them  We wrote the contracts and handled the files from the beginning to the end which included posting the funds. "
good,"A typical day at work was extremely busy and demanding.  I had from 100-500 files in different stages of work out programs to help homeowners with difficulty meeting monthly finances.  I would train my homeowners regarding what was needed, the time limit for me to receive it and how the programs worked.  I also counseled them on their financial situations and sometimes had to help them understand that it might be best to let their home go due to their situation.  I learned that these people were emotionally down and they needed a friend.  By being a friend they were most happy to send what I requested.  Management changed often which I felt was a negative. I also feel that many were not qualified to manage people. "
good,"A Day at work consist of answering call regarding mortgage. I learn everything dealing with home loans from escrow to taking payment."
good,Good Company To Work At. Great Leadership. I would recommend this company to work for.
good,"Great place to work and to learn."
good,"first career"
good,I do the same techniques every day. I learned how to deal with difficult customers
good,"As an underwriter/credit analyst this bank is very efficient and thorough with its' learning and training. They are very competent of the subject matter. The leadership team is also extremely efficient, helpful and realistic."
good,"its my first organisation  to start my Customer care carrier good learning, have learned many thing form my first job."
good,"a typical day at the bank would consist of sales, customer service, and looking for that one thing you could do for every customer.  it was my job to sale bank products to customers and refer to other lines of business.  i learned great communications skills, and i also learned how to sale to different types of individuals.  the works you get to know and the management you work under tend to be the best you'll ever work with.  the pressure might be there for sellers and management, but you get help along the way.  the most enjoyable part of the day is the people you work with and the relationships you make. the hardest part of the day for a personal banker is not meeting your sales goals."
good,Typically we have to process all return mail in a timely matter to meet all SLA deadlines
good,"Every day is a new day with new style of experience. Had improved my self personally & professionally, have learnt very new points about managing & handling the work. There are few people highly talented with good skills.The hardest part of the job is my last working day in the company & all other days when i was with the company are my most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"9-5 hours"
good,"My day began with opening procedures. Opening the vault and preparing cash drawers for the day. Giving customer great customer service. Also making deposits, withdrawals, and transfers for customers, and cash/coin orders for merchants. Providing customers with referrals to new account tellers for products the customer may need or be interested in opening. I enjoyed working with my manager and fellow team members. We were like a family. The hardest part of working with BofA was the inability to promote outside of the branch. Sometimes there would be up to 25 people applying for the same position. That was because open position were far and few between at that time."
good,Part of a team of motivated people who excelled in their work. Management created fun and an open environment for positive changes. The hardest part about the job was tackling the constant changes. The most enjoyable part was the teamwork atmosphere.
good,"At times, this job became somewhat stressful; however, the atimosphere was great, as well as the pay."
good,Enjoyable place to work.  Began my career as a Personal Banker and held several different roles including leadership roles.  Bank of America is sales and service driven with a customer centric focus.  All lines of business work together for the customer.
good,Reviewed post foreclosures for federal and state compliance.
good,Overall good company with support and each party responsible for his/her own job.  Guidelines etc. are available and systems are user friendly with a little training
good,"Bank of America was a great place to work. The managers were great to work with. They handled the managing and depended on associates to do the work. Being an associate and a coach gave me the opportunity to work with managers and associates. I had the opportunity to help associates who had difficulties with account, help them balance it and teach them at the same time. I won a trip to Hollywood, CA  for handling a difficult situation without having to involve a manager. With working in the banking business, I never knew if there was job security. The bank moved my dept. to Atlanta, GA. Probably the hardest part of the job was making sure everyone including myself met all deadlines. This part of the bank works with the Federal Reserve. I enjoyed the fellowship with managers and associates. I enjoy customer service and teaching others proper customer service."
good,Left Bank of America on maternity leave and decided not to return. And dedicate to college and my own business.
good,Overall a descent organisation to work with in a open environment
good,Bank of America is a good place to work as long as your schedule for home/personal time goes with what their plans are for you to work.
good,"Was great place to work for. Although lots of high pressure, local management cared for team members. Great possibility of advancement. Then upper management decided to close my small processing site in favor of large sites regardless of the fact our small site had the 2 top producing teams and multiple assurances that they would not close our site since they just hired 50+ new people a year earlier. Very disappointing!"
good,"Team player environment."
good,"Knowing that your customers are happy, being able to process their account carefully and them knoeing that it is kept confidential and given the best service."
good,Great place to gain experience. Bank of America works to redeploy instead of layoffs. I have had seven different roles in the five years I have been there.
good,"Overall, Bank Of America is a good company to work for.  Like Most companies, there are pros and cons.  Everyone's experiences will be different."
good,is You get to travel frequently to UK and Singapore to get involved in major projects and transitioning work from LOB
good,I enjoyed working for B of A the best thing was the environment is very professional and  always busy. Hardest part of the job is learning the system as thare are so many different system necessary to process work. Processes are not unified so that employees know what other departments do & how it all tied in together.
good,Big facility and many depts. to chose from. Diverse groups and people.
good,"Bank of America is a nice company to work for the benefits are great. I feel they are more concern about sales then they are of the well being of customers, Sale comes before anything. I am proud of the knowledge I received from the company and will carry it to my next employer, It was had to balance lifestyle and work."
good,"Management must determine and communicate clear and definitive goals to the Teams in order to achieve maximum performance.  Out workplace was dynamic and exciting as our Teams worked together in concert to achieve the defined Line of Business goals.  I would take the direction from senior Management and ensure that it was effectively communicated to the various Teams.  What helped me to grow both professionally as well as personally:  Communication and being Proactive."
good,"Although everyone in this office works very hard, the attitude and atmosphere is easy going and fun. The manager is one of the best I have ever worked for, always giving kudos to his staff and yet very humble about his great accomplishments. Your hard work and achievements are recognized and you look forward to coming to work. I will miss this place."
good,"It was indeed the best company to work with."
good,It was indeed a challenging environment to explore your skill set
good,"Great place to work!"
good,Good company to work if you get good appraisal. Keep your relation with higher management. Your work wouldn't be appreciated but your relation will be appreciated.
good,Good company to work for depending on what department you are in.
good,The company (BOA) overall is a great company to work for with a typical day consisting of multi-functions and tasks.  I have gained an extended amount of knowledge in the department.  I am able to process 98% of all tasks and departmental functions.  The management and co-workers are awesome. It is an enjoyable and very laid-back environment.
good,"Continuously learned to become more efficient therefore recognized as a ""go-to"" person.  Helped re-define myself which created strong interpersonal and communication skills."
good,Excellent company with amazing and talented professionals.  Great opportunity for growth.  Excellent benefits and training.
good,Work is challenging but rewarding.You are expected to start and end work on time and meet or exceed all goals. No room for errors. BofA has good employee 401k and medical benefit and it does offer good Vacation and sick leave plan.
good,The job itself is ever changing so there is always something new to look forward to.  My team leads and unit managers have always been great to work with and considerate when it comes to family life. I've learned to train others and to continuously think outside the box to problem solve. Upper management was always being rearranged so we went through several structural changes. The hardest part of this job was the uncertainty because our division has been slowly dissolving with layoffs almost monthly.  There was also no career path so they dangled a carrot in front of us for years and nothing came of it.
good,Its good work place.Learn so many technical stuffs like java/strruts/spring/Talend/iReport.
good,Goed bedrijf om voor te werken. Veel mogelijkheden tot doorgroeien. Weinig balans tussen prive en werk leven. Er werd van me verwacht dat ik 50-60 per week op mijn werk was.
good,"Each day is a challenge and fast paced. You may have to work on multiple deliverables at one time to meet deadlines."
good,There is  no plan for career advancement. Little opportunity to learn more and salary lower than others in the market.
good,"A typical day at work entailed loads of interaction with customers. I learned how to deal with different emotional demands of the customers. As far as management went, team leads were a huge help and co-workers were that in the truest sense as we joined the company together so we were in it together. "
good,Bank of America provides great benefits for it employees and there is room for advancement within the company.
good,"Working as a collector was a good experience, it was very educational and entertaining. A typical day at work is earning up to 10,000 dollars from customers in debt. I had incredible coworker who honestly and truly showed me what team work was all about. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I was not alone, no matter what the situation was, there was always someone around to help and I was also of help to my coworkers. We were a great team with a good management team."
good,"Great place to work, with great benefits as well.  This is a company with a long reputation of taking good care of their employees."
good,"Busy environment, learn a lot about the banking field. Co Workers work well as a team.Hardest part is trying to promote, the most enjoyable part is the co workers you get to know."
good,"Very helpful, positive guidance from managers"
good,"This environment is very challenging & dynamic environment, daily we will get challenging issues & support global customers."
good,company has good benefits and the mangers try to help. You have to work hard but you can move up.
good,"When I started at Bank of America, I felt it had so much to offer. The environment was wonderful and the work gave a good work/life balance. As I stayed with the company longer, there were tremendous cuts to positions and benefits that made me feel I wasn't appreciated as an employee. I have always gave my all because the company gave so much, but that really took away my moral and others associates as well. I hope this company can be as great as it once was. They have several seasons of massive layoffs - in my time of being with the company, my first position was outsourced to Mexico. The message of our position being terminated at that time was not handled in the best way by Senior Management, they had a large meeting with the entire contact center and stated our position was being outsourced as if they had attitudes about our position being terminated. We were told the cost of one associate in Mexico was equal to 2 and 1/2 US associates. It was not done in good taste at all. I was able to easily advance within the company to avoid the layoff but almost every co-worker I have has had to at some point migrated to another position to avoid a layoff."
good,Strict financial and foreign currency trade standards. Good management and great business colleagues.
good,"taking calls to help the customers with their banking needs."
good,As a part-time teller I was on the front line of the bank. I enjoyed the daily interactions with the customers and assisting them with information regarding products/services that may be beneficial to their accounts.
good,"Opened Banking Center Daily, with Duel Control, processed Night Drop bags, opened drive-thru by 8:00am.  Developed Customer relations daily, processed transactions, and multiple other duties."
good,"Currently assisting three independent investment financial advisor groups in all matters of client service. Prior assignment included three teams, one primarily dedicated to International Investment Management in Latin America."
good,Provide excellent customer service. Handle large volumes of money and other currency. Productive environment. Time management.
good,"It was busy, which I love.  Worked in a call center.  Assisted with existing Merrill Lynch employees benefits information. Extensive training.  Each day brought a new challenge with new questions. Managment was always flexible and there to assist.  Enjoyed all my co-workers and the always changing and learning of new HR policies.  Hardest part was the occassional irate employee.  Found it easy to calm them and get them the answer they want quickly."
good,I over all enjoy my employment here. Currently the company is down sizing (closing) some servicing depts.
good,"great pay, was able to advance, good company when i was there, enough hours to take care of the family, typical day taking incoming call from customer, making tranfers and cc payment, mortage rates quoates, cds rate."
good,"As a home loans closer I had a good jobs with decent pay and fantastic benefits (I got 12 weeks at full pay when my daughter was born, which was more than my wife got with her company). The workload fluctuated quite a bit, but was quite manageable most of the time. The management pretty much left you alone unless you asked for help, which was appreciated as it let me do my work at my pace without interruption. I did not find the job overly difficult though, which would probably be my main concern, and also led to me wanting to find something else within the company. Being in the mortgage business, the job market is very up and down, ultimately leading to the layoff of my building."
good,"It is good place to learn all those aspects of a large organization, in terms of process, but Bank is slow on the technology side just because of size of the organization. Most the time is spent on meeting as resources are across the globe but good exposure in terms of working with different folks, time zones, and culture. Every day is a new challenge and it is fun to take care of it."
good,"This job provided ample training, which allowed everyone the opportunity to be proficient. People are divided into teams which means people were able to recieve help easily or simply work individually."
good,"I was part of this team which was assembled to be the voice of the associates.  We were responsible for organizing leisure events for the site based on managements budget, bring attention to management any concerns that associates may have and make the site more delightfu and entertaining during special occasions.  This could be a powerful team if there was a large budget, if associate concerns were addressed and if it wasn't a call center environment cause due to the fact it wasn't a for profit department"
good,lots a career growth. lots of different job area that one could learn
good,"fast pace at times, lots of training, food day and team oriented"
good,Great job/work life balance.  Compensation is comparable to other companies.  Room for advancement within Banking Channel
good,"on a daily bases you were to communicate daily with home loan customers. Depending on the type of home loan product you were handling whether it be FHA Purchase, Refinances or other loan products, you could easily have a customer pipeline of anywhere from 10 to 30 borrowers. As you were communication with your borrowers, you were to show excellent customer service skills and to handle each loan as if it was your own home loan. I learn a lot from my management and co-workers because we worked together as a team and helped each other out. The hardest part of this job was making sure you following up constantly with your borrowers so that they could meet there deadline for there home loans. I really enjoyed working with the borrowers as well as working together as a team."
good,"Fun place to work  and very family oriented. Work volume fluctuate base on the state of the real estate market."
good,"We were required to work long hours to get the job done-to meet the monthly goals.  There was teamwork though within our department and we helped each other out, which made things easier."
good,Great environment to excel if you are ready to put in lots of hours..
good,"Became the SME for the monitoring tools of the system and led the testing of the third party vendors.  Became the goto person for the complicated projects"
good,n/a i will not like to discuss my work experience at this job.
good,"Very heavy foot traffic, sales oriented, job entailed premium service & sales"
good,"A day at Bank of America is not like I expected it to be. The work is tedious, the training is rough, and we were required to be at work at all costs. So things like weather, light sickness, traffic, and public transportation delays were not an excuse to miss work, or be late. There were strict policies and regulations to abide by within the banking center. Every day at work was rough, challenging, and high volume."
good,"It was great to work here, then they did the downsizing before trandering over to the new buidlings"
good,"An average day at work would be busy. From the second we sit at our desk the work begins until the second we leave. It is nonstop but in a positive environment where challenging projects are completed. As major projects are focused on, we also supported three departments that submit daily trouble shoot inquires or rush requests to finish the same day for them. Moreover, because of the busy and challenging days my skills grew stronger everyday."
good,"Fast paced environment, deadline driven, constant change, flexibility, worked with various associates in various capacities from senior level executives to lower level staff."
good,"A typical day would start almost immediately with getting in contact with any business partners who needed me while I was gone from the previous day. I learned to multitask with keeping in contact with up to 50+ business partners daily while maintaining goals and expectations of my work load. Management has an open door policy which makes the work day that much easier to manage. I would definitely have to say the best part of my day would be working with my co-workers. Everyone drives to achieve the same goals and we all work off of each other to meet the expectations of management as well as our clients. The hardest part of the job would have to be learning how to maintain control of fast paced and highly stressful situations. Keeping in mind that we must abide my state and government regulations, while working on closing on a home in less then an hour definitely could get stressful. All is worth it in the end when you know you assisted in helping a family out with purchasing their new home or selling their unaffordable home."
good,"good place to work, learned a lot about title and forclosure"
good,"This was a great place to work when I first got there and then it started to change so much, and change is good, but with them they could not make up there minds what they wanted to be and it got really just a really confusing place to be, and when rate's when back up the pressure to close people that didn't have a benefit to have the new rate increase."
good,"Great place to work. Very team oriented. Provides the opportunity to work with diverse and very intelligent people to solve interesting problems."
good,"The company has made a lot of progress since I started working there in 2009 to focus on improving in several areas like, career development, work/life balance and overall employee engagement.  Work is generally pretty structured from day to day, and the environment seems much more stable. The culture is business first, which isn't always a bad thing.  I would recommend this company."
good,"A typical day consisted of managing a pipeline of approximately 120-150 mortgage loans or 20-30 million in volume.  This consisted of keeping clients informed, while taking on new clients; in addition, getting the existing clients to a successful closing.   "
good,B of A is good to there employee but I wish the paid was better.
good,"Each day I monitor server activity and control batch jobs on mainframe and midrange systems.  I use a GUI for some functions and sign on directly to the systems with other functions.  I have learned how to free disk space on servers and use Mainframe commands to schedule batch jobs.  I have also learned all Microsoft Office products.  I have had several managers at this company and all have been very professional and fair.  I work all 40 hours in three days, so the hardest part is the long hours.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with a great group of people.  I am now interested in going from an Analyst II position to a Senior Analyst."
good,"Starting your career at a bank in one of its rotational programs is a great start! It offers great technical, leadership training and development for your career and provides a wealth of experience and opportunities."
good,Bank of America is a great place to be for someone who is sales oriented and looking to work they're way up in a company.

good,I enjoyed this position. Bank of America provides opportunity for growth.
good,"Sometimes your teammates were not located in your state. Takes away from the feeling of being part of a team."
good,Associates will get more chances to prove themselves and chances of improving the learning curve is high
good,"A typical day at work consisted of being a teller. I engaged with my clients and established long-lasting relationships with returning clients. I learned a lot about people's finances and how to assist them in finding better products or finding a better account to fit their financial needs. When I first started at Bank of America management was not the best, but I found ways to better my experience and my co-workers experience. We had to work hard together to help in the success of the company. The hardest part of my job was referrals, we had to have a certain percentage of products sold everyday whether it was a certain number of checking or savings accounts and/or credit cards. It's tough to get people to agree to new products or change the way they handle their finances. The most enjoyable part was working with the general public, I am a very social person who enjoys interacting with people and building relationships with my clients throughout the time I worked there was most enjoyable."
good,Worked on various mainframe systems to test various software. Learned how back-end systems work and how to perform black box testing. Dealing with client data and maintain the sync process with various systems. Worked on various project during the 3+ years spent there.Co-workers where friendly and very helpful.
good,"A typical work day can vary a little bit depending on what your job title is. How to process checks ,Management was good to work for coworkers some was fun working with some kept drama going I hate drama hardest part people complaining about work you come here to work the most enjoyable appreciation."

good,"One of the oldest and largest banks in the USA with very high investment in local community, environment and many other important initiatives."
good,"Challenging assignments and interesting Clientele.  Enjoyed being able to utilize legal expertise in everyday work.  Most of our co-workers were very ego-driven and it appeared acceptable from management.  It was not acceptable in our workplace to me being in an Administrative role that was partly production based.  Overall the total of 16 years spent in this role I enjoyed the Commercial loan end so much more as it was always a pleasure working with a larger more experienced group, seemed a lot more cohesive and we all worked together very well."
good,"My overall review of Bank of America is that out of a 10 rating, I give them a 7.5 to 8.  I leanered a lot in my time there, and grew as a person.  I would have liked to continue my career with BOFA, however with the site closing in my area, I was unable to secure another position with in the company, so I had to part ways.  I enjoyed my time there, the enviroment was unique to the people that worked their, along with the overall passion we all had to do our jobs to the best of our ability.   I had worked both the customer Service sie along with the Home Retention side.  I got to see the best and worst of both worlds.  I enjoyed the inner action with the people that I woudl assist on a dailey basis.  The day was never the same, always a new person to talk to.  And when I hd a portfolio, I was able to build a rapport with them, and trully assist in helping people fix and make their lives more manageable.  I enjoy the strong bond me and my fellow employees had.  We were a true team, and the teamwork that we woudl utilize on a dailey basis made the days go buy easier, and more efficient."
good,Excellent opportunity to enter into the brokerage community
good,Nice place to work. Co- workers nice and most management team was nice too.  My supervisor was going through some things and she started taking it out on the employees. Home stuff leave at home.
good,Great place for advancement and many opportunities. As a manager it is a stressful job that is compensated accordingly. There is room for improvement when it comes to work/life balance.
good,A typical day would be collecting information from customers to assist them with qualifying for assistance with their home loans.
good,"A DE Underwriter's day consists mainly of checking your ""inbox"" to determine what your tasks are going to be for the day, initial approvals, condition reviews, clear for closing, cancellations and denials.  The underwriters work closely with the underwriting manager to prioritize inbox tasks so the most urgent activities are taken care of first."
good,"25 years with the Bank, enjoyed all the time , would have liked more reward"
good,"I have learned a great deal about Default Mortgage Servicing."
good,"•a typical day at work - log in, review all emails, respond to MOC, meeting, meeting, meeting.."
good,I worked at the company for 14 years. Started from the bottom and worked my way up. I am grateful for all of the valuable work experience and skills that I obtained during my time with the company. It's too bad that the company made the decision to close our site after so many years invested.
good,Global company offering ability to relocate if desired. Allows for cross-functional opportunities.
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"I had a fantastic job managing the Payoff Department, which was located in four sites (two in TX, one in CA, and an offshore group in India).  My job was interesting and challenging and I enjoyed working with an excellent team and fantastic senior manager."
good,good company to work for. Being on the phone with customers can be challenging at times.
good,"I have had the best and the worst of times at BofA.  It is an environment where you can have great pay and benefits, but still be miserable thanks to your manager.  I wish it were more ground-up in its leadership style, but it's a traditional corporate environment.  I also wish it had a more playful atmosphere, but it is a bank. All in all, I respect their community participation and treatment of non-traditional and diverse lifestyles.  Among its peers, i'd say it's one of the better places to work."
good,"Bank of America helped me to grow in my field and educated me the area of underwriting.  My leadership was great and gave me plenty of opportunity to lead.  Unfortunately, the decision was made to cut staffing and that rolled down to me.  I would definitely work there again."
good,"I was able to refine my skills in customer service while employed here.  They provided adequate training for the job performance required.  Due to the ever changing face of financial  world, policy  changes and processes were communicated clearly.  With many different departments available to work in, opportunities for advancement were prevalent and obtainable if you worked toward them."
good,overall its a good place to work and the management is excellent..co workers are helpful.. d most enjoyable part is fridays fun activities to release all the stress
good,Review and underwrite conventional mortgage loans to include AUS and manual approvals. Meet invester requirements. Work closely with processors to ensure all conditions are met prior to final approval.
good,I enjoy working there but it seems almost impossible to move up in position. I work hard and get recognized constantly but there is difficulty in getting considered for higher positions.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is knowing that my bills will be paid when the day is over. That's what motivates me to go 110% every time I punch the time clock. Every job can be done as long as the motivation is there every day.
good,"Great management"
good,There is a diversity in my co-workers in age and ethnicity. I like my job because you get to help financial lives better for the customer through the connections we have.
good,"Overall a great working experience, but our California sites have to been sold to Safeguard Properties."
good,"Management at a local level is phenomenal.  The company has truly changed their focus to providing great customer service and having high quality loan files.  The systems that are current in place are archaic and very frustrating.  If you can just accept that as a fact and move on you will do fine.  There are checklists for checklists and then checklists for these checklists.  The average number of loans closed per processor per month is 8 - 10 and that is the expectation.  (That is not a typo.  8 - 10 loans per month and you need to work overtime to accomplish this goal)  A new origination, processing and underwriting system is supposed to be implemented in 2014.  "
good,"Very busy enviroment."
good,I loved working here. Learning how to confidently and efficiently handle customer requests while providing a service is a valuable skill. I excelled and had many great customer reviews.
good,"The work environment was pleasant, fast paced and we had to be very detailed oriented. I've learned that paying attention to detail is very important because being inconsiderate or non caring can cause big problems for others. The management team was cool and offered help when needed and my coworkers were awesome as well. There were no hard parts to me because I enjoyed my job and was good at what I did."
good,"I had a Monotonous duty of sorting checks by routing numbers and banks, I had the best co-workers and made good friends there. The hardest part of the job was the deadlines."
good,"BOA was a great place to work behind the scenes, many opportunities to advance."
good,"I work from home which is a great perk because I am able to save time by not driving into the office and that obviously saves on the cost of gas. I have been given the freedom to develop my skills both in the workplace and through college via a tuition reimbursement plan. Unfortunately, I now have skills that command a larger compensation on the open market and management is unwilling to address this issue. Benefits and job security are great but without career advancement opportunities and appropriate compensation the job I have feels hollow."
good,Bank of America is a great Company to work for. The Banking Center I worked for had Great leadership and I worked very well with my Team.
good,"I enjoy working at my banking center, it is definitely my home away from home. Its an all women banking center so I feel comfortable and at ease. The con about this job is the insecurity of working hours. Some weeks I'll work 40 hrs, others weeks I'll only work 20. I need a job that can give me the structure and security I need "
good,On a normal day i am happy and smiling. I have learned how to work very closely in a team setting. The management could be better but there are some great managers there that are really willing to assist and make sure you get what you need. i love the people i work with they are wonderful. The hardest thing i do at my job is not be able to help a customer.
good,"family oriented Firm"
good,"As a Card Service Representative, my goal was to ensure that all of my customers received satisfaction in knowing that all of their needs personal inquiries were met."
good,"After working for the company for ~10 years, I saw many wonderful and not so wonderful things transpire.  Lay-offs are not an ""if"", rather they are simply a ""when"" it will happen to you.  The pay is very competitive and you have the resources of one of the world's largest banks behind you.  However, the recent negative publicity and constant cost cutting has hit the culture very hard making it a less creative and interesting, even tolerable, place to work.  I hope they will turn it around, though I won't be there having been recently laid off. "
good,"Overall a good company to work for"

good,"A typical day was relatively easy, well planned, and without issue.  I gained more experience in seeing large scale call center deployment upgrades impacting multiple lines of business.  Management was liberal, and easy not given to ""micro-management"".  My co-workers were good resources for information and pleasant to work with.  The hardest part of the job was engaging the vendors, as they appeared to be prohibited to contractors.  What I enjoyed most was the orientation and discussions around infrastructure, specifically NICE 4.1"
good,"Working with my co-workers was great because we had a team environment.  The job itself was not hard - better communication from management about changes would enable the work to flow much easier.  When changes occur, there is quite of correcting work already completed along with daily deadlines.  I have learned to work great under presure. "

Ever since i've started working there ive learned a whole lot and i keep learning, but at the same time there is a very slight chance of career advancement and stability, which is what i am looking for."
good,Bank of america was a greta place to work for the last seven years until recenly laid off due to cut backs. It has presented me  with great knowledge of the mortgage industry. A typical day involves loan review of defaulted loans and making very critical decisions on foreclosure.. Great part of the job is being an agent  of change being able to work from various applications. Overall great company to have been a  part off.

I loved to challenges of meeting the needs of various groups and finding a way to make them happy.
good,A typical day was making production schedule without mistakes. I learned that people pay very high taxes to the government. The management was very friendly and helpful.

In about 3 months I took and passed mortgage licensing tests in 25 different states including the National NMLS and familiarized my self with the underwriting guidelines. And I am proud to say I passed them all with no failures or re-takes. The managers and co-workers convey a very team oriented atmosphere. I relate to this very well as a prior military person. The hardest part is the high pressure sales aspect. I find that  I enjoy the behind the scenes, underwriting and technical portion and know I would excel in this area. The enjoyable part is working as a team to find a solution that is a good fit for the clients."
good,I enjoyed my time at Bank of America I just wish that the position paid more. 
good,  Jobs in the banking centers are purely sales with a side of operations and customer treatment.
good,"A very professional environment day in day out. Lot to learn around on work floor. Organisation emphasis on Learning & Development of its workforce. I learned lot of new things in Bank like People Management, Inter-Department Operations, BCP mechanism, LOB liaison. Managers of Bank are quiet professional in their approach while driving the organisation. Colleagues in my organisation are of mixed culture which is been the fantastic experience for me to be with. After working for almost six years with the Bank with Investor Asset Management department there is nothing specifically that hard except the rare rejection of fund remittance by Investor for which there has to be multiple follow ups. Training to the associates is most enjoyable part for my work as imparting the knowledge & skills in trainees gives me immense satisfaction."

good,Very Busy Day. Very Numbers Driven.  Numbers are extremely high.
good,"I love working at Bank of America.  I always have fun, management is great.  There is a lot of room for growth within the company.  The benefits are awesome.  My biggest perk was the work life balance.  It  is important for me to be home for dinner. "

Hardest part of the job is not being able to get a client to where he needs to be to qualify for a mod, enjoyable is successfully helping as many home owners as possible."

good,Assisted customers and businesses with monetary transactions. Counted and controlled the vault and ATM machines to accuracy. Handled inquires into new products and service with the bank.
good,"Changes abound at BOA... and if you work in a call center, that's expected as part of the job description. However, it seemed that none of the changes were really investigated or tried out completely before being put into general practice. This caused many errors, unhappy customers and frustrated employees. You could come in one day and get a new change...and the next day, after doing this new change the day before, it has been changed or deleted altogether, and all the customers that you apprised of the change have now been given wrong info, and it really was nothing unusual to come in on the 3rd day and another change is made to the 2 previous changes...very hard to deal with. For the most part there was a fair mix of ages involved in my department, and we mostly got along well..for being in a fishbowl. Management could change on a dime also, and you could come in with no notice, to a new team leader. I would go back again, and I'm on the rehire list, but I couldn't find anything available for my job skills at the time I was laid off."
good,"A day on the job consisted of working with customers. I would do deposits, withdrawals, resolve any issue the customer had, answer phones, along with other things. I learned more about the banking business and how to work face to face with customers. I learned how important it is to acknowledge people when they walked in and to make sure the customers knew you didn't forget they wee there. The management could have improved some but my co-workers were all great. It was like a little family. The hardest part of the job was when angry customers would come in and yell and curse at me."
good,I enjoyed to opportunity for advancement. I started at the bottom and worked my way to Sr. Management in 6 years. You can self-educate via module training although there is a lack of apprenticeship.

good,• Currently manage a team of 14 associates/contractors in Broker’s Request Department
good,"As a facilitator I train anywhere from 20 to 30 associates in the various levels of customer service available at a standard contact center for Bank of America. In teaching over two hundred associates in a year I learned a lot about patience and time management. The multi-tasking skills needed for that role are critical ones to know and balancing class work, class prep, and class review documentation was intense. It is I have to say a very rewarding learning experience."
good,I have enjoyed working here for 8 years. The benefits leave alot to be desired however the programs the bank offers are good.
good,Usually dealt with challenging tasks and that is what got me stronger. Wonderful colleagues to work with! No regrets!

I learned that the more respect that you show to your fellow co-workers when assigning work the more willing they are to take on projects at the last minute. The most difficult part of the job was the constant change of contract designers."
good,Only dealt with direct manager who was real good. A lot of good and knowledgeable co-workers.
good,Large presence in Dallas. Fun first job out of college with opportunity to learn various functions within the bank.
good,"A typical night will consist reading emails and determining what ATMs need to have software reloaded. Finding all ATMs that were not current with software or ADs and taking the necessary steps to get them to current software. Worked with technicians to take an ATM from out of service and available for customer use. During rollout of new ADs or software version, worked with fellow co-workers and managers to keep the ATMs working for customers then send out emails to business partners informing them of the success of the rollout. This is a job that is to this day performed at night so the ATMs are available to the customers during the day. The difficulty was maintaining the fleet but that was the most enjoyable part of the job. All the challenges made the job worth while."
good,Highly competitve environment where strategic planning and business savy were demanded. Very complicated financial information had to be communcated to high net worth clients effectively in order for them to make a proper investment decision. Integrity and personal trust were the highest components for a succesfull career and the building of a significant portofolio. Developed the skills of performing under adverserial pressure at all times with success.

good,good place to work and learn new things.co-workers are good and environment also good its been a great working with this company for 6.11 years.

good,Great place to work where their core values are carried down from the laedership.
good,Bank of America is an excellent company to work for with great benefits.
good,Profession workplace. Friendly environment. Management is very hands off.
good,"I have worked for this company for years and with the many changes in the banking industry, there have been many changes within the company. They do not value their associates as much as they did and you are not always sure who you can trust in management. This makes for an uncomfortable and stressful work environment."
good,Working with Bank of America gave me my first introduction to corporate America.
good,It was great. The people they are really nice and the managers really know what they are doing. I've learned a lot as far as managing and how to act like a professional.
good,1) Assisted in opening and closing of over 2000 bank accounts.
good,"A typical day at work as a teller to make deposits, cashed lots and lots of checks. They concentrated in lost prevention which gave me plenty of knowledge and security at what i was doing. Management at the time was somehow monopolized but I still like the job so, I stayed. My co-workers were fun and respectful. The hardest part of the job was to cash so many checks with sometimes limited staff. I really like the health benefits."
good,Company has great core values. associates are very friendly and management is very approchable

good,A typical work day customer/business oriented. I have learned that being a team player makes your job a lot easier and less stressful at the end of the day. The hardest part of the day is getting started. The most enjoyable is time to go home.
good,Had a great time there.
good,"This job taught me to be more professional when it came to dealing with customers, it brought out more my customer service experience than i thought i had. I love dealing with customer and helping them with their needs. I had very nice co-workers they made the day much easier for me specially because i was new."

good,"i would load my computer daliy, i have learned to effectively listen, think outside of the box. managers where ok when they where not being micro-managed, upper management were horrible. the unit manager was horrible. people that i had interacts with where awsome. the hardest part of the job was getting belittled by some customers. most enjoyable part was being to make most people happy with the little things."
good,"I work from 10:30 to 7:00 PM Monday-Friday, I've learned so much at that job, I came in with no experience and is now one of the best reps. I work with major accounts such as YUM,Waffle House, and Compass Group. I've managed to exceed on my service quality for the year of 2011 and for my mid year review this year with a %97. The management is okay and my co-workers are okay as well. The hardest part about my job is my hours, I would prefer an earlier shift to spend more time with my 10 month old daughter. The most enjoyable part about my job is the benefits, pay and PTO they offer. Our department will be closing soon and I just need stability for my family and I."

good,I actually enjoyed going to work everyday.....loved my coworkers loved my manager. Just a good comfortable place to work
good,"One thing that I can say about working at Bank Of America, the team involment with technical support and internal customers was great. Everyone got along and we worked very hard to make the customer feel important and not forgotten. I enjoyed my time and work at Bank of America and was very sad to leave there (contract was terminated). I hope to return there someday once the company feels that it can bring us back in. We were a great technical support desk and I feel strongly that the internal customers are now suffering because they lack the support they need to handle their work load. If you take care of the internal customers, the external customers who we need to survive will benefit."
good,"Repeat customers come in daily. Process transactions in system quickly and efficiently. Enhanced outstanding customer service skills. My co workers were great with team work for benefit of the team and customers. The hardest part of the job was having to meet sales goals although customers may not have needed the referred products at that time. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was getting to meet and interact with new customers on a daily basis, and interacting with the repeat customers daily and already knowing their needs."
good,"For about 6 months, it was the greatest place: good pay, convenient commute and interesting work. I was heavily involved into development of new functional modules for the BOA data warehouse.

good,"Work was fun to go to each day. Best group of co-workers, at work and, off site."
good,"A typical day is standing in a lobby greeting customers,helping the customers with any needs and helping my co workers with all that is needed and some that is not recommended. I learned that a corporate job is serious business the customers has different personalities each day, Co-workers are people too.The Hard part of my job is remembering all the customers' names as i see them.The most enjoyable is satisfying the customers' curiosities. If you are a people's person you'll have tons of fun greeting but that's the only fun i had."
good,The training process is difficult but once you get past that the job is relatively easy. The benefits are wonderful. They give you reimbursment for childcare and school. i love the people I work with and the work load is light and there is very little stress with this job. There are a lot of requirements and rules that you need to remember because we are evaluted twice a year by audit and monthly by the branch manager. It is a lot of memorization but it is for the safety of yourself and your team members.
good,"High degree of upward mobility. Lots of camaraderie, good work environment. Decent brand name. Good banking services. Relatively long hours, but that is to be expected. Wide range of talent among the employees and management."
good,At Bank of America in National City was work from the minute we opened the door to the minute we closed it. Hard work was a must and learning sales and referral tips was a given. Management was always doing something in he vault or simply taking care of a customer escalation. Hardest part of the day was pre balancing to the penny after receiving a quarter million dollars in cash deposits. Bank of America was really big on Rallys which were extremely fun. A friday after work quarterly all the branches would get together and have some sort of competition just for fun and prizes. My manager taught me leadership skills which i carry on till this day.
good,"Generally, this is a great company. I enjoy working and doing what I do. I have learnt to be more patient although some co-workers can work your nerves. There was nothing really hard about the job. I enjoyed being in an open environment."
good,"deal directly with customers either by telephone, electronically or face to face"
good,"My daily job responsabilities include reconciling and reporting P&L to the municipal bond trading desk, along with providing P&L explains. Another daily focus is runing a montly reconcilation to minimize breaks between the traders and general ledger."
good,"Bank of America is a very large bank for a reason. They are a great bank to work for, lots of job security, however they are out of touch with their employees, probably because it is so big. They have great training. Middle Managment needs to improve, as I believe middle managment is reponsable for their 70% employee turnover. There is no work/life balance at Bank of America. Overall they are the most stable bank in the industry."
good,Across the street from BART and a block form Restaurants o' plenty at Todos Santos plaza
good,The people I worked with were very friendly and a good diverse mufti-cultural mix of professionals.

good,"Overall good company. Benefits package is great. Deal with different types of people, get to build people skills."
good,"The job included assisting other clients about information regarding IRA's and retirement plans. The mangers were very nice and patient. I learned a lot about the business side of things and even though the learning curve for all the information was steep, it was a still a very enjoyable day."
good,"I answered phones 8 hours a day, 5 days with a week. Lunch breaks were very short, and phone lines were always busy. Customers usually call upset if you work for checking and savings department, since usually customers only call when a problem occurs with their account."
good,Bank of America is a great place to work with opportunities to excel and grow.
good,I am usually one of the first to the bank. I make sure the tellers have everything they need to start the day such as cash as well as consignment items. During the day I complete operational tasks such as buying and selling from the vault and checking the tellers work. I also observe them daily to ensure they are treating customers with courtesy and respect. I have been with the bank for 7 years and I have been in almost every position in the banking center. I am a swift and willing learner. The most enjoyable part of the day is the constant interaction with my co workers as well as customers.
good,"Enjoyed working for Bank of america, I really enjoyed my job and a responsibilities as a Fraud Analyst. Typical day, come in, check messages, check you case load. We are assigned between 2-6 claims and are required to work and/or close 4-6 claims a day. Management was great, we were not micro managed. I really enjoyed the team that I worked on because everyone got along great and helped out one another."
good,Supportive peer and management environment.
good,"So I would process credit card machine and shipped out to merchant across the country. There would be a high volume of work to be sent off per day. We worked on different teams. Once we would be done, then sometimes we would help out the other teams and help with sending off the product to the merchants on time."
good,Diverse company with many differnet departments to build experience
good,Great place to work. Prestigious name has a lot of leverage behind it.
good,"A typical day would be from 7am to 3pm. I learned the importance of being very accurate to the hair. Had a great group of co-workers who i enjoyed spending time with. The hardest part was being very accurate to the penny, and the most enjoyable part was being able to handle all the money in a responsible manor"
good,"I'd say the part of my time spent at BAC that I enjoyed most is the people I've met. I've been very lucky to be a part of a team of hard working, intelligent, good people."
good,"Spend most of the day on the phone. I have learned a lot about mortgage, why many people goes into foreclosure, and how to counsel customers to avoid foreclosure. Also the steps in modifying one's mortgage."
good,"This was a great company that believe in meritocracy and provides opportunity for advancement. However, they do like to keep you within a specific role and business as long as they can, and switching functions is frowned upon."
good,"The company is going through a lot of transition, which makes it very difficult to advance in an associate's career. Rewards and benefits are being eliminated due to cost saving initiative efforts. Associate retention is also being overlooked."
good,Bank of America was a wonderful company to work for that allowed me to grow and gave me endless opportunity to learn new aspects of the position.
good,"Is a good place to work if they were not so micro management. Close management is good for a company but putting to much pressure an associate when working with money and customers relationships is not. With so much pressure, associates sometimes makes mistakes and they don't try to find a solution to help the associate. I don't think is the company is some markets. I was thinking to retired from this company but is not going to happen."
good,"Loved working at Merrill Lynch was a great experience. The people I worked with were great and helpful. My only dissatisfaction is that they give you no help in passing the Series 7and 66 and if you fail it, you're gone, no matter how well you're doing at the job."
good,The Bank has plenty of great training opportunites which gives you the ability to extend your knowledge and broaden your experience which allows one to improve their marketability through internal training.
good,New management is coming in and changing personnel and a the culture of the firm.
good,"I worked for the company for 27+ years. I was happy with their benfits, work environment and management. Had it not been for the state of the economy I probably would still be with them."
good,Overall decent company to work for despite downsizing. Recent changes have not been for the better of the employees but better for business which makes sense because it is a for profit corporation. Benefits are gret and they do tuition reimbursement for job related courses
good,"Bank of America is a great employer that has great benefits but could be more competitive in the compensation area. The work / life balance is a high priority for them and with the company being so large, there are endless opportunities for you to grow."
good,I was working as a customer service Rep for 3 years until i decided to develop professional growth within the company . I took a job offer within the same line of business which become a different role and responsiblities. The tranfer was easy and excited until i realize the demands and delay feedback on performance review.
good,Enjoyed working at bank of america. great company wit good benefits and very diverse. Only thing i didn't like was job securtiy.
good,"I started out at Fleet Bank which was acquired by Bank of America. We had many changes, but through it all Bank of America is a great company to work for. I worked in the banking industry over 12 years and enjoyed each position I held."
good,"I was a 100% team player. Most co-workers worked well together to get a job done. Managers, VP, SVP AND HIGHER trusted the work we did and never doubted our ability to get the job done correctly and timely. If it wasn’t completed, the managers of that team would crackdown on those teams not performing as they should to be sure they get the work completed."
good,"Expectations are high...must deliver to stay cutting edges"
good,Provides good opportunity and guidance to succeed. Each day of my work gives me a different kind of exposure to variety of situations.There is always an opportunity to learn and grow as an individual and solve difficult problems in a very professional way. This not only makes you successful in the long run but also makes you more and more confident.
good,Bank of America is a very large organization that encourages it's employees to gain experience across horizontal lines of business.  In my experience that is rare and a credit to their leadership.
good,"I enjoyed and succeeded in my time there, I worked hard for the opportunities given and felt as I could have succeed further if I would have stayed. While there I was responsible for creating a quality banking experience for customers, establishing, building and retaining customer relationships, performing business in an effort to meet and exceed company’s goals and objectives. Ensuring the operational excellence of the center and maintaining the highest level of customer service. Coach and lead my team on the proper execution of key financial center plays while role-modeling the desired behaviors. Reviewed tax statements as well as P & L’s, to work with an underwriting team for loan qualifications."
good,"Great place to grow and learn a lot. I was really happy with my first job in middle office. Unfortunately, they moved all positions to North Carolina and I had to find a new role."
good,As a financial center in a dense area there was bound to be an above average foot-traffic. As a teller you will be assisting clients with their transactions and referring them if needed with a banker.
good,Productive work environment.  The culture is very inclusive and diverse.  A typical day at work is servicing the client.  The people I work with are a pleasure to work with
good,"Customer service Representatives are responsible for customer deposits, withdrawals, payments, checks and purchases. With each customer transaction performed help clients with making the most of their relationship. Offering new accounts, account changes and other services offered by Bank of America."
good,I am thankful to work for a prestigious company. The team environment is very supportive. There are some opportunities for advancement. I look forward to growing my skills and excelling.
good,I loved dealing with clients on a everyday basis.  BOA is very much into technology  and I learned a lot to assist client to bank conveniently.   They promote team work and are very sales focused.  Hardest part of my job was meeting the goals in my area that were set for a metro market and I was considered a community bank.  BOA is a  good company to work for.
good,"BofA was a great place to work. They had great benefits, culture was great, and compensation was fair. Work structure, processes, and chain of command was clear cut. All employees were all given employee handbooks and clear information on what their expectations were. "
good,I have no ill feelings about this company other than the way they are re-structuring the incentive plans for their bankers. They are rolling it out so fast with big changes and no one is able to give clear outlined explanations of what the new guidelines will be nor why they are occurring. They are taking a big portion of our points earned value away without stating any clear offsetting compensating factors about how those will be made up on the local level.
good,Lots of travel.  Exciting and challenging projects.  Given tasks to stretch your capabilities and knowledge.  Opportunities to give back to the community. Good benefits.
good,"Use many Microsoft Office Programs (Excel, Word, PPT, OneNote)."
good,"Great people to work with. I enjoyed the experience. Learned a lot. Good work/life balance."
good,"Nyc company, gud place to work...will lyk to wrk once again if got a chance...ofc politics nd salary payout cud hve been bettr...hr policies r gud, cud b more female friendly, in terms of shift hours.."
good,Perfect work life balance and great work culture however less career opportunities and growth. Senior Management must invest in human assets to retain talent.
good,Working in the financial sector for the first time helped me learn what exactly the Bank does in terms of their technological products and style of work globally and locally.
good,"The workplace culture is great at Bank of America, employees are in charge of their career path, diversity and inclusion is a main focus with BOA. I have gained a lot of experience in the banking industry."
good,"Good company to work for. Benefits are awesome. Diversity & inclusion are talked about more than put into practice. Also, who you know helps with job opportunities."
good,"Was a good place to work, learned many aspects of enterprise software engineering working for a large financial institution.  Culture was good on the team I worked on for many years.  Hardest part was navigating some of the environment.  I enjoyed working remote and truly enjoyed the team I was on."
good,"Bank of America is a great company to work for, they value diversity and give opportunity to all social classes to grow. it is a very professional work environment."
good,Overall pay is good but demand is very high.  Expectation is too exceed goals. Bonuses have significantly reduced and goals have increased.  Bank of America
good,"A great company to work for overall. Great benefits, and great work/life balance. Limited internal advancement, especially in Branch Banking, lower to mid management."
good,"I really enjoyed my experience at Bank of America until suddenly, pretty much ""out of the blue"", our site was closed down and we were all laid off.  There was no opportunity to transfer to another location/position.  Very devastating."
good,"Well paid form of employment. "
good,The corporatism and need to sell things makes everyone crazy. The market leaders have so much pressure put on them to perform above goal that they go crazy when the centers are just below. Also the goal tracking system can be cheated so easily. It makes it a game to look like you are performing well. Also I support over hiring but the transition that they are working toward can't supportrt the number of people who are currently employed
good,Above average amount of time off.  Affordable benefits. Lots of employee support programs.  Low bonuses even after successful business growth.  Overwhelming work loads.  Company does stand behind it's core values.
good,"Nice culture, good work life balance. Great place to work in except the progression is not what i expected. Office politics is not too bad and people are generally nice"
good,Good business experience as well as an opportunity to work on many matters. Met many different types of people and learned quite a lot while there. Interesting experience.
good,"There are a lot of different business scenarios encountered and almost all the work are of critical priority for the business, so that demands excellent problem solving skills along with sincerity at work. Peers and co-workers are usually helpful and projects are agile."
good,I started here during the spring of my junior year and it helped me secure a job for the summer of when I graduate. They offer amazing programs and give you all the aid to succeed and build your business. Amazing opportunities to work with intelligent and multicultural individuals who all have something different to bring to the table.
good,"Stressful, fast making decisions days, focus on production, competitive"
good,"Interesting projects.  There is no one typical day in the project management space.  There are opportunities to work with a variety of people from many departments.  The bank offers generous volunteer and matching gift programs, and is dedicated to diversity and inclusion."
good,Bank of America provides many tools to help associates develop and grow professionally. Lynda.com is included and you also have access at home to use longer courses
good,I had a good experience with Bank of America.  I got along with my manager and could easily work with my co-workers.  My only regret is that I was laid off and the company is having difficulties now.
good,It was a positive driven area with oppurtunity and growth in alternate departments.  I feel if you had the right get along attitude and work ethics one could flourish.
good,"Bank of America is mostly a great bank to work for. If you work hard and network with the right people you will get to the top. Although it does have some flaws, it remains a very good company to work for."
good,High level stress and position with inbound calls team environment with individual achievements and goals  for expectations. Has very good and strong benefits.
good,Enjoyed working with the staff and clientelle that did business with the bank. Opportunities to work out of surrounding branches if help was needed there.
good,"Bank of America (India) is a great place to settle down. Very easy going company and everyone is focused on their own work. No pressure from higher management (at-least in my project)."
good,"Benefits at Bank of America were amazing. Workplace culture was demanding, often demanding long hours. This made work life balance a challenge, but there was a lot of opportunity for development."
good,This is a company that has a great infrastructure and incredible resources. They have a strong research department and a platform to manage billionaires. Weakness is the lack of support for leads and younger advisors.
good,The teamwork atmosphere makes it fun to work here. Pay is suitable for the workload. Management is supportive and understanding. Extensive training classes provide great understanding before jumping on the floors
good,"Challenging but great place to start your career with, learnt a lot during the years working for BOA. Good internal opportunities, aggressive working culture"
good,"To obtain a position within a company that utilizes my skill sets, management achievements, strategic thinking and leadership abilities to enable me to consistently exceed the company expectations."
good,"Bank of America is a team oriented atmosphere. In any department you are in, things are easier when you work as a team. The managers I have worked under have ranged from somewhat unprofessional to excellent. The culture of our workplace is defined by an acronym that focuses on customer satisfaction, teamwork, and respect. The hardest part of the job is keeping yourself organized in a way that will allow you to successfully stay on top of your daily duties and managing your time properly so that you are able to get everything on your list done for the day. The most enjoyable part of my job was the atmosphere of the team I am lucky enough to be on. Our team works together so well because our manager leads us in a way that makes getting along and working together organic and natural."
good,"Bank of America is overall an very organized company providing good benefit. "
good,"Beginning of the day, I'd log in, start taking back to back calls immediately, till my first 15 minute break, worked another 2 hours till lunch and so on.  Job had moments of being mentally stressful, but as a whole and the fact you sit for most of your shift is easy on the body.  Most coworkers are friendly and helpful, and help make the day go back quicker.  There did seem to be a lack of communication between upper management and on floor management."
good,This experience was through a internship and it was really cool. There was just a lack of information/training  that I was supposed receive. I would work there again but as a manager.
good,"Collected customer feedback and made process changes to exceed customer satisfaction goals. Provided accurate and appropriate information in response to customer inquiries. Demonstrated mastery of customer service call script within specified timeframes. Addressed customer service inquiries in a timely and accurate fashion. Maintained up-to-date records at all times. Developed effective relationships with all call center departments through clear communication. Ran reports and supplied data to fulfill customer report requirements. Worked with upper management to ensure appropriate changes were made to improve customer satisfaction. Built customer loyalty by placing follow-up calls for customers who reported product issues. Trained staff on how to improve customer interactions. Assisted with the development of the call center's operations, quality and training processes."
good,Always negotiate your starting pay before you are hired. Do not listen to them if they tell you they will reevaluate your pay after hire. They will penny pinch you for your annual raise.
good,Work enviroment is stressfull but colleagues make up for the stress. Management could be more cohesive as a unit. Benefits are great but work life balance good be better.
good,This is a great company to work for with great benefits and room for advancement. I wasn’t interested in a call center environment otherwise I would’ve stayed.
good,Very stressful and competitive environment. If you are not a sales person then this job would not be suitable for you. It deals with mostly sales and meeting monthly goals which are very high and sometimes unrealistic to achieve.
good,"Has wonderful benefits, but constantly laying off. The layoffs are never ending and you are always in fear of if you are next. Even if you are an exceeds on you mid and year end reviews."
good,"Before Bank of America acquired failing Financial Institutions, they treated employees great, we had employee recognition day, employees received medallions to use in the Bank of America Store and we also received stock. Bank of America has always had Lay offs, I survived several before I got laid off, it was only because they were not hiring part time employees anymore, they offered you full time positions, but I couldn’t except."
good,"Typical workday are morning team meetings. Setting expectations for the day and inspecting the results, throughout the day. Coaching team members when needed."
good,"I did not enjoy a lot of the time that I worked at Bank of America. Overall, the job is fine if you don't mind repetitive work. When I first began working there, they did require mandatory overtime and they were not good about telling people in a timely fashion. That changed eventually, but you knew that they expected you to stay. I did not see a lot of opportunities for career advancement. There is no job shadowing unless you specifically ask for it. Even then, it may take a while for them to introduce you to someone who can help. The pay was ok. Raises are a joke. Also, job coaching wasn't great either. If you make an error, they don't really have a way of helping you in improve. I heard ""slow down"" so many times, it became a joke. Maybe other departments of the bank are better, but I wouldn't know because there is little to no communication between the different departments to gauge."
good,I really liked and enjoyed working for Bank of America. The job is very easy and they provide training and coaching. Even if you don't know anything about banking you can still do this job!
good,"Great benefits and pay, great vacation and sick time, and holiday bonuses, open overtime for anybody performing well. Can be hectic and busy without pauses between calls,"
good,"Bank of America is a great place to work they have decent insurance package, some depts have management that is not the standard. Overall i loved working there."
good,I enjoyed my 25 years at Bank of America.  I learned many skills within that time that will serve me well going forwards.  I always had fair management who were always willing to discuss advancement.  I would recommend Bank of America to my friends and family as a good place to work.
good,"My current job is fine, but I am moving to North Carolina and would prefer a work from home opportunity.  The hardest part of my job would be telling a customer no. The best part is solving their problems"
good,Bank of America benefits are unmatched. They make up for the fact that sometimes you are not paid in accordance to your value. Pay is reviewed annually and generally you get a COLA. But it is difficult to have any decent pay increases without changing jobs. Disconnectedness of hiring process makes negotiating pay nearly impossible (by design).
good,Great benefits for women and good work life balance and benefits. Being a Captive center the work is mainly driven by US teams. Facilities are slowly improving.
good,"while there there was a lot of changes "
good,"I have been with Bank of America for over 15 years.  The entire time I have been there, I have working in the Consumer Banking division.  The company is huge and there are lots of opportunities.  The benefits and pay are excellent, but this company will monopolize your time.  There is no such thing as a work life balance."
good,B of A was a good place to work with excellent benefits and perks. I quickly moved up the ranks as management was fairly good at understanding the talent in front of them.
good,"Overall a good company to work for.  work life balance was pretty good while I was there, with options to telecommute.  I believe that's not available any longer.  Compensation overall was not bad.  Management not so great.  Too many reorganizations, too many managers moving around, change all the time, so there was some instability there."
good,"With any large banking organization, one can get lost if you're just a worker. The way to shine in these large  vats of people is to have an innovative eye."
good,"Truly can help clients with every connection.  Advancement opportunities, campuses in multiple locations.  Campus is great , lost of networking opportunities. Diversity is very important"
good,"You will learn a lot when you just start off. Reasonable goals at the start and if you can build your relationship, you can do well. However, the career development within the bank is not that good."
good,I enjoyed my part-time client Associate position while I was a full-time student at University of Michigan. Management is supportive and helpful for young professionals.
good,In Document Execution everyday was different. I was on a rotation with another associate to allow us to notarize and to ship the documents to the attorneys that were completed. I loved being with the people and learning the different documents that were involved. On the days I was a notary I was available to the signers and would assist in making sure the document was correct.
good,BOA was a wonderful place to work. The managers showed that they cared about the agents. The incentives were great! The park and ride was not the best.
good,"I did not like it much at Bank of America because they never gave me fulltime, that's why I went to Wells Fargo, plus I had no benefits and the pay was low."
good,My everyday is to provide the best customer service to every client that comes in to our center.  My role is to help with a client's immediate priority but also a Relationship Manager to help with future banking priorities.  My goal is to be the point contact for every banking need for our clients.
good,"loved working here, great management and great working environment. would recommend to anyone. very well oiled machine. learned a lot for future employments"
good,"I would say you pretty much now what your getting with Bank of America, depending upon your manager. I really had no surprises, and had a ""heads up"" on changes to come."
good,employee for 12 years. no furthers words needed. I enjoy working for this company. When I was a originally hired it was a job fair directly at the location I currently work at. Which was great!
good,"I enjoyed working for the company: the people, environment and culture was awesome during the time if Hugh McCall. It has taken some drastic changes since then but overall the company is still a goid place to work."
good,Working here was one of those things that taught me so much about the trading world. Life events forced me to move if not I would have worked there for many more years.
good,B of A is a good bank to work for.  I left due to an opportunity to advance to in to business development.  Great coworkers and nice shared mission made it enjoyable.
good,"Los días comenzaban revisando las posiciones de riesgo y validando el resultado de los operadores de mesa del día anterior, validando para dar el ok a contabilidad quienes una vez hecho subían los valores a SAP, con esto calculaban los índices de liquides y solvencia de la corredora y los reportaban al regulador. Una vez hecho, coordinar y validar avances en proyectos que se estuviesen ejecutando en la región, análisis de  los mercados locales en Argentina, Colombia, Perú y Chile generando reportes al management de NoBraMex, validar las posiciones de riesgo."
good,During internship company was going through a lot of changes. Fun environment. Fast paced. Great leaders and opportunity for growth within the company
good,"I loved working for the company the first two years. It was very customer focused, and the benefits are outstanding. Decent starting pay, great insurance, paid time off, child care reimbursement, tuition reimbursement, and 12 week maternity/paternity leave. We coached each other and was very team oriented. Wonderful place to work and great learning experience. Then it changed to being very number driven. Customer needs weren't the focus anymore. Sales goals were are unrealistic levels. Office moral at multiple offices went way down. Then they replaced many tellers with automatic teller machines in the office. Management, for the most part, does not work with the employee. They are all about numbers, and many are outright rude and condescending to the staff. Promotions were easy depending on who you know, not by your work ethics. I was promoted easily, while others I worked with that did an excellent job, were stuck in a standstill. Coaching changed to criticisms. Many people, including myself, decided to find work elsewhere due to the changes. I don't know if they've gone back to their old way of doing things, but I hope so. Because THAT was an excellent company to work for. The benefits alone do make this still a great company to work for, but it wont be easy to go up the ladder."
good,"The organization is wonderful at providing their employees a decent base salary and ensuring benefits are granted. Where they fall short is on communicating their expectations for each employee to fully understand the compensation program. The relationship management title is essentially a sales person role but the sales goals are so lofty and confusing that its caused a region wide lack of achievement. When the issue is brought up it surfaces as a problem of the employee and not their training programs. No grooming is done to help employees transition either. I communicated the desire to transition into the mortgage dept. but all my goals fell on deaf ears, despite consistency in numbers and referrals. Its a good job but don't believe the hype."
good,"It depends on which team you are in. I had very good experience and learned on performance tuning in Exadata."
good,A call center environment  with lots of calls never having to be bored. We had the ability through performance to make bonus. Meals were brought in from time to time. Good all around atmosphere.
good,"My time at Bank of America was mostly enjoyable. I really liked my manager. The branch I was assigned was okay. However, due to a management shakeup (at the branch level), all of my well trained staff ended up leaving. Unfortunately, the new staff that took their place were not as skilled. This resulted in a significant drop in loan volume. I ended up leaving to another branch. Unfortunately, the new branch just did not have the volume that can sustain a full time loan officer. I ended up leaving and going to work for Wells Fargo, a decision that I regret to this day."
good,Great job for obtaining entry level experience into the banking and mortgage industry.  Would highly recommend to anyone looking to enter the financial field.
good,work and life balance is great at the Bank of America. Management is very involved in day to day work activities. However no job security in Default Mortgage Servicing Space at this moment.
good,I absolutely love my manager here at BOA and i work so hard for her and my team. However I didn't like the fact that my job was on the line every quarter if I didn't meet my goals. I was nominated for best customer service and best award goal achiever as a new person.
good,"Worked here on a part time basis whilst studying in Liverpool. It was really very nice and a fantasitic expereince, Laods of help and teaching of the how credit cards work."
good,"the benefits are great, being about to take paternity leave with full pay is awesome. the pay is competitive and the incentives are great as well. They care about their employees"
good,"Bank Of America is a good company to work for with great benefits and a good culture but their turnover rate is high. Everyone is constantly worried about job security. More than once my department had to retrain new employees in the same job function that the previously laid off employees were already experienced in. In addition, too many daily meetings hinder production."
good,This was a temporary job as I was only there for a year. I enjoyed my coworkers as well as my manager. The work environment was relaxed and I loved how management let you do your job and not micromanage you.
good,Employee / management relationship was good and respectable. Free lunch at business meetings. I get to travel a lot to meet with clients and discuss their financial needs.
good,"Must be able to adapt to change and quickly. I’ve worked in different depts with the bank, never in a financial center. Just like every job, it has its challenges but i felt the benefits were great and best paid time off and sick time I’ve ever had"
good,Make no mistake ;   Bank of America is a good place to work.
good,"A typical day at work will be fast pace in the morning from 8am to 1030am. We need to meet SLA within this time. Ill be correction encoding errors on checks to prevent Fraudulent activities for commercial clients accounts. From 1030 am ill continue with my daily task that consist of balancing accounts online/ crediting and debiting clients accounts, assisting with any complaints from clients. Running Macros daily to put them into METRICS for higher level Employees to find the data they need.  "
good,Summer internship was pretty good. We had a summer long project and then went through training as if we were full time employees. Lots of down time. Managers are great. People will answer any question you ask. Very young office.
good,"Enjoy working at BOA but they need to focus more on work/life balance as most people are working 65-70 hours a week and are on salary.  However, they do offer flexible schedules and work from home for some who tend to work longer hours."
good,Exciting atmosphere reacting to several marketplaces daily through the trading of commodity futures and options contracts in the open outcry trading pits of the CBOT
good,"Exceed Expectation. "
good,"While employed treated with fairness and dignity. Paid a fair wage with nice people.  Bonus program, earned additional paid time off with years employed."
good,Bank of America was a great place for growth and learning about banking.  I would recommend it to someone wanting to learn all the facets of banking.  It had three to four shifts and plenty of overtime when I was employed there.
good,BofA is so large that it is no longer nimble and is very caught up in process. Its very good at protecting its interest to the detriment of the employees.
good,"BofA was a great company to work for.  I didn't want to leave the company but with where I lived, the commute time was too much with a family at home.  There was no opportunity to work from home"
good,"Audit files to ensure no errors and to make sure the file had all the correct documents so I could prepare the closing documents. If needed I would contact the processor or broker for any documents still needed. I would enter information into the system to prepare the closing documents and the funding conditions. If necessary wires would be ordered."
good,"Committed and focused team members who work towards achieving challenging goals and are recognized for their achievements."
good,They will work you do death if you let them. But if you are good and don't die you can advance quickly. All jobs are 24x7. Performance reviews are arbitrary and subjective.
good,"Bank of America is a great company to work for. Work load can be strenuous but doable. Micro management is very bad there. However, aside from that there is the opportunity for growth and promotion."
good,Working for a bigger company has added perks. Flexibility being primary. The ability to bounce ideas off your peers helped your career development. Benefits were a plus
good,"Nice company, co-workers and staff.  Job is challenging and company is committed to investing in its employees to succeed in their duties and offers many challenges."
good,"Bank of America has a large and complex work environments.  It was typically a good place to work due to strong, supportive management.  I would definitely say it was a place where it matter more who you know, not what you know."
good,"Bank of America is a great company that focuses on the well being of our client’s financial lives. When it comes to understanding our client needs, we are very well trained to understand those needs and guide with recommendations to fulfill those needs and help achieve those goals."
good,"I was recruited with the Financial Advisors I worked for at the time, so I had no real ""interview"". I can say that my Merrill Lynch experience was awesome. Since Bank of America has purchased, it has not been as favorable. The Merrill Lynch culture was about the people, not the bottom line... at least that's how it seemed for several years. I loved working with people and engaging, interacting, training and coaching."
good,"I worked with a great group of people.  We had amazing customers and lived in a great community.  The worst part of the job was the ""suggestive selling"" of different banking products"
good,I enjoyed my experience at Bank of America. hey are a wonderful company. I would love to 4be an employee of there's again. I would most definately refer BoA to my family and friends.
good,"A day at work in Bank of America typically consists of sitting in front of  computer and answering calls, assisting clients with their financial needs."
good,Great training was provided for the position you would embark on. They cared about properly training you. Compensation was not the best at 15 an hour. Co-workers are good people and it was easy to make friends. Management always had an open door policy and it was easy to communicate with them. The hardest part of the job was having to collect mortgage payments from customers that were in a very bad position with illness or death in the family. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist a customer in getting financial assistance to prevent them from losing their home. The health benefits were fantastic as well as the 401K option. The only downfall is the mass layoffs that BofA is so famous for. You sat there on a daily not knowing if you still had a job the next day.
good,Fast pace with great people who will help you get up to speed with changing polices of the Department. The Company is a great place to work. It offers many different positions to allow you to grow you career with Bank Of America.
good,My typical day worked around a portfolio of anywhere from 80 to 100 customer accounts.  I would set appointments with my customers to discuss loan modification options and assist with that process.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who had homes in the foreclosure process.  The most enjoyable part of the job happened when I was able to find a program and help the customer with approval for that program that would lower their monthly payments and allow them to keep their home.
good,"I enjoyed working for Bank of America in the customer service center but they ended up relocating to a different area, replacing with mortgage center."
good,"Progressive firm through 2010;  Great recession and forced mergers by government treasury officials imported Merrill Lynch leadership whose culture is more early 20th century traditional.  "
good,Working in Bank of America was always a good experience. Diversity and Inclusiveness of the company is plus. In terms of work there is lot diversity and challenges you can find it.
good,"when I was with bank of America, it promoted work and life balance program which allows employees, especially women, work from home with supports paying for internet connection and limited work stationaries, such as printer ink and paper supplies."
good,It was all good at the branch until they brought in a new manager who was too uptight! She had the worst management style which forced a lot of the employees at the branch to switch branches or leave.
good,"My team was the most supportive and competitive team. Management is very good. In terms of benefits and over all package, it was pretty much the same. However, for non-local like me, we get to have a CPF-In-Lieu which is added on top of your base pay."
good,Bank of America has been a tremendously productive and educational experience. The work environment and scheduling procedures are very flexible and accommodate many lifestyles. Management is cooperative and inspiring.
good,Your only as good as your last months or quarter sales.  Youve got to always be motivating your team and modeling behaviors and coaching them to meat sales goals as well as customer delight goals and Opeations goals as well as associate satisfaction
good,"This is a great company to work for to begin your career. They will expose you to pretty much all that there is to see within the financial industry. Work/life balance is also a great especially if you work in operations. Essentially, you don't take work home."
good,Last summer I was an intern at American Red Cross where I worked on a project to set up fire alarms in three cities in New Jersey where I strategized plans to increase efficiency by deciding the optimal number of teams and hours required and discussed with organizations the funds required for the project.
good,"Establishing relationships with new and long-term customers by providing the best customer service and deepening their relationship with their financial needs. Also proactively meeting their Banking needs while promoting, selling, and referring our products and services, assist customers to open retail accounts and maintain them at full range as required. Therefore, my goals and achievements are met successfully without issues."
good,"Great place to work but advancement is limited. Stability of work is not high, there is always a threat of lay offs. Benefits are good. Training is not priority"
good,"I am a rehire with the Bank after being laid off the first time around, and I was able to use my skills and knowledge to get promoted within about two years. The job is challenging (I'm a processor for Home Equity) and the guidelines are ALWAYS changing, but if you want to stay on your toes and learn new ways of thinking to advance, this role does just that. Different managers have different managerial styles, so if you are lucky enough to get a manager that meshes with you and your personality - hold on to them! Since the Chandler, AZ site is growing very fast, I have had over 5 managers in a span of 3 years, with the last manager being the result of a promotion. "
good,"If you have your numbers and don't fail call quality then the managers will leave you alone, beware individuals in the call quality department as they find ways to get rid of people. All the managers talk about is numbers, no room for decision making as a customer service rep."
good,"Handled a lot of Challenges in the project and had excellent opportunity to update my skills, had a lot of co-operation from management on any issues."
good,We would have fun on the job to build team morale. We would have contests and celebrate diversity and birthdays. BOA was very organized. Month end was always busy. That is expected in the mortgage industry.
good,Bank of America is a corporation that has great benefits and gives employees the ability to grow within. Bank of America also gives you the opportunity to move to other departments.
good,I found there were too many chiefs and not enough Indians. The company was very big on meeting the metric goals they set up. They also were big on micro management.
good,Great opportunities for advancement. Lots of networking events and many different positions. Layoffs are frequent but besides that overall good place to work.
good,I have my previous experience working with the same group while I was a full time employee with the bank. As my recent work as a contractor I felt the same collaboration of knowledge and expertise shared within the group. It was a good and enjoyable year and the project ended with a high mark.
good,I learned how to complete different tasks in different departments. I enjoyed the free lunches and snacks that we received from the management. I also enjoyed the free checking accounts that can with free basic checks. I learned a number of things while working with this employer.
good,"Banking is very complicated to some people, you get a chance to help them out in how the bank processes checks, what options are available to handle money, and how people can save money with loans and credit solutions."
good,"Daily morning responsibilities were some what stressful, dealing with Overdrafts and decisioning on a very short window.  "
good,BoFA is a great place to work with great culture and excellent opportunities for career advancement.  Great benefits and flexible work life balance opportunities.
good,I had a couple really great pod managers. There was a lot of opportunity to learn and develop knowledge of the mortgage business. It could get competitive at times and it was tough to eal with some of the cases at times.
good,"Imperative to stay on top of your workload, support is minimal. The culture is great and competitive but also fun at times. Management was great although the support at times failed due to being international."
good,I enjoyed the time I worked at Merrill Lynch.   Had good co-workers that helped working as a team.  I had previous banking experience that helped do my job.
good,pushed for quantity and quickness while doing top quality work  Liked their methods and time spent on training  treated people the same  very young employee base
good,Tellers are being replaced with Mobile deposits and ATMS. The CSR position is a new starting position to get your food in the door. There is room for growth to become a relation banker or relationship manger if you chose to stay in banking.
good,I enjoyed working for this company till they closed my site. Able to change jobs as the banking environment changed. Love the family feeling I use to get working with the people I use to..
good,"I worked as a contractor twice with BoA, The first time was for 20 months, the maximum I could work as a contractor. The team I worked with was excellent even though we went through several re-orgs. During that time I had three different managers and each one was great."
good,"steady day at work, change in management due to changing staff which resulted in confusing policy and structure. Co-workers were helpful and friendly. Management couldve used improvement - stressful envirnonment"
good,"learned a lot over here."
good,"I started my career with the bank in Trust Operations at Republic National Bank of Dallas.The trust department was smaller and handled only Texas situs accounts. It was completely customer focused and we worked closely together with the Administrative group to build relationships with the clients and their families.Over the years and subsequent buy outs, we became a cost center and over time the focus changed to revenue rather than customer relationship and retention.Administrative officers spent a great deal of time selling both trust accounts and retail accounts."
good,"Merill Lynch was a nice place to work at.  It was many years ago.  Therefore, I am not aware of the current culture.  When I worked there 10 years ago the culture was good and they focused on Learning and Developement."
good,"I worked for Merrill Lynch for 10 years (was laid off in the wave of 2010 due to the affects of the financial crisis).  It laid the foundation of my career,"
good,Leadership proactively communicates expectation's to the time to drive results. Everyone is able to share opinions and thought's on how to have a more productive day/fun.
good,"They look to hire ""The Best & The Brightest"" and they reward you for it in terms of compensation. The only negative is the amount of layoffs that they have had. Overall it is a good company to work for."
good,"A typical day at work is busy but enjoyed to resolve difficult case. i learned lot at bank of america, our management was supportive.i did enjoy my job."
good,"Currently undergoing considerable organization change.  Not well-planned.  Untrained personnel frequently promoted to manager level, not based on merit."
good,As the company continues to look forward and drive operational excellence change is always on the horizon. This creates significant opportunities if you’re comfortable helping to lead the journey.
good,income and benifits were great good location in delaware short drive time differant areas that i could post to however i was not happy with my supervisor she sometimes would yell at yoy on the floor
good,"normal work day, opportunity to learn a lot. management is good just too busy to answer any questions. Work place culture is great. Most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers."
good,"Working at hte Bank I was able to work in several Lines of Business, which helped me grow my job skills. Was able to make decisions on my own and work across all levels of management"
good,"Bank of America provides its employees with opportunities to make meaningful change, as itself and the industry adapt to the fluid economic and regulatory environment."
good,"Great place to work if you like a call center environment."
good,Minimize lay offs and pay cuts. Provide more cross-training opportunities and refresher training so associates can stay knowledgeable about their current processes and it allows associates to have insight on different processes. Provide over-time more often as the business sees fit.
good,There are lots to learn about technologies processes and software/tools. There are many opportunities in different departments and teams to pursue if desired.
good,"You will use all items learned at the company on every other company- your ideas are respected , your projects are taken seriously."
good,Bank of America is overall good company. Jobs security is little concern here. Salary is average however work culture is really good. Management is good too.
good,"Great company to work for. At times, it seems to lose its way by trying to do too much at a times. Your experience may vary from City to City or Market to Market. Career advancement is definitely within reach at all times but leadership support can be very fickle. Dealing with market politics can really ruin your experience working for such a great company."
good,I learned that Bank of America will provide opportunity for advancement if you work hard and are a team player.  It is a great company with a culture that takes a lot of pride in its brand.
good,Great experience and a great place to work. Positive atmosphere. Great benefits. Everyone is very helpful and nice. I didn't have a bad experience working for the company
good,I learn a lot in my time there.
good,Working at BofA can be stressful.  The bank has reduced its workforce to a degree that most people have more work than hours in the day.  This reduction in workforce makes it difficult find knowledgeable subject matter experts in the organization.  Raises are small to non-existent year over year.  The culture focuses on results.  Results oriented entrepreneurial people generally do well.  Others within the organization are top notch professionals who are all dedicated and hard working.
good,I enjoy working at companies.  I have a great response with employees and friends.  I enjoy my life and house and friends and work in Delaware state.  I would not live anywhere else.
good,"Work with a team of operation's specialist in the conversion of international investment accounts to a domestic platform."
good,Go in and do your opening procedures and get night drop out work that. Make sure your cash is ready for customers. Start working one customer at at time. sometimes your multitasking by taking care of customers in drive thru and lobby. I enjoy the customers - most of them. I enjoy the people I work with. I don't feel the bank's customer service is what it use to be. When we as Tellers work a Saturday we work six days. So we get a short day during the week.
good,"Managers change quite often 3 per year maybe. When is time to do a annual  performance review no one tells you how much your raise was and why you find out checking the next pay stub. Almost forced to put fake data (weekly calls, emails, appointments) to satisfy management quota."
good,"Lots of opportunities within the bank. Possiblity of working on a wide range of fields. International teams make it possible to travel for work."
good,Overall a solid work environment. Develop good experience and everyone is friendly. You can learn a lot if you keep asking questions. Can have some cumbersome work days but in the end they help with your overall growth.
good,"Very sales orientated, opportunity to  advance within the company, can be stressful if your numbers are not were they need to be. Customer service plays a role too."
good,"Reviewed appraisals on properties that were in the foreclosure process, for value accuracy, compliance with company guidelines, and USPAP. Based on the value, and the loan amount, made the recommendation whether to foreclose, bid at sale, or, walk. My recommendations were passed to upper management for final approval. Generally, a pleasant working environment."
good,"It is a good place to work but not the best environment. One negative thing about working at BOA is that fact that it does not matter what you do or do not do, it matters about who you know."
good,You will have to collaborate with multiple level of management and colleagues and  multi location teams.  That includes working over off working hours with offshore as well as early management connections on east coasts.
good,"Bank of America is an enormously powerful banking platform with universal brand recognition. The Commercial Banking division is very driven to new business, yet growing responsibly. The Bank has strong local, regional and national management with the opportunity to advance greatly in your career if you are willing to relocate."
good,Great financial institution to work for but they don't invest in employees like other companies (American Express or Mbna).  Very large corporation with different sets of corporate culture where ever go in the company.
good,Great place to start your career. You can get in the door at this call center and move out into other branches or climb the latter here. Dont get too complacent!
good,Great company to work for . Although the sales based position just did not seem like I would have made my quotas in the location I was in. I was offered a position with better pay and hours. In a field I had more extensive knowledge of.
good,"-Call center based."
good,Loved working with the customers and see the job was very easy and not stressful. Meet a lot of people. It was easy to move to another position within the company.
good,"great place to work for if you are a go getter and self motivated . the sales department has great bonus and base pay ."
good,"I worked alongside very smart teammates and business partners.  Processes, while sometime over engineered were clear and well documented.  Great training.  Collaborative Environment.  "
good,"Working at Bank of America was the hardest job for me.  I had never been a teller before, so learning their computer system and banking rules was hard."
good,"Typical day spent on phone with clients"
good,"It was a fast paced moving environment with good technology."
good,"As a credit analyst I had the opportunity to learn and understand credit risk assessment, banking practices and client services. The workplace culture was competitive and fast paced."
good,This was a summer job for me after my first two years in college. It was a great opportunity to work on Wall Street and learn about securities and retirement accounts.
good,"It is a great place to start your financial career, you will be able how a large financial corporation works and if willing wait until the opportunity open, you will have an unlimited opportunity with this bank."
good,"I was a part time teller with Bank of America, my manager and assistant manager were fantastic, unfortunately neither are there anymore. Coworkers and management got along very well."
good,Professional working culture; flexibility to work from home; management is okay; career advancement may be challenging; I would love to go back to work for B of A again
good,"Direct peers were great. Great Benefits, Work life balance is fair. Some great leaders and some not so good as is typical with any employer. Sometimes the process is over engineered.  Probably not for everyone but over all I enjoyed my time there."
good,The job culture and work is great.  The company has made comp decisions that are not in my favor as well as office space direction which is negatively impacting to many.
good,It is good to work for Bank of America for full time employees. I am a contractor for bank of America and do not get the benefits of a full time employee. Work environment is good.
good,"I was still in college when I began working as a teller at Bank of America. It was a good job at the time. Nevertheless, i never intended to follow a career in the retail banking industry."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Bank of America, I wish I could go back, I am constantly looking for job opportunities near me. This company has a lot to offer and the more years you have the more you get to benefit from."
good,working in the banking center you are at the bottom Hard to move to back office positions. As a manager they cut your staff and expect you ti run the branch with the nothing
good,all you really do is sit and answer questions and try and fix problems that people have also people yell at you alot for things you cant control so just keep being nice or youll get fired
good,"BOA really pushes to be a diverse and inclusive place to work. Although their salaries may not be the most competitive or average in the industry, they excel at alternative benefits."
good,"The work day at BoA was not out of the ordinary - sales associates came into the call center ready to work and make money. The draw back from my area in particular was management was very disengaged.  This is not indicative of all areas of the bank, I have friends in many other areas that love their job and management is much more effective."
good,"This is the best company I have worked for in the banking industry, as far as benefits. It was unfortunate that my department got transferred out of state as it was great going to work, the people were great (coworkers)."
good,"audit reviews and compliance checks, client servicing regarding consumer credit and loans. has work life balance but the job is stressful and full of challenges"
good,- Challenging and rewarding work place
good,Overall a good place to work. Team enviroment. Not enough people to work on current tasks and projects. Needs improvemen of better work life balance but they are getting there.
good,Mainly worked for one person whom was very nice to work for.
good,"Management was just ok.... to put it nicely. However, the pay was fantastic, as well as the time off and benefits. The overnight shift is difficult as well. Not a bad job."
good,"If you take a position here just be ready for the infamous 'budget cuts'.  They only kept me for two month, after which they laid me off due to 'budget cuts'"
good,"work flow could get very heavy towards month end might have to stay late depending on the work flow of loans."
good,It is a great place to work. We are encouraged to offer solutions to the clients. This gives you a sense of contribution and worth. The manager at our branch is very good and professional. It is clear that she has received the relevant managerial training for the role. The culture is fast paced but super collaborative. I have never seen a work environment with great team work such as this.
good,Bank of America is a corporate America type company.  Got a lot of customer service experience internal and external.  Insurance accounting is unique in its own.  Learning how to reconcile and post to insurance account is very different than daily accounting.  the hardest part of the job was making sure entries from other areas met deadlines for financials.
good,Bank of America is a great company to work for. They have excellent core values with a progressive employee benefits program. They are a very diverse and forward-thinking company.
good,"A typical work week was M-T 9-5, F 9-6, and Sat 8-12.  Full time hours were 36-40 hours and usually didn't exceed 40, so comp time was provided if you would exceed.  Great management in my experience but not a lot of opportunity for advancement."
good,A typical day at work could vary. I learned many ways to find worth in the service I was delivering even when the task at hand was difficult. I challenged myself personally daily to ensure I was gaining the most day in and day out no matter what my role was. The most challenging part of the job was the availability for advancement. Creating and getting assistance with attaining a true career path was hard without real support or better understanding to the other roles offered by the bank. The most enjoyable part for me was the interaction with my customers. The impact I made on them and my peers and the knowledge gained on how to deal with difficult situations.
good,Really enjoyed my job and what I did. Learned a lot about IRAs. Management could have been better. Had few managers that truly supported associates. Difficult part was working with associates that did not pull their weight.
good,"Bank of America provides its employees with many opportunities to contribute, and the size of the company means that a person could potentially find a job of completely new structure just a building over."
good,"In this position I went through 4 different managers. All of them had different management styles, so each brought something new to the table. The manager led the morale of the team, so if a manager played favoritism or was just horrible the morale was down. But besides management, the benefits were nice. Just needed to listen to employees more."
good,I was happy working for Bank of America. They're a great company to work for with excellent benefits & possibility for advancement. I always felt like a valued employee.
good,"This is really a very big company. A big company gives you many opportunities to learn different business and the interaction of different people. However, it's not so easy to manage a big company."
good,"Bank of America offered me the opportunity of growth professionally and personally as well as keep excellent customer service priority on everything we do. integrity is a very important value that the company promotes, teamwork and efficiency."
good,"My typical day involved learning about new technology, sometimes I do have to attend team meetings. The most enjoyable part of the job was everyone was friendly and willing to help."
good,"Opportunities to cover various areas of the business functions. Ability to be moved between different departments, allowing to gather knowledge within the firm."
good,"Good job, typical 9-5 for full time, part time varies."
good,My co workers were very cooperative and so was the management team. Good atmosphere to work. I would recommend this company to anyone.  I enjoyed training sessions. lot to learn.
good,"It is a great place to work, but they have poor management. Great health benefit, paid vacation, sick time, and bank holidays. Overall it one of a great place to work."
good,"Bank Of America is a very good company to work for, good benefits and very fast paced. You meet a lot of different people and are also trained very well. I  just wish more full time was available."
good,"I would recommend bank of America for anyone looking to start their financial career, especially in sales. They will take care of you but who you have as a manager makes the difference between a bad experience and a great one!"
good,BoA encouraged its employees to compete against each other when it came to productivity. The goals were set for each role and each employee must meet them. Employees were rewarded for meeting and exceeding goals.
good,"Awesome place to work if management could be taught and trained on how to manage people and make them better."
good,"I worked for Bank of America for over 21 years and had the honor of working in many different interesting departments. I was able to assist over 600,000 clients in those 21 years with the help of Bank of America systems and support staff. Overall it was a wonderful experience. There were market ups and downs and a few layoffs, but Bank of America always called me back to work for them again."
good,"You work with a team of people sit down behind a computer screen and do either reconciliations, AP/AR or other accounting work. The hardest part of the job would be adjusting to your team."
good,Learned how to enter data into the computer learned the whole lockbox proceeding experience job was easy and layer back I would do it again really enjoyed the job
good,"Yes, great company to work for.  I would highly recommend this place for employment."
good,A great place to work. They have a lot of training to make sure that you are ready to perform the work at hand. I will recommend Bank of America to anyone.
good,a very big call center based environment did not have time to relate to other co-workers it was all ways busy and very demanding. but I liked the rush that it gave you as well.
good,Could be very busy and fast paced so had to stay focused the customer in front of me. Did meet some very interesting people so enjoyed working with the public.
good,"I work with a great team and a great manager. I am looking to advance my career and learn new things."
good,"Typically, the traffic at the bank is pretty steady. You're going to see all different types of people and situations. My time at BOA has taught me patience and how not to take things personal. The hardest part of the job is attempting to keep a ""poker face"" to people whom you've do nothing wrong to."
good,"...Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch several years ago, so the place I worked for essentially exists no longer.  There were many areas for advancement and opportunity at that time."
good,"I love the structure. People are very passionate about the job. Too many layers of management. Great benefits. Often directives interfere with other directives as far as job duties. Lenient towards off work situations if communicated properly,"
good,"Good place to build your career. Lots of room for advancement if you are willing to put the time and effort to learn everything."
good,"Bank of America  is one of the few good Bank to work for."
good,I worked in IT services on a Tableau based product. Enjoyed the project and my manager was well balanced and supportive. I was working contract so the hours were set though at times overtime was permitted so I did not feel overworked and underpaid. Our consistent problem was access to current data & we never could solve the problem.
good,"While the benefits are good, the work environment can be at times very stressful.  Managers are demanding and many things seem to be changing all the time.  This is due to efforts to streamline operations and make the company leaner."
good,"- Constantly on the phone."
good,I enjoy working for Merrill Lynch. I am a financial advisor who's main objective is business development. It is a challenging position that requires you to be self-motivated and to work many hours per week.
good,"Fast passed; stressful. Very demanding in preferred Sales and client Relations. However very systematic position, no room for autonomy.  Other departments are more balanced, although still very demanding in a financial institution. Very strict on compliance and regulations, as well it should be. Benefits are outstanding"
good,"Had many roles while employed with B o A.  I shifted many departments while there so learned quite a bit from various areas that are applicable today.  Management at the time a bit conservative with workplace culture as I'd expect it is today, productivity focused."
good,"it is not a stressful place but a productive place of work, team work is important. a great place to work. great benefit. Activice in community affairs."
good,"I worked for BofA for about 6 years.  No room for advancement, I was a teller and personal banker then a CSR.  Overall, good company, no benefits.  40 hours work week.  Getting to help clients always made me happy."
good,Bank of America provided stability for my family and I. Enjoyed working there and learning new things. It helped me understand banking as well as many other aspects of the job.
good,"Great Place to work, many area's for advancement if you work hard and make use of all the opportunities that the company has to offer."
good,I worked at the busiest branch in Las Vegas and the amount of hours I worked as a PT employee were insane. Good benefits and great culture at the 3 branches that I worked at. BofA pay for CSRs is great compared to any other major bank. $15+/hour (no bonuses).
good,"I enjoy my time at Bank of America due to the rotational program I am in and the educational opportunities it provides. I was able to gain valuable experience and learn a lot about the investment management world. However, it is hard to advance in the company for young people and the pay is on the lower side."
good,Enjoy being a supervisor to a group of 26 - I am one of 6 Team Leads over 2 locations.  I believe that all analyst deserve the opportunity to learn and advance within the organization
good,I enjoyed the competitive work environment.  I learned several skills that were very helpful in my personal finance.   The workplace environment was very pleasant.
good,"Management was not understanding, When customer are not satisfied with the process and gets angry management are no help. Most of the team lead of Manager have no idea of the job"
good,"Great organization, great team members. But technology needs a lots of improvement. Rest all is absolutely fine. Cafeteria service also needs some improvements."
good,Good place to work but little regard for the employees. The bank pays very well but the quality of the management is not as good as other places I've worked.
good,"My typical day was to assist customer with their needs, like deposits, withdrawn money from their account, check safety boxes and money orders."
good,"Bank of America had a great training program."
good,"Great place to work unfortunately there was a reorganization"
good,"I really enjoyed my time as a contractor at Bank of America, and would welcome the opportunity to work there again. It was both a challenging environment but one where I built many relationships."
good,I love the company of BOA and hated to leave but it wasn't best for my career. I didn't want to be a seller my entire life so I had to leave. In Tallahassee there were no opportunities to get out of the financial centers so I had to leave.
good,loved working with the clients but having to meet monthly goals on sales takes away from the purpose of helping the clients. Great staff in the financial centers but they have sales goals also so takes away from them passing clients on to my position.
good,Worked there for almost 4 years and I feel that I worked my butt off and I was laid off for non work related issues it was just bank of America doing there traditional layoff period and I was a name on a list.
good,It's stressful being a teller because I am usually the only one with a long line .... A good company to work for other than the fact that there are no more ful time tellers on long island
good,I enjoyed working for Bank of America but found that certain departments were too large to be effectively managed. The constant flow of new regulations made it difficult for the company to respond quickly and efficiently.
good,"I had a very rewarding career with the company.  Management promoted your strengths and managed your weakness.  I also obtained a plethora of transferable skills.  If you are looking for a career in trust administration, you will find Bank of America/U S Trust one of the top leaders in the industry,"
good,"Large company so you can advance if you're willing and able.  401k match up to 5% and decent health care plan.  Sometimes the work can get very process oriented, but I imagine the same goes for most financial institutions."
good,"In the company people are cooperative. They provide friendly and healthy environment to work. We have worked extensively to achieve DOM Show, Hide elements and Event Handling using Angular JS."
good,"Great company, get into a line of business that makes the bank money, or is valuable to the bank. Operations and data entry is not necessarily that place."
good,I enjoyed working for BofA and benefited greatly from the training provided by the company.  I left BofA having gone through two mergers and decided to make a career change.
good,"Working with extremely intelligent and dedicated people.  Always enjoyed the culture within Technology--smart and logical. Challenge was to keep up with the continuous change, and pressure to deliver."
good,The company offers good benefits and great working conditions. Compensation is fair but not great. The company went through a lot of changes since the recession and cut so many jobs especially in the mortgage banking side.
good,Very competitive selling atmosphere with specific sales goals to reach.  Most enjoyable part of the job is working with team mates trying to collaborate new and efficient strategies to reach goals
good,Very customer service oriented. Could be overwhelming at times due to low staffing and high demands from upper management. Best part of the job is the Customers!
good,"Decent place to work, sometimes goals are too high, but typically this will be reviewed and adjusted after long periods of not meeting. Good benefits, some management entrenched and hard to deal with."
good,I was involved with Merrill Lynch as a consultant working for CSC India Limited (formerly Covansys India P. Ltd). Worked on developing a Web-based P/L report that was required to be shared with the senior management.
good,BANK of AMERICA was a fast-paced call center environment with sales/service goals to meet daily. The team members one dealt with on a daily basis made it a great place to work.
good,Good place to work and management has really worked to improve moral and job satisfaction. Has a decent work life balance but technology needs a lot of work.
good,the job is customer oriented and that is the problem the customers don't make the job enjoyable in addition to the repetitiveness of the position. Being its a combo service and sales position its quite competitive.Management can be a challenge depending on there experience in the position otherwise its a good entry point to the company.
good,It's actually pretty good. Pays well. They are strict on punctuality and errors. No errors is always good. The supervisors are pretty understanding if something happens.
good,"The hardest/stressful part of the job were the constant changes; it was fast paced; several systems, policies and quality measures had to be remembered; great benefits!"
good,"This was a great place to learn about the securities industry.  You have to be a self-starter and interested in your own development, though.  If that's you, you are okay."
good,It was a fun job at times but they are very strict on time off of the phones you have to be logged in a certain amount of time a day along with have no negative calls. Very stressful at times but they train well and pay well in my opinion.
good,"Always busy environment.  Great benefits.  Always learned something new from management, fellow employees and from the customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was actually the customers on the phone."
good,Quick and easy to work with fellow employees. great benefits and vacation time. Managers were willing to promote from within as long as numbers were there.
good,"friendly environment, management is very understanding and willing to help advance professionally and personally. The turnover rate is a little intimidating but once you make a name for yourself can ensure you will be there for many years"
good,"Good benefits, and lots of different lines of business to work for. BOA does a lot for the community as well. A lot of change happens there quickly, which can be challenging to adjust to, but there's usually a good business reason behind it."
good,Depending on who your manger is at BOA your work life can be interesting. There is a lot of favoritism.No room for growth in the company. Only thing good is the Benefits that they offer.
good,"Great company, Long hours, it all depends on your team manager. If your manager is difficult to deal with get out. This job requires  100% focus at all times and if there is any uncertainty about the managing FA, switch teams or get out."
good,"Used to be a great place to work, but things have changed with the new strategic direction taken by the company.  However, the work environment is such that people are accountable for their actions."
good,Work is good but facilities can be worked upon. Management is OK. Not very employee centric. Learning opportunities are good. Trainings and certifications are available at request.
good,I learned how to balance time and also how to complete the task within the deadline the work culture is slightly stressful because there will be so many tasks that are to be done in a short time
good,"I had a very good experience working at Merrill Lynch."
good,I enjoyed my job in Sales. I learned how to work in a Call Center and obtain sales skills. I enjoyed being in a Sales Role and helping customers obtain Insurance.
good,"I was brought on as a contract employee to help the trading desk settle a backlog of 4,800 pending trades. Additionally I helped build a new $4B deal by executing hundreds of assignments within LIQ."
good,"The work within the IT department in BOA has high visibility on the Senior management radar; so as independent contributors the pressure to provide high quality deliverables in a timely and financially responsible manner created the need to develop creative work solutions for resource planning and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The culture requires both multi-tasking and organizational skills within a high risk and high reward work environment.  Management maintains a low or limited supervisory policy evaluated based on weekly status reports that identify project milestones for achievements, next steps, and risk/issues/watch items. I joined the company as a technical/contract writer and was able to grow my skill set to include resource training, talent recruitment and development, forecasting and budgeting, and QA Software strategist/test automation management within a waterfall methodology."
good,"This job is pretty easy going. "
good,worked in collections inbound and outbound. good to come in and help people save themselves from defaulting on credit cards process payments and settlements. hardest part was just dealing with people who wouldn't make a deal
good,Provided upper management (President) with daily reports including incoming and completed counts of our department totals. Reviewed and validated incoming work and assigned to team members accordingly. Tracked escalated highly sensitive loans until closed.
good,Good Company to set a base & learn Management skills. Management was not supportive to help out with people problems... Lot of Politics & growth options very limited.
good,This is a great Company and you feel valued even though it is a very large company. There is a high turn over rate and may layoffs as well. The job culture and training is awesome.
good,overall it's a good company to work and learn curve is always there as the finance market especially in the capital market is very volatile one need to constantly keep him/her self-updated.
good,It was amazing to work at Bank of america . It was a great learning experience here. The management here was so very supportive to helping me by supporting for the job role.
good,I worked there right up until the recession. I went from bank teller to head teller then moved to one of their call centers. I eventually worked in online banking e-mailing responses to escalated customer inquiries as a supervisor. Unfortunately my position was outsourced to India.
good,"I was an intern for an FA at a local branch office. My typical day consisted of market research, Salesforce curation, or filing."
good,Bank of America strives for Diversity in all areas of the bank and works to keep a competitive workforce. They work well to balance work/life experiences with their associates.
good,"Working with BOFA for almost 17 year was a great experience for learning different aspects in the mortgage industry."
good,"Retail side is very dynamic, well suited if you enjoy working with people. Sales driven environment in progressive goals. Overall great benefits however working there can feel stuffy. The company is very low moving in terms of innovation, very much depends on direct management."
good,"Bank of america Merrill Lynch pays competitively. They have great benefits such as 401K, health insurance, also you have 40 days emergency care. But long working hours"
good,Bank of America has been a great place to work over the past nine plus years. I've learned so much from the various roles that I've held. I've had the opportunity to lead projects and I've been challenged to push myself.The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. The workplace culture is very competitive which is not always a bad thing. There are opportunities to move around within the bank after being in a role for at least 12 months.
good,"Overall there are some great people in the company and plentiful opportunities to grow and develop. The benefits are competitive however some can be almost not worth the hassle of obtaining. The schedules are often extremely demanding and employees will always be put last when it comes to meeting department goals, levels, etc. (even in the case of natural disasters). Lots of volunteer opportunities available if you have a good management team to help you take advantage of them. The size of the company often makes it extremely difficult to find support from other teams. This is largely a result of the culture, many are afraid to take ownership and accountability, thus no one seems to be able to help. This primarily stems from the management  structure that tends to have high stress on quality and performance and lack of internal educational opportunities which results in scared or unconfident employees. The divisions between the various components of the bank (BOA, Merrill Lynch, Merrill Edge, US Trust) often create inconsistencies in processes and experiences for employees and customers alike. However, despite some organizational challenges the Bank has a positive agenda, just needs to fine tune some of the smaller details. I would recommend the company."
good,Provides great work/life balance with flexible arrangements when needed; Lower compensation compared to similar positions in other companies.  Benefits are average.
good,"Pay was decent as were the benefit. The overall culture is lacking. The best part about the company were it's benefits, especially if you ad been there for a long time ."
good,There are such a variety of jobs available at Bank of America that you are bound to find something you like.  This is a solid place to work.  Lots of benefits
good,"Co-developed key entrepreneurial tools used for client development, prospecting and consultative selling."
good,"This company takes good care of you if you are willing to stick with them. Roles are often demanding, but my experience was that my manager was very compassionate and helpful as a mentor."
good,"Spent 20+ years with this company."
good,Good people to work with making the environment as a whole a pleasant work place. Management worked hard to advocate for CA's. The company cares about their employees and their communities.
good,"Here we deal with unemployment and child support accounts can be a little frustrating,some of the card holders can be very rude and slot of them can bsweet just don't feel as if they pay enough"
good,"- Excellent Salary benefits"
good,"As with any universal bank, the software systems are a pain but its a useful place to intern if for no other reason than it looks good on your resume."
good,stable company. solid management and great health benefits. Not easy to switch into a different line of business when trying to move around. had to leave the company to get the experience that I wanted.
good,"The environment was fun and the management, pay and benefits were great.  There have continually been lay offs with this company so job security is questionable."
good,A typical work day at Bank of America consists of greeting your coworker with friendly responses.  The bank provides an opportunity to learn and encourage an individual to contribute ideas to make the job and working environment pleasant.
good,Since moving back home to be closer to family the drive is just too long for me. The company has been very good to me since hiring in almost 8 years ago. I have had many opportunities to learn new things and move up with in the company.
good,"Good place to work ,healthy environment and can learn a lot. Work at times is stressful and have to be prepared to work extra hours, not your typical 9 to 5 job"
good,"A typical day in a banking center depends on your location and the size of the center you are at.  If you are at a small center, you will be understaffed even for the minimal amount of traffic that you receive.  This will make hitting your sales goals difficult as you are constantly trying to put out fires.  If you are at a large center, you will still be short staffed for the amount of clients that you see, and will inevitably spend most of your day apologizing to customer for the wait.  When I started with Bank of America we were busy, but it was manageable.  By the end of my time there, every center was understaffed and everyday was a fire drill.  BOA was actually a very enjoyable place to work when staffing wasn't a problem, but unfortunately it is always a problem now."
good,Overall BOA was a good work experience. There was opportunity for growth and even though I was a contracted employee there were opportunities for permanent positions.
good,"It is a great company to work for. They definitely treat their employees very well. Great health benefits and special programs for employees. Overachievers are well compensated. There are only a few opportunities for growth, and it is not that easy to get promoted."
good,4 years of working experience means a lot to me. I had a very good opportunity to work with different cultured people and good exposure to many prog languages and new technologies which in turn improved my overall confidence of working independently and to deliver my work on time flawlessly.
good,Good work and life balance with job security. Management lays a lo t of emphasis on maintaining quality of life outside office by giving mandatory vacations to employees.
good,"Bank of America is a great place to work largely due to the management team and co-workers. I find the people very accepting and very educational. As my first job out of college, I found this job very educational and allowed me to obtain useful corporate experience. After working at Bank of America for 2 years, I am ready to find a new job that is more challenging and analytical. The hardest part of the job is understanding different brokerage accounts and resolving escalated issues raised by clients. I really enjoyed the culture because it allows employees to grow with time and move up within Wealth Management Client Services."
good,"I did not give Bank of America a high rating however, I was given every opportunity to succed here. During the time I was employee the benefits package was great, the rewards system was even better. "
good,"Productive and flexible work environment"
good,"Working at Bank of America as a Teller in one of the most hectic locations in Tx had its pros and cons."
good,"Ok place to work  stressful with the ever worrying of job security cut backs realignment are the norm "
good,"BAML has good work life balance. Lots of restructuring ongoing and upward mobility can be limited. Compensation is fair for the hours worked, although no significant trajectory."
good,BOA is known to create a WOW factor for the customer and its true. Employee friendly with good work culture. Definitely a great place to work. Salary is not as per industry standards.
good,"The bank has a lot of job opportunities and mobility within different groups. However, it can also be an issue when there are too many teams and you need to figure out what each team does. Decent benefits and competitive salary. The work environment can be stressful at times."
good,Great organization to work for and a great place to learn the ins and outs of lending. They offer generous bonuses for results and their training adequately prepares people to achieve those results. Some managers have more influence than others and that can influence how much pull they have when trying to get deals approved.
good,". Very sales oriented "
good,"Good work life balance."
good,"Bank of America offered great opportunities for professional development, career advancement and volunteer opportunities. There were no dull days. I met a lot of great people."
good,"I like working at Bank of America Merrillynch but Iam looking to relocate to UK from USA."
good,"The bank itself was a great place to work, I loved it. Then management changes, favorites were picked and upper management wasn't helpful when  I felt like I was being targeted."
good,Its Alright you have your days where its super busy and days that aren't . I learned a lot from the department I was in. the hardest part about the job is probably getting the rude customers but other than that the day is really smooth. If you have a good coworkers there to talk to on the downtime the time flys
good,This was a contract position. Fun and exciting place to work and learn. On the job training was wonderful. Would have been a great place to work if the job/contract would have lasted.
good,"•	Responsible for auditing loan; applying quality assurance processes to ensure accuracy and reducing risk of loss and ensure policy and regulatory compliance."
good,"Bank of America was a great company to work for in terms of benefits and depending on which department you were in, pay as well.  Unfortunately advancement or trying to get into other departments (even with experience) is very hard to get into.  Bank of America provides great vacation and sick time and is very into community work and they offer lots of online training courses and personal growth seminars."
good,"Very busy,large corporate office. Lot of advancement opportunity for a financial professional.  I had a part time position and limited duties "
good,Had to establish relationships with individuals and /or business customers to provide a high level of service. Did things strictly by the numbers. Very much a work non sense environment.
good,I enjoyed my time at Bank of America. They changed the Countywide Culture for the better in some ways. After the buyout the atmosphere changed for the better.
good,"Decent company to work for, expectations are pretty clear.  Pay grades are pretty clear.  Must be a people person depending on the position you are hired for."
good,"I worked here for four years and I really enjoyed it! Managers wanted you to succeed. The benefits were great, too! Customers weren't always happy, but my colleagues always supported each other."
good,Bank of America is a good company to work for the employees are valued but they need to bring our jobs back to the U.S.A. You learn a lot from continuous on the job training.
good,"Bank of America is a great company to work for. Their benefits are amazing including three months paternity leave, daycare expenses reimbursement etc."
good,I'd work here again and would recommend. Overall found the work environment to be very reasonable. Major interest in process design at Bank of America.
good,Bank of America was a great learning experience for me. Team building and integrity was instilled within the departments. Bank of American needs to improve the training procedures of their employees.
good,overall a good place to work for: good benefits including child care reimbursement. a great volunteer program with many opportunities within the area.
good,"A typical day consists of irregular traffic through the teller line and bankers platform. Mid level management appears to lack in care for their employees needs/wants. Changes are only made when something has not met requirements of the market goals. Associates and work place is fine. Good challenges, plenty of work to do."
good,I enjoyed working at Bank of America because it had many good benefits. I was able to provide health insurance for my whole family. They also provided funds for after school care for my kids.
good,"Strong professional and work culture. Opportunity to develop knowledge of Banking, Investment and the Financial services Industry. Favoring the bright and articulate who quickly adopt to new challenges and opportunities."
good,"Bank of America offers phenominal benefits to its employees. These benefits don't just stop at medical, dental, and eyecare. These extend to discounts with other corporations and companies along with any accounts you have with BoA while working there. In my experience, the management in the financial center is great, however, the higher up management really doesn't understand day to day operations in the financial systems and at times make decisions that customer facing associates do not feel is the best practice. The minimum wage for Bank of America starts at $15 an hour which is great for a first job. The only real downfall is work life balance. I was a 30 hour associate and was consistently working either extra hours or 5 to 6 days a week on short 5 or 6 hour shifts. BoA has dramatically cut staffing to financial centers and when a fellow teammate goes on vacation you will often be requested to work extra hours as there will not be enough staff to ensure a solid work enviornment"
good,"Navigating the bank can be tricky but if you can do this, there is great training available as well as opportunities for mobility. It is, however, easy to get lost in the shuffle."
good,Excellent place to work for those who have a family and are not seeking much movement. Company is focused on associate readiness and willingness to understand needs of associates.
good,"This company has great benefits and huge opportunity to grow. As management, the work-life balance is always difficult but if you work hard, the rewards are there."
good,You get to meet a lot of people and help them with many different situations. you get to help them when they are having financial troubles and also when they need to apply for an account or a loan for something positive they want to do in their lives.
good,Bank of America was a very good company to work for. They demanded a lot but in return offered great compensation in a very cut throat environment which I enjoyed very much.
good,Great company but they are shortening their mortgage side of jobs so layoff are big and often. Great benefits and flexible scheduling. Working from home is an option so that is a plus.
good,Benefits are amazing. However the decision of laying off and not placing employees in a position where there is need of help.Oervall it's a great company to work.
good,"Truly, I enjoyed working there. I was good at what I did, and I got along with MOST of the people. The benefits were great, and the pay was decent. I had the opportunity to work in a variety of roles in the same department - this of course was a good thing and a bad thing. Good because you had the ability to learn new tasks, it was bad because you had no choice in the matter. The cons of the job - management saw you as a production total, not a person, so unless you stood out, you were subject to elimination. The recognition system was flawed, and there were quite a few people employed that should not have ever been allowed to hold a position of any authority or responsibility. "
good,"This company work on all technology, help peoples to change technology and learn new things, each quarter new learning session are arranged with most recent technology."
good,OVERALL company is good to work. Company do care for employees. There is not much to say about the company. The company is performing well in terms of customer delight.
good,"Overall, my 25 plus years at Bank of America were good. I had more good managers that I liked and worked well with then the other way around. "
good,"Not a bad place to work, great people around you. Ongoing change that becomes difficult at times and a lot of micromanaging. Great training and helpful people around you."
good,"Usually started my day with a meeting to go over current loans in our pipeline."
good,"Family oriented"
good,"I have grown and developed on a sales aspect with Bank of America over the past 4 years, and I have come to a road block when it comes to growth within the company."
good,"Honestly, it was nice to learn the ins and outs of financial services. Getting paid to receive my Series 7 was a great perk. However, the monitored environment, and likelihood that you will stagnate in Back Office or sales was depressing. For those not prepared to work extensively with numbers, it's a great job in Financial Services."
good,"Bank of America has a high amount of focus on the benefits provided to employees, such as parental leave and tuition reimbursement. In addition to the benefits provided, Bank of America stresses individual attention to work/life balance through continuous communications from both direct managers and senior management."
good,"The teller position has evolved into somewhat of a sales position in terms of getting a certain quota of customers over to banker to add things to their portfolios with the bank (additional accounts, credit cards, debit cards, referrals to financial advisors and mortgage specialists etc. The quotas that the teller had to reach were someties unreasonable and counted against you in reviews. "
good,"A memorable working experience with Bank of America. Good Team and good management to work with. Personally i never had work life balance issues in this company. "
good,Challenging work with competent professionals.  Work load is great - too much work for too few people to achieve the results the company expects. Company is very focused of 100% client satisfaction.
good,"Good: employee benefits."

good,"Open the branch do the morning huddle prepare to open and help customers, I have learned to listen to customer needs, my managers"
good,Great place to work. Plenty of room for advancement and growth and many different lines of business to work in. Management takes time to grow and develop and acquire new talent.
good,"Offers development. Busy day and great clients. The hardest is that they are migrating to digital, which means less staff.  The greatest is that their is lots of support and teammates willing to help through the transition"
good,"This is a family friendly company that provides excellent benefits and compensation packages to it's employees. Some lines of business provide scheduling flexibility for production efficiency. The hardest part of my job has been learning to constantly change with the ever changing management realignments, different management styles, and direction the management takes you to line up with the direction of the company. Each manager has their own depiction of how to follow in line with the companies direction."
good,Good place to work with a solid leadership group. Provide good work life balance and solid compensation and benefits package.
good,"A great place to work in certain parts of the Bank. My current team is a great tight nit operation. Great management, however pay is extremely below market."

good,"Your experience at Bank of America will vary depending on your management and department.  My current department has a very good work life balance and I enjoy being able to make positive changes in an area with open dialogue.  However my last department was the opposite and had a closed / hierarchical culture that I did not enjoy."
good,"Flexible corporation to work for, great place to learn new roles and work with a diverse staff.I have seen good coordination among teams.Strong dealflow, learning in a fast paced atmosphere, time complex deliverables and large number of responsibilities"
good,Short time with this bank but employees and managers were all great. Work load was manageable and overall atmosphere at work was pleasant. Good training program focused on current job position and advancement opportunities.
good,Management is always worried about how many checking account we have for the day. Learned a lot about major banks compared to credit unions. Hardest part about my job was not being able to assist customers with their home loan modifications and knowing they were going to be living int he streets with their families during the 2008 crisis. Enjoyed working with immediate co-workers however some managers were not to fun to work with.
good,Every day is different because you're always working with different clients. It can be fun and enjoyable for the most part. You learn how to problem solve and deal with situations.
good,"Was a great place to work for . I planned on retiring  from this. company."

good,BOA has a great training program for incoming managers that set employees up for success. Their was plenty of job opportunities and promotions happened frequently.
good,"Working at Merrill Lynch was an exciting, high energy, and time sensitive work environment.  Office politics became a problem. Drama and immaturity made for a high school environment filled with gossip throughout, including management."
good,"Learned how to work well under pressure. Customer-service oriented so taught me social skills."
good,The work environment changed when MBNA was acquired by Bank of America. MBNA was all about growth and opportunity.  Bank of America's focus was on cuts and efficiencies.
good,company filled with many opportunities. Allows for you to move in many different directions. Great people to work with. Competetive  environment in sales.
good,Bank of America is one of the reputed companies around NCR and I loved working there. The team I worked with was amazing and we had a great bonding. I believe it is one of the reasons why I could stick with BOA for so long
good,Co workers were awesome to work with. Management was ok. Higher levels treated you differently than your immediate manager. Listening to people before making decisions was key
good,Enjoyed the freedom to make decisions and know that management had my back.  Held many positions over the course of twenty years.  Mainly was challenged with finding process gaps and working with other lines of business to close those gaps.  Created a raise the bar environment by finding the faster cheaper way of doing things and still having results.
good,Decent pay. Unrealistic expectations from corporate. People are awesome and friendly for the most part. Typical desk job with deadlines and concentrated workflow.
good,"Compensation and benefits are great, depending on the group you work for and the manager. They have flexible hours for salaried employees who may need to work from home.  They have gotten rid of the My work program though, so working from home is not as frequent."

good,"For those with the ability to learn quickly with minimum training, the division formerly known as Legacy Assets Servicing (LAS) provides opportunities and challenges.  "
good,"Merrill was a great place to work I was with this conmpany for about 6 years While living in New Jersey. THis was a great place to work. I moved to Jacskonville with the same company and it was the most horrible place to work., My work life balance was horrible and i did not get a chance to work the way I use to work in New Jersey."
good,This company has great job security and multiple opportunities for advancement. The job culture makes you feel like more than an employee but an advocate for change.
good,"I loved my job, especially there was a lot to learn all the time. Management was there for us when we needed it.The hardest part of the job is meeting the deadlines and the goals which were too high.  I still enjoyed it."
good,"A great company to work for, even though I was laid off. I was called back as a contractor to work on numerous projects. They are concerned about their employees and have many networking sessions."
good,great benefits but too much micro managing. The pay is not too competitve and the corporate culture might not be ideal for some. upper management is very approachable.
good,"A typical day at work was leaving my house with my appraisal orders previously set up for the days schedule. After inspections and having some lunch, I would head back home and type up appraisals. After completing work and turning in, time for phone calls to set inspections. I learned how to handle various situations concerning appraisal, management, scheduling, conditions affecting value, navigating the streets and freeways, avoiding traffic and hazards along the way. Management, as with most in house appraisal departments was average. The best part was being shielded from any adversity that is usually caused by anyone involved in the financing and/or sale of the property appraised. The co-workers were great as far as I know. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the work load. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom to schedule and type up work at home."
good,This company provides you the tools and resources needed to gain knowledge and skills sets that will help propel your career.  Everyone I have worked with has been very friendly. Management is focused on associate development
good,Everything comes with time and work. Entry level  generally includes face to face sales or phone sales/ collections. Training is somewhat lacking. However give 110 % and network. Positions will come open. Move around often.
good,I am with the bank since last 9 years which also shows that spent most of my professional life here. It really helped me to learn a MNC culture and grow accordingly.
good,"It was good while it lasted, you are treated as nobody when it comes to lay off time. The pay ranges are top heavy, with very large salaries and very small ones."
good,"Worked at BofA for 20+ years and it was overall a positive experience. There has been an unfortunate shift in the past few years of trying to do more with less people. For better or worse, this has caused a strain on staffing and ability of company as a whole to meet their goals.Again, overall a good company to work for."
good,Bank Of America offers great benefits and I was able to make use of the child care reimbursement opportunity as well and tuition reimbursement as well.
good,"Typical day at work was completing assigned data analysis projects, running queries, meetings, data cleansing, data quality assessment, UAT, and ad hoc reporting."
good,B of A is a good company to work for but not very long term security. They inhereted Countrywides loans and did massive hiring in order to offset the volume. Once the modifications and short sales started to dry up the massive layoffs began. Training was sub par and you basically learned as you go. Stress levels were high and lot's of people quit do to the high volume of work. Overall if you're in the right department or group the culture is good.
good,"The Bank is a great place to work with some really good benefits. Unfortunately it is very easy to get lost in the fray and become nothing more than a number. Moving around is tough, but not impossible."
good,"help customers with financial needs and questions or issues"
good,"I started with the company in the Countrywide days and was with the organization until earlier this year.  While I was able to work hard and climb the corporate ladder it was a very demanding process and the culture to do more with less was continual and grinding.  I am grateful for the time I spent at the Bank but the next few years will be those of continued consolidation, limited advancement and subdued compensation adjustments."
good,Great Job Work/Life balance with very competitive salary. Excellent effort to encourage team building activities and solidarity. Management could use more training in helping their subordinates feel secure in their jobs as there is always the fear of a massive layoff given past and very recent history; yet employees stay positive
good,"It was fun place to work, good hours, decent benefits, and the people was very friendly. The only downside for me was too much politics."
good,"A typical day for me at Bank of America during tax season was to gather the all tax documents from the mail room and pass the work load to qualified employees that then processes them into the banks computer system. Other work I did involved clerical activities such as printing documents and putting employee's processed work in the department's mailbox who needed to further process the documents. Most enjoyable part was the people, they made this job worth waking up early to see their faces."
good,"Great management and team players, stressful in the sales roles but great compensation. I have worked for the company since 2012, the company have gave me satisfaction with a sense of great accomplishments since 2012."
good,"For the most part it was a good place to work, the incentives were decent and every once in a while we would receive ""Appreciation Points"" that we could use in the employee store to ""purchase"" different items like jewelry, clothes, giftcards, .... etc."

good,"hired as a contractor for 4 months, did not get a chance to really get to know the entire processes but it is a nice environment to work in. not enough support for proper training"
good,A place where work is priority. Coming into work you have goals that need to be completed in an allotted time frame. You work on your own pace as long as you meet the required time lines. You build relationships among your peers.
good,"I thought BOA was a great work place environment, I dedicated years of service to the establishment, however was played off without any signs, nor notice. The department i worked in was completely minimize, causing the location where i was to be terminated leaving many unemployed."
good,"-Typical work day consist of multiple conference calls and daily work coordination"
good,BOA is a great place to work. Quiet and clean and friendly atmosphere. It was a typical 8 am to 5 pm work shift. I learned a lot about granting and revoking access thru a ticketing system. I was able to contribute to the team with out asking for permission.
good,"Merrill Lynch is a decent place to work. Compensation is fair. There is not a lot of room for advancement and with the acquisition by BofA, there is too much emphasis on retail banking."
good,"My typical work day is pretty much the same everyday, I come in at 9 and work on processing different entries such as journal entries and wires through out the day and then add everything up at the end of the day for daily stats. I have learned a lot especially working with Excel and much of Microsoft Office in general. I enjoy the people I work with and we all learn a lot from each other everyday. Our management is always available for help and very friendly."
good,"Bank of America provided me with a great structure that will definitely help me in my future.  With their resources they showed me how to better develop myself as a seller and how to manage my own business.  The experience also developed my emotional intelligence as I had to learn how to read body language, facial expression and tone of voice to better connect with my clients."
good,"Great company at times, but you never know if/when your job, or department would become obsolete.  Overall, I enjoyed my years at BofA."
good,"great company to work"
good,"Overall the people at the company are great; however, compensation is below market level and room for growth is somewhat limited. Promotions do not offer significant raises even when taking a completely new and challenging role. External hires are better awarded than internal talent."
good,overseeing customer accounts while helping them avoid overdraft fees. management would jump in and help when the bank was extremely crowded. the co workers helped one another
good,"Good hours 9am-4pm, Mon-Fri at the location I worked at.  But no growth opportunity in that town.  There was only one location.  The pay is amazing and the benefits too.  Work environment not the greatest because of management.  If you love sales, this bank is for you."
good,"good to work always.you get good learning opportunities and will have work life balance."
good,Was great place till learn till exit from Canada in early 2000's.  Great team environment.  Supervisor in my department was excellent.  VP was confident and went out of his way to assist and guide us.

good,"various job duties each day, learned compliance and audit procedures, learned to be multi task person, fluent in microsoft office, learned many technology features for computers and printers,"
good,"Good  to work with Bank of America, Management is excellent with  "
good,I learned many things while at Merrill.  They paid for my training and provided a salary to study for my series 7 and 66 exams. The job is not easy. They expect you to throw away your personal life and free time so that you can accomplish the sales goals they have set for you.
good,Being with last job really made it fun to be at work while still getting the job done in a fast and accurate manner. BOA made sure we had access to tools needed to secure the company.
good,"The benefits package at BofA is better than what most employers offer.  I did find it difficult feel secure at BofA - there is a lot of transition, downsizing and restructuring going on ALL of the time.  They do not try to place employees in new positions that have been affected by their downsizing or restructuring.  Just about everyone I know that has worked for BofA has been laid off at least once in their employment there.  I faced layoffs twice in a 4  year timeframe."
good,"I like Bank of America , looking for better retirement benefits. Long term career move. In the same Industry .Mortgage  customer service is a challenging position , have to deal with irritate customers."

good,"Nice place to work, pay was very good, learned a lot during my time of employment & able to advance or move to other department"
good,I greatly enjoyed working for Bank of America and appreciated all the experience I obtained while there.  For the most part upper management was very helpful and available.  The team atmosphere was beneficial on all levels.  Great company to work for.
good,A typical day at bank of America would be very fast paced customer driven environment. I learned about how to manage and analyze accounts to better impact my client. The hardest part is running an extensive amount of reports between clients instead of a more streamlined process.
good,Bank of America have lot of process where we can enhance our knowledge. Increasing in salary will help reducing the attrition.

good,"Lots of procedures to keep track of, but is a generally fast-paced, enjoyable job.  They are sales drivers to be sure, and that can sometimes be overwhelming.  Immediate management is excellent and very supportive.  Coworkers are very team oriented and we all work very hard together to get the job done.  I have solid relationships with my customers and I look forward to my favorites every day.  The benefits are good, but very pricey if you're covering more than just yourself.  You do receive ample paid vacation and sick time.  Overall, a good full or part-time job in the banking industry."
good,"Bank of America is a fast paced environment. I have worked at multiple branches and the only difference would be the clients. A typical work day has a steady flow of customers. As far as co-workers, I was lucky enough to work with some great people at all the branches I have been to."

I enjoyed the flexible schedule and the perks of 3 weeks paid vacation and two weeks sick time, an extra week of vacation is available for a fee. I learned a lot about corporate culture and hierarchy. My managers were mostly concerned about socializing versus trying to coach their subordinates to new roles and skills. My co workers were mostly an older crowd. The hardest part of my job as a senior collector in a call center is the interaction with customers. The customers in the collections department can be very difficult to work with and at times they can be condescending. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting bonuses as they became available. getting a monthly bonus is amazing."

Keeping track of all of research that needs to be accomplished with follow up emails. Following up with management to ask if other things need to be completed and incorporate in my daily schedule. What I learned with Management is they are willing to help and gets things done for you and guide if necessary. Co workers were good to work with and they to had their minds on their production. I did enjoy working with my co-workers as we were encouraged to discuss loan files and any foreseen complications. The hardest part of the job is making sure to follow up with other co-workers to complete their work assignment that depends on getting my loan files completed and on a timely basis. At the same time, enjoyable part of work was the work in itself and my co-workers/colleagues."

Limited resources were available to get the job done, and upper management wanted action plans but were not held accountable to ensure the overall success of the employee or the department that they oversaw. This became tiresome in having to constantly followup with your boss to get the resources only to be let down, or blown off. But ultimately held accountable for the bosses short comings, and lack of involvement."

We had 3k employees in the building plus our size was over 200k in the nation at the time.

Management was ok, however there was a time when management was very challening, as with any company merger.  I learned a lot about certain cultures and working with Commerical Real Estate customers.

The most enjoyable part of the job was theme days, food catered, and after work events."
good,"The corporate culture is good.  There are many benefits to help balance work and life, but they are not always available for the management.  Needs of the business always comes first.

good,"Process mortgage loans for FHA and HARP programs. I loved my job and what I was doing. Felt management could be supportive at times, but that you couldn't trust them.  Their support was always about the company and not the employee. Left feeling unappreciated many times."

good,"Computer was not set up for close to 2 weeks before I could actually use my desk. Trained was minimal in light of Supervisor taking a month’s vacation & having no previous experience with Foreclosures and how to deal with them on the banks end.  I did learn how foreclosures/bankruptcies were handled after the file was rejected from completing an Exam. My department did not participate in most of the employee moral boosting activities.

good,"Good place to work at, excellent benefits. Upper management respects their employees."

good,"Great solid company, the best management ever, customer oriented and good salary."
good,"Everyday was challenging.  Getting a customer on the phone was the hardest.  Once I talked to them, letting them listen to me, some of which vented, some of which hung up the phone...if I got them to listen, there was a very good chance that I would get them to pay on their credit card account.  Dealing with older customers was difficult for me. They were on a fixed income but they were willing to give me a little of their monthly income which would eventually pay off their account balances."
good,"I started out working in the Loss Mitigation Department which was in charge of collections for home mortgages that were 2-4 months in the rears. The job entailed trying to help the customers make payment arrangements to keep their homes, or work on a short sale. There was a lot of open communication between management and the department which was appreciated and our hard work was compensated with monthly bonuses if goals were met. That department was transfered out of state and I moved to Loss Mitigation wich was the billing department for end of lease vehicles. I was trained with several co-workers in PA to bring the department to Brea, Ca. I assisted with training new employess and averaged 60-75 bills a day.

The hardest part was learning how to do my job at the beginning but once I learned I enjoyed it because it all become much easier and was able to train others.
good,I worked in three very different departments at Bank of America.  I began in the mailroom and was promoted to Collateral Management.  That was the job I enjoyed the most.  After that department was closed down I was transferred to the Foreclosure Department.  The mailroom was a physical job.  I enjoyed running the machines and sorting the mail.  The hardest part of the mailroom was the lifting of heavy boxes.  In the Collateral Management Department I enjoyed every part of it.  Each day my confidence grew.  I enjoyed learning the different documents and  the research aspect of the job.  I was very disappointed when the Department closed down.  I enjoyed my co workers and managers.  Many of my department transferred with me to the Foreclosure Department.  I stayed in that department until the banking center was sold to M&T.  Foreclosure at times was challenging because procedure changed from day to day.  It helped that we all learned together as we went.  Over all I liked Bank of America.  I learned many new things and was disappointed when the doors were closed.

My job is to closely analyze each situation to determine the best outcome for both parties. I take finacial information along with payments to reduce foreclosures and increase revenue. In a team environment, I have learned that helping one another to acheive a common goal has provided me individual recognition. The hardest part of the job is telling a customer that the best option would be to sale their house, on the other hard the most enjoyable part is helping someone save their home."

good,A good place to work and a great place to get industry experience.
good,"Bank of America as a whole is a great company. Thoroughly enjoyed my career with this organization. The different roles I had the opportunity to perform allowed me to acquired new knowledge and skills at a professional and personal level. I cannot think of the hardest part of any job I had with the bank, except maybe the anxiety every time we knew mass lay-offs were coming, and saying good-bye to co-workers frequently."
good,I really enjoyed the extensive training that Bank of America required each employee to take. I believe what I've learn will open many doors for my experiences in the Closing dept.

good,"Worked two portfolios consisting of about 100 - 150 loans each. Portfolios contained special handling loans for Bankruptcy including cramdowns and REO evictions.

good,"I work as a Sales and Service Specialist. Which is basically the step in-between teller and personal banker. I spend about 50% of my time behind the teller line, 35% handling service issues like replacing debit cards, answering customer questions and doing account research.

good,Good co-workers...good benefits.  Advanced technology in operations dept.
good,"Great company to work for - excellent benefits, great managers, overall a great experience.  Except, I have been laid off two times now.  That is the downfall.  The company reorganizes every 5 years approximately and this causes employees to be laid off for a period of time.  They are usually re-hired but the employee has to pay the bills until the re-hire process starts again and another position opens up.  "
good,The company as a whole is great to work with.  Some managers make your life impossible and when reaching HR they do not support you much.

good,"-Days are always busy.  "
good,"Everyday was something new at work, you had the opportunity to meet with all of the clients that came into the banking center. I had the opportunity to develop tons of associates while working at the bank which is a true passion for me. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was the clients that came into the office and being able to provide them with an experience that couldn't be found at any other bank or office for that matter. The clients come first and to be able to help in their lives either make things easier or earn more money, brought me great satisfaction. The other great part of the job was teaching others on how to provide that exact experience to their clients and also how to look at sales as a way of helping our customers and the company not just SALES. I would say the hardest part of the job was being able to multitask, now multitasking is not that hard in general but there is a lot of stuff that is demanded of a bank manager and when your not hitting sales numbers and have to go out of the office to get it, its demanding to come back to all of the work you missed. I have been able to overcome that by truly learning how to delegate effectively to ensure everything is getting done on a daily basis, that allowed for everyone to win and also develop some associates along the way. "
good,"My typical work day involves speaking with homeowners who are past due on their mortgages and who are looking for assistance to bring their loans current, I educate homeowners on different assistance options that are available to them, I enjoy working with a team, what I enjoy most about my current role is being able to find the find solutions for a homeowner in need."

I have learned very much about delinquent mortgage process handling, different investors, customer experience, some audits & reporting. I work well with others and enjoy team environment but also work well as an individual. The hardest part of the job is just learning the Bank processes and changes but I am a fast learner and great at adapting to change. The most enjoyable part of my job was completing loan modifications, different varieties of work every day with my Mortgage Servicing Position. "
good,An overall excellent job but their were a lot of personal issuses that were mixed with professional business. A typical work day consisted of about 50 calls being returned to Homeowners that were in need of assistance to keep their home. 
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was having the ability to connect and help my customers.
good,"I learned a lot at BOA professionally. The company gave me chances to succeed in the beginning and I did run full speed with every opportunity given. The management more or less knows how to work with their associates ( I was in management later on, good training for it) with coaching associates up or out. It's too bad that the company cut positions in the area. "
good,"A typical day at BofA is validation of counsels preparation of Motions for Relief to be filed in bankruptcy court."
good,There was a lot to say about being told you are not your race because you did not do what others did. 
good,"I currently review government home loans and conventional, non FHA home loans for foreclosure. I ensure that for all government loans, Housing and Urban Development guidelines have been adhered to by the bank before proceeding to foreclosure. I am trained in multi-level queues of the review process ranging from first level to final level before home is reviewed by the Foreclosure specialist and the warning codes are actively placed on the loan. I also have knowledge of state legislature letters that are required in certain states that must be issued to the homeowner and the time frame that should elapse before referring the loan to foreclosure.

good,"I currently work for the BAC. I LOVE ME JOB. BAC WALKS THE WALK.   I have worked for both banking and mortgage.  This side is a completely different company from other divisions.  The culture is completely different than the mortgage side. Mortgage side is HORRIBLE.  Banking side is AMAZING!  I LOVE BAC NOW.   When I saw a transvestite in full drag working here, handicap people and people from every single country working here, made me proud of being a BAC employee.  NO, they do not hire 1 person of these diverse groups for appearances, they are BLIND when they hire.  BAC however has its problems.  If you get on your managers bad side there is not alot of due diligence when it comes to firing.  Managers have full control, no matter how good the employee is.  I have seen it a million times.  Transferring to other departments or divisions is nearly impossible.  You first need to get an interview which is understandable, but getting selected for that interview is almost IMPOSSIBLE.  It's basically luck of the draw. It took me literally, years and years and hundreds of applications to get an interview to transfer, once I did, I was transferred.  I am amazed how great the banking side is. They allow so much time off which includes  paid volunteer time during your work hours.  They offer the basic benefits plus more.  They also offer domestic partner benefits and great retirement plans.  In addition, BAC is superior in customer satisfaction.  We offer so much liberties to make our customers happy which makes my job so much easier.  I LOVE BAC, they have been so great to me I am proud"
good,Bank of America is a very customer focused corporation.  Their number one priority is the customers.  Employees are driven to provide excellent customer service but are also encouraged to push for results as well.  The one complaint I would have about this company is that it is hard to advance.  
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job, was meeting different customers on a daily bases. I enjoyed building relationships with different customers as well as get to know them personally. The best part was my favorite customers, would wait for me to assist them, instead of another teller."
good,"My branch had a separate motor-bank.  On windy days you couldn't hear anything!  During the last four months I worked there, you could tell the branch was high understaffed.  Long wait times for customers and high stress levels for employees and management.  We were also supposed to hit daily referral goals and they were based on the number of your daily transactions.  On a busy day, I would be required to have 12 or 13 qualified referrals.  A qualified referral counts as someone actually driving over to the lobby, walking in, waiting for a personal banker, and accepting a product.  Y U NO GIVE ME REALISTIC REFERRAL GOALS?  "
good,"Typical days consisted of borrower interaction, internal interaction, and high level research on mortgage accounts. "
good,Bank of America has given me a lot of opportunity to become proficient at change management.  Our department was able to develop at lightning speed with the approval and encouragement of our executive leader.

good,"As a contract worker in my first assigment in the Chandler Location, I learned much concerning underwriting, the loan modification process, as well as loss mitagation processes. Management was very supportive,positively challenged us to do our best, and created a great team environment. Unfortuntaley, the assigment ended and I was hired at the Tempe location, where there were many challenges. As this was more of a strict call center environment where management treated staff as disposible commodities, it was not a good fit, and the assigment ended."
good,Bank of America is a good company to work for. There are so many departments that you can transfer to in order to better yourself as well as expound on your wisdom and knowledge. I really like the boss that I was working for.
good,"Good company to work for, but the values and culture changed drastically since BoA took over Merrill Lynch."
good,Variety of jobs held over long tenure with company. Training and advancement always available. Company was open to suggestions for improving processes. Hardest and most enjoyable part was being physically separated from those I worked with -- in another part of the country.
good,Days are busy based on the daily market. If you are interested in the financial market this is one of the best companies to work. Management and be a bit understanding and could be more prone to listening to staff yet they are professional at all times. This is a team environment and my peers were great to work with. Take heed if you have personal family issues such as medical needs. Work first in management eyes and you may be frowned upon for taking personal time. I enjoyed the team environment the most. It would be nice if I could have remained at the company.

Also a separate inbox for outstanding loans that had to be formatted using excel which had a 7 day grace period from when it came to my inbox. I learned how to prioritized work loads and keep management content. Hardest part job was month end when all projects had to be done before 3 p.m, it was always hard, but always got done.

good,"Getting to my floor and to my desk greeting my team and fellow associates with a good morning and a smile each and every day no matter what the circumstances are. I learned that from the first call starting my shift to the last call ending my shift that every call was a new customer and should be and will be treated as such with exceptional customer service. Co workers i had worked with alof of them for the full 8 years of service with the bank some of us even was promoted to different departments together or applied for transfers to different departments together all wonder and felt like family. Hardest part of the job was not making each and every customer happy each and every time due to regulations circumstances beyond my control, policys etc. Enjoyable part of the job was the customers meeting and conversing with each and every customer from young to old."

good,"Management support is very good, mortgage loan processing position is one of the most difficult jobs I have ever done. The hardest part of the job for me is that I need strong ability to multitask and deal with constant interruptions. Co-workers are very helpful and willing to offer assistance or guidance."

I learned a lot about investment bankning. Management there seemed to be a bit out of balance. Co-workers were great and very supportive. The hardest part of the job was making sure that all calls were under 3 minutes. It is not always up to you when you can end a call.

It's more about if management can trust your abilities and personality when being considered for a position. You can have the most experience, but if you are not friendly and easy to get along with you will likely get passed up. This is a good company to work for as long as you don't get involved in the office politics. I am speaking as a student who maintains a job while obtaining a degree.

I've hosted multiple events such as job fairs and open houses. I partnered closely with the managers to identify their needs and keep open communication with them to assist them with meeting their staffing needs.

good,"Bank of America is a great place to work. It offers great compensation, benefits and growth opportunity. My particular role did not allow much flexibilty."
good,"I've had the opportunity to work with the best and the worst. Your performance is based on your team.

good,"This was a great place to work with wonderful benefits.  The management and culture became a bit more political than I liked, but overall a good place to start a career"
good,Management were not qualified  to do the job. She was never able to help the employees with anything and she also sabotage deals do to her lack of knowledge.

good,Depends on the department. Some managers will give you a fighting chance to grow. Be willing to step outside your comfort zone and learn new process. It helps with raises and recognition. Favoritism and sexism. But not everyone is like this. Pay attention do your job network and keep your nose clean. Good company just have to decide what you want in your career!!

good,If you are good at talking to people this job is for you. If you are introverted or not so good at sales then you may wanna try for a customer service only job. To be successful you need to make sales and make them often. Especially if you want to move up into management.

As FCM you ran the day to day things - scheduling, operational check lists, greeting and routing visitors to the financial center. Also worked with market sales managers to assist in driving sales for the center. All the bankers report a ""area"" manager but live in your house, takes a little getting used to."

good,"Good and supportive managers, lots of opportunities to learn and grow,"
good,depending which location you work it can either be busy all day everyday or slow and steady. My location was constantly busy so it was definitely stressful but the pay and benefits was definitely worth it. Would have stayed if I hadn't chose to move forward with a career in the veterinary field.

good,"Depending on your job role you may have on the job training where you are actually in a classroom environment for 4 to 6 weeks. This depends on the actual job you are hired for. Others may be where you are sitting with individuals that are already on the team and they are training you with procedures and hands on experience. The work place culture is probably like any job there are some good experience as well as bad. There are people that come on board that have different levels of skills, background, education, so that you have to understand that everyone may or may not be as focused. The most enjoyable thing is helping people. The cons are realizing that no matter how hard you work you have to realize that you can always be replaced. With the banking industry especially there is always a chance you will be replaced no matter how hard you work or what you have done or continued to do."
good,"Wonderful staff, and a great way to learn about the banking policies.  "

good,Management is supportive. Plenty of work life balance. Compensation is a slow grind but there is plenty of room for advancement and different paths to take in the industry.

good,"Even with strong success, an awesome manager, and a great team, sometimes the environment restricts career advancement. Competition for the next level in intense, and only so many options exist beyond a manager role. Also, the lack of outreach programs involving financial literacy and teaching was disappointing as I love to do that and assist where I can."
good,The work was fast paced but the leadership was supportive and helpful.  The benefits were much better than several competitors in the area.  I really enjoyed working there and planned to retire from there until my position was eliminated.
good,"BofA had modern updated operating systems that were well maintained and rarely had issues. "

good,It’s a perfect place for work life balance. The company follows agile process and very process driven. You can have all the flexibility in the work. Thanks!

good,"Considering the location and other factors, the pay for this position was relatively lower than what most other companies offered for similar positions/roles which is surprising to me considering how big this company is and how ""reputable"" it seems to be. Other than the low pay though, the overall environment was great- fast paced, fun, hands-on and great support."

good,"Overall, I've loved my time with Bank of America. The benefits and hours are great. My only purpose for leaving is to try something different and to make more money. There are plenty of growth opportunities but, eventually, you hit a wall where it is difficult to move up any further within a reasonable timeframe."
good,I had always felt proud to work at bank of America.  Unfortunately my mother was put into hospice and I had no time to go see her as I had already used what I had to tend to her.  I resigned
good,Started here as an up and coming Engineer.  Not given many choices for making changes however learned a great deal to propel me to further endeavors.  I would recommend this to any engineer willing to work for a multinational company.
good,If you work in a busy financial center it works out because you meet your goals and that’s a plus for the company. If you’re in a less busy financial center and don’t meet your goals it’s a problem because they are constantly pushing for sales goals

good,I worked for LaSalle bank before it was sold to Bank of America.  It was a nice friendly environment to work.  We reviewed loan documents on a daily basis.  Every Friday was a dress down day.  We also chose to dress down for charity every month.
good,"Bank of America is a great place to work.  The benefits are some of the best around like six months maternity leave, two hours a week paid time for volunteering, and most areas are closed for all holidays."
good,"Overall Bank of America is a good place to work, the culture is one of diversity. We truly operate as one team. In my department the management team has is awesome. "
good,"Enjoyed my employment with BOA.  It was a fast-paced environment which was always changing.  Wonderful support and I worked with great managers. Would have liked to continue my employment but as I mentioned, thinks change and there is nothing available when you need it.  BOA taught me about team work and giving in our community."
good,working for bank of america was a breeze until layoffs came and everything changed. We started to have scheduled lunches and had to log in and out of a phone system that rarely worked
good,Its a very good company to work with good work life balance. Managers are very co-operative and try to encourage for take up the new responsibilities. Very good company.
good,Working for BOA was a pleasure and quite great when banking was not so advanced digitally. Now it's a little bit of a competition between online banking and financial centers.
good,Enjoyed working at BofA for 32 years. But didn't understand some of the decisions they made letting good people go and keeping non performers. Was able to work from home.
good,"Good project onboarding and knowledge transfer, appropriate developer to tester ratios, latest technology and proper documentation. Good Team work and work culture"
good,"BOA was definitely great company. Great atmosphere/ We worked long hours, however having a great a manager and team made the time go fast. this company believe in providing their employees to lean and grow"
good,"Received and process loans for clients and assigned loans to various processors."
good,"Hard to feel productive and a contributor when so many meetings and calls.  So many people involved in the decision making, can't get things done fast."
good,"Good place to work, great pay, good management, great benefits, busy workdays, it’s easier to move up in the company while working for the company, great job overall"
good,"An employee who consistently meets the expectations of the job.  Working well with the team as well as our internal client teams."
good,All in all Bank of America was a very great secure place to work. The weekly meetings in the morning were motivational and got the team pumped up for sales.
good,"Great place to work, like any job the leadership will determine the job experience.  Overall, I would work there again.  The overall company is great however, prepare for change and embrace it."
good,"A typical day at work consists of waking up to emails and calls from everyone. Clients, managers, financial center partners and other people involved in the Mortgage process. "
good,Great benefits with the company. Flexible with work/life balance. Focus is on driving growth through good customer experiences and customer satisfaction.
good,Bank of America offers great benefits to employees. People need to be their own ambassador and take advantage of the training courses that are available to enhance your skills.
good,Check coder.  processing checks on a machine that would endorse check amounts on items for the computer to read for payment processing. High paced and noisy environment due to the number of people keying and machine running.
good,"We learned from the IBM typewriter to the new internet email ways of communicating with our other global offices."
good,Work is varied per day.  Agile framework allows for highly collaborative work.  Our department is not yet expert in Agile but the progress made has permitted for better than average team work. Management is pretty much in touch and is accessible.  The workplace culture promotes independent thinking and group fun. The hardest part is getting peoples time many of the SME's are pulled in many directions and hard to get time with them.
good,Loved my regular customers. I did opening and closing procedures. Balanced atms and helped out with audits. We had to do various reports for different transactions.
good,I had a great time working at BoA.  Very good new technology to learn.  A lot of great people to work with.  The Load Balancing technology and configuration was a great learning experience.
good,"Typical day: I supported over 100 associates and was very busy all the time. The day went by quickly."
good,"Fast paced environment with lots of challenges."
good,"Worked independently or part as part of the team."
good,It's a great place to work for...but really depends on your direct team members. You can definitely a lot of things and especially hone your excel experiences and team work experience. Benefits are great but compensation could be better.
good,"I was here for 21 years, wanted it to be my last job - take me into retirement, but position was eliminated and I left.  Was offered a very nice severance package.  People were great to work with, always very professional."
good,"Bank of America gave me the opportunity to relocate within the US a couple of times always providing me career choices.  The best think about my time there was the people that I worked with in all locations and creating a team environment.  "
good,"Ready to be moving around "
good,"Your life at BofA depends on what you do and where you do it.  It is such a large institution you have to drill down to the local level for the review to have any impact.  A world of sub-cultures, but overall, they will train you to become a banker like no other institution.  I use my skills learned there everyday."
good,This was a great place for me to start my career with managers where always helpful and more than anything our market was a great community. We all helped each other.
good,basic sales job as a loan officer. dealt with customer reviewing their financial needs and put together solutions to put them in the best possible financial situation going forward.
good,"Responsible for New individual and small  business acquisition"
good,"Always busy, always short staffed, but over all good company to work for. Great benefits and easy to grow within the company since its a huge nationwide company"
good,"Great place to learn the ropes and collaborate with experienced professionals. It was demanding, but wasn't overwhelming. I would recommend anyone to look at this oppotunrity."
good,"Bank of America is a large corporation, so experiences will vary from department to department. Overall, it was a stimulating environment with lots of opportunity to learn and for advancement. Most diverse company I've worked for to date with fair opportunity women and minorities."
good,"Nothing bad about BOA only that opportunities are shifting to online resources to make it easier for clients to do banking and get the accounts needed to meet financial needs.  I would spend most of my time doing notaries, outbound calling, and emailing clients.  We would meet as team first thing in the morning and go from there.  I just see that my position could be eliminated in the near future and trying to be proactive at looking for other opportunities.  Most enjoyable part of my job is working with clients when they are in the financial center and growing relationships with them so they hopefully will come back to me for future needs as I am also required to show clients how they can perform functions through our online and mobile banking platforms."
good,Bank of America has great corporate culture.  They have generous benefits.  The hours were a bit long and was not conducive to good work/life balance.
good,Bank of America is a decent place to work. Pay and benefits are among the better. they however are not very flexible with hours and family life. and they have a tendency to close and open departments and shuffling employees inbetween without a say.
good,"Great benefits and compensation to include tuition reimbursement, child care reimbursement"
good,There are opportunities for career advancement depending on the department one works in.  Middle Management does not always follow the corporate culture guides set by Senior Management.
good,It is a great place to work but I will say that the pay is not all that well so if you plan to come to certain jobs make sure you either have a second job or a will to advance your career
good,"Working for Bank of America Merrill Lynch has been a experience. After 29 years, working thru mergers, relocation's and changes I can say have been rewarding with challenges. Bank of America Merrill Lynch has taught me to adapt to changes and make adjustments. Proud to have been part of a good company."
good,Great place to work with good management. Job security is a little scary sometimes being on the operational side. One wrong decision can end up in termination.
good,"Greate benefits and compensation package. Great Job/work life balance. Like many large corporation, too many breacracy to get things done, however, in each level there is a  great support ,"
good,"Good company to work with."
good,"Interesting company to work, long hours, very stressful, rewarding. working for the wealth management branch  you can expect to work more than 8 hours a day, management is good, always on top of you. Excellent working environment"
good,A typical day is filled with addressing daily responsibilities associated to my current position. Preforming multiple customer service tasks in emails and phone calls. Recognize situations that will require outside vendor service responsibilities in operations  and/or network situations.  Support my teammates in  technical and customer support situations.
good,"My responsibility involves settlement transactions including, but not limited to Equity/Fix income, CB settlement control, I also manage client service by providing liaising service to clients and facilitate settlements. I administer settlement control to various markets that includes ECR, US, Asia, etc. I assist clients and front office for their inquiries regarding trades for the markets. I involved global projects with doing daily work. I leaned how to manage my time, how to success the project and how efficient I could work."
good,"If you want work/life balance this is the place to be. Stressful sometimes but not always, people are all well mannered and well educated. A company that can provide best benefits for its employees."
good,Motivated staff to drive for success and achieve monthly goals.  Helped motivate staff to deliver exceptional service to our customer by offering solutions.
good,"Mostly relaxed, not high pressure. Do your work and meet your targets and everything is fine."
good,"Professional enviroment,  supplying generous comforts in the work environment.  My tenure,  a few months, was not long enough to complete an assignment or  engage  enough  coworkers  to give  a fair review."
good,Overall great experience and a good company to establish career path.  Managers can drive or stop your career goals At the company. Most leave and return to enhance career climb.
good,Great team for Recon Governance. Dedicated team members worked toward mutual goals. Great interaction with various LOBs/business partners. Contributions/impacts on the enterprise in the area of compliance and risk mitigation were notable.
good,Overall a decent place to work. Management was great and a very relaxed environment. A lot of group activities together but pay was not the best. flexible with work schedule
good,Its difficult to begin working in portfolio management through the training program.  There is very little to no technical or market training provided.  Only sales and relationship training is given to most trainees.
good,"As a Bank of America retiree, my overall experience was a good one while I was there."
good,"My experience on a typical day of work would consist of me first going to the onsite gym a couple hours before my shift started. I would then report to my area of work in the pre-sale foreclosure department to attend to my personal queue of loans. I would say that for a person my type this worked well. I liked the people there, my manager had the knack for being stern but also great with people in general so it was a nice balance to help me propel to the highest level. I worked in various home based systems to retrieve and send documentation to the appropriate location or attorney in need. I would say for me at least the hardest part of the job was managing all of my queues of different job functions as they became extensive. We were expected to optimal in our job functions as well get things done in a timely manner. I felt like I was part of a family at some point and that made my work experience that much easier. I would overall say it's been a great experience for me."
good,"If you are looking to gain a lot of knowledge and responsibility, this is the place. You have full range to work & do your work with resources. The culture is amazing but the down side is they have limited the work/life balance tremendously by limiting remote hours and bringing in most of those whom were strictly work from home associates."
good,"Has a great benefits but working part time and coming to work just to cover lunch it kills the day.                     "
good,The main role of being a financial advisor at Merrill Lynch is to bring in new business. Merrill gives you the tools you need to succeed and its up to you to perform.
good,Bank of America was an excellent employer. Shift work was involved between 7am to 11pm. I learned how to notice an opportunity and use it to mine and my customers satisfaction in regards to selling the correct product to the right customer. Management were excellent and always available for either a business or a personal problem. The culture within the company was very good and all about the team. the hardest part of the job was not the sales or customer service aspect but the time frame which every call had to be done in. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was my work colleagues and management.
good,I loved my teammates and loved the work I was doing. I left because Wachovia (now Wells Fargo) offered me a signing bonus and a raise. It is unfortunate that you have to move between companies to make more money.
good,Bank of America is a great work environment with opportunities for internal growth.  The company has a policy of promoting from within the current workforce.
good,"When managing someone's finances, it is likely they may get overwhelmed or angry. Well, this happened daily, and myself, being a Teller, couldn't do as much as I would've liked for the clients."
good,I served as a Level 1 Help Desk Analyst assisting Bank of America employees in the positions of manager or higher with issues covering their computers or their accounts.
good,"BofA is obviously a bank and their goal is to make money. That being the case, I did learn a lot there and was able to work in a professional environment with autonomy to learn."
good,Working at Merrill Lynch culture was better before it was Bank of America.  Good work/Life balance with some associates working remotely. Big organizational changes every two years with little or no input from the team.  Managers making career decisions for you without your input.
good,"Working the email box throughout the day and making sure the emails are answered in order. The email box is highly adverse so there are things on daily basis that can be discovered while answering different Branch questions from around the country. The management is a valuable resource for any question you can imagine. There isn't much ""toughness"" that encompasses this current position. Very self explanatory discovering what documents fit which investment."
good,"What I enjoyed most about the my time working at Merrill Lynch was the fast pace environment. You have time limits on certain products, so if they fail you have to be on top of it. It kept me motivated and on top of my game."
good,"I really don't have anything bad to say about the company, the only reason I left was that the commute became to long and you can only take the gridlock for so long."
good,"Bank of America cares about providing the best products for it,s clients. They constantly update their mobile banking and ATM features. Bank of America tries to make banking easy for customers."
good,"The work was challenging, however it became easier. The enviornment was very busy and time was taken for pot luck, team building and things that will relax you in such a high pace enviornment. It was an okay place to work."
good,You will get what you put in. Be ready to have fast paced work environment with support in place for you to succeed. I learned further de-escalation techniques and learn more closely to know my customers. The hardest part is adapting to all the changes that can even change day to day with little to no say in it. The best part is helping clients for the better best you can in a brief interaction.
good,You are servicing customer accounts but they still try to incorporate fun into the work day. They do like spirit week and employee BBQs as well as other activities to keep the moral up. This is all based on which department you are working within as well.
good,"A typical day included processing commercial night deposits, daily consumer/commercial deposits. Supervising teller and training new hires. Daily operations for auditing purposes."
good,Bank of America cares about us as employees and provides many benefits. We get vacation and sick time. They also offer maternity and paternity leave. It's a great company
good,"Its a good working place I work for, i like the management also people. I like to work there. The work schedule is flexiable, I like it and I'm going to work there in September."
good,I worked at Bank of America for 9+ years. There were some ups and downs. The benefits were great. Best medical benefits I received of any company I worked for.
good,There was never the same day twice! The people were friendly and we liked what we were doing! Creating a team work atmosphere was consistent with end of the month acknowledgment of top performers.
good,"I worked at Bank of America for 14 years, what I liked the most about the company is it's benefits, work/life balance and flexible schedule (work from home)."
good,"I had a great opportunity to work for this company, very friendly and motivating culture. At some points there were some disapointments but overall it was good."
good,"I really enjoyed working at BofA. They promoted teamwork as well as individual contributions."
good,"While working for Bank of America, I learned many of skills applicable to the work environment and everyday life. Everyone I've worked with at Bank of America was helpful. I was a competitive work environment as everyone wanted to meet and exceed quotas given by the company."
good,Great workplace culture and loved the benefits. Enjoyed the time with my peers and was not overly stressful. The hardest part of the job was decreasing work volumes and no job security at my location.
good,"A typical day at work in my position was to provide executive support for multiple advisors. I handled all of the administrative tasks, customer service, and money movements. The workplace culture is definitely competitive, fast-paced, and high intensity, but there is also a work-life balance."
good,"Good Place to work. Opportunity is present if you are looking for it. being a large bank, job security is present. The people are typically great to work with here. Sometimes networking and advancement are a challenge with the amount of movement and reorganizations going on."
good,It's a great company to work for. I worked there for two and half years and seen so many people come and go. Its stressful and only some can handle a busy environment. Managment isn't very well but everyone else does pull the work together as a team to get the job done.
good,This was a good job high energy high success and the ability to associate with people that can advance your career. unfortunately  they were purchased and we all had to leave.
good,"BOA is good  reputed company to work."
good,"The pay was not enough. There were many changes while I was a Teller Manager. Many teller hours were cut and we had to work short handed most of the time. It was hard to balance our required responsibilities and cover as a teller because we didn't have enough tellers. Although the bank had many options for online banking and using an ATM, many customers were old fashioned and preferred to use tellers."
good,"Difficult to plan a career, lay offs are frequent, usually not announced after giving assurances no lay off are imminent. Usually the associates are 1st to be released as opposed to Sr level management"
good,My Bank of America roles have positioned me to move up in the industry. Worked and learned from some great people. Workplace culture needs to grow up though.
good,"Part time available for college students, flexible working arrangement depending on management. "
good,"Excellent place to work. The associates were like a family. When the work was in high volume, we would have friendly competitions with our teammates to get the work out quickly."
good,a typical day at work is working with piers to assist customers. reading account notes to make sure you are providing the best customer service to our clients. managers are assisting when needed.
good,"Merrill Lynch has one interest, making money.  If you can be part of an area that makes money for the company, you will be well compensated. Overtime is often required."
good,"I spent the majority of my career on the Operational Side of the business, which for the most part was rather enjoyable.  There was a lot of opportunity to grow and advance your career.  The culture was inclusive and management supported associates.   I, myself in a span of almost 15 years went from a part time card collections associate to a VP in Consumer Compliance.  Towards the end of my time at the bank, I saw the ugly, cold, non personal side of corporate staff reduction.  In my last two years I had 4 managers, I lost several teammates to severances and resignation.  During that time work was divided and redistributed to the remaining staff.  My work load increased 3 fold as well as my peers, but I stuck it out and turned things around. In the end I felt compensation was lacking and the work/life balance suffered, especially in my case.  I think I would probably still work there if the bank would have worked with me on my relocation like they said they (management) would."
good,Productive work place. Promote from within and as well as outside. Benefits are good. Management can be a little hard but over all it was a pleasurable place to work for.
good,Bank of America was great to work for. up until management started changing and they moved their mortgage operations to Florida. This put a lot of people out of work.
good,This is an amazing job to get your feet wet. I would recommend for anyone looking to get started. Management is great and the work environment is very pleasant.
good,It was a good way to challenge and expand my management skills. Helping people with their Financial Goals were the pest part of the job. Supporting my staff was important.
good,"very fast pace,high volume,management keeps you inform on company growth,very professional,fun days with employees,very relaxing if you like high volume,makes day go by fast"
good,"People are great. Lots of project deadlines/cross training. Good team work experience! management is okay, leadership is a bit lacking sometime. It's a pretty organized and structured work environment overall!"
good,I learned how to work well with others I learned abut management. how to be a great leader. The hardest part of the job was my working hours. Fat paste environment
good,"A typical day at work .We would have our morning meetings.I would  look at the spreadsheet and determine the high importance of the list.I would distribute it out to the associates.If we had anyone called in ,I would do my work and there's.We had a great team because we all pitched in to get the work done.My manager did team building for team so we would work well together.We were the number  one team for 4 years until they closed the whole site down.Every quarter my manager took the whole team out for lunch for making the company goal."
good,Its a good place to work with great benefits. good opportunity to get ahead and switch jobs within the company. company provides paid time off and pat
good,Bank of America has very good benefits which makes them competitive in the banking industry they just don't pay as much salary wise because of the good benefit package
good,Bank of America was a good company to work for. They offered good benefits. I feel they treat their employees well. They would have celebrations such as: celebrate employee  birthdays each month and anniversaries.
good,"My time as a Data Consultant was very straight forward. There was no sense of micromanaging on my team, which I always appreciated. The standards were clear and I was able to complete my work at the end of the day and not feel as if I was taking work home with me."
good,"Working for Bank of America, I was constantly busy which made the day go by fast.  Friendly environment and co-workers were very helpful which made for great teamwork."
good,"Benefits are amazing, vision and strategy is clear, the company as a whole is a great company to work for, the local management does vary based on location."
good,It was a pleasure working wih Bank of America.  I learned a lot from the various businesses i supported. The managemenyt staff that I supported were engaging and encouraging.
good,Hopewell is a great location. I was hired for the Merrill Edge department as a Financial Solutions Adviser. The company sponsored me to obtain my series 7 and series 66 exam to work in the Life Services department. The most enjoyable part of the job is the job culture and opportunity for growth in a relatively young part of the company.
good,"I recently work for Bank Of America for 17years, but the current position went to another location which I was not in the liberty to move my down south."
good,"The company has great benefits and a solid culture.  But it's a bank, which means the pay can be better.  The management is hit or miss, it all depends on who your boss is."
good,I worked a 8-5 in an individual contributor role. The whole experience is what you make it. You can move up and make money if that is what you want or stay I your cubicle and do entry level work.
good,It is a great experience into a professional customer service skills and account and cash handling.  Really enjoy working with my coworkers. They are very helpful.
good,"The job is good, the pay is good, the benefits are good once you're direct hired by bank of America. But is hard to be hired directly. The requirement on metrics are excessive."
good,"I began as a P-time teller and within a year I had been given 3 promotions. The company, at the time, was great to work for. I have not worked there in over 10 years so I am not certain of the culture"
good,"•	Process between 20-25 customer transactions per hour with extreme attention to detail."
good,"Typically is a great work environment. You get to set expectations and meet them. I work remotely so it is very convenient however would love to sometimes go to the office and meet people and have regular conversations. I also love that the culture of THANK YOU is an important piece that has stayed consistent throughout. I am however sure that different managers/executives have different cultures. In our environment, it is very stressful and can easily wear you out if you are not flexible and willing to adapt VERY quickly."
good,I was able to meet and grow with the employees of the bank and was encouraged to be all that I can be by the management. Cool place to work. It was a great place to work but could be stressful at times.
good,I loved my multiple roles at Bank of America throughout my tenure.  I gained significant leadership experience which has shaped my career path.  The people I worked side by side with were enjoyable.
good,Working for Bank of America was a great experience. I was able to work with all cultures of people which was very refreshing. Bank of America is very diversified.
good,"On a typical day, I would run various meetings to manage different types of projects.  These would either be infrastructure projects  or non permitted technologies projects to remediate risk within the firm.  I would also manage global market data deployments across different lines of businesses.  I was also a vendor manager for a few market data vendors.  The main focus of this role was to manage vendor risk within the firm."
good,"Fast paced job, great people and management. Very stressful with sales quotas to measure performance. Excellent training and processes and procedures. Work to life balance was great, especially if you hit your sales quotas."
good,Was a good place to work. Management was concerned and intentive to employees needs and pay was competitive. Although lack of career advancement was my issue.
good,"Enjoyed my time with BOA, great benefits, excessive layoffs, community focused, family focused, involved in school drives, volunteer opportunities...."
good,"The place was a decent work environment, there was always work to be done but I never felt like it was an overwhelming amount. I personally found that the bureaucracy of the teams that I worked with tended to produce a culture of trying to deny responsibility in order to avoid or redirect blame for problems instead of cultivating a cohesive culture that would pull together to solve them."
good,A good company to work for if you enjoy working with the public in a fast paced environment. Must enjoy sales and offering products to clients based on daily interactions.
good,"This is a fast paced, very busy company with lots of opportunity. They conduct quarterly layoff's to keep a lean and competitive organization in attempts to increase shareholder value."
good,"I love working at Bank of America. The opportunities for advancement were numerous. The only downfall was that the schedules changed, which forced me to take a 30 day job search because I can't allow my child stay at home at night by himself."
good,Bank of America provided a good entry-level opportunity for me.  I work with business partners from Bank of America in my current position and they are all very professional .
good,I was the only creole speaker at the location I worked at and there were a lot of Haitians living in that area. I enjoyed helping each and every customer and assisting them with their accounts.
good,"Fast paced, friendly, courteous, respectful, fun, learned new computer programs. Daily rewards for meeting goals. Great employee restaurant and lounge."
good,"Not enough tellers which made it stressing on the tellers that were working"
good,"Learned  a lot, could be stressful at times pay, benefits and vacation were great, hardest part was not being able to get a customer a modification and they were so angry most enjoyable was getting a customer a modification and assisting them in keeping their home."
good,"in a day you take a lot of phone calls, deal with a  lot of customers, but you learn a lot and gain a lot of valuable experience and meet a lot of people and have a lot of fun doing it too"
good,"Good company,  likes to promote from within , believes in customer service , balance work home and family. Loves to help in the community  and family members."
good,"Overall, good place to work, but the pay in my current line of business leaves a lot to be desired...................................................."
good,I started with Bank of America when they were a small bank named DC National Bank in the late 1980's. My banking career reall jump started with this financial institution and I learned everything I now know about banking when I was employed by them.
good,"I started as a teller, got a promotion every year, and after 7 years I am a level 2 manager and AVP. Great benefits, paid vacation time, and paid sick time."
good,Great place for positive workplace. It is difficult with hours and the time for breaks. We have no internet so that makes it hard not to have access to laptops.
good,I have acquired and developed keen interest in finance after working for Bank of America. Competitive work place. Opportunities to grow and excel. Great work life balance.
good,"Overall the job itself is decent, the pay is good, the benefits are great. However, goals must be met, this job isn't for everyone, very selling kind of environment. Corporate is horrible with customer service, it is not great in that aspect."
good,"Merrill Lynch overall was a good place to work.  A reasonable work/life balance, and a pleasant work atmosphere made the work easier and more enjoyable than a peer banks."
good,Having only  one teller makes the job very stressful.  Lunches and breaks are usually late.  It's even hard to go the the bathroom. it makes the customers that prefer face to face banking upset with you like you chose to be the only teller.
good,"I had never work for a Bank before being hired at Bank of America;"
good,This was a very laid back environment where everyone was into networking and socializing.  The work place is very friendly with social staff.  People there value each other and the well being of others.
good,"I was aware finance was not for me but the job helped me learn skills needed in any job; organization, awareness, critical thinking, communication and client services."
good,"Bank of America is a company to be proud of.  They focus on the employees having a work/life balance.  Depending on what field that you are in and where you are located, there is room for advancement."
good,"This is a great company to work for, Bank of America offers job security and great benefits for you and your family. This company affords you the opportunity to grow and develop your skills."
good,"Management made it difficult. On busy times you were told to ask your manager if you have to use the restroom. I didn't . We are not children in school. Mondays were the biggest day when customers had to wait up to an hour and a half, Once they come into you they are livid. Bank of America certainly has the assets to hire more people but they didn't. That put stress on all the employees. I was a top performer and was treated as such. I loved my job a lot. Management was not open to hearing new ideas from me or other employees. It was a sit down and shut up environment. I worked as a Fraud Analyst II. Management  didn't like my sarcasm and joking. I was just trying to make it a fun atmosphere for my coworkers. The last few months with the company my behavior was bizarre and I didn't know why. I went into work one day and forgot how to do my job. That is why I left. I was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. My doctor found the cause and it was taking too high of a dosage of a certain medication. Then I was fine. It was very difficult to get a job after that because Bank of America put me down as non hireable. That crushed my career opportunity. Management had their favorites and if they liked you they would put you in management regardless of the lack of experience. The company as a whole is awesome in every way. First and second level management needs to be trained on how to deal with people. Of the 8 managers I had only one was the best.. That was Don Beckham. He put his people first and trained them to better accomplish their goals. I worked at AT&T for 30 years before"
good,"cope up with rapidly changing and advancing technology, learn current market trends on softwares and technology via job training, good management skills, work and get compensated"
good,"there is great opportunity for growth within the organization. company is very involved in the community. leadership is very knowledgeable, hands on and approachable."
good,"It's your typical cashier setting. Management left something to be desired, as he wasn't concerned with improving the branch because he wanted to transfer. The hardest part of the job was just the intensity, we were a very high traffic location. The team I worked with was great. By and large, the regular employee culture is very welcoming."
good,When I was there the market exec (fired and no longer with the bank) blamed everyone else for his failures.  The current management is excellent.  The only problem here is that fewer people are required to do more work on a continual basis - the Wall Street conundrum.
good,The corporate banking culture in Charlotte is very different.  I came from the banking environment in NYC and just had a completely unique experience.
good,Over 19 years have worked in various departments with various managers.  I have had very few managers that I didn't love/get along with well.  The bank provides amazing benefits and have a great work/life balance mentality.
good,"They have a decent training program for those interested in becoming a financial advisor. This is a very competitive position, and you must be willing to work long hours and accept rejection."
good,"Complex processing"

good,"I started my first job out of college  here.  The pay was very low but I lived at home during that time."
good,"I enjoyed working with BOA except few Asian manger who micromanage.  pay is good, vacation is good, flexibility growth opportunities is there.   Asian manager should be given more training on western style of management so the employee do not quit because of their micro management style"
good,"Flexibility, Tuition reimbursement, a company that cares about their employees and their families."
good,I worked with Bank of America for over 24 years total. I started with them when they were NCNB and went through all of their buyouts and became Bank of America. The company started out were employee oriented and then moved more into the customer side
good,"Smart hands partner with IT team to ensure that security software is properly installed on employee computers. Installation of Cisco and Avaya phone. Conduct site survey for VOIP transformation and conversion. Install maintain and troubleshoot LAN, WAN, and data communication equipment."
good,"Great benefits, but goals can be hard to reach. Great benefits like parental leave. Branches lack consistency and some are more organized than others."
good,Always keen to learn new things as there was always a new task to be finished. Management just provided us the target dates and all team members would need to meet that.
good,I don't have any relevant information to provide here. I was only there is a temporary capacity so I wasn't able to take advantage of all that may have been available
good,"Customer service assistance with card related inquiries, confirmation of activity and restoration or new card activation. Claims are generated if fraud/ high risk a potential factor in purchase attempt"
good,"Fun work environment with room for growth. Typical day included daily meetings, sales goals with daily incentives. Assisted customers with bank inquiries and concerns."
good,Bank of America is great company to work for. They offer a lot of benifits for their employes. They do a great job to help out their  employees in any way they need. There is room for growth.
good,"Daily, the team environment fostered good collaboration. The managers were engaged with the team and ready to work with us on project deliverables. Each day was like working in an ideal team and productive environment."
good,"The typical day at BOA was crazy, we where none stop from the time we walked in till the time we walked out. It was a good job and I enjoyed working there. The downfall of BOA is the crazy goals you have to reach and things you have to do during the day. There just is not enough time in the day to get it all done."
good,Good place to start long term job career and job advancement is available. Workplace culture is typical stress and have to deal with lots of deadlines. But you will train quickly on how to handle multi tasking and time management skill.
good,"Strong focus on results, budget allocation was fair, edge, long work hours, Job Movement is frequent, Risk Focused, Strong teamwork, work/life balance if you can get your work done"
good,Was paid well but desired more flexibility within the role. I was a top performer but only got one day off for Thanksgiving and it’s an act of Congress to get vacation the first week of the month.
good,"B of A is generally a good company to work for.  It can be difficult to create a career path depending on the department you end up in, and you may not control your own destiny."
good,"Despite promises to the contrary, continually added to workload.  At the end, handled 60% more accounts than the amount specified in my performance plan."
good,Bank of America offered the best of benefits as well as on site cafeteria and other accommodations. Overall a great place to work if you can handle the fast paced environment and enjoy working in collections.

good,I was in the opening class for the Fort Worth location and was promoted to Supervisor within the first ninety days. This was an awesome experience and if was close to me I would totally go back if the compensation was up to par.
good,Loved the office. Good benefits. Learned different working trades. Great people to work. Manager very fair to work with. Job security. Was understanding about family matters.
good,I worked for this company for several years. The department that I worked in was outsourced to another company. I was in the last wave of people who left the department. I was offered a nice separation package when I left the company.
good,"Bank of America is a good strong company to work for.  I have never had any issues.  I was paid fairly, treated well and recognized as expected.  I was with the company 14 years and held many positions."
good,"I was with this company for almost 15 years."
good,"Working at BofA provided me with new skills, and the opportunity to assist where needed.   I managed numerous projects and had great support from my Manager."
good,Very Good work life balance.  Fortunate that I have worked for great management and team members committed to their responsibilities and working as a team
good,Nice group of people to work with. It was a contract position so there was no benefits. The pay is really good as a contractor and they had a lot of potlucks.
good,"Love BofA's products, makes it easy to offer clients products. System is much smoother and easy to maneuver through. Didn't like the 1 hour long lunch and getting out past 6 pm Monday-Friday."
good,Great company to work for very competitive. Very easy culture to become part of and good coaching and career development. A good platform for anyone wanting to work with face to face client in a financial setting.
good,"Various teller duties. Greet the customers, cash checks, made deposits and withdrawals and do my best to give great customer service to our customers."
good,"Fast past work flow, I learned a system called timing which we had to track peoples who filed their taxes in the United states , the hardest part of the jib was filing we was stilling using paper charts as appose to electronic filling. I enjoyed being apart of a already awesome work team"
good,"I began with BoA as a Teller when it was Bank South. Then it became Nationsbank and then BoA. Through the years I worked hard and wad promoted from Teller to Researcher,  Teller Manager and then Customer Service Manager. Hard work was recognized and rewarded at BoA."
good,Bank of america has a positive upbeat cal center culture that has always been consistent since i worked there for 6 years.Leadership and agents have a clear understanding of the job and what is expected  in their dept.
good,I was afforded the opportunity to work with and in many mortgage LOB's.  This allowed me to learn and grow my mortgage banking experience.  I enjoyed my time with BANA and appreciate the support I received.
good,"very busy, fast paced place to work. hours are rough sometimes and getting time off was frustrating for me anyways. Overall it just was not the job for me."
good,"I say interesting because there were constant changes. Work load was sufficient, but the way upper management dealt with such occurrences wasn't too much fun. Overall my management team in the branch was Amazing, strong workforce, super supportive, fun and I loved my colleagues."
good,BOA is a great employer with unmatched benefits. I probably will not be able to find another company that offers has many benefits as Bank of America does.
good,"Sitting with clients to determine best solutions for immediate needs.  Creating new opportunities for sales growth once initial client needs are met.  Partnerships with FSA, Mortgage specialists, and Business Bankers.  Obtaining sales objectives on a daily and monthly basis."
good,"I was a part-time teller. My assistant manager was amazing. They have really good health, vision, dental, plans for the employees. They also had child care reimbursement, which almost covered my entire daycare cost. The vacation time was done by rank, which I wasn't crazy about."
good,Bank of America is a good company to work for for the most part. The call center jobs however are highly structured and stressful. Your expected to sell product which is not appreciated by most customer.
good,"I would have loved to stay with this company. It was a temporary position although it could have turned into full-time employment. I had to leave unexpectedly due to paternity reasons. There were parts of the work day where you had to lift and pull trays that were heavy and the job wouldn't have been an ideal job after my pregnancy. I never had a dull moment at work, it was a very fun comfortable place to work. Great company."
good,One of the best companies I have ever worked for. Always changing and always a challenge. The hardest part of the job of struggling to be comfortable in the same position and understanding not much room for growth at times.
good,"Company is cutting staffing, so responsibilities are more. Management tries best to accommodate with the short staff, but it is hard when customers are looking for fast and convenience service."
good,Bank of america is a great place to work. They know to show you your worth.I  have no complaints other than the shift became a big problem due to family issues
good,"Working on the build team was a mostly reactive position.  As long as there were projects and tickets coming in work was steady.  In addition to provisioning servers, we supported SAN migrations, physical server migrations, V2V migrations, and other break/fix issues for servers not in production."
good,"I came into this role at a very busy time of the year.  The learning curve was steep because of that timing.  Summers are calm and less stressful.  I learned a ton during this short stint.  The people were fantastic and had I stayed, the opportunities very positive."
good,"Timeliness imperative "
good,"Overall, I enjoy my job, the variety in my job functions and the professional staff. A normal day can be long depending on the volume of work and multiple interruptions and change in priorities.  I've learned to shift with the needs of the day, which can be stressful at times.  The most difficult part of the job is staying focused since the supportive role demands responsiveness while staying on task and meeting due dates. I truly enjoy my co-workers. This role is more challenging that supporting only executives, which has been most of my experience, since I support 140 people on the floor. Bank of America offers good benefits, has excellent communication avenues between top management and employees. The only drawback where I work is the building could use some serious refurbishing and updating. Otherwise, the physical environment is fair.  There are several networking groups offering opportunities to serve in the community and for professional growth. I believe there is a commitment to customers and clients for excellent service to build a banking relationship, which may increase loyalty and multi-product utilization."
good,"Great benefits, pay, PTO, leave time off, and discounts. It can just be very stressful regarding meeting sales goals and over achieving. Sometimes selling things that customer does not need."
good,Typical day at Bank of America consists of inbound calls from customers needing assistance with the bank accounts. Bank of America is a great company to work for with options for growth.
good,working in a bank is a position for customer service. I really enjoyed it because you meet different people and were able to help with their financial needs.
good,"Bank of America provided me the training and skills perform my job effectively. Levels of Management are supportive. The hardest part of the job is shaping the clients perception of the representatives performance. The rating system is frustrating. A clients rating can either help you make the monthly goal or not. "
good,Working in bank of america is not only concentrating on your work i.e. not only doing routine work. You would be offered with many different learning session day-to-day basis.
good,preferred sales representative was an intense position where it is an ever changing environment where you have room to grow but must show an improvement in performance weekly.
good,Great place to work.  There is an abundance of learning opportunities and employee networks. Individuals must be able to drive their own career and actively communicate with their managers.
good,I enjoy what I am currently doing at Bank of America. I have posted for jobs in the past and had to take assessment test. If am currently employed with the bank why should I have to take an assessment test to apply for jobs that require customer services?
good,"Primary management function is to oversee operations and control revenue growth. "
good,Running checks through the proof Operator and balancing totals at the end of the day. We will get work from all around the Inland Empire . Sometimes we will be in late and work late because the carrier was caught in traffic  or bad weather.  Mostay it was fine and calm until all the work was done for the day
good,This company offered great income and benefits. The financial rewards were satisfying enough to maintain my employment for many years even with limited advancement.
good,"Great place to work with time to learn and opportunity to advance.  Balanced work culture - great worksite where I can walk after lunch, exercise, plenty of tailgate socials such as pot luck,  many network opportunities on campus and opportunity to participate different kinds of activities."
good,"A dynamic work environment that is rapidly changing. One must always be prepared for a change in process, management structure and expectations. "
good,"Stressfull but learnt many things working at BOA. The company has a very good working environment. My work location is Dallas, TX which is a Shared Technology Services office that BOA has first introduced at this location, this means irrespective of the primary technical skills, people get the opportunity to work on different technologies which helps to learn new technologies."
good,"It was always stressful but lots of learning potential and got to meet a variety of wonderful people.  Really loved that part.  The bank was also very good to their employees with lots of incentives to keep trying to meet your variety of goals (which I almost always exceeded).   After it merged with Nation's Bank, the  management  style changed and was no longer employee friendly.  It became harder and harder to meet the goals, the manager was always being hollered at by the upper management over the phone, sometimes several times a day.  The incentive to excel was no longer there, there was only punishment if you didn't.  It became very difficult to work there."
good,"Company has a strong notion for competition. It is a very stressful job as your bonus and pay is based upon customer delight, and meeting sales goals."
good,"My work gives me a feeling of personal accomplishment.  My job makes good use of my skills and abilities.  "
good,I like the location of this company very convenient to come to work.  I learned a lot from the business and technology perspective.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with friendly people.
good,Learned a lot about the advisory business in general and the ins/outs of working at a large brokerage firm.  Hitting sales goals and metrics can be difficult but not impossible.  Great place to meet new people and network for future job opportunities.
good,Bank of America is a great company to work for IF you land a fair manager that is not into favoritism. The benefits package is GREAT!  Some departments have great flexible schedules if you're in school or have children. It really all comes down to the manager and their willingness to work with you. I've had some managers that didn't acknowledge a death in an employees family but I've also had managers to send flowers for employees loved ones in the hospital and death in the family. Overall it's a great company to work for!
good,"could place to work, usually fair management depending on who your manager is.  not well paid, hard to advance, benefits were good, worked with all types of people"
good,"The company is losing its insight on what matters most.... the associates. Benefits and money is good, but knowing that someone personally cares about you is better!"
good,"In my line of work stressful and production was a big factor in my function. Mistakes were not tolerable, if so you would be talk to. At times management did try and up the moral in the environment."
good,I had the opportunity to experience working inside a corporate bank focusing on the economic crash causing Foreclosures. Overall it was a great experience to be able to share on my resume.
good,"Recruitment, People management. For a two month period I managed sixty people. Challenging!"
good,"I am very busy everyday, but job is no hard. Use all kinds of system, need very good compute skills and advanced excel skills. Job is very secure for my position. Compensation is low, benefits is ok. Can work from home once a week. Most coworkers are friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is deal with a crazy manager."
good,After my time with Merrill Lynch it's clear that they are a company that secures talent and works with their employees to build the careers they want!
good,"I enjoyed the challenges presented to me."
good,"Fast pace call center"
good,"Typical day at bank of america"
good,"I thought that the training BOA gave the employees was very well done, I felt very confident in performing my duties once the training was over.  I felt that they emphasized outstanding customer service and to always due what was best for the customer."
good,Bank of America was a decent place to work.  Outsources too much though; this keeps institutional knowledge lower than it should be.  Bonus system is not able to motive developers enough in my opinion.
good,"The company is a great place for work life fit."
good,"- I have enjoyed my time at Bank of America"
good,A very good company to learn the banking industry. The company has been in business for many years. Great opportunities for growth. Branches located all over the country
good,"we are a very busy office with over 180 employees, we deal directly with clients, staff and management with different issues, we multitask a lot and are here to help with in the day it gets very busy, "
good,"All work no play, no time to get to know your other co-workers. Treat you like another number. But benefits are great though and potential for a long career. Top performers do get recognized, more about who you know not what you know. But what job isn't."
good,"Homeowners would call in to our call center to ask questions about their mortgages, escrow accounts and various other questions. Once we answered their questions we had to try and sell them savings accounts, checking accounts and credit cards, I always got high survey scores of over 90% on how I helped the homeowners but I was never able to reach the goals that were needed in regards to the saving accounts, checking accounts and credit cards. I'm not a very good sales person."
good,"Emphasis on analytical listening to resolve a customers issues, and provide a optimum solution.  A rep needs to have in-depth knowledge of various mortgage and property claims information."
good,"Good place to grow in carrier, and lot of new things happen here related to technology.pay scale is very nice.very generous health insurance and benefits offered"
good,A typical work day is fairly busy. Normally have about 4 meetings a day with plenty of work to keep you busy. My advice is to always take your lunch and breaks
good,A typical day at work was constant flow of high traffic volume.  I learned exceptional customer service skills and sales tactics.  Management was constantly shifting.  Culture very diverse and accepting.
good,"Inbound and Outbound servicing calls, on an automated dialer. Many hours of work, sometimes over 40 hours weekly. Management was not the best, and not the greatest of leadership."
good,"I enjoyed some of the people I worked with but ultimately found there was no upward mobility.  I am glad that I got the exposure, but was happy to leave."
good,I think this company really cares for their employees.  They have great benefits. Easy to advance in your position.  I worked in a few different departments.
good,"My journey with Bank of America is going good and I have learned a lot in terms of technical and business view ."
good,"Great place to work and thoroughly enjoyed my tenure in BAML, NY USA"
good,great place to start your career. You make your future here. Depending how hard you are willing to work is how far you will get. great work/life balance.
good,Their believe and took pride in taking care of employees. Wonderful place to work. I would take a job back at Bank of America in the blink of an eye. The take care of the whole package. You fill fulfilled working there.
good,"I was tasked with mortgage modifications. I completed several training courses offered by BOA at no cost to me. Management was always helpful and focused on 100% accuracy 100% of the time."
good,nice place to work with the environment and received opportunity to learn alot about the job i was hired to  do. older systems but the typical office job atmosphere with there being a surplus of employees and every seat filled causing it to be loud at times and noisy.
good,Company used to be great for employee development. Had great employee morale. Used to give employees yearly bonuses based on company revenue in previous year. Recently had many lay-offs and depleting of job departments. Extensive downsizing and demotions.
good,Great place to work if you like to meet new people. Hours are good for working parents. A variety of jobs are available based on education and skills.
good,"Bank of America has great benefits , and its a privilege to work there. My current position is very challenging role that has help me grow professionally  ect."
good,I enjoyed working for Bank of America.  I learned a lot and the people were nice to work with.  I find no fault with the company.  Maybe one day I will go back and work for them
good,"This is a very stable job. The industry continues to grow. Room for advancement and training. Due to compliance, it can be difficult to manage a family working for BOA. They allow the same amount of occurrences for singles with no family, as well as a single mother. Their lives are drastically different. This can cause resentment and frustration when trying to balance your life and provide for a family. Often, you are forced to put your job before your family."
good,"Was a great working environment. Tellers are pushed to get referrals. "
good,BOA mortgage department was a fast pace and rewarding job. My manager was great and very knowledgeable which help out greatly with every day changes. I love my position but need to relocate back to the east coast.
good,"I was going to school while working there, and Bank of America really help me out with my busy schedule. Really take their time to train you for the role you apply for."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo era muy bueno, mis supervisores siempre estuvieron al pendiente de qué se necesitaba para mejorar el entorno y hacer la jornada laboral más amena. En cuanto al trabajo a realizar sí puede ser difícil ya que al trabajar para un banco, las situaciones relacionadas al dinero son delicadas y el mayor porcentaje de llamadas que recibía eran de clientes molestos, sin embargo, esto te ayuda a manejar las situaciones de estrés y a desarrollar la resolución de conflictos, lo cual debe realizarse en poco tiempo para que el cliente quede satisfecho con el servicio."
good,Good Company to work for but they have too many lay-offs need more stability great benefits and good pay but not for long term you can get laid off and be unemployed
good,I love working at BOFA but the sales aspect and hitting your numbers on a daily is extremely stressful. You have to LOVE sales. Lots of policies to follow.
good,Overall good place to work. My department is very unstable at the moment. It is not a revenue producing department and the Bank is looking for all the opportunities to reduce unnecessary workforce.
good,Was on a contract and learned a lot in my time there to use elsewhere. People are helpful and are willing to teach so that you can use your skills to the best of your ability.
good,"I joined as a consultant providing technology expertise with streamlining core technology delivery infrastructure.  It required at times 24 hour support and we shared responsibility in the team.  At times, I had to work from home late at night to early mornings.  It was ok because it also provided me with flexibility at times to manage my time."
good,Each team can vary significantly by quality and culture. WM teams are independent from one another linked through physical office space and a shared management team. My team was high quality but quite demanding. There was a struggle to pair the tightening regulatory and compliance standards with the sales culture that often comes with WM. Overall the firm did well adjusting to industry changes but these changes are only going to escalate in the future and will continue to stress the traditional industry.
good,"Since day one it's been challenging, which helps keep associates busy with new daily tasks and constant awareness of the financial environment we deal with."
good,"Exciting environment filled with competition to be the best, the best of the best.  The culture fostered a spirit of recognition and reward for your accomplishments.  However, growth for advancement was limited to climbing only the management ladder.  Advancement for analytical positions was only for those who chose the management route."
good,The people at Bank of America is very friendly and supportive. A lot of the workers are seasoned which tells a lot about the workplace. The majority of the people have been with the department at least 20 years. Everyone makes you feel welcome and appreciated. The work / life balance is a priority with management.
good,"Bank of America is a leader when it comes to job opportunities and growth.  Changing environment is constant, which allows entrance to new roles.  Flexibility is a must.  They are more innovative in technology than other competitive banks."
good,"ordered cash shipments and supplies for banking center, perform audit and personal observations on 8 tellers. Coached tellers to reach monthly sales goals, logged and scanned work throughout bank, attended weekly and monthly managers meetings for review and overlook. Most enjoyable was the rewards points  you earned online could be used to buy stuff online, not using your own money."
good,"The job I held there was a great learning opportunity, teaching me the ins and outs of the banking world. It involved working with customers to open and close accounts, help them manage their accounts and all their financial needs, and really getting to know them so I could recommend the best solutions for them. Management at times could have used improvement, particularly with being consistent. It was hard to deal with conflicting feedback, leaving me with not always knowing what the managers wanted. But I enjoyed my colleagues, working with all sorts of customers going through all stages of life, and consistent days and hours."
good,Depending on the volume determined on the amount of overtime required. Sometimes overwhelming.  They are getting better about giving a straight forward answer. I prefer a yes or no answer which in the past was not clear. Loved everyone I worked with. Working over 12 hours a day can put stress on the family life. I loved to fund the clients loans and let title give them the keys to their new home.
good,"I worked in the IT Finance department for a team that loved working together. We all worked well together. I have tremendous respect and admiration for my former manager. My only negative remark would be that I was laid off due to downsizing. I did plan to start a family at the time and took that opportunity to stay at home with my children. They are school-aged now and if I were given an opportunity to go back, I would!"
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company. I learned a lot that I actually use in day to day life. I got a chance to learn about various types account including checking, savings and CD/IRA accounts."
good,"BANK OF AMERICA has great benefits and also the job security/advancements are not to bad. Hours are truly flexible  "
good,The team environment is prevalent in the workplace. You are able to transfer to different teams to learn more about the culture and company aspects at any given time. Management is supportive of its staff and allows them to grow in their current and future roles.
good,It was a great opportunity to learn. Job culture is moderate. HR support is moderate. Management support is moderate. Salary is as per industry standard and other benefits is below industry standard
good,Great place to work if you love Corporate America. The management team believes in work and family balance. The money could be better but it's not the lowest in the industry.
good,Great company to work for with room for growth! Awesome for any one looking for a change in career. Would recommend this company as one of the best company's to work for.
good,"Very busy, able to learn all positions, management was good, the workplace was fair, the workplace was good, the hardest part of the job were the hours."
good,Fun place to work..been with bank of america for more than 7 years..learnt lot of new things..made good friends..executed many projects successfully....
good,I would say my time in this position was very enjoyable. I had a great team and my managers were pretty cool. The role I was in was pretty stressful though.
good,Complex business with many very bright and client focused employees striving to their best.  many opportunities to make an impact and management is willing to listen.
good,"BOA was a good starting point for my career in Financial services, I had some amazing Managers to learn from and met some really great friends."
good,"I enjoyed working at BOA, it assistance me in becoming a better customer service associate. I really never has any problems while working. The problem was how I was laid off an the amount of time it took for that process to be completed."
good,"The training was the worst I have ever had so sense it was very unorganized, not structured, and not informative, it made the actual job alot harder than it should of been. Even though my entire training class complained that the training was horrible, management didn't do much for our class to be successful. The good thing about it was that you only had to have great customer service skills to be hired for the job, no banking experience was required."
good,was there 15 years and it was a great time. Worked my way up from the print room and into storage management and became a vice president.  They always treated me well and with respect. It was always a good environment to work in.
good,Strategic and effective training to ensure all employees at all levels continue to be productive. Employee networks encourage a diverse environment. Growth opportunities exist for those who wish to advance their career.
good,"I learned to maximize my processing skills,the opportunity was very advantageous. The work culture was full of positive energy all employees were made to feel valued."
good,"Wonderful place to work for in my opinion, motivated and well driven to exceed expectation in sales and to drive home the right products to customers benefits were commensurate with salary."
good,Good company to work for. Mix of good and bad mgrs. One mgr I followed from branch to branch. Very low pay for the amountt of responsibility required.
good,"Working for Bank of America will likely be an enjoyable experience, but the enjoyment and satisfaction you get out of the job will depend greatly on your immediate manager and market manager. Stress and difficulty will likely come from that portion of your job - the team mentality is very important at BofA. That also means that if you have a great team and team members, you'll likely have a great time as a BofA employee."
good,"My work experience began with Nations Bank, which merged with Bank of America one year after I was hired. Although the work environment was challenging due to system and process changes, overall the experience was great."
good,Some are open to new ways of doing a process better.  Others are not. Enjoyable working and contributing to a team on projects with potential high visibility and importance for the company
good,"Overall, Bank of America has good benefits and depending on where you work, the team atmosphere can be good.  It can be very challenging for internal employees to advance even though upper management states they will work with you.  Many times actions do not match their  words.  As a result, they lose talented employees who have endured and decide to pursue other companies or even a different industry to achieve their goals.  A company of this size should be able to do a better job at actually listening and retaining good employees."
good,My time at Bank of America was extremely valuable.  I was given every opportunity to advance and develop.  I started as a temporary agent and rose through the ranks.  Leadership took notice to my diligent work ethic and knowledge capacity.  With their guidance I was able to develop my skills towards a career of notable merit.
good,"It is a call center, so the customer can be stressful. Bank of America cannot stop the customers from being rude. It is a nice place to work. Can work with your schedule."
good,I really enjoyed working for Bank of America.  There were lots of opportunities for knowledge enhancement and growth.  I would highly recommend Bank of America to people who are looking for jobs.
good,Very stressful job. Worked a lot of hours while being under staffed. Laid offs in every department. The overall job was fine. I loved helping people. Just wihed we had more people to help. The best thing was the benefits.
good,"This position is temporary.  I run fundings to the client 2 times per week, cut checks & process Emergency Checks for the Lease Administration Team for rent."
good,"I enjoyed my work there .. was always a team member willing to help you understand or pick up the slack if necessary.    I learned how to create a bid no matter what it state it was for."
good,"Was a good company to work for, but to much BS where I was at with management. I had to many of them the whole time I was there. I would have wished the pay was better."
good,While working for Bank of America I have greatly improved my communication skills. I helped get my customers the products and services they needed. I made people's financial lives better.
good,everything is very streamlined and the managers there are very down to business. It seems like a call center without the calls. Everyone is pretty quiet and tend to stay to themselves
good,"Great company to work for. Sometimes it's size / having worked there too long might be an issue on career advancements. "

Big supporters of Christmas In April and blood drives which gave me a sense of giving back to the community it serves."

good,"I work in a call center with Bank of America.  My experience has been very good and positive.  Bank of America gave me an opportunity and I seized it.  I had no prior call Center nor banking experience.  After retiring from a nearly 30 year food service management career.  The training is excellent.  The support from the leaders is excellent.  Associates must perform the work up the expectations of the organization.  And there are very clear expectations.  A very well organized, intelligent, hard-working person can thrive in the Call Center Environment. When a customer calls in about a problem or service issue, we must evaluate and solve the issue; we also determine if we have a solution to help the customer.  The only pressure is to look at the relationship and have a conversation with the customer.  It's not that hard.  Yes, customers get angry at the bank about fees, poor service issues, etc.  But we are given tools, resources and excellent training to deal with these customers.  When we do not do what we are supposed to do, leaders pull us aside and very, and mean very, kindly coach us to do better.  I have seen people leave for not doing their work.  We are paid quite well for the work we do. After six months I felt comfortable in my performance.  Bank of America leaders felt the same.  I moved to OJT coach.  In six months I moved to training new associates!  After that gig, I moved to a higher level of service.  I did that for about 6 months and moved to Team Lead.  There are opportunities, if you work for them!"

good,"Great company to work for, great benefits. However, frequent layoff due to department closure or re-organization of departments."
good,Great co-workers but a very large company with very specific positions which do not provide exposure to learning about various other processes in the banking process for clients. I did not see myself growing my career there given this.
good,Management is professional. They take time to understand you and work with you in a team environment. You have the opportunity to advance in this company.

The most enjoyable part of my most recent job was working with a team who helped me to learn my position and be extremely successful.  My only regret is that Bank of America needs to focus on placement of dedicated, hard working successful achievers and try to help them locate another position within the company should there be a restructure within the organization.  A lot of talent has been lost from Bank of America due to reorganization and downsizing."

During this time I was able to work with my senior leadership on various projects and manage to those expectations to meet the common goal. I was fortunate to work with some of the most engaging and goal oriented leadership team during my career. The most difficult portion of the job was the balance of work/life due to the sheer volume our staff encountered following the creation of our department shortly after I began my career with Bank of America. The most enjoyable portion was being able to leverage some of the amazing talent, lead them in various and/or multiple projects, and share in their success.

I learned leveraging the DMAIC framework, also Agile scheduling methodologies. Management at BofA was highly vertical, Sr. Leadership decision making was often painfully slow.

During my time with Bank of America, I learned that having a mentor could make or break your career. Management is often dedicated to special projects for the majority of their time and frequently out of the office which makes it important to be your own expert.

It could be a fast paced, no time to catch your breath day or a slow paced to audit work and finish old projects that you were able to put on hold for new priorities. Management is always willing to teach you new roles and programs in order to benefit employee knowledge. Moving up in the departments can be hard at times as High Level Management does not have a high turn over rate so there is not a lot of movement in that area. I like that we are able to team up and do projects together to get to know associates from other departments as well as being able to work alone and figure out solutions in your own matter as well."

My last position was very enjoyable as I was on the team who audited our foreclosure attorneys. We needed to know state specific laws and guidelines. We had to audit the time the paperwork was sent to the mortgagor and if it was executed and recorded timely. I don't know that there was a ""hard"" part of the job, but it was difficult to get the attorney's to meet the document deadlines. We would call and they would say they'd get the documents to us by end of business but they wouldn't."

I still have the same TL, which is not qualified to lead ANY team; however, in my new position, so far the upper management seems highly qualified and are ready and willing to show their appreciation for a job well done.

My management team consisted of one person, who in my opinion didn't have much interaction with our team.

After we opened the doors to the public, we would spend the day assisting customers with common transactions as well as warmly transferring them over to a banker with any issues. I learned how to handle difficult customers during this time and not let anything  be taken to heart. I learned that customers were not upset with me but just with the situation and I had to be okay with that. I learned how to answer difficult questions and warmly transfer them to who they needed to be transferred too, whether that be a banker or a manager. My co-workers were all very pleasant and I grew very fond of them. I think the hardest part of the job was actually having to say goodbye to it. By moving to Chico to attend Chico State, I could not keep my job in El Dorado Hills.

Mornings always stat out with getting the team set up for success with supplies and any other needs such as money or call backs.

I have learned all the ways to process checks, invoices, and correspondences.  I have also learned how to look for errors in the work and how to reject certain items.  Management was alright, but they always demanded better results for productivity even though we were meeting our goals.  The co-workers at Bank of America are all very nice and I haven't had problems with any of them.  The hardest part of the job is trying to exceed in production and the fact that I was working night-shift.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the events and recognitions that Bank of America has fairly often."

I ended up quitting within a week! I cried everyday I had to go there! Before I quit I asked if I could be transferred and I was told no and there would be no advancement for me because I wasn't bilingual. So over all I would say bank of america wasn't a bad company to work for however it depends on who you work with!!

good,"Bank of America is a good company to work for, but it is not good for those that are seeking alternative career paths. It limits to what you can do because they only look at your current position and not what you have done academically or what you are capable of from your past experience, which makes their business inefficient. "
good,Bank of America is a great place to work. I've enjoyed my job and made a lot of wonderful friends. The flex hours are great which allows you to balance your work and life activities.

The hardest part about the job that I come to notice was moral, the moral and lack of motivation had decreased. My manager did his very best to make sure that we all knew that he appreciated our work, I really feel that he was one of the best managers that I had at the Bank. "

good,"Everyday we are responsible to driving sales to meet our monthly sales goal.  Depending on the staffing of the day, we can be busy or a slow day.  If managers are too busy, we are responsible to take care of our every day business with customers and co-workers.  Due to the traffic in our bank, it is harder to achieve our sales goal on a day to day basis. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help a customer in need.  When I know I have done what is right for the customer and lift a weight off of their shoulders. "

I was fortunate that in my last year in this position I was given the opportunity to supervise and was able to apply some management skills as to how to deal with others.  This made it a lot easier to deal with co-workers.  The hardest part was having to deal with irate clients.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being recognized for a job well done."

I love my schedule now but you most likely won't get a great schedule to start with.  Time off is great, 3 weeks to start.  Most Holidays off and if your not off, your getting paid extra.  Cons:  Management help is so so, depends on the manager.  The job can get monotonous and you sit at a desk all day.  You get two paid 15 minute breaks and an unpaid 30 minute lunch."

good,"From their sales processes to services to products designed to enhance the client's life, Bank of America takes a holistic approach to building relationships with their communities.  This includes state of the art products and services that challenge the status quo and encourage banking that meets the changing demands of the consumer.  They operate with a focus on being nimble and efficient and hire those associates who can deliver both.  There is a strong network for women to further develop their careers and provide a landscape that encourages creativity and passion in all that you do."
good,"Working as a CSR/Teller was overall a good experience where I learned how to develop many skills. As my first job I was able to learn how to interact with customers, show personal interest while at the same time taking care of their transaction accurately, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I knew part of our job was to refer customers to the banker, what I didn't know was you can be written up if you didn't meet a  quota at the end of the quarter. With every customer you had to take the opportunity to refer a credit card, savings account, home equity, car loan, etc (depending on what they qualified) to the banker. This was difficult because you see the same customers every week even every day and you already know their view regarding whatever you offered, which was ""I'm fine I really don't need it."" I realized if you're not comfortable or enjoy selling products to people this job can become stressful and discouraging. Selling is a huge part of your job and what you will be evaluated in every quarter. It can possibly cost you your job if you can't meet a certain number. That's the only downside to working at a corporate bank where the expectations or standards are very high in regards to sales. Other than that the benefits are good and your manager can try to adapt to your schedule too.  Depending on your branch and number of employees you may have to work on Saturdays every other week (half day only) and if they're short on employees you may have to work more hours than what you signed up for.  If you're a person that is detailed, loves people, and enjoys selling this is a job for"

good,"Co-workers and Management teams are supportive and friendly. There is a lot of opportunity to learn (many training classes available at no charge).  Associates are encouraged to participate in volunteer events and the company will pay you for your time away volunteering. The Chandler campus plans many employee events throughout the year and encourage associates to attend. Although the volunteer and employee events are great benefits, I found employees have too much work on their plates and cannot participate (unless they want to work nights and weekends to catch up with work).  The hardest part of working at BofA was the stress of trying to get the work done when there never seemed to be enough people to do the job. Layoffs happened too often and the work that was left by those laid off, fell to the employees left behind."
good,My experience at BofA was pretty good. I was treated fairly and the opportunity for advancement or even to try a different role within was available. Benefits were great and the people were awesome.
good,Bank of America was good because I enjoy helping customers. The sales goals are sometimes unrealistic for the market. They raise each time you finally reach them. Salary isn’t worth it in my opinion.

good,"If you work here expect to always be told to sell even if there's days were no one wants to accept an offer. Since theres more resources which the client can make transactions there will only be you and another teller so when ever it gets busy also expect people to get mad at you (especially when you HAVE to ask them about an offer) Basically if you struggle in communication and/or in selling this job will frustrate you since its the most percentage for your score card. If you dont meet the goal well you cant really advance. Now for the positive aspects of this job is you get great benefits and you get to have Medical, vision, dental insurance with vacation and sick days."

good,As an fcam you are pretty much a high paid teller. They only have part time tellers no full time tellers and have the fcam open a cash box. You are required to have a cash box and also supervise your other tellers at the same time.
good,"There is always job rotation, usually without notice or input from the associates.  The benefits are excellent and diversity programs are expanding and keep improving but are already really good.  Career path and training leave some to be desired.  Good company overall to work for.  They are doing away with their work from home program which was a huge benefit and attraction."
good,"I loved BOA while I was there, great manager.  However, the location was shut down so I had to leave there was no other location near me.   One of my supervisors is still a very good friend, she had health issues while at BOA and they worked with her as far as schedules went."

I speak very highly about the company and the wonderful people there who were very hard working.  It wasn't until my last year with BOA that there was a derogatory change in management, sales goals and downsizing that made me consider leaving.  Unfortunately, my position was being eliminated across the franchise, but I was given a very generous severance package.  I would definitely work for them again."
good,Typical day at work is reviewing accounts on real time systems making sure there is no fraud. I have learned a lot about fraud and how to spot and catch it. The hard part of the job is staying focus cause you're tied to a computer all day. The best part is you so get to help people. There's is just not a lot of room to advance. Management is okay they do the best they can.
good,"Working as a Visual Specialist is stressful due to micromanaging.  The benefits are excellent, but the numerous and extensive statistics that is required for each day is excessive.  The most enjoyable  part of the job was the monthly friendly team competitions and activities."
good,"7-8 hours of Customer service interaction, learned to identify patterns of our clients by their using our products and how to service them with respect. Management was company driven. Working progress,in improving work morale. The hardest part was sometimes keeping pace with the work load, personal attention with our clients concerns.

Hardest parts of the job, having a quarterly discussion with AVP in which they explained why they wouldn't be giving you your full commission check. After working hard for three months and killing the numbers the last thing you want to find out is that you aren't going to get your full commission check because of some specific metric that the AVP was focusing on.  The second was having discussions with customers about over drafting.  It was almost always that people that couldn't afford to overdraw their account.

good,Very stressful to work at such a competitive bank but the fact they are very stable makes it worth knowing you have job security & advancement opportunities if you can work hard & sell. The manager I had at the end was the type who delegated a lot of her job & took credit for your work & if something went wrong it was always everyone else’s fault instead of hers. She was rude & played her job like a game where she put on one face when corporate visitors came in she was perfect & nice but not her true face.

A typical busy day at work is starting off with a morning team meeting, next if you don't have appointments early in the morning, making your calls or confirming your appointments for that day. My most current team has been one of the most hardworking and welcoming of them all. There is never a day where we don't congratulate each other for what they have accomplished that day.

good,"My time at Bank of America was mostly positive.  It is possible to have your career stagnate if you work for a manager that isn't motivated to promote their direct reports.  My team also went almost 2 years without any kind of raise because of constant turnover in management.  While I was there the biggest negative was the constant layoffs at then end of each calendar year, usually just before Thanksgiving.  This would happen even when the bank was setting record net profits.  I was fortunate enough to ask about an open position that created additional opportunities for me.  Management did give my team the authority to make most decisions on our own without having to get approvals from layers of management, which was great.  I was also given the opportunity to work from home, which eliminated a bad commute to Dallas."

We had 7 minutes to verify that person, find out what the issue was and give them great customer service. A lot of the time the calls were long because almost all call was a person that was angry and would go on and on.

good,"It is a great company but being in retail is like being in retail everywhere. Average day is spent trying to scrape the barrel in the financial center for widget selling even though they say its ""not"" that. Sure. Lots of regional and market micromanagement on aforementioned widget selling. Labeled as finding solutions for customers but really it is just to make you feel better about pressuring people into increasing their banking relationship."

In my time with the bank, I worked in three different departments, the Mail Room, Mail-Sort Services, and Bookkeeping Exceptions. In Bookkeeping Exceptions, my responsibility was to research unposted debits and credits to bank customers' accounts to determine which accounts they should be correctly posted to. The bank was a good place to work. The hardest part of the job was dealing with certain particular people in my department but most of my co-workers were pretty easy to work with.

This was one of the many perks of the job that we all enjoyed and knew we could achieve.  The most difficult part of the job was the long hours,  being the manager makes you the business owner and your business must succeed. The most enjoyable part of this job  would be working with individual clients who confide in you the most amazing life experiences that you never forget. At times, even friendships and aqcuaintances formed."
good,"My experience as an employee for Bank of America has been good. If you have ambition and show initiative, there are plenty of opportunities to take on large bits of responsibility and give yourself a very robust learning opportunity. The expanse of knowledge across the employees and the company culture and routines are well established. I spent time in their Tech and Ops department, which has been undergoing reduction in head count over some years now. As such, promotion opportunities are starting to dry up in that area, however, there are still pockets of grown (information security, etc.). Across the broader business-facing bank, there is great opportunity."

good,BOA was a good place to work with a great and positive atmosphere for it's employees. The pace of work was steady so it wasn't stressful and they have great benefits.
good,Needless to say they want the best but at the same time they seem to have pretty lofty goals based on the performance of that branch from last year. They do at least have the courtesy to train you for your first two months and slowly ramp up your goals for your first quarter but after that you are on your own.

Though the salaries could be higher, they do offer great medical benefits and other types of benefits that can help offset that including tuition reimbursement and discounts on many items and at many places. There's also a lot of opportunities to learn additional skills whether through the Learning Hub or through the various employee networks. Its really up to the employee to take advantage of what the firm offers."
good,I enjoyed the people I was working with and loved the benefits. Unfortunately they changed the rules and regulations regarding advancement. I would work for them again

good,"Great company to work for. Manager are helpful and knowledgeable."
good,"I had the privilege of having an amazing manager who works endlessly to improve our sales goals to obtain a promotion and our work product. I have also had the privilege to work with a staff that is willing to support and help in the work load and procedural demands of workplace tasks. I feel that anyone in this company can get promoted if they seek it out. Do not wait to be asked for an opening position. You have the sales numbers and work product, just go get it. The only thing I will say that the process to get promoted is long and there might be a chance one may work in a different location (which at times can be far)."
good,Merrill Lynch was a great place to work and I would still be there today if my division didn't merge with BlackRock. The people and culture were great and although work was demanding people were civil and fair to each other.

good,Had a good computing environment and a good life balance. Worked at merging data from subsidiaries into the corporate database.  Worked on some code generation techniques to allow future imports

good,Bank of america is a great company with lots of opportunities. If you are a go getter you can definitely make it a career and change your life!! You definitely must pay attention to regulatory standards and creating your band to the best of your ability.
good,I worked at Bank of America for nearly 5 years. I loved my co-workers and the managers but the company kept changing the loan processing. The changes were the end of my location because upper management couldn't figure out what was the best approach so they kept changing the processes. This caused discord among the employees. No one liked the new process and everyone struggled with the changes. Eventually our site shut down entirely which I do believe could have been avoided by just making the one change and sticking to it.
good,"Bank of America was a very diverse environment, I've built my communication skills. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with different people."
good,"Good environment for work and fun, people are friendly at Bank of America although i was from foreign land, Helped me with my work as well as settle down at my locality."

good,Working for Bank of America has been a great experience and has taught me how to better provide for the customer with the resources that are available. The immediate managers that I've had the privilege to work with have always gone above what is expected of them to help you succeed in the company. The co-workers are like a close knit families and are always willing to help whenever a question should come up.  The hardest part of this job is to know all of the procedures to get the jobs done along with following and complying with the government regulations that could impact the company.
good,"Great benefits, but really competitive. Sometimes you have to work under a lot of pressure. Nice people. The company also has many training programs and resources to ensure your success in the role."

good,I enjoyed the day to day challenges towards giving the customers what they needed.  When I was there we had some of the best managers over the years.  The hardest part at times was staying alert some nights.
good,"Very nice people to work with. Although benefits are excellent, your monthly income is really bad. They offer incentives that are almost impossible to reach, can people reach Mount Everest? Sure many have made it. That is the company approach. People stay years in the company waiting  for a better position or to receive more compensation. Life is too short. People should be able to grow year after year!"
good,BoA is a great place to work.  They encouraged self-development and challenge you to better yourself.  They care about their employees and the communities they serve.
good,"I enjoy the customer service experience, every day is different. Helping people and at the same time meeting the banks goals was an every day fun challenge."

good,"Working for Bank of America was a good job. the pay was good, the hours were fixed, and you know that you will always be off on pretty much every holiday there is. Now I don't know if this has changed or not, but when I worked there your job depended on how many checking accounts and credit cards you managed to sell per week. You were supposed to ask every single person if they wanted to apply to open a new credit card or checking account. I had a problem doing that. I hated asking people who clearly DIDN'T have any money or who were constantly overdrawn if they wanted a credit card. It just made me uncomfortable. Again, I don't know if it's changed, but if you can do that, then this is the job for you."
good,Call volume was steady each day and having different customers and situations each call made the job exciting instead of boring.  No 2 calls were same although the policy or procedure regarding answering the call may have been the same.
good,"we got paid. "
good,"Job is ok however is very repetitive and can get very boring "

good,I was very fortunate to work with a great group of individuals even though we were winding down many of the departments at the mortgage side of the bank.  Everyone had a great attitude and outlook.  It was difficult to transfer out of the group because the bank was moving the mortgage activities to third party vendors.

good,I did not like doing the exact same thing over and over every single day. I need variety and excitement. It was always so quiet. Most of my coworkers were older.
good,"Manage my own team, review the quota of files and clear deficiencies of each file to tr to fund it on our time line."

I learned a lot there that I was able to use in my personal life, especially when I purchased my first home. If I hadn't decided to relocate I would most likely still be working there. I worked in almost every department there except for the sales related positions. I started as a temp in the mail room, then was hired permanently in the mailroom. Then worked my way up over the years until the only other place to go was up into management positions. I met a lot of really good people and I'm still friends with my old co-workers. It was a genuinely enjoyable experience. Not many folks can say the worked at the same company for 11 years and still enjoyed it. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the angry customers. When someone is denied credit, they usually aren't very happy about it. But I had excellent management who made sure that we didn't have to endure any kind of abuse form the customer."

As the day goes on, I learn important attitude corrections, as well as awesome customer service delivery. My team leader is very outgoing and enthusiastic throughout the day to ensure that our team remains enthusiastic throughout the day as well. The group of people I had the opportunity and privilege of working with each day where one of the reasons I enjoy my job each day. If there came a time where we did not agree, we didn't argue, we simply took the time and sat down and discussed the situation and came to an agreement that we both respected one another on. A job in itself is not hard, the hardest part of any job; are the people that you work with each day. Everyone has a life outside of the office, and sometimes that life situation maybe brought to work and displayed in the office. As a co-worker, knowing your officemate, can help them get through the day with a word of encouragement and an understanding view that life can be too much sometimes and we need others to walk with us sometimes. In the office where I worked there was always a campaign or challenge with another group to raise funds for Susan G Komen, American Cancer Society, or some other organization. Those are the times that I enjoyed most because we came together for a cause that was outside of Bank of America and outside of ourselves to help others."

I had plenty of co-workers, and some of them are still very close friends to this day. The hardest part of the job was to deal with the craziest customer issues in the world and also having to deal with internal social issues. The most enjoyable part of the job was building relationships with customers and knowing them by name and vice versa. Overall, Bank of America is a good company to work for, but just like everything in the world it has it's flaws as well. I learned that everything isn't always as bad as it may seem at the moment."

With a minimum of at least 5 customers in line at all times, every day was a challenge. Constantly, you were busy. It was a very fast passed enviornment. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to change people's attitudes with a simple conversation. By the time a customer gets to see a teller, after waiting in line at an extremely busy center, as expected, are a little frazzled. By being able to, by the end of that particular customer's transaction, change their attitude, makes the worth the stress of a busy day.

good,I joined the Merrill Lynch team just as it was being bought/purchased by Bank of America. The room for advancement wasn't visible then because of the changes that had taken place. If the company would' ve kept its office in JC NJ I probably would have continued on there. The department was great and the people were easy to get along with and were insightful and helpful.

I get along with my co workers we are like family and just like any company you definitely have to be a team player. The hardest part of my job is when you are not able to locate a customers payment and you have to follow up with the customer to let them know the status of the situation. Some customers are understanding and others are crucial, which I can understand this be damaging to their credit. What I enjoy the most about my job is helping people and the recognition I receive for doing my job. Not only do I receive a paycheck for my work but I receive praise for a job well done.

good,"I loved working with my team, my manager was great, co-associates were team players, but the pay was, ""meh."" (I liked my team a whole lot better than BofA as a whole). I worked for BofA for about 3 years. I did receive a significant raise on the third year, but that was after tons of hard work and brown nosing. They hire from within, so it is easy to be promoted, but you need to play politics (thus the brown nosing). My position was salary plus commission. If i ended my quarter at 103% I would make a bonus approx. $1200 (before the goverment took 42% of that from me), but if I ended a quarter at 185% I would make a whole whopping $2-300 more in my bonus. So there was no motivation to sell much more than required. No matter how good your sales are, it was never enough, but that's pretty consistent with all Sales Jobs. Overall, it is a great entry level job to get Sales and Customer Relationship experience. Oh, and Benefits and 401k matching are decent! BofA has tons of discount programs for employees."

I've gathered some advanced underwriting skills that have been helpful during my journey at Bank Of America. I enjoy all of my co-workers and have built a strong relationship with them. We all work well together and look over each other pipelines to cover vacations and illness. I am the ""go to"" person on my team for system issues, or for general questions with the loan process. The most challenging part of my job is the system we have. We are paperless but unfortunately sometimes technology is not always working as well as it should, which puts us all in a time crunch at the end of the month.

good,I have worked for this company for about 5 years. I have been dedicated to achievement and although there may be many advantages of working for the company; it comes with extra baggage that may not be worth your while. We have had several changes in the environment that no one was prepared for and I love change but I do not like unorganization.

good,"BAC is a great place to learn, it is also a great place to advance your career."
good,"I truely enjoyed my 30 years at Bank of America. Over the years I had the opportunity to learn many jobs and took on many tasks, the last few being in management. I've learned that you need to be willing to take on any task that is assigned to you and complete it at your best ability. You should always try to complete the job the first time so you don't impact the customer. The management at Bank of America seemed fair. You need to learn how to work for different management because all managers have a different style of managing and they could all be correct. They different managers also have a different prepective on what is expected out of you. Co-workers have a different speed of learning tasks and completing them. They also have different prestitives of what they want out of the job. You need to learn how to work with everyone and be able to except everyone for you they are. I don't believe there was anything diffucult on the jobs that I completed on the last few years. The must enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with different people and having to complete different jobs in a short period of time. I liked the idea of always learning new jobs."

good,"A typical day at work is just that... NEVER typical! My day begins shortly after I walk in the door. I handle escalations to resolution, and participate in several manager/project calls through the day. I've learned that each associate who comes to you with a request, whether it be vacation related or not, it is important to them. So make sure to get back in a timely manner although it may be last on your list. Alwals FOLLOW UP. There is nothing worse than a client or another department having to call you to see if something has been taken care of yet. Always communicate and give updates if it going to take much longer than expected. My co-workers are mostly a team of associates who worked the same job and bank of america for 30-45 years. It has been challenging to teach them new thought processes, because as they say ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks."" Although there is some truth to this, the challenge is to find new and efficient ways to improve a process re-engaging the associate. The most enjoyable part of the job has been the opportunity to create relationships in other deprtments. It really helps when you find yourself in a situation where you really could use a favor to get something pushed through, because you are comfortable enough with that person to be able to ask for help!"

We all live in different parts of the country, and initially to compile our report we would meet quarterly for a 3-4 weeks at a time. Now (starting in January) I work every day from home, which is not the ideal situation for a young, social, extrovert. That for me has been the most difficult part of the job, in addition to the fact that I'm not particularly interested at all in the work that my team has transitioned to."
good,I would like to have a chance to work there again. I worked there for 25 years. I learn a lot
good,I had this job as a summer time job. I have no complains about the company it was just not a fit for me personally.
good,A typical day working at the bank consisted of taking inbound calls from customers and employees of the bank to help them with their banking and investment needs. I learned alot about the banking industry working here. The hardest part of the job was any situation where there was just not an acceptable solution to a problem for a client.

good,"This was a great company to work for! They constantly trained you on new procedures. They allowed you to do a new specific task each day. There was constant praise and coaching on areas of improvement, and the branch that I worked in had a pleasant atmosphere. Everyone got along and the mood was almost always light. The hardest part of the job was selling products to customers that they didn't necessarily need. Bank of America is more corporate based than consumer based, and there are a lot of fees for the average consumer. Other than selling consumers on their largeness and the convenience of them being everywhere, and state of the art facilities, there were not too many selling points. There are other banks out there that offer tons of benefits to the consumer that will actually help their money grow without charging any fees. They really need to work on being more consumer friendly in order to gain more customers!"

good,Working From home is great. Too bad they are starting to crack down on that though. Benefits are fair and management always seemed to be great from my experience.
good,"I was an intern from a program called Year-Up, and my position was not meant to last no more than six months. Although my time was short, I enjoyed the atmosphere and appreciated the guidance from my managers and team leads. Everyone was welcoming and the weekly goal for each week was easily reachable. Although, I was unable to stay due to school; I would not mind working for Bank of America again."
good,"I was a contractor at bank of america. i enjoyed my time there. everyone there was like my job family. I was in the spanish department from fraud analyst. the managers really helped me grow with the company, they helped me advance and provided great advice.

good,The hardest part of my job was not being help people not because I didn't want to but because I couldn't help them. there was so many times I wish I could help but was just not in the position to do anything at all.
good,What motivated me the most are my customers. I love educating them on their financial benefits within our company. Although we always received a high call volume our sales incentive dropped rapidly and tiers were placed with higher goals and payout was even less than what we were actually selling.
good,"A typical day would include the following:"
good,"Place where employees feel appreciated and engaged, and can build their careers with. Places emphasis on helping clients build better financial future."

The pay & benefits are amazing. $17/hr starting pay. $240 reimbursement for day care a month. 16 weeks paid maternity leave. 10 days each of sick time & vacation. And it all starts when your employment begins (no waiting period for vacay & sick time) insurance is great also. This location is the only one in town so it is very fast paced but the pay is more than worth the job duties"
good,"Great company to work for . Would work there again if I had the opportunity , great benefits as well ! The company will allow you to grow with great promotions and pay compensation"
good,"Like any financial institution it's about drawing in the clients and keeping the clients.  The employees are not recognized as much as they should be, but on occasion there may be a ceremony to recognize a few employees for their outstanding performance and there are incentives.  Bank of America is not a bad place to work, if you are an outstanding performer.  You can move up the ladder very quick  but once there, don't let your guard down because you will be out the door.  Which is understandable, given the type of business it is."
good,"A typical day at work. Multitasking incoming calls alone with reviewing debit card activity for possible fraud. Weekly, there are meetings to discuss fraud trends and strategies. Management team! Some are Awesome! Bank of America is very diverse in culture. The hardest part of the job - dealing with unhappy customers that use very abusive language and the inconvenience caused when customers are traveling international . Most enjoyable, employee recognition and overtime."

good,"A good place to work, but it's hard to move up in a career, and the hours make it hard to have financial security.  Aside from that, an excellent place to work, but not sustainable for a good personal life."
good,"Very busy environment, friendly and hard working staff. I Learned a lot about Trust, Estate, POA accounts, I was the go to associate to assist clients with their difficult transactions. The hardest part of the job was working with some of the computer programs that we used to assist clients with account maintenance and other various transactions. Fortunately  we had great clients who understand.  The management was great, specially since part of my position was to back up the managers when needed and supervising the teller line quite a bit of the day. The best part of the job was celebrating holidays and special occasions. Everyone would pitch in and decorate and contribute what they could, we were a team.  The associates are like family,and I have made many friends thru the years."

good,Bank of America was a good company to work for. The only down side of working there was the never ending expectations of selling products. I did not enjoy trying to sell every customer something if feel they did not need.
good,"This is a good place to work with great benefits, if you can handle a HIGH stress environment.  A lot is expected of employees, and requirements change constantly."
good,"I held nearly 8 positions in nearly eight years.  Several changes were due to reorganization, but it allowed me to grow as an employee and truly enriched my business acumen.   Only pitfall was multiple changes to my managers within the same positions."

Great customer service skills are an asset the company desires and is compensated for.

good,"I liked working for the company but there were moments in which i was asked to manage my team in a way that I felt was not adherent to my principles. I would be asked to manage one way and if I succeeded but it was not done exactly as how my supervisor wanted, then I would have to fight to defend my position."
good,"phenomenal employee benefits, poor work life balance, sales goals do not take into consideration locations, customer demographics, and other factors.  Patience is a virtue working at a bank, for good reason.  As is for me, money is important to customers, when they loose money or pay fees, it is a big deal, we all work hard for our money so irate customers is common thing, being understanding to the fact you would not be happy either if someone or something took your money helps with customer service."

good,"Its a good environment to work in, you get an opportunity to work with a lot of data and experiment with a lot of different tools as well. the company encourages people to think outside the box."
good,I benefited from the rigorous training program at BoA. The management supported career development. The compensation was below desirable level and it was not negotiable.
good,"bank of america provides awesome benefits and resources for their employees, pto, sick time and maternity leave. they also have many volunteer events that you can participate"
good,"I loved working here, the only reason I am no longer there is because we moved from the area.  Stressful at times but, this is how the mortgage industry is.  Management was decent."
good,"Working for Bank of America consists of many diverse work tasks.  Some down time, but not much.  I learned new procedures within estate and trust planning.  Management works with you when you have questions or issues regarding the procedures the company has in place.  The culture of the company is very friendly and while we all work hard, we still have a few laughs throughout the day.  The hardest part of the job is searching for certain documents that are needed to request transactions to be completed by different departments.  Learning new things is always enjoyable to me and I have learned from my time at the Bank.  I highly recommend working for this company-even though my experience was a little lack-lustered."
good,"Daily morning meetings with your team."
good,BAML is probably the best place I have ever worked at so far. It is a place that recognizes talent and promotes bases on it and merits. It is fast paced and exciting. It is also very good at recruiting and retaining talent.

good,Good working environment bonding well with others. Stressful with dealing with rude customers that would not understand certain guidelines we would have to follow
good,"My job was to manage projects and it was a very busy job. I usually worked over 50 hours per week. I was able to participate in many of their employee networks, which lead to a lot of contacts throughout the organization. You can't possibly know everyone who works there, but the more you network the better off you will be. The bank is currently moving to a culture where IT support employees need to live/work in one of their 6 core cities. If you are not in one of those, there may be limited opportunities if you are not willing to relocate."

Pay is competitive.  Also great company culture with Employee Resource Groups.

good,"I worked at Bank of America for 6 years, only left because I had to move and couldn't transfer. I've tried working for another company and the benefits and pay simply do not compare. I was so spoiled. I worked both in the call center and finance center. The call center was amazing, very structured and you knew exactly what you needed to do, much more professional atmosphere than working in a financial center. When I was last there, I got 4 months of 100% paid maternity leave after I had my baby, plus they help reimburse you for some of your daycare costs. It's an amazing place to work as a working parent."
good,"Bank Of America is a great company to work for,  there are a lot of opportunities here if you work hard and are dedicated. I have learned a lot within the past 10 years, if giving the opportunity to work at a different company I will be able to bring all the experiences that i have obtained throughout the years"

good,"The bank has been steered in the right direction and has been improving on their business and culture since the recession.  There is still a lot of work to be done, but there has been positive steps since the CEO took over.  I think the bank offers amazing benefits such as 16 week paid maternity/paternity leave.  Community involvement is heavily promoted and flexibility to volunteer is provided.  I think there is still a lot of improvement needed in management as well as job security, but with the ever changing banking environment, these may be challenging fixes."
good,"Although I desire a position in commodities, working at Bank of America provides a lot of opportunity. My manager is great and offers up different projects to further advance my knowledge of Middle Office."

good,Environment at  Bank of America was friendly long time associates. uplifted associates and was a great place to work as it gave back to the community by participating in non profit organizations. associate recognition was a big incentive for me and my peers. management was knowledgeable and provided the training necessary to obtain positive results and achieve goals. The hardest part of the job was not being able to reach customer satisfaction results as a team. The most enjoyable part of my job was connecting with customers and working the best deal that would meet our customers needs.
good,At the time they were cutting our pay. I didn't realize that I was hurting myself by leaving. I made a mistake leaving. I tried a different job at Bank of America and should have went back to my previous job before leaving for Wells Fargo
good,"Bank of America has good benefits and help"
good,If you work hard you stand out and management tries to help you advance. Compensation was fair. Company works hard with activities to make it fun for employees. Great benefits.
good,The Proof Department had no set schedule and work hours could change on a daily basis. This was a relaxed environment that encompassed 3 work units. We received our work from the banks and processed all incoming deposits. The most challenging aspect of the job was to meet our deadlines to have our work ready for the next processing unit.
good,"My review is limited to my experience/team/manager, but it is overall a place with excellent benefits (4 weeks vacation + 10 days PTO) , opportunities for career advancement, and also tuition reimbursement, which should signal to candidates that this is a place that invests in their employees."
good,Client Service Representative consisted of financial transactions that involved recieving and giving monetary instruments to clients and merchants of Bank of America.
good,"Bank of America is a great company to work for;however the career advancement is not where it needs to be. I've been in retail for the past 14 and a half years,"
good,"We try to advise our customers about their financial lives based on acknowledgment, honesty and customer-orientated attitude. Keeping up with the long hours and lack of advancement opportunities are the hardest part of the job. Yet guiding a customer in need, frustrated and worried about his or her future to the right path is priceless."
good,"Superb management, friendly environment, chance to learn advanced technology and solve hard problems. Lots of fun with a great bunch of people."
good,If you are dedicated to learning an opportunity at ML would be great for you. There are ample opportunities to interface with managers and various ways for you to learn and grow.
good,"The best part of the job was the employee appreciation and volunteering in the community. The pay was very fair within  the market, the culture was good until you get in upper management."
good,"It varies on days of the week but when we get lots of mail, it gets very hectic if we don't have enough workers.  We have deadlines everyday and we must meet them without any questions asked.  Working atmosphere I really like because everyone was down to earth.  The hardest part about the job would be when IRS auditors stops by to make sure that we're all following protocols when entering customers information's or handling our customers tax returns."
good,"overall is was one of the best places I have been employed by, management was great, flexibility to your personal schedule managers discretion, overtimed employee compensated with dinner"

good,"You are expected to actually work while at work, but if you can do that, its not all that bad.  However, our office was small and isolated so there was not much room for advancement.  Office was closed in 2017."
good,it was dream job. I was super happy to come to work everyday for 8 straight years. I did not want to leave - would have retired with company if I would have made better decisions to protect my role with company.
good,"The one specific part of Bank of America, that sticks out for me is the ability to advance in their work environment. In 18 years of working with them, I went from Desk Support, to Application Manager and ended with the level of Assistant Vice President. This is great for young people willing to get in there and work towards a career in Finance, Business Admin or IT work. They have tuition reimbursement, which can be very beneficial for those wanting to get an education, but lack the financial resources o get started.  The 18 years, that I was with the Bank, were the best I've had so far."
good,Enjoy my time there just was not getting the advancement opportunities as promised work was sometime made more stressful due to not communicating with those who it would effect.
good,Boa was wonderful to work for. Loved the atmosphere.   The pay was great and the staff listened. If I can return I would definitely. It's like you're part of a family.
good,I love the people I work with but there is little opportunity for advancement and growth. The sales goals are not realistic and makes it a little stressful to achieve.
good,I enjoyed  Bank Of America. working as a loan processor. Unfortunately it did not work out. I took the job rather than the severance pay that lasted a year
good,BofA was an exciting and rewarding place to work for many reasons.  The ability to meet different people every day a definite plus.  Learning Financial regulations as well.  Room for advancement always available!
good,"Great benefits, career opportunities. The compensation was acceptable and the management was supportive. I do not like the sales goals or being pushed to make revenue above everything."

good,"Great atmosphere, Good work culture"

good,"Positive - Very stable working environment"
good,"Really great place to work. You learn so much there, it's amazing to me how much I have learned about finance since starting at Merrill almost a year ago. I was not a finance major in college nor did I ever believe I would be in this field, but I have really learned a lot as well as made lasting friendships with co-workers."
good,"Bank of America is a good place and organization to work for/at. However, I am open and interested in other opportunities within the banking/financial industry as well."
good,"No opportunity to grow. If you want to apply for a position within the company, they prefer for you to have experience instead of teaching you so you could have the experience."
good,"The work environment is very professional. It is business casual with a cafeteria and a work -out facility on site. The company is exceptional at training its employees and giving them the resources in order to be successful at their job requirements. The management is generous in expressing appreciation for a job well done. There are designated areas allocated specifically for the smokers, so that non smokers are not forced to the exposure. It is a great place to work! There is definitely the opportunity for work/life balance at the Addison Bank of America location"

good,"A great company to work in. I enjoyed every day spent at Bank of America, I loved helping customers with all their needs. My manager was very accommodating and my co-workers were also wonderful people."
good,There is great potential to enhance your skills that will move you to the next level.  Customer Service is key in this industry to work with individuals from various backgrounds in educating them on various tools in investing their money.
good,Great overall company to work for.  Promoted teamwork and growth and gave a family feeling with in the company.  I grew as a person and a leader and was challenged daily to be the absolute best I could be.  My managers were great and they groomed and helped me grow as a manager and a person.
good,Very relaxing environment and ALL managers encourage progression within each and every role. If you are in one position for long it is because YOU did not want to advance yourself. Endless opportunities
good,"Most product and project teams tend to have a fair work-life balance.  You do extended hours, but that could happen after family dinners, special events, etc."
good,BOA teaches many things and has many corporate training options.  Most management supports their employees in numerous areas.  I love working at BOA and would not mind continuing.

good,Bank of  America was fun place to work until now but the culture is changing with the management getting the Managers from offshore on L1 and making this place hard to work

I enjoyed the many benefits such as vacation, paid holidays, sick/maternity leave time, bonuses, health and many more."

good,It was a great experience. It was a good learning experience about the financial industry. The company is very diverse and helps you pursue your education.
good,Boa is an awesome place to work though there is a flaw in some management. People quit because of a certain individual but nothing is done about it. Also sales goals and stack ranking should be weighted.
good,"The branch I currently work at is closing so the days are not typical.  We have the task of helping clients get comfortable with online, mobile and atm banking.

Problem I would see is alot of movement with senior management.  The vision would be the same , however, would have to explain your roles time and time again."

It was a hard job due to the amount of traveling we did but very rewarding."

good,"Bank of America was a good place to work. The pay was good and so were the benefits, but Bank of America always looked for loopholes to cut bonuses. I'm not talking about wall-street level type bonuses either. For example: If you have a goal of a hundred checking accounts to receive a two thousand dollar bonus and you met the goal, they'd say something like, ""the Bank itself is in the red, so here's seven hundred bucks instead"" (meanwhile the bank made the news for record breaking numbers). I was okay not receiving bonuses, I just didn't like the bait and switch. But I wasn't singled out, it wasn't personal, that's just the way Bank of America does business. Besides that, the hours were great and time flies for some reason. Days never dragged."

good,Start the the with opening procedures Im 2nd observer. Start by doing night drop deposit and then atm . You learn as you do during the day.

I was a bank president for a small, agricultural based banking center in a town where I knew almost everyone.  Toughest part of the job was the inability to help my friends and neighbors.  Banking used to be more faith - less science.  My team brought our little center out of banking obscurity with a 'go-to' attitude, winning a ""Best in the West"" class rating from BOA."

I had several ""Opportunities"" that I took and was told I would receive a raise that never came; however the workload increase along with my title. Most supervisors never knew how to do or follow any procedures, so anytime we were stuck in a situation where no help arrived we had to wing it literally. I felt for a lot of the customer because a lot of situations could have been resolved if we knew what we were doing so the issues continually dragged on and yet we still advised them it was there fault. Bank of America plays fowl and continues to advise otherwise. I NEVER held a checking account during my employment and will never hold a mortgage account with Bank of America because they are crooked."

The company itself is a great company to work for and had one of the best benefit packages around. 401k, pension (at the time), medical, dental, vision, PTO, child care reimbursement, commuter and tuition reimbursement.

good,Decent place to work. Prefer back office roles as they are more lax. If you work directly with customers typically the environment is more stressful. Claims is the best role I've experienced
good,"A typical day would consist of 2 tellers including myself. From the minute I walk in the work is fast-paced since there is a rush in the morning. Management is great. The hardest part of the job is getting clients to sit down with a banker to uncover financial needs (people are always in a hurry).  Another reason this is difficult is the center is always low staffed, making the wait time long at times. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with people."

These included a number of large upscale condo developments in many states and also some office buildings and retail developments. Many of the deals were so large that we syndicated them to a bank group to reduce our exposure.  This required a lot of detailed administration to ensure that all the syndicate members' positions were accurately reflected on our loan system.  It also required constant communication with the member banks to ensure that the borrower's transactions were accurate."

good,Bank of America and Merrill Lynch are a wonderful company to work for. The atmosphere can be stressful depending on the expectation of your management team and the role that you have. Each manager I have had has been extremely supportive of helping you achieve what you want in your job function.
good,"The last team I was on was the best ever.  My team communicated very well and we had loads of fun. I learned so much from my last job, especially to have really good process maps, job aids and checklists that took any guessing out of the role and responsibilities.  Did I mention communications; we would meet every week and talks through all the challenges of our jobs that kept all associates aware of up coming changes and large client setups so that we could prepare for the work load."

While working at Merrill Lynch, one can expect a welcoming job culture with a majority of work being focused around the various aspects of client's accounts that are held with the firm."
good,A typical day working at Bank Of America was pretty easygoing. I learned how to manage and work an ATM. My job was to meet and greet people at the door and see if they needed any assistance. The hardest part of my job was dealing with foreigners since I could not understand them. The most enjoyable part of my job was that the boss and co-workers express they appreciation of my help everyday which boosted my confidence.
good,Great work environment and room for growth as long as you meet up to the requirements. The benefits are great and many choices of discounts. The day to day activities need to be improved a bit especially when sometimes employees can get overworked.

The company was great and offered many benefits for their employees, tuition reimbursement, 401k, day care pay for parents, maternity/paternity leave, etc...

good,"Processed mainly non-conforming loans. Pipeline consisted of approximately 25-30 loans. Processed overflow of conforming loans. "
good,I worked night shift. The job was easy and our shift was staffed with a great group of people. Bank mergers and downsizing make it hard to rate Job security higher when it comes to this field of work.
good,"A company the size of BOA is more akin to working for the government when providing a review. Each line of business, office, and team has their own budget, values, goals, etc. On the corporate level, I find the company very progressive in their goals and how they want to treat their employees. The health and family benefits are the strong point, providing things like an exceptional maternity/ paternity leave package, 401k matching, and a generous work/life balance."
good,Not the best work life balance but management and co-workers make time spent in office worth it. Systems are not user friendly but training is great.
good,Great employee engagement and support from senior management. Constantly striving to be better but not at the sacrifice of the employee experience. I would work for this company again if the right opportunity was presented.

good,"Fun company , however  job advancement is difficult."
good,I truly enjoyed my time with Bank of America. I started as a part time teller and in less that two years I become a Banker. The benefits were AMAZING. The pay wasn't great but it got the job done. 16 weeks of maternity and paternity leave. I absolutely love their benefits. Hate how they run the company.
good,"Great office at World Financial Center with a great culture. Laid back but productive workplace. Very much abides by the open door policy and all financial advisors are willing to talk, so there are plenty of learning opportunities and relationships to be made."

It can be challenging and come with a lot of pressure/stress to meet your sales goal, all while trying to conduct transactions from the teller line. However, this is a great position for those that are only available to work part-time because of either school/other duties. You receive great benefits, work with professional peers, and it is a worthwhile accomplishment to post onto your resume."
good,Topical day at work would be setting your goals and trying achieve them by interacting with customers in a more profound level based on their needs and offering ways to either save money and having a better banking experience.

My leader is currently an excellent leader demonstrating support, knowledge, credibility, and determination in her role. As a senior employee at my financial center, I've learned that one of the most important factors to successfully run an organization, is to understand your employees, customers, and most importantly, yourself. Listening to one another encompasses great leadership skills as well as executing effectively. With each one of us consisting different personalities, understanding each other takes us all a long way. We are able challenge obstacles together and succeed together. I'm able to work with each associate by helping my co-workers and creating a valuable and professional relationship with them and our customers.

I learned more of the default side of the mortgage world and  I also started on the title side of the business. I had always worked on the closing/refinance area. I had a good manager but I feel she could have been better because she tended to help out her friends more. My co-workers were easy going and fairly easy to get along with.

good,"BOA had a laid back fun work environment.  I came in under the impression that I was going to be in more of a data entry role; but the recruiter who brought me in challenged me to be a Home Services Specialists (Refinance Term of Home Loan, Provide Cash Back during Refinance, Get Loan prepared for underwriting department etc.) In a month I was just that a Home Services Specialists at BOA.

good,"A great company to work for overall. While the hours may feel like they drag on, the outcome is satisfactory. A typical day consists of a back to back call flow, with a mix of satisfied and unsatisfied clients. My job is to ensure that both types of clients leave my phone line with a feeling of accomplishment and understanding, as well as make sure that both are completely satisfied with the products they have. Both upper management and co-workers are very friendly and helpful, implementing  ""360 Degree Coaching"" approach to all hardships faced. This ensures that everyone's opinion is heard without reprimand or retaliation. As you progress, you learn more and more about the inner workings of the financial industry, which in turn helps me out on a daily basis with my own financial needs. There is always room for improvement in any job, the major difference, and most enjoyable part of being part of Bank of America, is the fact that they tell you what you as a person and what your team need to improve on. We are constantly training for new products and revisiting older product details to make sure that we fully understand both, and can deliver a consistent expectation to all clients."

The benefits are very good and I was able to take paid paternity leave for the births of both of my children.
good,"As a Public Sector Client Manager, my day focuses on municipal clients and their everyday banking needs.  I’m part of a phone based group with 450 clients in the municipal space.  Clients in this space have a varied range of needs and business acumen which could be a benefit or a hindrance to a sale but every day is different and I enjoy the challenges.  Management is quick to reward success and support those who need assistance.  The co-workers can be testing when you're in a competitive environment but it makes for stonger success."

good,"Fast paced with heavy phone use. Loved problem solving and negotiating with travel vendors. I had worked for the bank and understood their culture so working as a contractor came naturally. The agency had a slow upstart and were backlogged with unresolved issues. I learned the travel culture quickly and had a strong working relationship and trust level with my manager. I felt valued.  Position provided me the flexibility to make my own decisions on the best way to resolve individual issues. The main drawback is always having to be overly politically correct but I was already used to that. The travel benefits, employee package, and perks were all above average. I really enjoyed that job!"

good,"I worked in the same office for over 5 years at Bank of America. In this time the office adapted to three different lines of business for the bank. I originally started off doing credit card collections. In this time I suggested payment plans, took payments, setup payment plans, answered and assisted customers in any other way possible. After this task we began to perform welcome calls to new and existing credit card holders to increase and encourage the use of benefits existing on the credit cards they had opened. In this segment we also assisted customers with reward redemptions, credit line increases/decreases, taking payments, changing reward types and many more credit card functions. In the last part of the job we switched to mortgage and began to overview loan documents to prepare for auditing. We also worked with several notaries to complete this task. Throughout the years I have learned a wide variety of skills including advising new employees, learning several different kinds of computer applications, working with multiple team members and lines of management, telesales experience, dealing with a variety of customers and specific customer situations, maintaing professionally to customers and co workers and many more skills along the way. The teams I've worked on were progressive and supportive and probably the best part of the entire job.

good,inbound call center aswering and solving issues that customers have with their current mortgage. I have learned to adapt to a always changing working enviroment with new updates to current procedurs. My co-workers are like a second family to me and will miss them. The hardest part about working in banking/mortgage enviroment is due to the enconomy customers are facing hardships and are fearful of losing their homes. It gets really emotional and can be very dificult. The most enjoyable part would finding a resultion to a customer's issue that they may have called in on before and has not been resolved. When I hear them say I wish I had spoken to you the first time I called in really warms my heart.

A typical day at work includes both running a teller drawer to help assist with customer transactions as well as opening accounts and helping with customer issues.  Our banking center is a team in the truest form--we're always helping each other if there's an issue and cheering each other on.  My management team is amazing; they make sure to coach accordingly, but also praise us when we've gone above and beyond our role.  Such belief makes you want to work that much harder.  The best thing about my job is the amount I've learned in such a short time--there's always something new to try and conquer, so the role never becomes stale.  The hardest part of our job is sometimes making our referrals, because we have so many repeat customers, but it just makes us work harder to procure products from both existing and new customers.    "
good,"I have learned so many things such as being proactive in dealing with clients, listening to clients concerns and what they want.  That gives me a view of how we can sincerely help them.

In addition to some basic transactions, we are also required to refer customer's to bankers to enhance their visit to the banking center. It allows a more personable and individualized service when I am able to refer my customer to a banker based on reviewing their profile and deciding on which additional services that may meet their needs. The management at Bank of America is great. I am extremely lucky and fortunate to be working with such a great team at my banking center.

good,· I managed the teller line ensuring that all daily tasks were completed.
good,"I started working at Bank of America as a part-time Teller while going to school full-time! The atmosphere was great! I loved my Banking Center Manager and knew that soon I'd be managing my own branch! I was great at what I did! Exceeded my sales goals and was always the top in all competitions. At the age of twenty-two, I was promoted to managing! I loved the training programs in place which prepared me to run my own branch. I learned a lot from my co-workers as well as my Market Managers. I learned so much about managing at Bank of America. I had learned to become a well-rounded manager by knowing about auditing, sales, operations, human resources, and much more. I had become a part-time student due to working full-time. Bank of America paid for my entire school. They were very supportive and encouraged me to complete my education. After almost eight years of service at Bank of America I met my soon-be-husband. We had plans of moving to his hometown of Arizona. However I wanted to complete my undergraduate career and earn my bachelors degree. We decided that in order to do this in a timely manner, I had to resign from Bank of America. This was a hard decision. Bank of America was very good to me. Not only did I grow as a person but I accomplished many of my dreams while working there. I had purchased two homes and gained knowledge that would take me years to learn elsewhere."
good,"Call center atmosphere, averaged 9-10 inbound leads per day and made on average 75 outbound calls per day with an average talk time of roughly 4.5 hours daily"
good,"working for a company as large as BOA may bring the assumption that the little ones like us at the bottom of the food chain are ignored, but that isn't the case. BOA has a culture that recognizes the importance, input and efforts of the ""little fishes"" at the bottom of the food chain."
good,Bank of America was good to me when i was hired as a teller. What i learned there was doing cash handling and how to balance the teller cash drawers. The management was friendly and supportive to my needs. The hardest thing was the distance from my job to my home it was a long ways to get home by bus and it was part time.
good,"On a normal day, you take maybe 30 - 40 calls which is smooth sailing compared to other call center jobs that I have had. The job is always changing, I must've done a million different things there including customer service, collections, and sales. I learned that working hard and longevity is appreciated here, because I had a three dollar raise increase within a year. Management is on a first name basis, and everyone is very friendly. It is completely okay to have a joke with management without anyone running to tell the boss you broke a rule there. It was actually fun to have lunch with your boss. The management here treats you as an equal, instead of just a subordinate who works for the company. A difficult part of the job was getting the hang of things. There's an extensive training at the beginning of employment that teaches you basically everything that you need to know. You take tests and quizzes, role playing, book work, playing games, learning terms and definitions, etc. And training is most important, because you build strong bonds with the people in the training class around you. I haven't worked there since 2009 and I still have a few friends that I met there. I honestly have to say that the hardest thing about the job is leaving. Though the pay is good, they don't offer as much room for advancement as one would like. You are always recognized for the good work that you do here though. There were always parties, always ways to make more money, and always a fun event to go to that involved this company! It's really a great place to work for!!!"

good,"Working in the foreclosure lookback department has been an eye-opener. It is a new division within the company, as we redeployed October 2011. I have learned so much about the foreclosure process itself. My part of this project is to review each loan assigned for any fees that may have been assessed in error, thereby causing harm to the borrower. Management is always on hand to help when needed for questions on the various tests, career progression, and are very to talk with. Co-workers are very wonderful, and after working in Correspondent Lending together for 6 years, we are all one big family. The hardest part of this job is seeing and reading all that the customers have experienced as a result of lending regulations of previous years. I do, however, enjoy working with my co-workers, and participating in such things as themed food days, fundraisers for various major national health walks held throughout the company."
good,Great work enviorment and it was fun. Work was pretty repetive but it was still a challenge because I dealt with people's finances from all around the world especially spanish speaking customers. Co workers and managers were always great to work with but the hard part sometimes was sitting the same spot for 8 hours of the day. Overall its a great experience from working different programs on your computer to problem solving customers concerns.

good,"What can I say? Bank of America is a great company. It offers plenty of incentives to not only start there but keep you within the institute.   I've only been here for 1 year. However, I can already see great opportunities all around me."
good,"Bank of America, Merrill Lynch is a great company to work for. They offer so many benefits and really give their employees a lot of opportunities to be trained and grow within.

The team environment was great and so was the management. Life/work balance was good as well and management was very accommodating especially for those with children to a reasonably degree. There were quite a few changes before I left and of course as with many companies today it was an ever changing environment...some good; some not so good. If it's not broken and working perfectly fine... Why fix it! I would still recommend working for Bank of America as they do give plenty of opportunities for employment and do offer great benefits. I did feel the career advancement was very limited after this position as there really were no other options available other than departments at other sites which I interviewed with, however after ""careful consideration"", was not qualified for the positions. I basically felt trapped in my current job. The only major disappointment with Boa was that they froze our pensions the previous five years of me leaving the bank."
good,"I have been a teller for two years now and the job is quite easy. The most difficult part is having to deal with crazy customers but management does a great job at stepping in to handle the situation.

good,"BOA is a great place to work. My typical day was opening the facility and getting my and helping others if needed open and designate teller positions .I learned to be a even better team player due to the face paced nature of the BOA location and flow of clients.

good,"My day usually started at 8 am to open the banking center.  I learned that leading a team of people can be challenging, but much more rewarding when everyone gets on the same page to acheive goals that was set before us.

good,"My work day starts with reviewing my loan file for the day. Returning telephone calls and reading and responding emails. Processed mortgage applications. I learned new information almost everyday. Even though our process is the same, every loan is different in many ways. Our managament staff is there to help and guide us with all aspects of the process. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the closing dates. Closing dates can changed due to either issues with the contract, the sellers or buyers and even the appriasal results. The most enjoyable part of the job, is to knowing I am able to be a part of the making the dream of home ownership come true."

good,I had a job that needed to be done but when you have management that didn't know what was suppose to be done in order to get the job done I would describe as very unorganized and made it very difficult at times to do my job so I tend to have found things to do to occupy my time job related.
good,"I worked at BofA for the entire modification program from start to its wind down in 2013."
good,Great company for the customer less interests are had to be told and many would benefit in respects to proper placement of logical procurement.

The job was not that hard it was challenging at times when we learned a different part of the job but once we learned it, it was easy again. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to other co-workers or helping other teammates that may have struggled to understand the process get on board.

good,"Working at Bank of America is a good place to work for. The customer is a big thing with Bank of America. I would be happy to work for Bank of America  "
good,Good to be here. Work life balance is good at bank. We have better opportunities when compared to other organisations. Only draw back is there is no scope for career growth.
good,"great environment, great customers, lovable co workers. Learned a lot regarding money handling, written and verbal communication. re enforced my customer service skills, and my computer skills."
good,It was very calm and pleasant. the work load was heavy at times but it was  manageable. The people were very friendly. The hardest part of the job was finding people who worked for the company and had moved to a different location.
good,Great benefits. Bad management. No raises or bonuses. Learning curves are great but does not help you to advance. Depending on your particular management is what you get
good,This job was a partnering company to bank of america. The people were great and calls are like any normal job at a call center is expected to be. Job life was very competitive for the very little that was offered.
good,Investment platform is top tiered and provides all the investment strategies to attract new clients and help support existing client base through feasible servicing models.
good,Bank of America has some of the kindest customers! Over the course of seven years I built a great rapport with a lot of customers. The most enjoyable part of my jobs a Senior Teller was being on the front lines and truly uncovering needs and knowing what more I could do for my customers.

good,"The BAML Financial Advisor platform is comprehensive.  You have access to any opportunity to further your clients financial success and financial planning.  from PE to Exchange Funds, The BAML platform with the help of US Trust gives you a Cheesecake Factory sized menu of financial strategies.  That being said all high-finance strategies are best for people with established relationships with high-networth individuals 2.5M+ I would say.  Anyone under $1m you would be doing a disservice as they could access similar strategies and opportunities through a robo advisor.  The management actually incentivises Advisors to sell off their clients under 1m+ to the Merrill Edge platform (robo).  New advisors looking to start their career with no connections... This is a great opportunity to get paid to pass your series 7, 66, life and health.  They offer pretty great perks and a 50+ base just to study and do minimal module work.  The problems for new advisors is after they are certified, performance goals start approaching and nothing useful is taught through the educational program on how to actually succeed and bring assets in.  Instead they preach to find a senior advisor or team and partner as an underling with them, this leaves you open to being used, and overworked by senior advisor."
good,"Hours are long and management wants it their way no matter what. Culture has real potential to be great but time is so limited that it misses the boat. They started pulling a lot of the perks back, such as subsidized lunch and gym. People that work here are hard working and want to do a great job."
good,"Fast paced environment, good benefits.  No room for advancement. Very few raises. Work guidelines can change daily and need to be good with change...."
good,"Working for Merrill Lynch was a once in a lifetime experience. I learned more, very quickly, during my time there than at any other job in my career. "

good,"A typical day included getting to the office earlier than anyone else and staying later than most. It was a very exciting environment because I enjoyed what I was learning and I like finance, the stock market, wealth planning, etc. Co-workers were friendly but at the same time it is a very cut throat business. It is highly competitive environment and it's each man for himself. The most difficult part of the job was the testing. The most enjoyable was the people and learning about the markets."
good,"The hardest part of the job is maintaining an empathetic demeanor while still utilizing your tools to help grow the business."
good,"great company with a great mission.great place to begin a career but limited potential for advancement.  as long as you produce and meet the standards for work, you have job security."

good,"If you live in Califronia you have rights to protect the worker. But poor management fails to follow the law you miss brakes they don't care, and if you call in sick you better be dying or else they will find any way to fire you that easy. Super streesfull for the pay you get not worth it. I really enjoyed my job four years and everything was good but bank of america feels they have to stress you out to push sales they will threaten your job on a daily baises if your numbers are not where they need to be. Just work really hard keep your mouth shut and you will be fine."

good,I had as many as 100 loans most of the time.  This company had very unique and affluent clients so things were done differently when qualifying for a mortgage loan.  The most difficult part of my job was trying to keep all of the customers informed on the status of their loans on a weekly basis.
good,This is a fun place to work you account money all day long. I got to work before in one set up and started to do my work. Money from ATM machine was like you never know what you  get tell you finish. I was let go because they had a bank to close. I was the last one to hire in so I was first to be let go.

Answer all their questions and try to sell them new products according to their financial profiles. My primary concern was the commercial window and handle all large change orders for the major stores in Wichita Falls. I learned to do this as quickly and as correctly as possible so that I would not be out of balance as the end of the day.
good,"great people to work around, some can be snobs but you're there to work not make friends. there wasn't any motivation to where job security was secure. if you worked as a temp they got rid of you at the end of your shift unexpectedly. the supervisors never stood up for the temps even though they did an awesome job."
good,Workplace culture at bank of America is balanced. Fun activities along with work go hand in hand. you don't have to stretch your shifts. Though shift timings can little odd.

good,"Bank of america in the part that I worked was great with people I associated with (a few bad seeds but there always are).. the issue with bank of america was because of two reasons, one very slow pace of work and not enough to give to everyone and so there was times that a lot of us just sat around and did nothing. The second thing is that the company does not do a single thing when you are being harrassed by other co-workers they just ignore you and get rid of you instead of dealing with the person who is committing the crime."

good,I liked working for B of A in the aspect that it was a work from home opportunity and I was a young project manager.  Successful project managers can influence decisions and allow people to collaborate.  I was 22 years old and it's difficult to get people twice your age to respect your ability to manage.  Since I worked from home - nobody was able to identify my age and I experienced less obstacles managing.

They usually never end early and have the potential to be extended up to three times before the bank would offer a permanent hire. I have only been offered once but did not accept due to me being pregnant and wanted to take time off with new baby. When contracts expire you are required to take a 3 month hiatus. So prepare as you work your contract for your downtime. BofA has exacting training you will never be without a job aid to back up what your job duties are. Sit in your desk, do your work and go home. Very rarely will you see OT but pay is good enough you have a life. They have integrated systems to see and monitor your work so micro managing is not face to face but electronic through the system. As long as you are meeting quota and completing daily work load you will receive some coaching but not hassled by management too much. Easy environment for me.
