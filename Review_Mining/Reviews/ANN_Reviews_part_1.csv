good,"ANN based in London, Arab News Network transmitting to the middle east."
good,What do you want me to write I do not wish to review my company here at this time.  The fact that this is required to post my resume with your site seems ridiculous to me.

good,Era una lavoro diversificato. Ho potuto conseguire diverse qualifiche
good,My review for anm would be a 3 out of 5 it was sometimes fast paced but the communication berween employer and employee were off.  Other than that they do good work.
good,"Ann Inc. was overall an enjoyable place to work. A typical day was fast paced with a strong focus on delivering excellence in customer service. I loved the relationships I was able to build with my clients. While training associates it was easy to create an entrepreneurial environment that lead to their own personal success. The hardest part about being successful at Ann Inc. was that you were never given all of the tools to be successful. Marketing elements were scarce. Window dressings never were the right size. Merchandise would never arrive in appropriate time frames. The technology that we need to use for our daily operations were out of date and or just did not work. When we would report that we would be sent refurbished/rebuilt replacements that had always the same issues. "
good,"Buen trato con clientes, ambiente tranquilo, organizado y compa√±eros cordiales."
good,"A typical day working at Loft would include working in different parts of the store such as wardrobe, desk, stock, middle of store and front of store. This job made me learn that the customer always comes before what task you are completing. The co-workers were supportive of each other. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet for long hours and barely having a break. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people every day and helping women with fashion advice."
good,"I started working here since June 2009, just a months before I started my ACCA. This role gave an all round accounts experience and I really enjoy working here. I have learned many things from here and my boss has given me training over all sort of day to day tasks which he has been reponsible for."

good,"Relationships, partnership, and teamwork are very important to me. I found all three were present at ANN and encouraged. It was easy to swing my legs out of bed each morning to go to work because of that environment, and the people that I worked with."

good,"I was showed around and knew what i was doing do to the staff, they trained me well and i loved working with them. I learned that the customer is always right of course."
good,"Easily the best place I have ever worked.  There is very low turnover, as many people have been working at this location for all 25 years that it has been open.  Atmosphere is conducive to allowing you to do your best work in a low-stress environment.  Very flexible scheduling and family oriented.  Unfortunate that it will be closing soon."

good,I love my time at Ann ..we truly serve others first. It's a great place to work. You can move up in the company.. The teams help one another out.
good,All of my co-workers are nice and friendly. They are very helpful when I need help. I've learned a lot about working at an outlet store. You have to keep your eye for anything and always be attentive to customers. I haven't worked that long here but I can't wait to progress.
good,"Live. Love. Loft."
