Knowing what needs to be done and having people to help you complete those tasks are crucial to the success of any company. The hardest part of work is doing inventory checks every month. The most enjoyable part of the job being able to work with wine. Wine is my passion.
good,"Whole Foods gives chances to many new employees in the way they recruit. I was one of those fortunate students lucky enough to be accepted by a large billion dollar company such as Whole Foods and gained much experience working there. The company has many meetings weekly to discuss certain safety and consumer tips. The Whole Foods Workplace also has an extremely friendly environment through the way their employees treat you the minute you walk in and when you leave. There were always smiles and small discussions and this promoted a very friendly, healthy, and supportive environment. Although my job there was terminated and not long lasting it was a pleasure to be given the opportunity and to have had the opportunity of working alongside such friendly people. It is not the kind of workplace where you would feel lesser than but instead always supported."

Management takes the time needed to find the right people to be team members and make it clear that their job is to support you to help reach company goals instead of ""manage"" you. Whole Foods operates as a team and has appropriate benefits for all levels of team members when goals are met. They keep good morale and get more from each employee by doing so. You're provided with the information you need daily to excel and are appreciated for doing so. Customers are also much better than just about any retail environment because people who care about what they eat have higher self standards and act more appropriately than for example in a mall."

There was 5 sections: Cold Case, Meats, Burrito, Sandwhich and Pizza. I was to prepare all the food and back for the entire day and afternoon. Making premade sandwhiches and menu items that went into the item. The store would open at 8 am and lots of customers came through on a daily basis getting breakfast and lunch. The hardest part was keeping everything stocked through out the day even when it was busy since there was only a couple of us running a 5 station prep line.

Management is great, they are always willing to help you and listen to any dislikes you might have. The co-workers are excellent to work with, they are so helpful but above all incredible friendly. The hardest part of the job, for me, would be lifting heavy items. I work in the grocery department and some of the product weights more than 50lbs, and thats too much for me.
