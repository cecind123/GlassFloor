rating,review
bad,"Stressful place to work, my wife nearly had a stroke due to high BP during working hours but the Team Lead assigned as if didn't care. Very stressful place to work."
bad,"The company does not value its employees, or management team. They say they do but actions speak  louder  then words (talk is cheep). The company has changed, they are bringing in chosen people from Fremont and the UK and pushing others that are in the position that they need. There are very few people that started the Hyve business 5 years ago. The upper management team is rude and disrespectful to the management team, there leadership style is one of  intimidation and hostile ."
bad,Factory assembly with grumpy management with poor communication skills . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
bad,"too much favortizuim,  allow employees to drive forklift and not obey and OSHA safety.  Dangerous place to work when walking the floors.   HR has no care for safty if you are not a favorate."
bad,Toxic environment for African Americans. I was called out my name many times by the older Hispanics and nothing was done because everyone is related to someone.
bad,"They are racist , they have favorites, they will make it known that they don’t like you. There rude . The supervisor and manager will pick on you , talk about you in there own language or talk about you to other coworkers. They tell you that you will get hired on and after your 6months they let you go with no warning . All the supervisors,managers,favorites will all know your getting fired but won’t say anything."
bad,"I didn't really know what I was doing because nobody trained me properly. My work was scrutinized and then rejected. Out of the three people that inspected my work, you think one of them would of showed me how to do it."
bad,The typical work enviorment was to work with management on projects to be completed . Gather information needed for Cad drawings and collaborate with staff to complete work .
bad,"easy to work with colleagues and approachable management. fair compensation and benefits for all employee. given a chance, i would love to be a part of that company again."
bad,"people are not friendly, they think you come to take there job. pay are very very low. Work are vary hard. A place to work for and looking for something  better to move on too."
bad,Don’t work here. Period management is horrible favoritism at its finest lousy raises . They don’t care about employees all they see is numbers and if the daily work is done or not
bad,Very high turnover enviroment.  Would not recommend for the unexpierenced inside sales rep. Expectations are high with a very undermanged sales team...
bad,"Hyve Solution ( Synnex Corporation)"
bad,This place really drains your soul. Working 6 days a week would seem like its beneficial in advancing your career but that is not the case here. Management is lacking basic human compassion and experience.
bad,"i was working part time as a inventory specialist for a temp agency and the pay was not great. no benefits, vacation time or paid holidays. I would not recommend this job for someone who is looking for a long term career development opportunity."
bad,very racist company will never work there ever...make this a last option for a job ...only if you are on your last leg ..I was sexually harass at this job for a whole year and when it was reported they release me Don't ever work for Synnex.
bad,management is not organized therefore lacking in all departments. I was hired through a temp agency so it was the only way I had my paperwork done on time.
bad,"Doesn't matter how well you-do there isn't anywhere to advance.  Unless you know someone in upper management, in which case, you can move up quickly regardless of how well you do your job."
bad,"If you're looking for long hours for no pay or respect this is the job for you! After two years of no respect and feeling incredibly disposable, I finally had to quit."
bad,People were under paid and over worked. Turn over was extreme and no respect or empathy for workers. management was cliquish and showed no team work. hours was unheard off. 16 hr days.
bad,"From the day I started I didn't like it. They trained me how to pick orders for 2 days and expected me to know what I was doing with any errors. They then fired me n realized they made a mistake n rehired me, and 6 months later they ended up firing me again."
bad,I wouldn't advise anyone to work here unless you really need a job.This is not a place that is very friendly and I would ever make a career out of it
bad,This job pays very little for what is actually deserved. They require people to work 6-7 days sometimes. There is lack of direction.The co-workers are ok to work with. I have learned very little there. The hardest part of the job is not having control of how busy production is. It is not the most stable job.
bad,"watched alot of people get fired on a daily basis, low salery, felt like a number instead of an employee"
bad,"I hated this job, because the management was rude all the time. There was no set schedule, you never found out when you worked or what days you had off , or even what time you got off that day until the end of the day. I learned how to work in a warehouse, how to do packing and shipping of merchandise."
bad,"Although There was plenty of work on hand. The tools needed to properly test and repair the units are not on hand. Screwdrivers and bits like Philips and Torq, you have. But they get in a variety of Apple laptops and iMacs and they don't (or didn't) always have charging cables and power supplies for proper testing. "
bad,The pay for warehouse workers was poor. Turnover rate was unbelievable. Always were training new employees. Work load was unfair and averaged  work day was 14hrs
bad,"Pay is fine, but management team is by far the worst I've every experinced in over 20 years. Very little training.  Managers are very belligerent.  Vendors are great."
bad,"They don't care about anything but the work that they continuously fail to get out in time. They don't care if you have kids, they will try to fire you for leaving early. The work/life balance doesn't exist. They ask you do several huge number tasks simultaneously and they never help. They give you the bare minimum to work with and it's extremely cold all day everyday. 50 degrees. You can't sit down at all unless you're at a certain area."
bad,"This place will chew you up and spit you out. You can and will be fired for anything. Pay is low, the work is stressful and this is compounded by pitiful benefots and ridiculous metrics."
bad,"the person in charge of human resources is bad if you do not like him, say goodbye to your work a lot of favoritism and you rule completely stupid"
bad,"Too much work for the rate of pay, rude management. The company takes advantage of temps. Very poor training which causes issues if you make a mistake."
bad,Didn't  care about growth for the employees. supervisor was always sleeping in his office and floor manager wasn't doing anything about it. wouldn't recommend
bad,This job is great if you just want to sit in a cube and get by. The people only care about themselves. Little to no training is provided. They expect you to just figure it out which is near impossible if you have no prior IT Distribution experience.
bad,"Poorly managed, insecure, unprevisible work-place with ever changing hours, rules, quality assessment, 12-hours-shift, unpredictable holiday planning, dirty space, poorly ventilated workplace, lack of information - chronic, smelling exotic food on floor, dirty equipment, dust, lac of direct communication with key internal interlocutors......"
bad,OK company with good benefits but conditions are poor. Advancement is very difficult or non existent internally. Employees afraid to voice opinions. MICRO mismanagement to the max. Long hours expected for salaried employees.
bad,Absolutely awful place to work get messed around by management . No job security and lack of communication. Overall bad management no thoughts or appreciation of staff.
bad,"Good co-worker its just management not totally good."
bad,"Lots of good people, management not so much in my busi was unit.  Pretty disappointed in how my manager handled things.  Worked really hard, hit quota a good bit but I'm glad to be out.  Good experience though - alot of people work here for a bit, make some friends, and bounce to a better gig"
bad,They allow there leads to run good workers off without listen to both sides..Poor leadship in the company ect.........................................
bad,They highered me and worked for 6 months and when they wanted to higher me for prement they let me go for my background.  They said they knew about it .
bad,"After 10 min training they expect you to know everything and if you ask for help they give you attitude like it bothers them. It’s slow un organized the worst place to work at pay sucks reguardless not worth it at all. You can’t take your lunch to the break room in back of the warehouse you gotta waste 10 mins walking to the front to take your lunch, dirty place period."
bad,The warehouse was very unorganized. Supervisors weren't there to help you or show you what it is they need of you. If it weren't for the other workers showing me what it is that needed to be done I would have nothing to do.
bad,Most unorganized company I ever worked for. Been here for one year and a month only one raise in my first 3 months. None of managers know how to manage nor lead. Most of the People they hire have no common sense what so ever. The only two good things about this job is the hours and the taco truck.
bad,Good job for high school kids to learn about shipping receving
bad,"Concentrix is a good place to work however it is not a place to grow deep roots because the business is not very stable, they have been moving accounts from one country to the next and my current position is a stake for that very reason, they constantly look for better ( cheaper ) options to provide customer service and rumor has it that they are moving from Costa Rica down to India as they already did by migrating half of my current organization over there."
bad,"There is no job security with this company, would not recommend this company. Management is not very good. Company is primarily commission base."
bad,"It differs every building I think because I had a friend in a different building that said work was very chill. The building I was working was very hectic everyday, nothing was done in an organized manner, the workplace was messy, and a lot of other things. The management expects too much."
bad,"Does not offer employee growth through external training, and has lots of politics. Does not recognize a hardworker against someone who just know how to rub elbows with the boss."
bad,"Pay was the lowest I had for Warehousing ($10/hour). The pre-shift meeting typically had Management complaining which made morale drop. My Department had one reach truck and several walkie riders. If you couldn,t get a walkie or the reach truck, you had to use a manual pallet jack.The hardest part of the job was transferring large electronics onto the order pallet. Some of the product stacks were 7-8 feet high!"
bad,all day taking out orders and walking all day. I learn how to work under pressure. the management was at points good but at times no.
bad,"Don't plan on staying there long. The job is extremely dead end and management can care less if you even show up. This is mostly just the RMA department in Tracy so may be the other sites aren't as bad. The site in Tracy is very unorganized when it comes to the RMA department so if you really want the job, go for shipping department."
bad,"Too much politics working there."
bad,It was always business but didn't have a lot of morale. It have been a while so I can not give an accurate account of what the culture is like now! Maybe there is new staff to better run the place.
bad,"Worked here for about 10 years and never really got the opportunity to advance. Christmas season was the busiest and although the money was good during that time, trying to meet shipping deadlines was hectic and constantly changing."
bad,"Fast paced warehouse with little training. Productivity is placed in front of quality. If you're a fast worker, Supervisors let you break the rules..."
bad,Hard to become a permanent. Managers only promote and help their own people. There is mandatory overtime on weekends. They don't care about your time and life. All they care about is numbers.
bad,"Fun place to work for, but Upper Management sucks, no opportunity of growth."
bad,I learned many good things I can take a long with me in my next scope of work. I learned the ins-and-outs of the Channel market. As well learned B2B and B2C sales.
bad,"Unless you are former military, this may not be a good fit. The unit I worked in was packed with former Navy personnel and they really stuck together. I was there the year the IT bubble burst, so it was good at first but then went down hill very quickly."
bad,This place is a good start up position but they severely underpay their employees. Management team is very unorganized and lack a sense of overall direction.
bad,"Back then, we signed up as a technical support specialist but later on the job was changed to sales. We were forced to sell the service, you will not get breaks until you have a sale. If the call was high volume, no break, no lunch. Lowest pay,"
bad,"The job is great the people on the floor are great but the people in the office have no clue what goes on. It isn't organized, but that also comes from the higher ups. At times they don't give you heads up about working overtime. You will be there until the end of your shift and by the time you are ready to walk out they stop you and say we have to work overtime. The bonuses are nice. The work is easy. Just the management that runs the Southaven Facility are the worst."
bad,"and did so for years. The twentysome-th time someone disrespected me , I left.  I was going to fight it with human resources, but the fight was not worth it to me. "
bad,"Large fortune 500 company that needs better management insight and structure.  Opportunities for advancement within operations is not easy.  Fair assessments of talent is not visible as rewards for that talent in the way of advancement is isolated to individuals that are favored.  Turns a blind eye to real operations issues, morale is super low in the warehouse and when reported, not handled appropriately to help curb the issues.  Underpaid management as well as underpaid warehouse workers make it difficult to stay, and difficult to manage."
bad,"NO great advancement opportunities"
bad,"its a really friendly workplace almost everyone gets along with one another, a lot of couples who work there but one thing that does bother me is that the place is really unorganized and everything is out of placed and just everywhere."
bad,"Not providing a good training to the employees."
bad,A very stressful environment that created a clear divide between the haves and the have nots. Management team was not diverse and compensation does not match the effort they expect
bad,A typical day at work was stressful because things always went wrong system wise and you never know what your work load is until almost end of day.  Upper management does not provide the necessary resource to get the job done in an efficient manner.  It is easy to point and say get it done.  Co workers were wonderful.  Hardest part of job was trying to fix something that should not be your responsibility company is to big not to have proper coverage in areas that break down.
bad,"I worked for this company thru a staffing agency for 9 months. Its very disorganized, very low pay with extremely long hours. We would work 10 hour days 7 days a week for a month or two straight, then we would have no work for another month and were placed on call. We would have work, but no materials to do the job, or waiting around for supplies and material to start a job. A few of the lead supervisors were incompetent. I enjoyed and got along with all my co workers."
bad,Type of company where the managers are only there to cover their own butts and blame it all on the staff!! Strong Asian culture that makes it hard to assimilate but that still wasn't as bad as the management team!!
bad,Very rude team leads and supervisor  never overtime on weekends .... coverage with employees... the pay is not very well.. if you don’t speak Vietnamese... your a outsider
bad,"Terrible Canadian corporate culture because of some key management personell.  Management lacks diversity and vision.  Everyone is out for themselves and regularly throws others under the bus as that's the type of bahaviour leadership enables.  A lot of inappropriate chatter especially if one does well.   No real sales strategy other then lowering price to beat competition.  Which results in lack of pay for most reps.  There are some exceptions, and majority of the non management personnel are good people."
bad,"taking call from upset customers, under trained management this place was total chaos as if the ppl in charge where not ready to be. The hardest part of the job was having to do the jobs of other ppl and departments the only good thing was you could kind of come and go as you please as long as you get the job done."
bad,Been working for this (Concentrix) company for -- years now and I have not received any annual performance appraisal. Managament esp HR does not know their policies and procedures.
bad,I was hired for the Repair Tech job after I got my A+ cert. Experience was ok and the people were nice. Job didn't pay enough for the work and I was asked to work weekends every week.
bad,"ok. Worked with an agency. Never got hired permanently. Too many supervisors, not enough time to think. Good people around to work with. Easy money. Too many people talking in their own language, can,t talk in english with majority of people without getting frustrated."
bad,great company to work for absolutely love the job. fast past work was wonderful great experience with different aspects of the company. learned fast operations of the task to complete my job.
bad,working with some of the employees was ok.. some of the people were very competitive and there was a lot of favoritism shown .. the overall job was ok
bad,"I have no comments about Synnex"
bad,"People are kind, folks are helpful."
bad,although very stressful shifts are awaiting its employees in every shift the workplace is still enjoyable and offers opportunity in further enhancing the growth of the employees in terms of their career.
bad,"Best measurement of dimension in services of team leader provider for successfuly issue manner. Follow the procedure of management & help the engineers to find out the problem of testing , repair , and troubleshooting in electronic parts of failure..."
bad,the company really went down the drain they had lots of people on call at one time so no one the was employed for the company was working.
bad,Please dont work here unless you can handle Chinese people's attutude. They will never show you stuff just like  they affraid you will take over their jobs and they will be laid off. You will learn nothing from this company unless you are one of them :)
bad,You're thrown into a job with minimal training at best.  You're expected to perform job functions for which you've had no training or coaching whatsoever.  Your job is constantly on the line.
bad,"They throw you under the bus so that they can cover their ""behind"" regardless of how many years and hours of your life you have given the company. bad"
bad,"bad working experience, trainer do not train, mean coworker, payment is very low, manager do not care about their employee working environment. bad environment in general"
bad,Training was good. Having remote management was horrible. No feed back what so ever on how you were doing. Way to much internal politics. Overall not a great experience nor a bad one.
bad,"Productive and steady work. Easy to pick up. Company works with Facebook, google, and amazon so they have have high value clients. Consistent work but not much growth in the company."
bad,"Too much micro management, They have the resources to promote modern day methods of employee development and motivation, but do not employ them effectively; if at all."
bad,"At first I was excited to be working now I'm not sure. Management sucks. People dnt leave bad jobs they leave because Of bosses, poor management Who don't appreciate their value. They say one thing  n change  next change it up. They need to do a random drug test on all employees. Theres no Team work in the QC only a few n those who are and aren't appreciated no future in this company"
bad,would be a great company if you are permanent if not good luck. management sucks doesn't know how to manage the team.
bad,No REAL room for growth/advancement in the company. Some of the managers are hard to talk to. You first start out as a temp worker before you become permanent. And they only gave a .50 raise.
bad,"I enjoyed the experience i recieved & new things I've learned. Even though, Synnex DID NOT pay well at the time, it was 1 base salary regardless of job description or responsibilities, I learned a lot & met some-great life long friends.GREAT LIFE EXPERIENCE"
bad,"The company should listen to their employees whenever there is a problem occurring in any account. Also, the company shoulfe let the employees have their freebies aside from the Family Dat at Enchanted Kingdom."
bad,This is a good job if you want overtime and long hours. You start out as a temp. You can move to permanent after 90 days if you come to work and perform all of your job duties
bad,"This was where I started my career path working a call center professional and eventually becoming a communication skills trainer. It was not easy, but it was all worth it!"
bad,"Nepotism! Most of the people that work at Synnex are either married or closely related. This can be good or bad depending on your position. The pay is low and the benefits are expensive. Management can be vague at times and lower level employees are not always in the loop. The career and professional development is a joke. Tuition assistance is also a joke. The company only offers $2500 during your time with them. The best perks like free lunches, gifts, and on-site events are for sales only."
bad,Synnex prides itself on not laying off employees. There is room for growth within departments and to transfer and grow in other areas. Work is stable.
bad,No personal growth and lots of corporate politics. The company want to compete with other silicon valley giants but isn't doing much to show for it.
bad,Soul crushing corporate warehouse with very good benefits
bad,Its a good company but be prepared to work 12+ plus hours everyday.
bad,"met great people"
good,"One of the better warehouses I've worked in for sure. Small opportunities for growth, on-the-job training, and small promotion opportunities. Really close to restaurants for lunch."
good,"Temps are the primary job force here."
good,"terrible place to work, but pays the bills, poor management and growth opportunities, working environment is friendly at times,"
good,"Unprofessional environment overall would not recommend for long term employment. Management is a mess, coworkers area  mix of professional and very unprofessional people with little to no computer experience. Skip this job if you can."
good,"The business venture is in a competitive industry. Company needs to invest a lot more on her employees, then build a stronger loyal team who will spearhead her to a competitive edge, build an upbeat work culture and retain the competitive advantage in the industry."
good,"Great company, but management tends to overlook a lot of things, no advancement opportunities unless you know the upper management well, education and experience really dont play a key role here"
good,"If you've been out for a while, it's a good place to get started.  They'll hire practically anyone."
good,"Is being fun working here the employes are like a big family that are willing to work together and help to get the job done, is just a shame corporate dont see it and dont pay employess a fair wage and they give no oportunities for people to move up.  Also company dont buy porper equipment to get the job done there is a lack of forlifts and essential warehouses materials needed for shipping"
good,"apenas para passar um periodo, trabalho cansativo, as opcoes de crecimento sao poucas, sem muitas escolhas, salario baixo e beneficios tambem"
good,A typical day at work I would work with computer servers. Place stickers on the areas that need to be reworked. I learned how to inspect computer servers. The management was poor. It was a stressful environment. The hardest part about the job was getting all the rework stickers on in a timely matter so the rework team can do all the rework. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with friendly co-workers.
good,The site manager is a very racist man. He don't care what you're going thru he jus want the work out. Its just not a fun place to get up and go too. I want a career
good,"This job was causal but 40 hours given and any OT allowed depending upon the order volume.  Every morning stock count, continued by picking and packing, serving customers who picked their orders, packed shipments were put into the delivery area, shelving of items, taking daily deliveries (devanning), allocating bulk and bin area for new stock, general housekeeping etc., for the day."
good,"Assembling, testing and repairing enterprise linux based servers is a great entry-level position to get expose to the IT/Production fields."
good,"Typically I start the conveyor system, inspect and/or troubleshoot and acess possible failures, make repairs and adjustments or replace components on the system; inspect and calibrate as necessary digital scales; inspect and service lift trucks,make minor repairs or schedule repairs; update spread sheets; perform safety inspections and maintain MSDS; maintain spare parts inventory; conform facility lay-out for maximum use of space; inspect rampack machines/ rap machines make repairs and adjustments; perform or schedule outside contractors for other facility needs; interact with departmental supervisors and address individual needs and concerns; keep Director of Operations informed and up to date on company needs and requirements for optimal performance and operation."
good,"No advancement for your career. If this is your first job, good company to learn after that better look for another job.  Looking for job security this is the best company.   Micro management.  Low pay."
good,Sitting down nice but it’s boring without entertainment and gotta be uo and aware. I liked the culture and how cool everyone was but management sucks. They control everything and can even mess up your time if they want
good,"Being a casual not much working hours and in a bigger organisation, hard to move onto better reponsibilities due to the internal systems, with a large customer demand for service and delivery."
good,"No matter where you work, most station you work that required you to stand at least 7 hours a day. When it got slow, they send you home and put you on call with no set schedule...you just gotta wait, until they call you, if that ever happen."
good,Picking orders that is printed on papers or orders that pop up on the RF Scan guns. Good workplace environment with great co-workers to work with. Everyone works in a good atmosphere with good leadership from the team leaders and supervisors.
good,"company just celebrated 100 profitable quarters, hours are long and intense"
good,Everything went well at the beginning. The work flow was good. Steady work. But management gets lazy. No backbone to hold their position as supervisor(s).
good,The company is ok to work for but point system sucks and management is with in the company and suck.other than that it's a good job to start off with for rxperience.
good,"Great place to work right out of college or if you are single.  Lots of vendor sponsored happy hours, weekend trips, and incentives.  Promotions are few and far between though.  Company is focused on buying other companies instead of internal operations.  As it they grew, healthcare options got worse and worse.  Has advantages and disadvantages but overall a decent company."
good,worked hard / was not offered advancement. Management was not concerned with advancing people. I enjoyed the people I worked with and was not impressed with the management team. the Production team achieved a production goal and was given Pizza at 8:30 in the morning ( ouch )
good,"A generic 9-5 company with little to no employee engagement. "
good,"this is a big international company; however, they have the worst management ever. The manager don't really have a good education, the only that they have is little bit experience. There was sometimes they did not know what they need to do for some situations. The next thing i want to say that this company pays very cheap to the employee."
good,"If you are a worker there for certain time theyll fire u because cheaper salary can replace u. Health insurance very good, hood thing alot of work available."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my position was when I was able to assist my clients, build stronger relationships and win business together."
good,"My boss was very inappropriate with the men in our department, snapped at the women, didn’t like to be asked the same question twice. She never once tried to help her employees fully understand the job or give them any other kind of tools to advance, instead she wanted to keep them chained to a certain type of position where they couldn’t advance. The raises are a joke. They do not care about their employees"
good,"Everyday you get your gun, scan items, and make packages with efficiency, in a fast paced environment, needing to make your days quota. Supervisors have no regards to personal issues, they just want to get the job done."
good,"The job itself and the training process were unremarkable, and about what you would expect from a general labor job.  The protocol about the leadership was questionable, as there were many disputes with one leader, including a reported and confirmed incident of harassment, and he faced no repercussions of substance.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the lighthearted society of the blue-collar folk, the hardest part was the dullness and monotony of it.  I learned (or re-learned) to capitulate to leaders, even if they're unjust."
good,"Your typical office job. Nothing inherently outstanding or worrisome about the place. Great benefits, great pay, lacklustre work culture. Nothing to rave about."
good,This is a place where you can get a lot of experience to grow in MFG field. I was haired as Material handler and since 2015 I am MFG lead to acting supervisor now.
good,"SYNNEX doesn't pay much but they do supply their employees with plenty of food---especially if you are on the sales team or product management team. Expect breakfast, lunch, and snacks at least 2 days a week. This helps off set cost of bringing/buying your own meals. "
good,"I typical day at work: Building server racks for Facebook, Google and other High Tech companies;"
good,"There was very good compensation for SYNNEX, but the advancement opportunities are very political. Alot of it is based on who you know and how long you have been at the company...and not so much based on performance."
good,"Arrive at work start picking orders with electric equipment. Move to processing orders with either comp. or RF scanner. Co-workers were easy going. Nothing was really hard about the job once you learned it, unless they were trying to implement new procedures and then kept switching over and over, but that's normal. You have to embrace change."
good,to far of a drive the pay is not good they want you to work hard for less money
good,Job wasn't to bad. Worked in the control environment part. PUT together the mother board and wiring for boards. If you do your job and keep to yourself. You will be fine.
good,"Great starter job for someone that is looking for entry level customer service. They do not drug test, so that should also tell you what kind of place you will be working. There is desk sharing. Bring your own wipes. You have lockers for your belongings, but definitely leave them in your car."
good,The only thing i love the most in the company is that..money is just a number when it comes to company parties and activities...and also their sleeping lounge is very nice and comfy
good,"Then you learn about shift bids, which occur every 3 months.  Although you work remotely, there is little work life balance. Decent benefits are offered, you just have to be prepared to not be able to work a set shift. With shift bids, comes a new manager. You are bounced around quite a bit although the information and client details usually remain uniform."
good,"A company that you can find full time work. 	Built and cabled multi-server racks for Amazon, Twitter, EBAY and Face book"
good,Dollar foolish and penny wise.  Technical Support is mediocre.  Human Resource lacks direction and focus.  Company makes it difficult to find the right support because of pay structure at the floor level.
good,I learnt a lot of things working for synnex a very laid back company very good people to work with always kept busy we got a free lunch once a month which is very nice
good,"Decent place to work. Environment is typical cubicle office space. Spent most of the day on the phones working with sales partners or on the computer making sure stuff was planned and promoted. The more you sell, the higher the goal, they always found a way to keep pushing the carrot further away."
good,"Assisting to the different types of needs of a customer at the same time is challenging, you got to be organized to be able to do it.It is a challenging workplace, I get to meet a lot of people and speak to a lot of people."
good,"Good for immediate work, but dont expect to work full time all the time. Sometimes it's really busy, at other times its extremely slow, and cant make it to 8hrs/day. However I do like the people I work with as they are all hard workers."
good,The job is ok but the workload is too much and not healthy because i worked in a graveyard shift.
good,"The lack of support and teamwork between sales teams at Synnex is something I had not experienced before in any other company I've worked for. Managers and VPs give the best accounts to their favorite sales teams, while other less favored teams are left with small customer accounts which do not have the potential to bring a lot of revenue due to lack of credit and/or resources. Management disregards and ignores this, and sets unrealistic high goals to less favored sales teams that own ""garbage"" accounts which ends up in unfair firing of Sales Reps/Account Managers. On top of this, VPs and Sales Directors condole the  stealing of accounts between sales teams which cause frustration and lost of conflicts between sales teams. At annual sales conferences VPs and some Sales Directors get drunk and act very unprofessional. Synnex is certainly NOT a company that practices what it preaches."
good,Was promised that this was a position for hire permanent then let go after 8 months  you are treated like a child and told not to talk there was a lot of favorite
good,"One lady put her hands on me, another lady threatened to beat me up for telling the office about the first lady. All though I didnt instigate or cause any of these advances towards me, I was fired anyways for being involved."
good,"most of the time you have nothing to do, or you are repeating the same tasks 100 times. The problem with this company is the messy higher management, no room for growth what-so-ever, and the constant fear induced fight for job security."
good,"For Greenville, SYNNEX is a pretty good company. The pay is average and the culture has evolved a little bit.  Unfortunately, the work required is a little heavy.  In order to get promoted or have any visibility to Executives, you must work 10-12 hrs a day.  There is little work life balance.  It is 100% work before family."
good,"Paid is not enough for live expenses and no enough room for career advancement, management is not clear enough and transparency , I will recommend to my friend if it is for internship ."
good,"Long days very competitive. I learned how a computer works. Many hours on your feet."
good,"The culture was good, but their bonus structure needs improvement. The Upper management is very family oriented. There may be some travel involved. Overall good company."
good,"Productive well oiled machine for distribution of goods"
good,Some days you would have a great day working other days management would be in a unpleasant mood. It all depends on the people you work with and for in that area.
good,"SYNNEX  Is a great company to learn new skills with in the information technology sector. The salary is fair and the work is hard, benefits are great, if you put in the effort comission is sometimes possible but not often so you will always be relying on your base salary. Management directors and executives are a laughable joke, which is their biggest weakness as a company today. 3/5 stars."
good,"The company has good benefits, environment and compensation but bad management. Your supervisor will help you out and give you a break if you need it. Holidays and personal leaves can be easily applied. However, the upper management is not good. They will not back you up and you won't find support from them."
good,"The hardest part was understanding instructions that weren't specially given but, needed for very important/detailed paperwork (checklist)that was used for inspecting units."
good,"Concentrix has a great culture with great and knowledgeable trainers and colleagues. One thing I don't like would be the salary that they offered when I was working back there in the Philippines. It is located in Cagayan de Oro and the compensation is really low, even if we support a hard core account with bloody key performance indicators which is slightly impossible for us to reach our goals for the incentives."
good,Not a bad place to work if you don't mind overtime without notice. This is a very fast paced but relaxed place to work. Advancement opportunity is not the best and company is slow to move or do new things.
good,"Rather than being focused on sales, the focus is placed on technical support.  There is a lack of education around product lines, which causes a reactionary environment, rather than a proactive environment.  Great coworkers and teammates but management lacks leadership and rule by fear is used more often than not. I enjoy the travel but do not enjoy the unrealistic customer base (over 3,000)."
good,As much as I enjoy the break room and coworkers i would prefer to do less repetitive work but other than that it is fairly easy to learn and would recommend to any entry level workers.
good,I feel under paid because of the extra work load but still manage to enjoy my stay with the company because of my co-workers.
good,"Worked for Synnex in the UK for two yrs. After a yr I worked my way up to Production Lead & I worked very hard while in that role but due to unforeseen personal problems I had to step down. The company told me I would have to step down to an agency level which I agreed to as I liked working there & needed the job."
good,"The good thing about the job was I like working on a desktop. I like to work with data entry. I learned to pick orders also, and make sure the product matches the description on the order."
good,Labor intensive job with very basic pay. Helps people get back on their feet. Serves as a temporary job while looking for a new one.
good,"They should listen more to the agents than ignoring them."
good,I can be fast-paced at times then extremely slow another so when it's slow you help out other departments. Some days are slower than others but it's an easy job that can be picked up quickly.
good,"Rather not say. My stay at this job was short lived and not on my behalf. Began with an AWESOME Team Manager and when the TM left the company, our new Team Manager brought there people from their previous company and pushed us out. Not good for us!!"
good,"basic day in day out type of position, was giving work instruction that carried though out the day, was a well kept building, comfortable environment and atmosphere"
good,"Great environment, nice friends."
good,"The hard part of the job is the schedule because you need to work during midnight and no day shift available. It's fun though because all teammates are very supportive, helpful and fun to be with."
good,I enjoyed the work that I did for the company.I just didn't like when I came to work some days they didn't have work for us or they would send us home after 2 or 3 hours.
good,I was able to learn more about troubleshooting of internet connection and the products related to it. The company also gave us the chance to excel in marketing and be trained in marketing strategies.
good,"Couldnt keep a manager,left because there was too many issues and not enough training or understanding of what I was suppose to be doing on a daily bases"
good,Company is very helpful with working students and gave me preferrable shifts so I can continue studying. Salary is okay but the incentives for hitting your sales is very hard to get
good,Can be recommended to a friend and relative as one good place to work. State of the art equipment and clean surroundings. An international company and offers health benefit for employee and employees relatives.
good,treated unfairly by coworkers. spent day after day of no one even speaking to me and there was only 3 in my dept.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
good,"Good company overall, but they pay is not scaled to performance as it should be. Many teams do twice as much as others but are compensated the same leading to an uncomfortable environment and tough to stay motivated."
good,"My time at Synnex was very short. However I learned quite a bit in my short time, My trainer and manager were both very pleasant, helpful and informative,"
good,"It's a fun work environment to work with. I learned a lot in technical troubleshooting and networking. The management is good, they treated all employees as family. The hardest part of being in a call center is the pressure of hitting the monthly targets for your incentives (KPI). One thing i love about this company is that we work hard, we party harder."
good,"Great work culture and supportive management, after acquisition from IBM, there are certain process which are made redundant and HR is missing competency analysis of employees, given there are 65K employees Globally."
good,Its A Great And Relaxing Job. I Learned Nothing Because I Knew Everything. It Wasn't The Best. Its A Warehouse. Trying To Teach Somebody Something And They Act Like They Don't Want To Learn. Got A Chance To Meet New People.
good,"The workplace is fun and enjoyable because you have a lot of times to mingle with your friends while waiting for the next live chat. This company helps me develop my sales skills because since the time that I started working in the BPO industry, I'm only handling technical account from different countries. I was able to work under a high pressure because you need to hit your daily sales quota and also hit your Q.A scores."
good,It was unorganized. I did't like how the Management brought in over 80 temporary employees and expected them to meet numbers when they were untrained.
good,"Good! interesting work fast paced environment. I have nice and good co worker. I learned different areas of work, assembly, cabling, quality work and documentation."
good,"This company has a lot of areas for improvement, so if you want to work hard and develop your skills, management is very open to what ideas you have to make that happen."
good,"Work starts early and ends late; about an hour. Preparing rooms, hand out materials, and communicating through email is a daily routine, on top of the regular module we facilitate. Time management is the most challenging part of the job. Being able to be a part of my trainees success was worth all the effort . Every one on the team is supportive of one another."
good,the best part of this job is to transform an irate customer to a loyal and satisfied customer. Managers lead you and give you all the necessary tools to work efficiently and motivated.
good,i didnt like the job for the simple fact every time i would mess up they werent really telling me what i was doing wrong like i was QC a pallet then he would tell me that i was doing it wrong without really explaining. so basicaly i was kinda confused but not really.
good,"SYNNEX's company culture is ok, managers in Finance are ok. Just the company's compensation was not that competitive, especially for me."
good,"Synnex is a great job for anybody looking to get there start in the IT field. There is a lot of thing to learn there and every body there is very friendly,"
good,"Everyday, we need to assist customer with their internet connection and devices. And within the year that I've worked as a Tech Support, I was able to realize that having a sale each day is not the most happiest part of the job, it is giving service beyond our customer's expectation. "
good,A very competitive environment where weekly we had extra activities to inspire sales and boost morale.  I enjoyed working here a lot and it is a learning atmosphere
good,Micro managed but stable work environment. Most employees stay to themselves and no one really trusts anyone else. Very successful and growing company with a good industry reputation.
good,Job is easy and people that i work with are very professional. The only bad thing about it is about 90% of the employee are temps. it is hard to get permanent because some employees has been working in their for 1 or 2 years and they are still temps.
good,"always stressed"
good,"I liked working there. We had good overtime hours. My supervisor was cool/easygoing. I would work there again. I learned alot of things."
good,"Time in at graveyard shifts, answer inbound calls, answer queries, troubleshoot problems, pitch for sales."
good,"Building units,installing components needed by the customer"
good,"good place to work, improved software and interpersonal skills"
good,"Stand all day, over-time hours, for a short period of the year. Possible on-call."
good,It was a ok job and the warehouse was very hot and the pay was low but the insurance was good.
good,busy and challenge
good,This job was very strict. Management treated the workers like they were elementary kids. Talking was almost prohibited. Also no rotations in stations. Terminated because of a 'rumor' was spread.
good,asembly line learnd lots of intel hard drives product. the hardest part of the job was no part it was fun
good,I could consider Concentrix as one of the best BPO company in Davao not just because of it's good and comfortable workplace but also because of the management that they have . They are indeed excellent in terms of handling their people and ready to train those beginners. You could really say that working there is a worth experience though sometimes the account we're working on is quite challenging.
good,"Very hard to advance. Percentage of commission pay is based on your teammates that they assign, which sucks. Too stressful for the pay. You do get to travel which is nice, but the pay is really tough to deal with and the opportunity to advance is few and far between"
good,Not a bad place to work. Relaxed atmosphere and good management. Don't always get our 40 hours and the rate of pay is not good. Good for temporary job
good,"Fue mi primer trabajo donde aprendí a trabajar bajo presión, tratar con clientes difíciles, brindar buen servicio al cliente y configurar una gran cantidad de dispositivos. Ambiente de trabajo tenso y mucho movimiento de personal."
good,"Some are easy and hard. It takes time to practice everything what is going around in the products, so its hard to remember everything in the products.For example, refused to added why its damaged. Sometime everyone think you are slows but you tried to finish everything."
good,Synnex Corporation is a fast paced sales organization with a tremendous amount of talented people. Working at Synnex gave me great perspective into the ever changing IT distribution channel.
good,"Needs a Regular Morning Schedule. Needs no more random come in the morning. Has an Extreme parking lot issue."
good,I have been working there for 3 years and the work is not hard but they expect fast pace. It is a third party company witch means they have to please their costumers at all times to reassure their business to keep coming so it is little room for error and have to be fourth taking on all projects.
good,Synnex was a great place to learn and enhance your skills. They provide training and you get to travel to different warehouse. Overall a good company to work for but difficult when you reach a management position.
good,Working in this company helped me in terms of adjusting to the demands of training life. It also taught me to be more independent since I was sent to the provincial site to help out in facilitating training sessions.
good,"In a typical day in my last position I fulfilled management tasks of 	Ensure that individuals are properly trained and their job functions are being performed correctly."
good,I like working with this company and i have learned lots of new challenges in the field of Production and Manufacturing. The Management is fine but i like the team i work with; they are nice and very cooperative people. The hardest part of my job was the ERP system complexity but i learned it so quickly.
good,"people at this company are good and fun to work with, very dynamic kind of work and will unleash your full potential. every day is different from the other day wherein you can learn different things every single day."
good,I handled a Healthcare account (Health insurance) based in United States. Our shift starts at 9:00 pm and ends at 6:00 am. We are answering calls from the Provider/doctor's office asking about patients eligibility to health benefits and the following up on their claims. I consider the schedule/shift as the hardest part since we've been working at night but I enjoyed assisting customers and talking to doctor and nurses probably because I can relate to them since I am also a Registered nurse.
good,"Great place to work."
good,Long hours of standing on your feet really has to be your thing will probably be just a job for a lot of people. I did not like it why does it require 150 characters jeez.
good,Its the culture of Synnex Concentrix that keep their people in the company and make their people do their best in whatever it takes because of how they treat the employees. Sometimes its the career advancement is the challenge over there however its good company to start with and stay long if you are contented with an average income.
good,"Most days very busy and an occasional free lunch, management easy to work with, the people all work hard and as a team which makes it a better environment in which to be in."
good,It's and I'm place to work but it's not what I prefer to stay at for a lifetime. You can get all the over time you want. But when it's time for you to go they never wants to see you go home. But it's and I'm job.
good,"The management, colleagues and work environment is what it really seems. Workplace is fun and gives a lot of incentives and activities to work with. Good salary package."
good,"Great place to work when your just starting in the corporate world for sales."
good,The hardest part of the job is when we are forced to work on rest days. The salary is very low and not sufficient for workers' needs. Some co-workers are fun to be with but some are not. But I have learned a lot of things when it comes to the job.
good,Walked around all day and picked products that would be shipped off in boxes. Lots of people working there so it was not a dull work environment.
good,"Every day is fun and challenging, I learn technical things, workplace culture is good and fun, management is good also hardest part of the job is low salary most enjoyable part is stress relieving activities"
good,"Not all people would think the same, but my opinion regarding work at Concentrix is positive ,me and the team sometimes go out after work for a drink, during work day, everyone is busy doing tasks, following up customers and answering emails."
good,"Monday through Sunday"
good,"OK Company, Fairly Nice People, Worked Late Hours, No Training, Good Pay & Benefits"
good,"Overall, a good company. Learning new things in advance. I'm currently working on iMac and MacBook products, mostly repairing or replacing parts. I wish this company has better opportunities for me to advance and have something better."
good,"It was a good experienced working in a call center industry, I had a lot of training, the management helps us to dream big and giving rewards to what we have contribute to the company, the hardest part for me is that the competition makes the agent pulling down the other agent, I want everyone to succeed  and be happy to the success of others, I gained friends, I like the incentives and benefits not only for me but for my family."
good,"good working environment, managers are friendly, treats you like a family"
good,It's really a fun workplace the staffs are so hardworking. The only challenge that I've experience is the shifting schedule and sometimes we have to work on a graveyard shift even also during holidays
good,"Friendly people"
good,The workplace culture is diverse. You are on a time clock and you are required to pass through metal detectors and security. Management calls for a meeting before you begin working every now and then if anything has changed or to keep everyone up to date. Supervisors are pretty helpful if you have any questions. I learned how to put together a computer or take apart if needed.
good,Job position was easy. Just the company has bad management .It was had to request to take brakes from 10+ work hours per day. some people in the building are nice and other were mean. They will not give you a chances to move up a position.
good,A typical day at work can be busy if we get a lot of production to tests for a whole quarter of a project. It can be slow on days because at the end of the quarter we have no more productions to work with until our client gives us some more products. Working here has help me increase my skills and gain some experiences. The hardest part of this job is getting put on call when there are no work!
good,"Very easy to get a job here. I got paid a dollar above minimum but the non-contract ppl got paid more. The main con i frequently noticed were the ppl i was working with. I was being mansplained to from the older men countless times (like taking a box out of my hands and making it for me kinda thing) , and they would often say inappropriate things to me (like trying to set someone up with me)."
good,"I work so hard to get shipping on time despite the extra time taken by previous stations, like testing or repair. I keep a team together, motivated and committed."
good,"Synnex is a great, growing company with job security and opportunities to move, but opportunities to advance are challenging. There's a myriad of opportunities for credit, finance, sales, global business and learning opportunities and good job security. The culture is intense without a good work/life balance."
good,"Managed and received, Inventory control, Shipping/Receiving, Quality control, Processed complaints, Human Resources, Managed health insurance accounts."
good,Everyday presents a new challenge and learning new methods to solve a verity of problems. The workforce turn around has a lot to do with the challenges at this place. Most of the work force are temps and the temp pay is very low so it gets hard to motivate people to get things done.
good,Fun place to work at. The co-workers are young and fun to work with.  As long as you do your job correctly you have nothing to worry about.
good,Synnex has taught me a lot throught my tenure. I learned how a warehouse proplerly runs. I learned how they operate and how to work in the many departments within the average warehouse.The co-workers are awsome and perform most of the training required to work.The most enjoyable part of the job is walking because it is beneficial to a healthy life.
good,"I enjoyed working there because I enjoyed talking to the medicare beneficiaries that called in and I enjoyed working with some of the people that I connected with."
good,This place is good to get job experience then maybe move on to something else. Long term not a lot room to move up . The pay could defanately be better .
good,"Overall good environment and great people, very faced paced and must have product knowledge or you will be lost and won't keep your job. Please pay attention to detail as well."
good,"Managing accounts dealing with VAR, Vendors, PM, BD, work deals from A-Z.  Great sales floor lots of training and good food"

good,"As working in the assembly line. I enjoy prepping the service machine, I must correctly and accurately install all screws, panel , hard drive , fans, power supply and switch, and electrical parts."
good,The people are what make this company. A real family feel when working at SYNNEX. Managers always are fair and are open to offering new opportunities.
good,"Great company "
good,Having long hours would be the hardest part of the job. It takes a lot of patience and confidence to get through the hard long days or work and also with kids.
good,"the job was very easy and hard at times, very good supervisors, happy and very good co workers, the place and the warehouse is very clean to work. just happy to be there"
good,I would recommend to friends great place and great company to work for.. Fun to work with people from different back grounds. Lot of new things to learn and working for face book is great plus to my resume.
good,"Working at Hyve Solution can be both boring and intensive. There are some days where there isn't any or very little work and then the next day or week we are working non-stop for days. The supervisors and team leads are relaxed and laid back and are always looking out for us. During days where we have no work they will try and keep as much of us working when management wants us to take the day off."
good,Synnex is a very well tuned distributor with a multi-billion dollar revenue. Synnex ranges through all technology from IT to computer hardware/software. Very secure company.
good,A typical day would include friendly conversation with co-workers and management as the day begins... being productive and efficient in sales operations with attention to detail.  Problem solving and taking the initiative in providing support to the Sales Reps along with multi-tasking and exercising great communication skills.  Learning the application process and being equipped with tools necessary to effectively manage account maintenance and process orders correctly and accurately.

good,Good job for people to enter the technology sector. They are focused on customer satisfaction. Continual process improvements help to achieve this goal. Overall a well run organization
good,productive and calm workplace. advanced my skills with RF scanner and counting system. some of management don't have a clue while most get it. the hardest part of the job is cleaning up after people that don't care about the job.
good,"learned a new skill"
good,"The team atmosphere is good. There is lot of flexible work shifts though."
good,"I was handicapped from the first day of training. I wasn't given all the tools needed to start off in the right directions. I took over 2 weeks to get my logon credentials and by the 3rd week we were expected to pass an exam with 80% or better and how could I, without having the right tools when I needed them."
good,"My Supervisor makes work for his employees enjoyable, understandable when it comes to new products and growable. We can learn new things within this job field as we progress being apart of Synnex corporation."
good,SYNNEX Information Technologies was originally a small distributor that sold computer peripherals.  Over time they morphed into a contract manufacture and a supply chain logistics company.
good,"My job deals with a lot of configuation. My duties are to image certain unit models. Hardware installments were done as well. My job requires a lot of training to be productive in the position. You must have knowledge on different units such as: Lenovo, Dell, HP, and more. I also worked with printers as well."
good,"A great place to develop communication skills, telephone marketing and sales skills as well as well as professional training in specified areas for each client. Make new friendships. Potential opportunities in growth with company in management and quality positions and in other areas. Cons are limited pay scales, and expensive benefits per pay as well as unstable longevity of entry level positions, contingent to client/company contracts."
good,loan processing.
good,"there ok to work for work place ok managment ok / Warehouse Associate/Shipping Clerk    "
good,"Pros"
good,"Saudável ambiente, inovador, agradável,motivador, excelente chance de crescimento"
good,"Friendly enjoyable environment, able to use my skills, able to problem solve. No air conditioning so hot during summer. Smoking area outside. Always busy."
good,"I enjoy that there is no typical day, every day is different and with the vendors that I handle you never know what you will have to react to on any given day.  I enjoy that I have freedom to travel to meet with customers and vendors.  On the retail side, where I reside, upper management seems discriminatory towards sales, allowing more freedom while showing distrust to the product team."
good,good place to work for. Nothing too hard. come in do your job and everything else falls in place. The only reason i left was to start school. If there was a second shift at the time i was working there i would have stayed there.
good,"- focused on empowering employees"
good,come in and start picking using a scan gun. you place product in boxes and then set them on the line to be shipped. ship products using fedex and ups or DHL
good,"I loved working with different servers and computer parts. I learned about technology and which tools they use to build google, twitter, and facebook servers."
good,"SYNNEX is a great and fun place to work with lots of comps to employees including free lunches and after hours events, but with low salary as compared to market average makes it hard to justify feeling truly satisfied about the direction of one's career path. I'd work there again if the salary was a little better."
good,"It was a great place for me to start especially with the account that I was able to get in. Although there are a lot of flaws in this company regarding the benefits, reimbursements and stress that I encountered; I was still able to tolerate the workplace because of my colleagues and management who are quite understanding especially in my condition since I started working as a single mom. Kudos to this company for letting me bring my kid to work when I have no one else to find to care for them."
good,A typical day in the company would be checking for irregularities on the server and network racks that were built and correct these errors  before shipping it.I learned to be meticulous and attentive to details like cable label orientations and port location of the cables
good,Working here at synnex was a technology dream a warehouse of everything. It taught me so much about the latest technology. Fast paced atmosphere. .THE BEST EVER
good,"I learned how to work as a team."
good,"The job itself is a great introductory job you could have from anywhere else. The tasks given to you are taught thoroughly and are fairly easy to understand. The hardest part of the job was when customer orders were low so the pace slowed down, but it is otherwise a very good job."
good,"Good place to work with great team members. A lot of travel and not much time with family at times. great benefits and the HR team is good to work with,"
good,"I signed on as a repair technician but have had the opportunity to work in other sections to learn different parts of the operation such as packing, inventory control and shipping. My manager understood when family issues arose and allowed me overtime to make up for lost hours. I would stay if the pay was better and I didn't have a 2 hour commute."

good,"I had a lot of different experience I floated around and learned"
good,"Steady consistent pace"
good,"Engaging with Customers"
good,One can grow with the company by doing his best and if one is up to the challenge. The account we had though requires a high standardand it compels someone to strive and aim for the best to stay with the job. Hope that the benefits is quantified by the high metrics required.
good,I want to be back Synnex when I can. They will give you permanent like after you work in there 1 year. I like working at Synnex if they pay more than before
good,Synnex was a good experience for me although the pay was not up to my expectations. Management was good and communication was good. I learned different positions in the time of me being there which was very beneficial.
good,Since I was working the night shift for this location is a challenge. Pay grade is grate at that time. I am not sure of what condition it is at the moment.
good,it is a good work place there are many friendly workers who are help to each other but there is a work hours now very less..this is a clean workplaceok
good,"Great company to get hands on experience with computers, computer software, and servers. If you are in the Information Technology field or plan to be, i strongly recommend working at a company like Synnex."

good,It is a fast pace work environment. Was able to learn to the Quality Control position in short period of time. If stats and performance are good you are not micro managed. Body is typically sore and end of the day from constant moving and lifting.
good,"I liked it for its payments as well as it's working pace "

good,"Good working environment, Cooperative people, Different kind of work like Paper pick, Smart Pick. Paperless Pick, QC Line, Put away etc., Rotational work"
good,"This job b was a great experience. The culture is diverse to an extent, there’s mostly people of Indian and Arab decent that works there. The workers work in a fast pace but if one mess up the whole line is messed up."
good,Great growing company with high morals and work ethic. Leaders develop talent and give freedom to build expertise and specialization. Company continues to hire for open positions based on strategic areas of investment. Industry-leading sales system but focus is on customer and vendor relationships to grow business.
good,"A typical day is starting with the bunch off work."
good,I worked there for a year and  i was a bit dissatisfied  with the benefits they give to the employees. I worked on a graveyard shift and i feel like i was under compensated that time.
good,"It was my first job at Synnex.i learned there too many things like how to do the communication on work base,how to handle the pressure of the work,among the many projects give the importance to priority,learn the system of the company.It was good management there,and the people over there was also good.Work on special projects, that was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Synnex atmosphere is fun, you build a family bond when you enter the place. If you are seeking to advance Synnex has an opportunity for growth. Being a planner on the team has taught the true meaning of teamwork; from inventory to production lines."
good,"Typical day could be slow or very fast. Depending on the team, you're in for a great environment and enjoyment at work or possible dread. "
good,"With my almost 7 years experience in customer service with different teams, I learn to become more competitive/productive to meet my goals. Being part of top agents I realized that I am being hard to myself, I am pushing a little bit more on what is asked which I find the hardest part for me however it is good for the company. The management gives us activities to forget how stressful our work is and just have fun."
good,"They have very good medical benefits not only for the employees but also for their respective dependents."
good,"Everything is almost perfect except for the  for the management, since it's like a politics where in your career will grow if you are close to the persons above you when it comes to the position"

There are many moving parts to the this Fortune 500 company and I'm happy to say that these parts typically move in the same direction. SYNNEX and its subsidiaries make for a top-notch Corporate environment, despite some of the challenges that any large corporation may deal with.

good,"The most easiest warehouse I’ve ever done and I really enjoyed it. I was in the RMA department just scanning, checking items and input into the computer. Being on the computer the whole time was the best not having to lift heavy items or walk around a lot. The schedule was perfect and not many people like other warehouses. But the downside was a lot of drama since it’s just girls. I didn’t have much problems  until new girls came which was girls that I had problem with months ago over social media. Never in my life ever thought I’d be working with them. The first week was fine then out of nowhere one of them tried to start problems that almost got into a fight. The supervisor was honestly no help only to contact our agency and the agency let all of us go. Doesn’t make sense when I didn’t do anything and I was employee of the month with them for only 2 months working there."

good,Job is just fine and not stressful. I learned many things from my manager and the training from the company. Workplace is also good. The hardest part of the job for me is working with people who are not having fun in their work and always think negative.

Starting off as entry level, they are always willing to train you and move you up. They take the time to get to know you as a worker of the firm, and also as a friend, to find a way to teach you and build a relationship with you. Your co workers end up being like a family, and work is like your second home. The hardest part of the job, is maintaining 500 plus clients on your data base, and being a part time receptionist, with answering every inbound call coming into the firm. What was most enjoyable at the firm, was hearing clients and how we helped them become successful in becoming debt free."
good,I learned a lot of skills specially in programming because of standard coding and system life cycle that we follow. I'm happy working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is that when it comes to the rush part or misunderstanding of your manager. But I can always handle and manage the situation.

good,My experience working at Synnex was enjoyable for the most part.   Product training was excellent but at times excessive.  With such a large product line the representatives often had a feeling of information overload with daily enhancement and upgrade announcements.  The management at Synnex is extremely aggressive in creating new partnerships.  The sales margins in this industry are extremely low and it is difficult for less tenured representatives to maintain their commissions consistently.  The tenured representatives selectively sell higher margin hardware software or licenses.

good,I like working at Synnex Concentrix.A very nice working place.Well compensated.The management is great!For me the hardest part of the job is the transportation because i need to wake up as early as 3 am to catch the 4 am employees free transportation
good,I enjoyed working there for 5 years and learning from other experiences is the best teacher for me. The workplace is comfortable to work while having fun at the same time. I think the hardest part of the job is when they need to transfer you to another account or another team. You need to get along while you already build friendships with your co-workers. And the most enjoyable part of the job is when you know the weekend is just around the corner.

good,"After the meeting it was time to get to work everything was almost perfect about this job. My supervisor is the coolest i really miss this job. My supervisor helped out in so many ways i cant even describe because he showed in so many  ways he was really for his employees and not against them and when things got hard ruff or difficult he showed numerous ways around everything and he made sure you had no reason to doubt yourself. Co workers were just fine they were all so different. The hardest part about this job was leaving because I loved my job i loved waking up heading to work but due to lack of transportation i had to leave, the most enjoyable moment about this job was having a cool supervisor and a cool team lead."
