bad,What is expected of you is unreasonable. They lie to you non stop. If you’re not their favorite you don’t go anywhere. It’s a horrible place to work. Don’t do it!
bad,"Don’t work here if you want a life outside of work.  they expect you to give them everything, including all you pay to charities.  Worst place to work ever"
bad,Very dishonest upper management. Lies and deceit are common practice. Fear based work environment. Associates are treated horribly. This is not a place you want to work.
bad,Alliance Data's management has become very unprofessional and unreliable. Let go 380 associates this year without any notice. Just pack up your stuff and leave.
bad,This Job says they allow grow but you need to know the right people they lie to the associates they don’t have and room for help don’t work here unless you have too not worth the stress.
bad,The company has drastically changed for the worse . I would not recommend anyone to work for this company if you care about your mental health or being respected as a human
bad,Trust me...go anywhere else...save yourself. This place is going down the drain. I have worked here many years and the environment now is a gloomy fear ridden place
bad,Don’t do it. You will be overworked and under paid!! It’s a cult like environment. This is coming from someone that was in leadership. They will do lay offs. They start from the top and work their way down. Life is greener not working here!
bad,Alliance Data is excellent at being obsessed with charities (obviously to get a break on taxes).  It is so bad that they have agents go to your desk and mKf you feel bad if you do not donate.  This is quite possibly the worst job I have had.
bad,This company is a joke. When they first moved to cda they were great. So it seemed. But then they grew to fast and couldn't keep it going smooth. Sup become supervisor when they shouldn't. Sup have sexually harrassed and they simply get demoted. Sup can set out to for someone and get away with it. They are notorious in over looking ppl for promotions and given to ppl who don't deserve them. Everyone sleeping around with eachother. Such a very
bad,In my opinion this place partnered with my original employer so we could teach them everything about the credit accounts they bought from us then fired everyone they hired a year later
bad,Not a work  schedule there do not know how much work employees have not 40 hours work on weekends some time in week 1 day 2 days three day or five day u never know
bad,"I was expected to do the job of two people with no mistakes and every time"
bad,"This is anything but a professional environment. Employees are treated like office equipment, expectations very unrealistic. Don't ever think you can have a life of your own because if you do you will be written up and threatened every week. There is a reason educated people are NOT needed in this environment, and that reason will be obvious to you within your first month out of training. The location in Westminster CO is in a fine area if you have a car or if you work mon-fri 8-5 but if you rely on public transportation you are screwed. You won't have nice mon-fri 8-5 hours you will work hours when buses don't run. There are no opportunities for advancement unless you are content to move from one phone monkey job to another phone monkey job with no increase in pay but more responsibility. AND, advancing in this company only comes to those who are favorites and no one else. I know someone who started there almost 2 years ago and he has the exact same loser job he started with. In the 6 months I was stupid enough to work there I saw unprofessional behavior run rampant through that office. Management is a JOKE. If you have anything at all going for you, especially education, pass this place up. You WON'T succeed here."
bad,"At Alliance Data, there are times when you WILL feel you’re in North Korea in that you are made to cheer your “leaders” at STUPID pep rallies you are required to attend.  You only THINK you would never do something so fake, but if you work at ADS, YOU WILL BE DOING IT. "
bad,"Supervisors abuse their power,They stress you out when you don't rank,but when you ask for help, they don't take the time to help you. They pick and choose who they want to help. They said you will never have to worry about  job security there, but they just closed a site out of the blue laying off over 100 people after sending us a email saying were doing better than ever. There is a lot of discrimination. Five others and i quit together. I would not recommend this as a place to work, i actually think think they need to be put under investigation for discrimination."
bad,I'm not qualified to reveiw this type of business. I had a lot of bad experiences here that tested my faith in humanity. the building I worked in was located in an undesirable part of town and that essence permeates through the whole building. I felt like promotions there are just carrots they hold above employees heads to make them think they have a shot while supervisors would sabotage portfolios and hurt candidates chances of advancement. Not a good place for someone who wants to make the world a better place. ok if you want a job and don't mind asking dying cancer patients to pay their bill.
bad,Alliance Data is a company that has very inconsistent management and unclear policies and expectations. You are expected to meet unrealistic expectations.
bad,"was fun, played gamed and activities for incentives. Was very flexible and allowed to change shifts. Didn't like to be yelled at be customers and didn't like the commute"
bad,This plave will rot you from the inside out. The people there just look for ways to up themselves at the cost of your reputation. Mamagement WILL NOT back you up on anything. They will lie to cover themselves because they know they could be fired next.
bad,Doesn’t let you miss even if you have a doctors notes many other workers go over points and never get fired. But yet others don’t get the same treatment.
bad,"The only thing that matters is numbers. Don't get comfortable, work from home but that's the only luxury. The culture is fake. Late stage collections have unrealistic goals."
bad,Micro management biggest click company I have ever worked for it's not a job it's pure harassment by management i called labor board for loss of wages on my Collitions they would allow there friends to steal accts not one good manger do they have .
bad,"This job will kill you eventually because of the stress, its good as a stepping stone. But that's it. The management expects unrealistic goals and the management constantly uses scare tactics against employees to meet performance standards. Iv been there awhile and ever since the first day i started its all about meeting your numbers and if you don't meet the numbers you will be fired. You will endure a incredible amount of emotional and mental abuse from both management and customers alike. The worst part is your expected to take the abuse, like your a sub human literately. Its so ridiculous and anybody who has ever worked there would agree.  They try to paint a pretty picture of this job but the reality is; its just a hostile work environment. "
bad,"This call center is notorious for high turnover on employees and having worked there, I saw why. I was offered a mandatory evening shift and was told I could request a shift change in less than a year. Never happened. The management micromanaged and nitpick about everything they could use against you. There’s no work/ life balance so if you get the evening shift expect to work every Saturday except maybe one off a month."
bad,They entrust you to be responsible for people's feelings but dont equip you with the resources to actually fix a problem.  Absurd culture that they brag about.
bad,Horrible unprofessional. Management is weak and bunch of bullies. Stress. Headaches. Not wanting to go in everyday. No place for advancement. Wouldn't suggest to anyone.
bad,Worst job I have ever had. Extremely cut throat and backstabbing. Did not appreciate the fact that our promised monthly incentives were stripped away and the fact that we were forced to work on days which we originally had off. Worst company to work for as far as keeping their word or if you enjoy constant contradiction on what youre demanded to do.
bad,"Culture at the Coeur D Alene, Idaho payment solutions dept is harassment and abuse of power by the management, the other depts. are not like this as far as I know"
bad,"Everything said here is true about management and team leaders. Inept and and have no business leading anyone.  They are uneducated with a High school mentality.  Cut throat gang warfare environment.  Turnover is out of this world.  I watched someone get promoted 3 times with nothing to show for it.  HR is utterly useless.  Basically, if enough people leave for the right reasons, only then will they uphold their corporate ethics parody and get rid of the manager.  PIP's are a joke and have nothing to do with performance.  Dog eat dog world there."
bad,It is a call center. So you are taking calls from different department stores. They process CC and take payments. You have to make your numbers each and every day. And you have to up sale what ever they are sailing at the time.
bad,"I would never recommend this place to anyone. It was the most stressful job I have ever had and I dreaded going there every single day. My supervisor was not helpful at all, and they trained me for 1 day on how to take calls for a new bucket they were putting me in and I went from a reasonable amount of calls per day to back to back calls all day long from the time I got there until the time I left for the day. I was not given a raise for the extra work I was given and I did not think that was right at all."
bad,I do not wish to comment. The company was bought out several times within my 14 year tenure. Overall the job was great. The environment could use some cleaning up though.
bad,There structure is set to loose bonuses they will stab you I'm the back with have a 93 percent average and your still let go for following there contradicting policies and this company just changed policies to take advantage of there customers
bad,"I was there for three weeks and was the primary associate to help solve over $175,000 in consumer fraud. Then out of no where, told to leave (as I was a temp). The next day, my initial supervisor claimed I never worked there as well as my rep from the temp agency claimed I never worked there as well. What a waste of time."
bad,"On the phone all day, helping account holder's understand their bill.  The culture was great, co-workers are fantastic.  The hardest part of my job was calming down an upset account holder.  The most enjoyable part was knowing that I did please an account holder."
bad,"Office politics do play a big part of any call center which is what we experienced with skip trace role, those that were the favorites got chosen to go into a billing line where people called in to make payments and got bonuses because they got more payments than average skip trace team members."
bad,This job was a stressful job. This job pay was not high as it should be to handle the calls that you have to take here at this job. This job is not worth applying for
bad,"They don't work with the employee, would not recommend them to anyone, they micro manage and look over your shoulder daily, you can't talk to other employees either"
bad,poorly trained. changed supervisors 3 times in one year. Stats were very hard to hit. Management never had the same answer to my question. Internet would go down and we would have to de-escalate the calls
bad,Too many chiefs not enough Indians.The management is not trained properly. They are not on the same page. One question could get 10 different answers. Not one answer would be correct.
bad,"Without a doubt the worst company I have ever been with."
bad,Help run the floor with the supervisor. Sometimes ran machine when needed.
bad,busy call center but to distracting and loud. Clients would complain about all the back ground noises
bad,Wasn't there long enough to learn much about co-workers or management.
bad,this was a temp job so there was really much I could get out of it but customer service
bad,"Just a stressful environment. The company itself wasn't horrible, but the idiots I worked with made the job hell."
bad,When I first went for interviews the human resources representative started to interview me for the wrong position.
bad,A typical day is so stressful-you deal with for the most part angry and idiots on the phone plus the pressure from company to sale lousy products and services-you will lose your job if you cannot sell enough. This has happened to tons of employees. This place is like a revolving door for hiring and firing-NO JOB SECURITY!!! Management is terrible-training is terrible-equipment you work with is ancient-computer software applications constantly do not work correctly. I can honestly say working at Alliance was the most miserable job I have ever had.
bad,Was an okay job 5 years ago. Then the company wanted to make 20 billion by 2020 and took every step to make that. Cutting bonuses and increasing work. Once the CEO left hundreds of jobs were cut. The work environment is depressing. Hard to find happy coworkers there.
bad,Over worked. 150 calls a day. No bonus. No incentive. Nothing. I ranked the top 5 and it still was never good enough. When i ranked 2. I was told i can do better.
bad,"This company does not care about it's employees. You are dealing with high stress calls all day long, very poor support. The company seems to be going broke, I feel they will close this site very soon. The company cannot be trusted, you do not have job security, no matter what position you hold."
bad,"At one time, this was an amazing company that cared about it's people.  Today, it is about work over any other balance.  Justified requisitions are denied, and staff is promoted based on who cuts the most throats."
bad,"Do not work here! This company talks like they care about their employees but then lay off 300 plus in one day. People who have been there for a decade or more were told to leave. The leadership is horrible on a whole new level. They make terrible decisions and put all the blame on the lower employees. I know for a fact that they break local, state, and federal laws then tell you to not go to HR. Terrible place to work! Oh and if you are in the military good luck getting ahead, they could care less about your service and USERRA. I know for a fact that certain departments have talked about not hiring military because it's to much of a problem. They do not care about you!!! Leadership is horrible!!! Do not live up to their own values!!! Break laws!!! STAY AWAY!!!"
bad,"I worked at Alliance Data in Rio Rancho for 2 1/2 years in all that time I never got to do anything except be on those phones. I used to get 85 to 95 calls a day you talk about stress. I started out as new accounts I had never worked in a call center and I was 64 when I started so it was a little hard for me comparied to the younger people  who grew up on all this stuff. After about a year they started making us do Authorzations and putting more and more on our plated. It got so stressful I think I went a little nuts. I asked so many times to be put in another bracket but my Supervisor said they couldn't do it she said if you are good at what you do then thay punish you by giving you more calls,she really said that. I would see some of her favorates not getting so many calls and they all just played around, laughing and having a good ole time while me and a few others worked our butts off !!!!!!! So let this be a warning!!!!!"
bad,"Thought this was a good place to work until supervisors fail to do their job by addressing anything wrong that you’re doing and write you up at the last minute. Some supervisors do their job and some just slack and when you move to a new team the new supervisor will write you up left and right. This place will offer high pay just to get people to work for them. They don’t care about their employees just about making money. You’re just a number and easy to be replaced. They ask for input and when you give input they find ways to fire you. "
bad,"I been an employee for 4 years and worked in both collections and customer service. There is a lot of favoritism throughout the company, especially in collections. Customer service no longer offers incentives, which caused moral to go down in the company. People no longer have a reason to work hard and longterm employees now make less money because there are no incentives. You do get a lot of pto but you usually have to schedule it well in advance if not it's hard to get a day off. I have had more managers than I can count and most were useless, did not know anything, or willing to help. I currently work in customer service and the job is now underpaid because there are no bonuses. In my opinion it's a lot of work for little pay. Back to back calls, stressful, not appreciated, have to meet goals, but no incentives. There is also a high turnover rate in all departments."
bad,"Anything alliance says is a lie. They tell you about all these great benefits but in reality it's all smoke and mirrors. They say they give you the tools to succeed but while you're distracted by their lax and friendly culture they're really tying one arm behind your back and then cracking the whip. The double standards, misdirection and miscommunication are all abundant. Don't fall for the tricks."
bad,"I started with alliance over 3 years ago. I loved their leadership, incentives, benefits, etc. over the past year I have seen several heartbreaking changes and non of them are for the good of the employees. This company has completely sold out and had found every way possible to “lessen their costs”. The have fired over 700 people in the past 6 months and will continue to do so as they send jobs overseas."
bad,"Alliance Data has laid off 1,100 people this year alone. They laid off 300 people on 10/23/2019. The approach was cold. They do not care about their people. This company is going down hill. You do not want to work there."
bad,"I was not with this company very long.  It was too long of a commute for me.  "
bad,"When I first started at Alliance Data Systems I loved it their! That was back in 2008. Management was completely different. Management actually cared for their associates and it showed! Around 2012-2013, almost all of management was either fired or relocated. That all happened around the time Alliance Data hit their billion dollar net worth. At that point, new management was hired and Alliance Data Systems became a horrible, miserable place to work. Money changed  the culture."
bad,I liked the staff at Alliance but the sales goals were unrealistic. Several people were let go for not hitting their sales goals. Two months of low sales was an automatic dismissal. Who wants to work under that pressure?
bad,Management takes forever to get anything done. Instead of hiring and promoting within company they'll hire new candidate's and fire the ones that have been there the longest just so they don't have to pay you more money. Company claims to be a good company when really they rip ppl off with late fees company is very sneaky and would never work for them again
bad,Alliance Data represents a corporate work culture in every negative way. Management is dismissive and apathetic about career development. Salaries are unfair and raises/bonuses hard to come by.
bad,"They kept changing everything they wanted after you are hired. You are hired for certain things and then they change it on you. They don't treat everyone fairly. There not the best place to work for that some people think that they are,"
bad,alliance data is a great part time job but not full time. the job is stressful with minimal activity. sitting down all day.It is a highly competitive environment but not very fair in promotions. its nice to work temporarily if there is no other job out there of if the economy is bad but nothing promising with this company
bad,This company has a trainer that will pick one girl from each class to sleep with. I brought this to the attention of management and nothing was done. The training at this company was a joke. It was two weeks of them telling you random stuff they did not really teaching you anything important. I also was fortunate enough to get a supervisor who didn't give a care about her employees. I got very little coaching. for the first two months I saw her like three times. This company does not care about you as an employee.
bad,"The job is okay, but the supervisors are terrible. All I have to say is don't be fooled at first since they are very nice and tell you all the good things the company does, yet once you are in it is totally different. They pressure you so much to donate money for charities and even bother you so much to take ten dollars off your paycheck every month for a year. Being charitable is great, but their is no need to have so many charities if the contributions come from the employees, who cannot donate for every single charity. Also never ask your supervisor for help because they probably don't know the answer and dislike being asked anyway. Very shady company."
bad,There is no work life balance at Alliance Data. If you have to call off and have a doctors excuse they dont care they still count that against you. Also they dont keep their employees updated with the changes that are going on with a lot of the clients that they have.
bad,"Requires you to take classes on their so-called ethics and zero tolerance policies,  but then continues to employ unethical, unprofessional supervisors and management.  Known drug users who create a hostile work environment and hire all their friends are never drug tested and never reprimanded, regardless of reports to the ethics hotline.  Their business is based on getting people into more credit card debt.  That's nothing to be proud of...."
bad,"This company has went downhill over the last three years. Fifty percent of the current managers/supervisors play favoritism and thrive off of micro managing. Some are very disrespectful and have no idea on how to lead.  The 300+ managers that were let go right before Thanksgiving were the ones who showed compassion and had the desire to lead their team to the top.  No one cares about the associates because it's now about the money and we're just considered the bottoms feeders. If you get a chance, walk around  the sites and look at the associates eyes and see how hurt and afraid they are. It's become a toxic environment and that's why I'm throwing the towel it. Even the investors refuse to do business with them. The pay is decent and the benefits are hmm ok  but nothing is worth my peace of mind. I refuse to be part of a fear based environment any longer. Goooood Bye!"
bad,Stressful and constantly worrying about job security. Some supervisors don't take time to help there team. Work life balance isn't there like it used to be
bad,"Very unstable.. 3 CEO's since June of 2019, Lay offs of over 460 good people recently. Jobs are going overseas. The culture and environment is no longer."
bad,"No advancement opportunities unless you're the manager's favorite.  People are bailing left and right getting out of the sinking ship.  Management is a joke.  No cost of living increases.  People are nice for the most part, but worked hard with no appreciation."
bad,No sick days unfairness no work life balance options. Any reason you miss a day unscheduled you accumulate points. Do not take Dr.'s notes a girls mother had a stroke and she had to leave got points
bad,They are very inconstant with there metrix.telling there family oriented but there really not.also tell you one thing and do another.brag about how much money they gave to chatity.but are not there for there enployees
bad,Worked for Alliance Data for 9 years. In my time there l had 7 supervisors. I understood my position and set monthly goals to be a K-performer each month to receive a incentive bonus. There were times l didn't meet my goal l worked hard to improve it. The last 4 years l worked from home. I enjoyed it at first until alliance decided to add w@h sup from different states than you live so communication is only by email or Skype. It feel like your sup really doesnt get to know you or care. I had a family emergency and was absent which instead of getting FMLA setup l received a call that l was fired. No sympathy for me or my family after my dedication all these years.
bad,"Its great for a temporary job if you can handle poor management, training that barely applies to your job, and being verbal harrased on a daily by customers. It can be very stressful over time and you take the hit as an employee for cannot reviews"
bad,"7 years of h*ll. Every boss I had was a loser. This place plays favorites big time. They treated us like children. ""power hour"" what a joke. Oh goody I get a balloon for salve labor."
bad,"Helping account holders on fraud claims, prevent criminals from accessing accounts, using multiple systems (Vcars, Falcon, Snap), multi-tasking busy phone lines, understanding wide variety of callers on phones, sticking to a strict schedule (can only use bathroom certain times), following complicated laws."
bad,Workplace does a great job of making you believe the things they say are true. When it comes to actions they are less than true to their words. This workplace is not about your abilities or about what you can do but about how well you can make the people that matter like you. People often get overlooked because they take the time to get to know employees not management. Management tends to believe they are the only ones that matter. There is no loyalty there.
bad,"I became ill while working there and the HR department refused to put me on the American Disability Act, to allow me to work while being disabled. The hours was long and pay was short. We kept having meetings basically on horrible we all was doing as collectors. Very stressfull, which led to my disability. There is no room whatsoever for advancement. You could be a supervisor for 10 years with no where else to go."
bad,"Management leads you to believe one thing, doesn't train you properly, and then you find out they lied to get you to work there. They have been laying off multiple people each quarter and are highly deceptive."
bad,"I worked long hours, 13 sometimes 16 hours a day and at times 7 days a week. Worked myself to the bone for 3 years then one day we attend a conference call telling us they are dismantling our department and outsourcing it to India. Others were contacted and told not to come in as their entire site is closed. No warning at all. Now they are in the midst of more massive lay offs. Unstable!"
bad,"they dont care about employees with all the firings and lay offs theyve done so far. And new employess drop like flies cause of the verbal of abuse from customers. Employees are just another number and easily replaceable to them, anything to get money to reach goal 2020"
bad,"Alliance Data is a great company to work for up until the time they have to make numbers on Wall Street.  Then, there is nothing more important, including their employees.  Staffing is the only area they seem to know how to cut costs and so every quarter in order to make numbers, there are layoffs.  "
bad,If your not kissing butt you won't move up. The  have these different types of incentives but there sneaky coaches or interns I should say always pick there friends. Unfair company made me so stressed I just quit after years. They make it seem like any business decisions is helping the employees and it only helps with management. We have to let customer disrespect us. The customers can use profanity we can't do nothing about it but deal with it. Favoritism company trust me don't waste your time they don't have your back or best interest!
bad,"Unfair, low pay, decreased moral, no benefits, management inconsistencies, stressful environment, competitive pay, employees are not cared for, and concerns never addressed."
bad,The collections department was plagued with cheaters making ranking difficult. Supervisors changed with the season. Company practiced moving representatives desk location every four months which made me feel temporary. Broad Street location literally and figuratively has two revolving doors.
bad,"ADS has extremely poor middle management and/or lack of management. Very unorganized! Calls are crossing over from Customer Service to New Accounts and Authorizations. No one knows what call to take - there is a lot of cold transfers. You are actually awarded for doing a bad job. If you are lazy, don't care and unmotivated - this the place for you. The workers who want to do a good job are penalized for finding solutions actually resolving the callers issues. "
bad,it sucked working there customers was always right and they did not try and help you out like other companies did for sure I wouldn't recommend this place to nobody
bad,"In my person on the beginning I had a bad supervisor she always was behind me, she stress me all the time, she was very rude I did not like her, I asked to change my schedule and my new supervisor was so polite he explained very well everything, how you get rate for the customers etc. "
bad,"Very good technical people. Management is very bad, who encourage harassment,  retaliation and discrimination. People that harass others are being promoted."
bad,"High Turn Over rate, Always changing Management is very clicky and will retaliate against you if you speak up about the way your treated at company, great benefits though"
bad,"Strange that when the company has had record high level performance they feel the need to give 10% of the work force no bonus or pay increase.  It's the hottest topic of employees, and it's killing morale."
bad,"House of cards could not be sustained- business narrative proved to be shadows of partial truth and blue sky snake oil, Independence of business lines ultimately obscured accountability."
bad,"Everything they tell you about how it's a "" family "" and how they are willing to work with you when things come up is a complete JOKE. Nothing you do will get you promoted or moved into a different position. Only way to move up is to know someone and kiss their hind end. So many "" supervisors"" that take favorites and literally LIE to your face on many and multiple different occasions. Half the staff are unhappy unless they know someone and got into the "" in "" crowd. Pay is good, benifits are expensive. 401k match is great. But the company as a whole is a joke. Look else where. They aren't even meeting their quarterly goals and sit there and talk about how "" great "" they are doing! HA"
bad,"When I first started at Alliance it was a great time. Competitive pay, good structure and support, and happy teammates all made me happy to go to work. Now with many organizational and leadership changes, and more pressure on us to to make and keep customers happy, I’ve dreaded coming into work for a while."
bad,"Some people feel so desperate to win and be so, "
bad,This place is a mess. Upper management are bailing. No respect. Lots of throwing each other under the bus. Very catty. Management is a joke. Overall poor culture and morale.
bad,"The company is taking calls for Commenity Bank which handles over 170 different clients (Brands). The way business is conducted to our customers is horrifying. I will never apply for a card if I know that Commentiy Bank is behind it.  They close customers accounts with no reasons. They lower the customers credit limit with no warning. Commenity bank refuses to give their customers their account number so they can create a Online account and/or make payments through the IVR. Since the customer does not have their account #. They are charged $9 to make a payment with us (live representative). They changed their attendance policy, so unless your time has been approved you earn a point. 6 points are you are fired.  So don't plan on being sick next week unless you can have it approved first. Doctors notices mean nothing here!"
bad,"Very stressful job, great for some people but not me.  customers calling you every name in the book, and yelling at you and you cannot hang up on them."
bad,alliance data would be a great job if the pay was fair and the hours were worked with they don't work with your hours and the pay is nt fair they want you to work but not fair with the pay . And reasons for firing you is not fair either
bad,"It is Cutthroat Island for sure! They have a K.E.Y System to rank in the department for bonuses and to see who gets fired if you can't get money out of clients that do not want to pay their bill. You leave hundreds of messages a day, but if no one calls you back, it counts against you. The system feeds calls to the ones that take the most payments in. So if you can't get clients to call you back, you're time if limited sadly! Some of the supervisors are very hurtful if you are unable to rank within the company. This is promoted by the higher ups in order to try to threaten you to perform. Be warned, if you cannot rank in the department you are in, you will not be able to transfer to a department that you might be more suited for..."
bad,"This place treats you like a child. They monitor you with everything you do. what your eating, what your doing on breaks. Cant use phone in bathroom. The minute you talk to a friend/co-worker they come and get you to go sit down, ..."
bad,"In customer service, we were required to sell intangible products of dubious value that the customer ""agreed"" to have paid by automatic deductions. This company was associated with a ""jewelry club"" which asked for debit card info to pay S&H, then proceeded to enroll customers in receiving automatic jewelry shipments without their knowledge/consent."
bad,"As a manager, I am forced to assign 10% of my staff to the bottom level where they are assigned no merit increases and no bonus, even when I feel that those employees are doing a good job. This has really hurt the culture of the company as employees have told me that they are less likely to be team-players, out of the goal of avoiding being ranked in the bottom. I have a lot of difficulty telling an employee that I have given positive feedback all year that they are now in the bottom 10%, because ""someone has to be""."
bad,"Worked at Alliance Data for 4 years. Was laid off this past October along with 300 others. Company is sending jobs to India, Jamaica and Mexico. At first the place comes across as a great place to work. Good benefits, pay is fair however, your just a number to them. They only care about their 2020 vision goal. They don’t care about you or your family. They’re constantly asking for donations in their name so they can a tax break."
bad,At first seemed amazing. Too giod to be true in fact. And it was. Youre no more important yo Alliance or Cimrnity Bank than a reem of paper. Arguably less. Saw so many great emplpyees and great people lose their jobs over the most parhetic of reasons. In some cases for unlawful reasons. Including firing the handicap instead of providing accomidations.
bad,I was written up for compliance issues and would ask for refresher training for new procedures and updates and would not receive the training.  Policies were constantly changing causing more write ups on employees.  Lack of support from upper management on what we had to deal with on a daily basis (irate customers for example).
bad,"Great people, horrible management. Micro-managing, no clear team direction, condescending, thow-you-under-the-bus. 80%+ turnover rate for one team? People taking pay cuts to leave? Yes, you’ll find that here."
bad,"Cannot trust management, layoffs and job insecurity. The company used to have a great culture but promotion of inexperienced leaders has caused this company to fail."
bad,"The job just isn't friendly to anyone who has kids, I had been working there for almost three years and I couldn't get my schedule changed to a day shift so I could put my son in daycare and they would never have any day shifts available for the bucket I was in"
bad,They need to work on getting supervisors trained in a department they are supervising because personally I had a supervisor that did not know the job at all and he couldn't help me when I was struggling with the job. That's what lead to me getting fired because I was not able to meet their standards for ranking due to collecting on higher accounts and my supervisor not being able to help me
bad,"Management and human resources is horrible, cost of living raises never, and their micromanagement is horrible sets you up to fail. Unhappy customers and employees."
bad,"A typical day at work is going to be clocking in and automatically taking inbound credit card call. Customers are usually upset most of the time because she forgot to make a payment or questions about why they are charged fees. Everything is ran on call chart which displays your call time, hold, voice tone, surveys and on time breaks. The workplace with your team is good. People there are laid back and friendly. I enjoyed going to lunch and clocking out. Hardest part is maintaining self control while being scolded by an angry customer. Also a customer can be upset and give you a bad survey. This will hurt your stats and that's the way it has to be because the customer is always right (which isn't true.)"
bad,Working was good while working in incoming collections then transferred to a different position as a lead intern and was shorted out of many opportunities that I was actually supposed to be gaining. I eventually transferred to outgoing collection and the training and the culture there was of absolute disgust. Associates were being trained to cheat and to be deceitful on the phones and were not being corrected about it when it was brought up but saying this is how they were trained to do so. When addressing the concern with the trainer they only validated that yes indeed they were trained this way and that they are aware that it was and is indeed shady.
bad,The only good things about this job were the pay and the fellow employees that weren't supervisors. Everything else was trash.
bad,"I thought AllianceData was different, better than other call centers, after all they refer to themselves as care centers. They care about the customer experience. I too care about the customer experience and provide the best customer service possible. The problem is that when you receive a bad survey it negatively affects your scores that you have to meet. All of my negative surveys were due to me not being able to waive a second late fee for the account holder. So, of course the account holder will send a negative review even if I have provided great customer service. We are told those surveys can be appealed and if we did provide great customer service and met all the call quality marks, the call could be appealed, but they always find a reason not to appeal the call... they will say you didn’t say this or that or you should have said it this way.  So, why even try if you are doomed due to surveys that are one-sided? Seems to me there are many other ways to measure an employees performance.  Not sure I want to dedicate anymore time to a company that doesn’t value my hard work."
bad,Nice culture but schedule options and micromanaging needed improvement. Lots of contests and competitive atmosphere.
bad,The job does not care if you had a major illness or not nor surgery it is about what you can collect it was very stressful.I would run as fast as you can it starts out sweet then you learn the tricky sneeky part about the company.
bad,Ok place to work. Trainers were great. Very supportive and easy to go to. Did not have a lot of support from supervisor or felt comfortable for going to her.
bad,Very stressful and they do not support the staff at all.. they fire very easy and if you dont fit their mold they will hunt for reasons to dismiss you... I was not happy here at all and would never recommend this place to work at
bad,Ive experienced way to many issues and problems while working for this company and ive only been there for 6 months. When i started working for this company my training had about 15 people in it and before making it to 6 months we were down to 4 people because of such a horrible experience we all went through
bad,"Calling delinquent customers, problem solving with negotiations for payment arrangements. The hardest part of the employment was you were competing with your peers."
bad,"Collecting on behind credit card payments for clothing stores believe it or not isnt peoples first priorities. Expect to get yelled at and cussed out 90% of the time. Management is very hard on you if you dont met quotas then your worthless to them. Oh yeah try convincing customers to pay over the phone with 15$ pay by phone fee. But if your good at your job they will let you advance no problem. Work hours are crazy, split shifts are mandatory."
bad,Absolutely terrible work environment. Management above everyone else and used underhanded tricks to fire or force people to quit. Those of us not targeted were compensated at the absolute bare minimum required by law.
bad,I opened new acct. for top stores such as The limited etc. Took in bound calls as well learned new systems. It was a very enjoyable place to work at.
bad,"On a normal day, I would sit down and log into my computer and phone. The automatic dialing system then starts sending me calls. I provide excellent customer service, while collecting a debt owed on a store brand credit card."
bad,"It’s about who you know and that’s how you advance  No job security They get rid of tenured associates"
bad,"Management is very poor.  There was a couple of occasions that employee's on the phone were under sever distress.  When brought to the managers attention the response was what do you want me to do.  I had to go into personal to complete their calls, causing me to fall out of adherence which effected me negatively.  When requesting something from supervisor, I had to follow up constantly, email, skype and directly.  So, the staff had to supervise the supervisor.  "
bad,I honestly don't want to discuss that information on here. I really have nothing bad to say. It was a job. Until I found a better one. So I just dealt.
bad,"Six to two job that requires little education, and mainly about sales. Hardest part of the job was to sell credit card protection to clients."
bad,"Terrible work life balance.  Managers only like people who are just like them.   Stressful all the time and job is always at risk.  Things that drive results don't matter, just do what someone else has done at an old job and keep doing it, even if it doesn't drive activity.   So stupid."
bad,"nice environment but management does little on the job site, "
bad,the hardest part of the job was getting screamed at and sitting in one spot for a long time i really like being productive and learning new stuff
bad,"Taking over 100 calls per day that would consist of assisting customer, talking and sitting for long periods of time."
bad,Just dont take the job... It isnt what it seems. The management is impossible to work with! They suck you in with noce but are anything but nice
bad,Call center for inbound and out bound calls for retailer credit card accounts
bad,"Recently there have been changes to the company that conflict to the values. Transparency and open communication was a key part of Alliance Data, but recent culture shifts have changed that. The systems used for associates everyday task are out dated and not up to par with other competitors. There is a high disconnect from upper management and the closer you get to the core floor."
bad,"Recently many changes have been made that are causing many very highly competent and valued employees leave the company.  Variety of management provide priorities and those do not always match thereby, causing confusion and the inability to focus on correct priority."
bad,This place used to be amazing. Many chances to grow within the company and benefits. Over the last 5 years it started to go down the drain. Now they are outsourcing a lot of the back end jobs and took away bonuses. They also decided to change medical insurance benefits and the company who works with the us now sucks! It costs more to just go for a normal primary check up then the darn co pay. This company has just decided to go the cheap way with everything. I would not suggest anyone else to this place after what they have started to do. It is only a matter of time before this place is just like all the other call centers and close their doors and send everyone overseas.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working there long term. It's very stressful. Between clients and the added stress to perform, I was ready to pull my hair out at my desk each day. I would constantly have panic attacks walking into work with the anxiety of working there."
bad,Alliance data is a trap. They change rules and regulations regularly. Bonuses are nice if you are a ranking collector. But if you are not schedule requirements make it nearly impossible to rank.
bad,The people there are not trustworthy at all.  I had a great supervisor. However i would not work for this company ever again. They say one thing and do another.
bad,"Never knew what to expect from one call to the next."
bad,It is a company growing but still acts as though its small.   Very political and no regard for employees.   Don't let them fool you.   I would not recommend.   They put a lot of pressure on their workers.
bad,"Job had high promises when I interviewed, when I started the training really had nothing to do with what the job entailed. Also the lack of manager support is really upsetting. Good place to work if you like to  be confined to a small desk all day with only an hours worth of a break all day."
bad,I've worked there for a year and a half I've had seven different supervisors the organization is based on getting more money from their customers Supervisors constantly push associates to collect more and threaten  employees with termination the company says it stands for opportunity and growth I have found that the organization  truly stands for age discrimination gender bias and nepotism not sure at this point how much  longer I can take the negative work environment getting yelled at by customers and pressured by leadership
bad,"Working here was different and educational. I would collect on past due accounts and deal with rude people. They were uneducated on what effects delinquent accounts have towards your life such as jobs, insurance, credit, buying a home or car, and we as account managers would have to teach them that and try to get them on the right track."
bad,"The metrics are simalar to any call center, handle time, sales, after call, adherence, call quality etc. The main difference is VOICE at Alliance Data. If a customer says the agent was great but is unhappy with the company or the companies policy the agent is still held accountable. That is unfair to the agent since they are required to follow company policy. "
bad,This company has a busy season and will offer as much O.T. as you can work.
bad,"The company has done a complete 180 and are not transparent with their employees. It’s one of those companies that says everything is okay one day and the following day the CEO has resigned and over 300 employees  are laid off. The only thing alliance has going for them, is the flexibility in their collections department."
bad,"I worked at ADS for 5.5 years, and I did like it at first; there were a few things that weren't told to me during the interview process, but otherwise it was great! My coworkers were awesome, the pay was decent, the PTO offered was more than normal and the benefits were spectacular! However, things started to go downhill. They took away our ability to easily leave early if we had an unavoidable appointment for ourselves or our children; the work-life balance was absolutely awful. I was told I would have the opportunity to change my one late-night a week that I had to work, but I was never allowed; every time I requested it, I was advised that due to business need I couldn't change my shift. The calls stopped coming in after 7:30-8:00 PM depending on the day, there was no need to keep us there. I had 7 different supervisors in the 5.5 years I worked there, and not all of them were good. We had to report an incident to HR not long before I quit, and it was almost like HR was trying to find a reason to not believe the incident actually occurred. The customers were allowed to spew any manner of abuse at us, and we had to take it; I was told several times by customers that they would find me and kill my family, and I wasn't allowed to hang up or transfer to a supervisor. On that note, after working there for 5 years, I knew a lot more than some supervisors did, but was not able to advance because of ""written warnings"" about my points or absences, which were all earned due to illnesses in either myself or my children. There are a lot of other instances that caused me to leave this"
bad,"It’s a great place to work if you don’t have kids at home, pets, or medical problems. Holidays are either catered or food is provided in the cafe and the dress code is pretty relaxed."
bad,"Employees on the floor are ok to talk with. Favoritism does play a role with alliance data which is denied at all and played as “fair and equal opportunity”. Management could use some classes on being able to deliver a message in a meeting. Site manager is ok likes to hear himself talk. Could upgrade dispute policy and conduct thorough investigations for a reps concerns instead of brushing it off and saying “just forget about it, let it go, and let’s focus on next months numbers”"
bad,"As mentioned schedules are not the best, they will start you to work mid or closing shifts. If you want a day shift they make you bid and put on a waiting list till a slot opens up. I waited over a year! Management will not have your side, no sick leave, attendance policy is ridiculous which means they do not understand that you have a life and kids."
bad,"this is a fairly low paying job for the area. The promises that where made in terms of unlimited over time and greast incnetive pays outs where all a show. I have been here 6 six montha nd OT has been canceled twice an unlimited Vol;unteer time has been offered. And, for the incentive pay after taxes isnt worth the frustration of limited superivors that have no reason to excel. Every supervisor claims to be great but fail at the simplest things."
bad,Management is terrible.  Very hard to advance and very high turn over rate.  Metrics are hard to meet for a call center and they keep raising the bar making it harder to meet.
bad,"The job is extremely stressful and the management is terrible, it is like high school at the company. there is favoritism and they don't really care about the floor associates."
bad,"Took business to business calls, problem solving. Also took regular calls from customers directly. Many were escalated due to issues with their bill, or there store experience. Problem solved. Exceeded all expectations on yearly review, with highest distinctions and awards given. "
bad,"Pros: "
bad,"very little training, yet expects you to know how to  bully account holders into paying. they  do not like ambush people. they want people who are content to  bully and not help the people in a real jam."
bad,Company is struggling and laying people off which is destroying the culture in their office.  Leadership as been flipped and the market is not reaching positive to the changes.
bad,"Management is out of touch.  Top performing associates are expected to pick up the slack for lesser performing associates with no offer for advancement.  Empty promises are made and complaints fall on deaf ears.  "
bad,"If you are a young and naïve person who likes command and control leaders who want you to fear them, then this is a great place to work.  Truly pays well, but not a very inclusive culture."
bad,"This place looks great at first but once you prove you can do the job well and make some serious money be prepared for management to start looking for a way to get rid of you. The turnover here is absurd, and don't expect to advance. Management is awful and preferential treatment abounds. If you like to brown nose, you'll do great. If you like to get by on your achievements, don't count on it. It's not what you know, it's who you know."
bad,"roughest place ever worked. People with 2+ yrs fired for slightest reasons; credit card lender does not offer automatic payments; exorbitant interest rates; no warnings about promotional loan plan expiration dates; ""Gottcha"" for consumers and employees. Impossibly restrictive call handling times and call scoring. One step above payday lenders. Ruthless; over-valued stock; charge card holders $9 service charge to make a payment with CSR even when payment websites and automated phone systems are not functioning."
bad,"The management was constantly changing, and a lot of them seemed like they didn't want to be in the position that they were in. The benefits were good, and they did give you PTO, but they didn't give you any sick days."
bad,"Did not enjoy doing collections"
bad,Did not pay their employees what they were worth and the environment sucked. When I was offered a position that tripled my salary I jumped ship. They would not respond to any HR requests
bad,This company use to be a great place to work unitill the end of last year when they made changes it use to be fun to be a part of this company now its all about being cut throat and fighting to stay a float and live in fear of loosing your job because you dont collect more than everyone else its not about your skill anymore its about luck if you are lucky enough to get a call in thats wants to pay big bucks then your job is safe for the day and dont get me started on some of the supervisors if you want to brown nose your way to the top this is the place to be if you want to be besties with them then you can assure yourself to never get in trouble for anything if this company was the same as it was last year i would of never left and the 6 years i had with this company would not of went to waist maybe i would of never took a 3.00 pay cut just to be stress free and happy
bad,"Although there are great benefits, I feel that the training you receive is not at all what they make the job out to be. You're put on the phones all day, and when you need to you use the bathroom or anything you're penalized. In addition, schedules are changed last minute with no notice whatsoever. Almost no help from your resolution team, and other departments that are supposed to be your support system while on the floor. Definitely not a very good experience, at least in my opinion."
bad,"Their expectations for their employees is too high. Not enough breaks, expectation to be in your seat is at 95% of an 8 hour day. If you take a break for too long than it eats at your goal percentages and you could loose your bonus even if you showed up to work. No fault policy: they don't care if someone dies or is sick they will just fire you."
bad,Answering outbound calls and inbound calls assist customer with web problems or inquire also provide resolutions with there financial inquire.
bad,We were promised advancement and it never occurred. It was hard work and long hours. The employees kept one another motivated without management help.
bad,"I would look forward to assisting our Saks Fifth Ave credit customers. I learned alot in credit approval, credit reserch,spoke with our wardrobe clients and signed up new film companies. Learned collections and dealing with the customers that owed. manager was efficient and trusted all aspects of workers to do their jobs. Co workers I only knew from lunch or break-too busy.Not being in the recognized group was hardest part of job. I enjoyed learning and helping credt customers"
bad,"I used to love this place, now, it completely lost what made it successful."
bad,The hardest part about alliance Data is that they a have a metric system that they score their employees on. I learned a lot at alliance Data. Awesome!
bad,"If you can handle being abused by rude, entitled people, you'll be fine. I struggled with this and because of it most managers and supervisors did not treat me very kindly. They expect a lot with what little resources you are provided. I had one outstanding supervisor in the nearly 4 years I worked there but she has left the company."
bad,Alliance wants to be a great company but falls short. Benefits are great but they do not make up for horrible management! My supervisor was verbally and emotionally abusive. Filed a complaint against him with HR. Had barely set back down at my desk before he called me into an office and for the next 45 minutes he threatened to harm himself and berated me for putting his job in jeopardy. He was never disciplined.
bad,"During interview process  ranking needs to stressed either you rank or you are fired. If, so less people would not accept the position. Its a high stress job."
bad,"Don't even bother, its a joke! No matter how long you work there they will not pay unemployment to anyone if you can't reach the unrealistic goals they have. You can work your butt off and not get paid commission because only a percentage of employees get paid out and you don't get your calls backs unless your at your desk when they call back. So many downfalls and not enough perks."
bad,"Working at Alliance data was okay if you were a certain type of person - e.g. wearing JCrew or the Limited, preppy, wanted to stay within a box. They have favorites and clearly, show who they are. If they want you out... you're out... it's just a matter of time."
bad,"Extremly stressful. Management is horrible. Ran more like a daycare then an actual job. Be ready to be micromamged. Told when you can go to the bathroom.  The most stressful job I've ever had. Supervisors are dictators and will throw you under the bus.  Do not recommend. Its just like working at dish network. Favoritism. Lots of supervisors are not honest. Don't let them lie to you, you will never advance or be promoted unless you are brown noses. They change their goals monthly so it's impossible to meet standards"
bad,"This company is a great opportunity if you work outside of customer care. Customer care is a different work environment where employees are required to meet a ridiculous amount of metrics, only a few of which pertain to the job description. You can't even use the restroom without being penalized for being off your phone for a few minutes. Everything seems to count against you and you often have to choose which metrics to meet each day and which ones not to meet in order to do what the company expects of you. It's like a double edged sword. If you can get a job in a different department other than customer care than it is a great place to work. As representatives on the phone in customer care, we are expected to go above and beyond for customers but are extremely limited on what we are actually allowed to do to meet that demand. We do do not received the same courtesy from upper management that we are expected to give on the phone. Horrible department to work for."
bad,Pay is great but due to the fact someone has to be a bottom 10% everyone is out to get ahead and will take you out to get there.  HR always sides with the Manager even if they are wrong.  Fires an employee by putting them on a PIP.  Eventually the manager will be let go too.
bad,answered phone assisted customers with credit card accounts maintaining cal flow and adherence I learned how to hone perfect phone etiquette and remain professional and calm with irate customers on phone. at the end of the day i achieved  helping for clients and felt better about my work status
bad,"At first I loved my job with this company. Great pay and opportunity to get off early if it was dead. But the hardest part of job became trying to make the customer happy while following the proper procedure. Procedures seem to change every few months, sometimes without you even being told about the new ones till you do something wrong and get a low score on a call from the quality team. My manager changed out of no where a year and a half after starting and we were told it was what the employees wanted. There was a revolving door of new employees starting and old ones getting fired or leaving. I was employed 2 years and only got coached maybe 4 times by my first manager. There was most definitely favoritism happening in the company and it was easy to know where you stood. You could be great at your job but it didn't mean you were gonna move up . Kiss up and maybe then you'll move up. Sucks to  put it that way but its very true."
bad,"The time that I have been with the company I have seen a full team leave. Management cares more about the goal than leveraging both goal and employee fairness. The hours are disturbingly long and the negative employee's morale is contagious. "
bad,"As soon as my numbers went down, my supervisor wanted nothing to do with me and let me go for attendance. I tried to show her that my attendance was fine but she refused to listen."
bad,A typical work day consisted of back to back calls from the time you clock in. The management and culture were based on numbers and not overall agent success or promotion. the hardest part of the job was the requirement to up-sell a product to customers that could not afford to pay their regular bill.
bad,"Alliance Data has changed for the worst.  Hyper growth means more work in the same hours with technology that is unstable at times.  Multiple re-orgs since I joined.  Lack of context around written communications received.  Lack of any feedback on performance.  Doesn't want to change.  New hires are made to comply.  Culture is odd.  Favoritism is around.  Benefits are typical, nothing unique."
bad,"I worked for a smaller agency that was bought by Alliance Data. The once-friendly, supportive company became very structured and unfriendly. Company made little attempt to keep talented people from the agency as time went on. In fact most have been forced out, or left because culture completely changed."
bad,Attendance rules are ridiculous. Getting sick is impossible. Your kids getting sick forget about it. Its unrealistic for someome who has a demanding home life. You can be phenomenal at your job and get sick one time and they dont care.
bad,Terrible choices in management some of call center was closed 11am -3pm during the week and they require saterdays witch is hard to get your 8hours in one day with out working mornings and nights
bad,The job is very stressful and management makes it even worse. They say they are family friendly but that is not the case. Collections is not a fun job and its even worse when you are in constant competition with everyone around you.
bad,Alliance Data at one time was a great place to work. After becoming a Fortune 500 company there were a lot of changes that stripped away what was the good of being employed there. Management is not transparent. Advancement is based on who you know rather that your contributions. The goals put forth by the company are unrealistic leading to the loss of incentives which causes low morale
bad,Dealing with customers personal information and credit cards can be really hard. Although you are there to help them customers can get really nasty with you and supervisors/ company expect you to sit back and take the verbal abuse. Worst place to work but great company as far as benefits go
bad,"Depending on the day, various functions may apply.The associates are alert and engaging. The leadership tries to find new ways to help spread the brand while retaining productive team members."
bad,I  worked at Alliance for many years and it is a great company but your work life balance is not always an option and its very intense work environment that is not always enjoyable I did however gain massive knowledge for working for this company  they are top of line.
bad,"After working for this company for almost a year it drained all the enthusiasm i had for the business, I tried multiple times to advance in the company and they made it extremely hard explaining that they were looking for people who had been in certain ""committies"" for positions instead of basing their decisions based on an individuals intellect and enthusiasm it was moreso about who you knew and who liked you. also the way that they let people go would throw anyone in a tizzy, they approach your desk with a cardboard box, take you to go get fired and unpack your items for you (i guess for the security of information) its scary and does not give you a great sense of job security especially if you see 10 people go in one week."
bad,"Company as a whole has a good plan, but the people who are implementing it have ulterior motives, mainly greed, and a me and my close buddies first! Do better"
bad,"A typical work day at Alliance Data was motivation for the department team members, meetings, and making sure reports were sent out. I learned a lot with excel and different ways to keep a team motivated. Alliance Data was very diverse. The hardest part of of the job was making sure the department hit their goals and reports were sent out by the due date. The most enjoyable part of working at Alliance Data was the peers and all the fun activities we would do for the department."
bad,The workplace culture on the outside would appear positive and encouraging. The truth is somewhat darker and more sinister. You are only as good as your last months stats. You aren’t valued beyond an attrition rate .. reporting is arbitrarily rated and not fair.
bad,"phone calls were all over the place, there was very little help from managment as far as advancing, all that seemed to matter was that we met the metrics set by the company."
bad,"5 reorganizations within last 2 years.  Company HR and higher level management team did not handle events well."
bad,120-150 a day call volume during Holiday Season. 12:30-9pm shift the absolute worst... and that's the mandatory shift for the first 6 months.
bad,"For a collections associate, Alliance is a solid way to make money and have a flexible schedule. For leadership - its never about what you've done right. Current budget situations is causing jobs to be offshored and roles to be laid off. Culture has some perks to it but, in collections, it can be extremely cut throat with everyone assuming you're cheating if you're doing well. Considering status of budget, not real room for advancement at the current moment. Job was too far from me to be a ""flexible"" schedule however, collections associates can set their own hours so that can be a perk for associates. Leadership are required to work weekend and late nights on a rotating basis and are often there closer to 46-50hrs a week."
bad,"It is easy to overwork yourself here. Just ensure you are efficient and organized. Also, there have been layoffs this year. Please ensure you have a back up plan, if this doesn’t work out for you."
bad,"Alliance data offers great benefits but you're over worked and under paid for the requirements. They took away bonuses and No work/life balance. Work one late shift per week, every other Saturday, and one Sunday a month."
bad,"Job is ok, worked here for almost ten years switched departments where my experience became terrible. The supervisor (security) is not looking to promote but to showcase his superiority as a supervisor he belittles his staff and makes constant threats. The employees brown nose their way to the top and advancement goes to those who are most popular"
bad,"Initially I enjoyed working there; had two of the best managers of my career, enjoyed coming to work, felt supported and inspired to deliver excellent customer service. There was then a change in leadership and the new leadership and resulting changes in the organization affected the culture negatively."
bad,Alliance is amazing they have difference centers ech center is different because people are different . You have to be patient and work as hard as possible for success
bad,"Conducts patient education sessions including contraception, STIs, safer sex and other reproductive health services."
bad,"Basic call center customer service representative for a credit card company that managed various clients, responsibilities included managing customer accounts, data entry, payment processing, and answering all customer questions."
bad,Servicing and customer service for B grade private credit card labels with most accounts calling for charges to be waived.  Company standards prevented certain number of times charge could be waived creating a customer vs representative conflict on many of the calls
bad,"The hardest part of the job is acutally having to sit in a chair for 8 hours and try to help people who don't want to hear anything other than what they want to hear. No one wants to hear why their account got a late fee, they want to hear that it's waived off the account. It's an extremely thankless job and is not for someone who wears their feelings on their sleeves. The best part of the job is co workers, they make it bearable to be there."
bad,"I had relocated to Ohio specifically to work for this company."
bad,"The company is excellent, but the Account Protection department is completely disorganized. There is no work life balance. The benefits are good, the pay is good. Most people work every single weekend, and never have 2 consecutive days off."
bad,Alliance Data was an outcsource company that handled electric accounts for the TX market. I made a lot of friends there. They paid well and benefits were decent.
bad,"decent place to work but the job will burn you out, not much work life balance.  In school and working will have a difficult time here, they don't allow much flexibility"
bad,"I’ve been here for going on three years and I’m still in the same position. It isn’t for lack of trying it’s just next to impossible to grow with this company. When I first started at alliance the culture was totally different but now that we have a complete different set of sups and directors than before which has played a major factor into the change. Almost everyone is on leave because how extremely stressful that the job is. You can barely go to rest room without someone jumping down your throat. There is a sale,fundraiser, donation campaign and giving event every five seconds where they try to guilt you to give money that you are there to earn. I don’t have it to give bruh. If I didn’t I would be in this building. Stress"
bad,"Wanted work done too fast which meant poor customer service, there was a time limit on the phone which sometimes could not be helped and would interfere with break and lunch times which ended up getting points against you did not seem fair."
bad,"Best part of working for Alliance Data was the pto. If you told the truth to customers it would be held against you. Watch out for your voice surveys as well, if you upset someone then you will be walked out the door."
bad,"The associates are not bad most not educated. The procedures that they make you follow to get a minimal monthly bonus is counter productive to what they teach you or want you to do for a great ""customer experience"". They make you take training on things you cant actually do for instance they say critical and flexible time off is something we offer here and here is how you use it. Then when you get on the floor or out of nesting they let you know its no longer available and you can not use it."
bad,Great place to work but the team leaders and management definitely have favorites. I was working from home and when trying to get help on a question no one at the monitor station would respond even though they say they will be there for you when needed.
bad,You'll meet great peers with in the company however the management is awful. There is Major favoritism from department management and little room to grown with in the company unless you are the one who is favored. There is also very little communication between leaders and half the time they don't know what they're doing. I lasted a year before I had enough. They're collections department has great bonuses but if you don't collect enough money for 3 months you're fired. It's a very stressful work place.
bad,hectic and unorganized. It was very stressful. Lost a lot of channels which meant angry customers and tv equipment always had issues
bad,"Answer phones anywhere between 30 - 100 calls a day assisting customers with credit card accts. Supervisor's are hands on, but upper management doesn't hep or take suggestions. Company claims to be employee focused, but as of late has shifted toward maximizing growth over anything else."
bad,If a Stressful Day of Calls & a Couple hundred transfers is for you this is your place .. Management doesn't like when you go over there head when issues are not being address .. They wait until your on your last limb too notify you! Just too get you out the door ..
bad,Since this was my first experience in a call center I learned that it is   busy.  The co-workers were friendly and helpful to one another.
bad,"Very flexible far as work schedule... management can be biased, only focused on top collectors. Hardest part of the job was dealing w/ management, if you were outspoken or truthful you were considered a problem. Co workers were like family. Your average work day consistent of making calls, & educating customer/debtor on benefits of bringing account current. Most enjoyable part of the work day was meeting or exceeding your goals, on your own, no co-worker, or managers assistance. From my experience in ANY type of collections... You can't put a lot of trust in anyone! Its a competitive job, everyone is gunning to be the best."
bad,"I work at a Call Center dealing with inbound calls for a private label credit card company. A typical day at work consists of taking 80-100 calls per day answering billing questions, processing payments and providing stellar customer service. I learned how to approach escalated situation in a nice calm way. My co-workers are amazing and help whenever I may need something and we always have fun while doing our jobs. The hardest part of my job is sometimes dealing with those escalated situation and a customer is trying to bully me by screaming in my ear calling me names and go off the wall on the call and the customers are not listening or anything. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be the people I work with and most of the times when my calls are amazing and the customers treat me with complete respect these calls make me appreciate my job a lot more."
bad,In this position i was a skip find specialist.  i did collections for people who ran out on their credit card bill. for dept stores. when i did locate them i was supposed to be assertive to try to get the money from them. I was unable to do this. i do not have that type of personality. i am customer service. i am nice. and i was uncomfortable talking to people with a stern voice. as i was told to have. not me.  My supervisor tried to help me out she really did. but in the end i quit. i couldn't do this job and i was uncomfortable.
bad,"It was a wonderful place to work. The people were extremely friendly and very upbeat. Everyone was always smiling and always greeted you. I enjoyed the one-on-one trainings, coaching, and grow and develop, as well as Volunteer Time Off (VTO). They really want to see you excel and do better, they offered lots of encouragement, support, and care. I loved the PTO; the only downside was having to wait until it's your turn to bid to request days off. So, if you have certain days you want off and when it's your turn to bid - hope and pray that those days are not taken - if so, good luck. That's a major upset too."
good,"Very good work enviorment however poor management. I enjoyed the job as well as my co-workers however the management team all had different answers for the same question, which left the employees all following a different protocol."
good,"While the pay was decent, the amount of work they wanted you to produce was very high and extremely stressful. At first it was fun (while you were in training), but once you were on the floor the term: ""throwing you to the wolves"" becomes your everyday life. They say that help is always there, but it's not. Management does very little, and while working here I personally saw 3 people get demoted simply because they needed more people on the phones -- unfair."
good,"I've learned how to help clients get out of debt. Also to find different solution, depending on the clients situation. Management, I didn't find, was good at all. A lot of favoritism. "
good,"This company expects perfection from their employees. I don't believe that is possible on a daily basis, I very uncomfortable being made to review my former employers."
good,"With rapid growth comes challenges for leadership to maintain a productive, efficient culture."
good,They push that they've got a great culture but the staff are miserable and if supervisors are supportive of non pet employees management is vindictive.
good,"Assist customers  with inbound and outbound  calls to make payments and verify account information to the customers "
good,"Unless you're a favored employee do not expect company to back you. Food is overpriced and terrible. People are great but calls are hellish. Expect, if you do bonus (especially often) to have to watch your back. They will fire you the first chance they get. Same goes for raises."
good,pay does not equal the work. management is lacking leadership qualities.
good,"No chance of advancement. Their business follows their stock value. Ever since the new Director took over, things have been going downhill. Morale is low, Bonus is non existent, and before where they prided themselves on being transparent, they are exactly the opposite now."
good,"When I started with Alliance Data 2 years ago the call center was full, overflowing in fact. After only 6 months we lost 1/4th of the employees and by the end of 2 years the call center is only about 1/4th full now. When i started there were annual bonuses and my first was 550. The second was dropped to 250. Monthly bonuses were cut out. The stock prices have dropped from 247 to 174 in a matter of months. The money received from the government to be an incentive to give back to the employees was used to boost stock prices temporarily and it didn't work.   Several major clients have dropped alliance data and Victoria secret is one on the verge of dropping them as well. In a word this business was a fruitful one but due to poor management practices and those practices border on illegal. Imposing heavy late fees on people despite the reasons being valid or not. Not giving the agents the ability to genuinely assisting the customer but talk them into paying the bill and stalling them to make more late fees be assessed thereby causing the cust to be indebted for life. This is a sinking ship if you are looking for a short term job go for it, otherwise avoid them like the plague."
good,My working environment was very competitive. I was often concerned about my job status. Overall I would still be working there if possible. I would have changed my position.
good,called people took their money called more people sometimes took their money blah blah blah i dont care this is stupid that you are making me fill this section out
good,Dont expect movement within this department.  Nearly Impossible to do!! Management is imbedded with large salaries and they will not back you for anything.
good,they care more about the customers than the employees. they allow the customers to speak any kind of way to the employees and there is nothing we can do but take it
good,"Current employee but looking for another job. I understand a company is about making money but, management is not on the same page. One supervisor will tell you to do it one way and another will say NO you do it this way. Company opening 4 off shore calling centers which will mean more job loss. Major layoff around Thanksgiving and another layoff after the 1st of the yr."
good,Board-led organization with little care for the value of its associates. Company culture has diminished over the past 6 months with little effort to reinforce positivity amongst associates.
good,"When I first started working here, it was AMAZING. There is a lot of customer abuse that's allowed( Ill get to that), but it didn't matter because they metrics wasn't so strict and we rcvd performance bonuses ever month. We used to be able to actually have fun at work and laugh and enjoy each other. We knew that customer service was hard, but you could always count no having a good time with your manager and coworkers."
good,"A typical work day includes assisting customers with general customer service like lottery, check cashing, coupons, returns, refunds, faxing, dry cleaning and wic.  I learned various skills like trainee, communication, ordering, money management, preparing deposits and much much more.  It is very hard to advance in the company."
good,I liked working at Alliance Data as there were fun and casual atmosphere. It didn't hurt to get discounts from many of the retailers that were our main customers.
good,It was a call center environment.   The hardest thing about this job was being attached to the phone.  I like to be on the phone but also have the ability to change projects.  My co-workers were one of the best part of the job.  I learned how to collect on soft-line goods.  Typical day was to come in log onto the phone and start working in ques then also be on the dialer system when I was suppose to be.
good,"I hated the call center environment. I would be cursed out daily and would not be able to do any thing about it. I also had several men call in wanting to know what color of undergarments I was wearing, and I was not allowed to even sound like I was offered but the question with out being put on a written warning."
good,"The company used to place the employees above all and with the stock taking a hit in the last few years, they have started placing the business needs above everyone else. They will tell you that overtime is voluntary and then pressure you to work it even if you cannot as an example."
good,I. Think think it’s a great company the employees too they hve great benefits great employee programs and some management it wonderful how ever I was  wrongfully let go
good,It takes a certain kind of person to do this job and do it well. You must be assertive and be ok with asking the most uncomfortable questions about an account holders life situation and then create a way for them to pay their account off.
good,"I used to love working at Alliance but in the last year or so the company has gone downhill. They've promoted apathetic people who don't care about their employees and are only concerned with not getting fired. If you need a job and can handle long hours and stress, it's great. Flexible hours, good benefits, pay should be higher. I wouldn't not recommend it but I'd say be careful."
good,"Growing Company can be a good thing unless they start to leave the tenured behind.  I loved my job and my associates (had the highest Associate Survey Scores every year).  But did not like feeling pushed out, back against the wall, and no job security."
good,"at the time i worked there, there was a lot of pressure on being the best company, it was a culture where there was no balance work life and mangement were not interested in there employees"
good,Micromanager Travel Manager. Somethings apply to some; some to others. HR is worthless. Admins and travelers are great. Unfortunately I can not say the same about the person that oversees travel.
good,"I really like ADS when I started but it has declined in the last 1.5 years. So far I have had 6 different supervisors in 3 years and they all do things differently.  No communication, confusion, chaos and cutthroat.  Management is aware that people are cheating to bonus and they do  not seem to care.  The money and benefits are great."
good,"Micromagement is the name of their game. You will be faulted for customer opinions on policies, and automated system. Have not had ""Growth and development"" for the past 3 months. The promises they promote will never happen."
good,The company does offer a variety of benefits to their employees and to the community that are very positive. There does seem to be a high rate of turnover in both management and entry level employees. The training up front is basic and just enough to get you on to their floor but ongoing training is virtually non-existent even when it is requested. Job performance is very statistically driven without much in the way of support if you need help in achieving benchmark goals. Definitely need to be able to adapt to constant change in both what statistical benchmarks should be met and which teams and managers you'll be working with as there is constant flux.
good,"Moral is down."
good,"Too many recent changes going on. They claim that their employees are the most important thing, but, that simply is not true anymore. It has drastically changed since the new CEO came aboard. People getting laid off, bonuses being taken away. Not a healthy place to work anymore."
good,"Compensation is nice but, stress is very high. Must be able to handle it bad days and good days.  Like any collections job its cut throat competition is high"
good,Alliance Data was great with their flexible work while completing my education.  I was able to obtain my Masters degree while working at Alliance Data - however no opportunity to use my degree.
good,"Alliance was a pretty good job aside from the unprofessional management, I was fired a year to the day of my anniversary for reason related to a medical condition. My benifits were terminated at midnight that night and they denied my unemployment. I appealed and won because the hearing officer determined my termination was unjust."
good,"Back to back calls, there are no room for advancements, and hardly any time to use pto. But its a good company. I feel like overnight shift should have alternate on weekends"
good,It is a call center so you are sitting at your desk and on the phone for your shift. The department that does scheduling does so without regard for how close your breaks and lunch are. Associates can be penalized for a negative review if customers are not happy with a policy that cannot be changed for their credit card. During onboarding you are given a certain perception about the culture that is not accurate as to how it really is. With a company that has displayed exponential growth and and ever expanding portfolio the annual bonus has decreased and doesn't reflect the hard work of the associates.
good,"The company did good work, however, some departments were very cliquish and unwelcoming of newcomers. The environment setup was not very welcoming and was competitive in ways that worked against most mid-level management personnel."
good,Responsible for transforming a tactical buying group into category managers charged with the development and implementation of category strategies for the Enterprise.
good,Training was thorough although humans are unpredictable they teach you to adapt to every call situation. Updates were every week and so were group meetings. As a debt collector most customers negatively respond to the calls and can often have very harsh words. The day goes by quickly.
good,Management was not good. No communication among supervisors to employees and when there would be mandatory meetings they would inform us about things that never happened.
good,"poor management, poor communication. the regular workers were wonderful. when a company says its about the people but its really about numbers,very  sad"
good,"A typical day at work is making calls to collect data and recover past due accounts for Comenity Bank which is owned by Alliance Data. "
good,"a typical day at work is 98-96% on the phone.  You can take anywhere from 80-100 calls daily.  Stats are everything to this company.  For the most part you are a number unless you have a really good supervisor that has been on the phones before and understands how stressful back to back calls, day in and day out can be.  If your supervisor has never been on the phones then forget about it.  I now understand the ends and outs of credit cards, for the most part the coworkers are friendly.  The hardest part about this company is that mid-management are not supportive of their staff and push you because if you bonus they bonus bigger.  The most enjoyable part of this job is VTO option when it is available as well as when overtime is available, easy to sign up for both."
good,"During my time at alliance data both me and my employer benefited from the work I completed on a daily basis, the culture was not sufficient for growth or advancement"
good,"Ive worked for Alliance Data for over 10 years and Ive been through the good, the bad and the ugly, now its time to grow! Its a very faced paced environment and if you have children with a strong support system this is an excellent Job for you!"
good,"I absolutely love this job!   Between the coworkers and management, there is a teamwork environment.  All the goals of the company are clearly express with meetings and team development times off the phone.  The work place is like a family environment. You will definitely make some friends.  The hardest part of the job is keeping the bank compliance and the call quality up to par.  They instituted a voice score that you must meet or beat 87% or face getting the white box of freedom. You get eight calls per month that you are judged on so you must really focus on every call being like your last or it will potentially be your last. The most enjoyable times are the slow times of the month that are not billing days where calls are not back to back."
good,"typical answering inbound calls,create new account and work with existing account and provide and over all customer satisfaction. i learned mutaplie programs like VCARS,NAGUI,IEXMicrosoft Excel and Word Document. Supervisors are friendly and knowlagable, co-workes show the willingness to assist others. The hardest part of the job is not being able to make all customers happy. what i love is being able to help those i can."
good,This is a great company to work for however due to the fact that work is based on clients needs work weeks can be between 20hrs a week to 48 hrs per week; this can make it hard to plan family activities.
good,Ok company I was just burnt out on phones  after working collections for seven years at discover card.  People are nice but not a lot of help in fraud protection.  I was wondering if anyone knows if you get paid out for your vacation after quitting?
good,"Assisted Direct Energy customers with their accounts, new service, payments, problems.  Mentored new employees.  Assisted Help Desk employees and worked on Online Support team. Received more than 20 customer commendations during my employment but was never promoted despite being advised several times that I would be."
good,It's bittersweet. It has it's up & down days as do most jobs. The quality assurance department was a nightmare & there were moments that there's a lot of drama. No job security. Owned by a parent company & I really didn't appreciate the 2 year raise freeze.
good,"they are moving forward with work life balance, ,but backwards in benefits. there is no job security at the moment and leadership is not transparent about the future of the company."
good,I have been working hard and diligently at ADS for 3 years. Working toward advancement.  Performing at to top of my department. I was not expecting alliance to come though in the middle of my shift and fire without warning many of my colleagues.  I'm really sad about that.
good,"On the phone 95% of the day making calls and leaving messages. I enjoy working from the comforts of my own home and being able to set my own schedule. Collecting from customers during hard times is  the hardest part of my job. The best part of my job is being able to help customers. I Have learned that collections is not easy and it is not for everyone, however some people really enjoy it."
good,"I went into the position with high expectations only to find that they want you to lie to customers to get good surveys. It doesn't matter if you perform your duties, if a customer does not like the response you have to give them (due to protocol) and you get a bad survey, you are penalized."
good,"Great place to work, but a lot of folks in management or control freaks, and you only get respect as a supervisor if you are anything else you are a slave/flunky"
good,"Lack of real leadership. Need to be more pro active."
good,"Leadership was sub-par. Some of them barely knew the employees on their immediate teams, because they never even spoke to them, or tried to help them understand what their job duties and roles as employees were. Drama ensued almost always. The rumor mill was insane. Benefits were great unless you needed something medically, and then they wouldn't accommodate you at all. They were constantly changing things in people's credit card terms without notifying them. They told us not to tell customers we were a bank, but if a customer asked, we confirmed, that we were indeed a bank. The company  just feeds lies to the employees and the customers. No two supervisors ever gave the same story when asked a question."
good,Very busy call center. I learned a lot about credit. The hardest part of the job was not being able to do more for the costumers. Most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.
good,Greedy company but treats employees willing to conform very well. Seems great at the beginning but it's only slightly better than other call centers..
good,"Typical workplace at Alliance Data consisted of taking high volume inbound calls back to back more often. dealing with customer complaints and late fees. I learned how to communicate with customers, co-workers and management. Management was not horrible but was far from great. I dealt with a lot of communication issues regarding my job and my schedule. The culture was decent and nothing was difficult. The enjoyable part of my job was the co-workers"
good,"No work/life balance"
good,"I felt Alliance Data was very prejudiced against some persons. I worked hard and tried to follow all the rules, however, there were those who did not and were not reprimanded.  Noise in the office was unbearable. I managed to attain home work status.  The job was not too difficult, but management was never happy with anyone's performance.  We were under a microscope all the time and a lot of pressure."
good,I wouldn't recommend to anyone who wants a life outside of work. I liked the pay and benefits but they have a set structure if you want to move up in the company.
good,"Co-workers are amazing but most of the people here can not stand their job. There is a lot of favoritism that happens within management and it is not possible to move up if you are not someones ""pet"". Most supervisors are very helpful and nice. Would not recommend this job as anything other than a last resort."
good,I like this company because they were very attentive in making sure that all employees were comfortable with handling machinery on our own before leaving us with no assistance.
good,"Alliance Data does give you plenty of benefits because it is not an easy job. It is a nice environment to be apart of, however being in  a call center is never easy. You get called names, you get cussed out. Even when you are doing the most you can to satisfy a customer. Your ""performance"" is based off of customer surveys even if they are not speaking about you."
good,"The typical work day starts with an inbound call and ends with an inbound call with anywhere from 59 to 79 calls in between. Management adds on more work, incorporates it into the score card and at that point the agent can't fight it. Co-workers are a sight for sore eyes, because you know they they are going through the same as you."
good,"Loved the job itself, and co-workers, Just need to touch up on their mgmt team. The job was made out to be more than it was, I have owned my own business for over 10 yr's also worked for many call- centers and unfortunately this wasn't for me."
good,This job was very strict and was very time based. I didn't agree with a lot of the credit card policy's that weren't very understanding to the elderly.
good,"Good company overall."
good,Working with customers and clients throughout each day can often lead to surprises such as angry customers or those who are entirely confused about the products and services you are representing.
good,"Customer service calls, collections calls, all the calls"
good,It was a place to work that paid the bills.
good,"Typical 8-5 job, no flexibility with schedule and difficult to stay talking and typing no matter what."
good,"Typical day at work is I sit in a cubicle on the phone making outward calls to collect on past due accounts. Answer incoming calls when they come in. Problems solving skills are a must in this type of a job. Must display empathy and solutions, with confidence."
good,Innovation in the credit card industry Inn much of brick and mortar retail services. Expansion is vast however better infrastructure should be produced.
good,Company has grown a lot recently. Encountered many lay off's recently. Pay is okay compared to other companies. Should be a better place in the future.
good,"I’ve worked for the company for many years, the company is currently in trouble.stick prices are falling and hiring has stopped for the first time ever."
good,The company continues to send positions offshore creating concerns of job security.  Due to the offshore staffing direction there is also a lack of advancement opportunities.
good,"No opportunity for advancement. Not really a zero tolerance policy, no sick time, lying managers, and point system is ridiculous when things beyond the employees control happens even when that employee has great numbers consistently, acceptions can be made for favorites but only favorites so it's total bs and I will never work there again"
good,"The pay was good, can’t say much else was."
good,"They pick who they like. Promotions are based on who you know sadly. You can work hard to show yourself approved but if there is anything, another coworker ect, that someone may have personal relationships with you will NEVER move forward. I loved working here but there were quite a bit of people who had terrible attitudes and we're unprofessional even while on the clock."
good,"A decent place to work at, I love the fact that they offer work at home positions. Career advancement within the company is not that easy, it more of a favoritism type of deal."
good,"There are constant changes literally every month or two changing your job but not how you are ranked, consistently when. Your rank is being taken from you and you prove it, you are pushed aside. And told to work harder."
good,"You can earn a lot of money but one mess up and they take it."
good,You have to be willing to take customer abuse about policies without getting upset.   You are rated on customer satisfaction survey about things that are not in your control but relate to either company policies or services.
good,Decent opportunities for upward mobility. In need of culture shift to be more collaborative and consistent between teams with similar roles. Good work life balance
good,Great job wouldn't allow me to get paternal time off when my daughter was born last year. Incentive was great. the bad work life balance isn't what I needed a the time that my daughter was born
good,"Answered the phones, handled inbound customer account issues, updated info via data entry. Management wasn't around enough for feedback, co-worker were very nice, but non-productive. Hardest part was, not receiving good or bad feedback from chain of command."
good,I come in and put my headset on. I start collection attempts/ making phone calls at 8am until quitting time. Its the same duties day in and day out. No variety. My section is micromanaged. I stay to myself. The hardest part of the job is trying to figure out what customers are lying to you when they are asking for your help and which ones aren't. Helping people is the best part of the job.
good,It is a small workplace setting that places emphasis on culture. Often promoting from within whether people have the skills to do their job or not. A lot of promotions are based on politics.
good,I work for the company for 5 years. Made friends over the time i have been there. Management is okay. Come in do your good and then you are off. I like talking to people on the phone and helping them out
good,The work at home program provides equipment and pays Internet it qualifies.  You only have to pay for basic phone service. You do not need to pay for international calling.
good,"Over the company was amazing! Great benefits, flexible schedule, played fun games to get the collections team to collect. Only issues was poor management, seems like they were more money driven, instead of helping the employee find a resolution for the customer. The customer is in a hardship for a reason, it’s better to get some money in than to get no money at all."
good,Not a lot to add.  They are a very corporate company. There isn't much room for feedback and change.  They like how they do things and want to continue as is.
good,"It was a strong place to work. and fast pace, Alliance Data has a close work family atmosphere, which made it a easy fun place to work. the people made me feel welcome and a part of a good team."
good,Management keeps you very busy with a healthy workload.  At times it can feel a bit overwhelming.   My immediate team members are very helpful and are willing to take the time to show you how everything works in this fast paced environment.
good,"I took 80-100 phone calls per day, it was exhausting! Was rated on each phone call. You interact with all types of customers. Management was chaining all the time. Had 3 supervisors in less than a 2 year period."
good,Sales and Service - you must sell or offer different promotional products.  Your spill had to be by verbatim or it would count against you.  All calls are recorded.
good,I am currently still employed with the Alliance data company. I collect on credit cards that have been closed and charged off. I am responsible to collect the balance.
good,"Managed a department of sales agents, which I trained and was hired in for my sales experience.   Held meetings with agents to advance in higher level positions and career.  Monitored compliance to ensure that company stayed out of regulatory issues.  Conducted meetings to review performance and created action plans to help achieve performance goals.  Participated in multiple functions in giving back to the community.  Conducted presentations for training to all agents new and new to job role."
good,"Expect fast-paced, team-centered work with a variety of brands. POC may find it hard because diversity is not really embraced. Hyper growth and giving"
good,everyone there is very welcoming. it’s a fun place to work at but can become very stressful. most of the time manager are willing to work with you but once you reach a certain amount of points and you go through family things they stop caring
good,Work is a bi stressful. .  Huge push to rank.  Everything decided on rank...pay...hours everything...kind of stressful.  This type of stress leads to people doing things shady..
good,"Nice place to work room. Don't match my skill level. It is a fortune 100 company. Good shares great benefits. Work on computer, learned good customer service skills, diverse work place. Hardest is overcoming objectives. Like working with the people."
good,"As this company is a credit card processing, my assigned client had gas stations all over the US. If that processing had a problem my typical day turned into 24x7 until resolution and contact made to the gas stations/jobbers in the field."
good,"I didn’t mind this job I got my right lunch breaks it was quiet , people were social and nice . I had to organize the files in alphabetical order & mess around with Microsoft word"
good,Can be stressful but the work is interesting. Gorgeous new campus and growing a ton. Climbing the ladder is very political. Loved working with the different clients in various industries.
good,Great place to work however feel communication needs improvements. That is my only issue other than that love the people and job it self. It also needs to pay more.
good,"Everyday is was a great day, I learn about credit card , approve and disapprove, marketing, sales and fraud. "
good,This company was fast pace. The people and management was nice. Company located close to great eating places. Love the morning hours. i would recommend to someone
good,There is some dishonesty and favoring going on allot I see. When there is an issue you can never get a straight answer from the supervisors. If you complain there is retaliation. It pays the bills though and I enjoy my customers.
good,"Alliance is a tele performance job. And sales as well! I my self am not a sales person, but since I been at this job i do my all to learn as much on sales that I can."
good,Alliance was a great place if you could do the same thing over and over forever.  Many folks were stressed by having to waive fees and negotiate with late paying clients. There was also very little time for personal needs.
good,This company is a call center. Productivity is high & very fast paced. Flexible schedules for those that like their flexability. Calls are monitored on a daily.
good,I do not have an opinion of the work environment. I met nice people there and enjoyed working with them. Many nice people to work with.The people were a joy to work with.

good,You have to be good at sales and collecting money which I am not. They do not give a lot of coaching or help to succeed. The hours are good and its tough.
good,"Organization - seems to only respect the experience you get from them. In my case, the company hired me for a job hadn't done in 30 years but would not hire me for what I've been doing the last 20 years. That was puzzling to me."
good,"Alliance Data is a good company to work for. Alliance Data is sill growing and building. The management team is easy and very supportive to the management, as well as the employees."
good,"A typical work day consist of collecting on credit card accounts, completing settlement forms, contacting bankruptcy attorneys,adjusting late fees, skip tracing, updating information ect. What I learned in this position is how credit actually works and I was able to inform and educate customers. Management was helpful when needed.The hardest part about the position was dealing with some of the irate customers. The most enjoyable was being able to assist customers with comfortable payment plans that fit their budgets"
good,"On a day to day basis making payment arrangements, collecting on past due accounts, data entry, and following proper procedures. Call Center Environment and on AutoDial."
good,Most call centers i have worked at are all the same.  The pay is ok here.  The location was great.  Stats are a huge thing here like most call centers.
good,"Very busy depending on the time of there year which was a good thing, kept me busy. I definitely learned patience there with the extremely wide variety of different clients and customers."
good,"Its a good place to work as long as you don't speak your mind, You have to kiss alot of butt to stayed employed . It use to be a GREAT place to work until they start making to many changes"
good,Overall a good place to work management was very laid back and cool everyone knew everyone very family like. I would recommend this place a nice company to work for
good,Process payments that customers submitted through the mail. Had to maintain the equipment that we used to run these payments through. Had to do some data entry of the rejected items. Helped the Manager with duties in controlling the flow of work that came through the center. Assisted the employees with any issues with work related problems. The hardiest part of the job was not enough work to keep you busy. The most enjoyable job was interacting with the employees.
good,Nice place to work. Customer care driven. The company cares about customers needs and is always looking for more effective ways to improve the business and the satisfaction of the clients.
good,"The job its self isn't bad, the constant changes though are ridiculous. the hardest part was adpating the the constant changes, in the middle of a month, finding out payout is changing!"
good,All customer service reps were very helpful and i enjoyed talking to customers and getting to know their life stories just through a short phone call.
good,A typical day at work was very challenging due to experiencing my first pregnancy. I learned how to overcome my personal issues by being committed to my employer. The management was very supportive and encouraging. My co-workers were loving and caring.
good,"The corporation is not very caring if you are trying to further your education, unless your degree has correlation to the job you perform with their company."
good,"employees are nice management was good when I worked there"
good,"I was doing the coding; testing and migration for the credit cards related projects."
good,"Insurance and Travel specialist. TICO certified, Travel councillor training. Community involvement. Customer driven company."
good,"Fun place to work with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you grow personally. Business political red tape, from company growth, The most enjoyable part is my colleagues and learning from them. Are office has become crowed from tremendous company growth."
good,"Management could improve their processes to support their growth. Personal approach from leadership, but no time to coach employees."
good,"Provide excellent service to customers resolving an array of issues such as; payment arrangements, cut-off notices, new service, customer complaints and general inquiry."
good,I loved working here however I did leave due to the pay. Be prepared most people have a great attitude. I liked that our supervisor took us to lunch.
good,This job was extremely stressful because of the angry people who called with their electricity cut off because they did not pay their bill.
good,"Job was simple fortunately training was good, management was good as well, very supportive... "
good,good p;lace to work it was very professional and I loved working there
good,"I need more financial security,  Love working from home, but really would like to start a new career with a different company.  The company is great, I would hate to leave, but I need to think about my financial situation, and loving a company so much.  Is hurting my financial budget"
good,"The hardest part of the job was the outbound calling, especially first thing in the morning and on Sundays. The customers were very irate during those times of the day. However, I did enjoy the extra incentives we received for payments we took on delinquent accounts."
good,I enjoyed being close to home. The hours were not the best with at the time having small children.
good,Reviewed and approved Credit History. Approved Credit Cards for Customers. I enjoyed helping customer get approved for credit. The job was very educational and easy.
good,"A typical day at work would include logging in to the phones and taking calls to service accounts for customers as needed, I have learned a lot about credit cards and new systems, with a call center the environment is constantly changing with new technology and programs. The management is there to help when needed, i work from home so I don't come face to face with co-workers, but I do have a great team of people. The hardest part of the job would be that it's never the same, every day the call volume can vary, but I do like the challenge and opportunity to learn new things and keep expanding."
good,Opportunity for advancement in this job and was also very proficient in the training that was provided.
good,"I take about 110 calls on a average day, increasing calls by double on hoildays and special sells. I learned that patience will take you a long way and helps build character. It has taught me better commucation skills and how to show loyalty to customer. How to give unwanted information in a positvie matter. Co-workers are happy upbeat people of course there is always a few sour apples laying around. The hardest part of the job to not take customers bad mood which is only towards the company and not make it personal. The most enjoyable part of my job is being regonzied for being great at what we do ."
good,Alliance Data is a small company but the people were excellent and friendly.
good,"I enjoyed working there but it was a temp position. Very friendly people, very professional."
good,able to learn faster with the team members on site. A typical work schedule would involve very long hours.
good,i love the people at my company. a typical day a this job was coming in helping store assiocates process credit card applications also increase credit limit. sat on phone and look at computer screens for several hrs of the day. i learned a lot about data entry. i love my managers also my cowokers are great. the hardest part of the job was trying to go above and beyond for our customer but be put on a time limit i didnt like the feeling of rushing my customers off the pne in 2:00 mins. the enjoyable part about the job was my team
good,Overseeing a team that activated satilites and rebooting system
good,I worked for several years at this company and loved it. The company changed CEO's and organizational changes started happening everywhere.
good,I loved the environment and the people were amazing. The hours were fair and made it easy to have a life outside of work. The work was grueling but working in a call center is never really a blast.
good,"Alliance Data Systems, very busy call center. 100+ calls a day."
good,"Run a Flexible Productivity Series (FPS). Pulled summary reports also, cleaned and oil FPS. Load inserts and loan statements into pockets. Load jobs into computers for work. Load completed statements and load APC into mail trays. Made sure that work on computer screen matched work being done on the machine. After all is completed then enter paper work at end of order or shift."
good,"Alliance Data has is an rebuilding / restructuring period. While working there could be challenging today, I feel that there are leaders who will get Alliance back to the company that people enjoy working at. They have a ton of great talent there. Accepting a role with Alliance will allow you to learn new skills and talents. This is a company who really does invest and support associate development."
good,Good if you like call center life and need a good check. It’s stressful they do try to make it fun but what they do doesn’t make up for the stressful busy day. Your exhausted all the time with no consistent days off. God forbid if you get sick or have a family emergency. Too many ways to get on finals even if your a great collector. Pay isn’t worth it in the end and neither are the bonuses.
good,"Good place to work, care about their employees, great pay, fun place, great perks and benefits, understanding when it comes to work life balance, great pay raises"
good,"Alliance Data is a job with minimal change in day to day operations.  It is time oriented that drives promotion, Immediate talent isn't recognized until shown that time has been spent at the bottom level.  Personally my education achievement drove me to search for a career in a more work/life balance job title.  If you enjoy talking with people it is definitely worth your while, however certain policies have rapidly changed and the company is outsourcing jobs.  I felt there was a lot of critical change in the last year causing chaos with management."
good,"Calls can be constant, schedules are super strict and it can be draining. Working weekends are a must and one late night per week. Monthly bonuses are available if you meet the right stats."
good,Better than average based on what I was told by my co workers...  An average day consisted of talking to mostly angry/abusive customers who wanted late fees waived or people that the automated voice recognition system couldn't understand.
good,Company is stricked on attendance with no flexibility in scheduling being in customer care. Team mates are great to work with and with. Although I do have many Complaints with the manager overall a good company to work for
good,"Overall a decent workplace culture. Bright and collaborative group of employees made the job enjoyable.  Recent management moves cast doubt on the future of the company, however."
good,"Take inbound customer service calls for credit card and financing accounts.  There are also frequent meeting, coaching, and growth & development times scheduled throughout the week."
good,"Work Life balance that they preach about is a joke. Don't be fooled by the make your own schedule option. Although you can decide your schedule it defeats the purpose when you have to work certain hours in the morning and then have to work certain hours in the evening and weekend the job ultimately ends up consuming your life. "
good,"I enjoy working for this company. The only reason I had to resign because had transportation problems. Now I have reliable transportation."
good,Good Company with good team building activity.  Onsite health facility to keep the workforce active.  Great PTO schedule.
good,Enjoyed the great benefits of Health Care.  Advancement opportunities for Part Time associates are not offered.  Supervisors and Managers are helpful and pleasant.
good,"I would refer anyone to work here if they like call center environment."
good,"Start my day on the phone colleting past due credit card debt from 1 to 3 payments, working in a call center.  My coworkers are a good bunch of people and I like working with them.  I have learned this is not the job for me."
good,took phone calls regarding customer credit account and process credit applications.
good,"I love alliance data however I have major complaints about wages, management following policy, nepotism and ability to advance."
good,typical day at work answering phones
good,Enjoyable workplace culture - have had recent re-organizations that could impact future employment/job security.  There are opportunities to learn both professionally and personally - compensation is fair with unique benefits.
good,This company was fine till out of the blue they decided to shut down our location and let all workers go the same day without any warning. There was over 152 workers who lost their job
good,"The company offers great benefits and pay that beat other companies in the area. Very cut throat, competitive environment, so if you want to work here be ready"
good,The company has multiple opportunities for growth and development. Atmosphere is fun and exciting along with great people to work with. Also has great benefits.
good,"It was a great place, great environment and people. But if you want to work here, make sure you’re like perfect with no outside life. Meaning no kids, no life issues. Nothing. They will not care."
good,Alliance is't a bad place and not the worst by far. I will always love the culture that is inspired at alliance. On the other hand Alliance has too many job endangering stats that you can't control 90% of the time which causes stress and frustration with the company altogether
good,"I don’t remember much about working here besides the fact that they randomly did draws and gave out gift cards, which I grew to appreciate. They also fed us sometimes."
good,The culture at Alliance Data is great. You get to meet so many people and you get close to them and you can definitely chat with others around and still remain very productive.
good,"You take phone calls all day in a cubicle about people's credit cards. They often don't know much about credit, and can be very hostile and rude and aggressive. The culture and company are good and they try to make everything else good as the work itself is less than stellar, but I couldn't handle the stress and anxiety involved in working there. If you can compartmentalize well and not get stressed easily from people coming at you in an aggressive and hostile way, you'll do well, but it wasn't the job for me. There's also a lot of tracking of your work and how your 'metrics' stack up to other people, it can be stressful in that way too."
good,"Alliance Data is a good place to work, especially for the GenXers.  Lots of advancement and they seem to be more in tune to that generation."
good,"Not bad for a summer job or a job for a kid just starting out ofter or during college.  The environment is pretty focused on productivity, but the managers I had were all very nice and accommodating."
good,"Alliance is a great place to work if you like working in the customer service field on the phones. The benefits are okay, they have pto and vacation and holiday pay. I did not enjoy working there because the phones were so busy constantly you had no breaks in between calls. You had to do a good job with your call because they are listened to by management. They are really strict with their calls and how you have to proceed with the call. You have to be really patient."
good,"While the culture and environment at Alliance Data are fun and easy going, the fact is that the job is stressful. Granted there are metric that must be met at every job but some make it impossible to do your job to your fullest ability"
good,"Customers feel entitled to not pay their bills on time and they expect a late fee credit. The people I work with are nice, management as well. So micro managed, set lunches & breaks which differ daily."
good,Nice environment. Hours too variable. Auto dial system. Very competitive with nice incentives for top performers.Great benefits. Absolutely NO cell phones or devices with audio or video recording capabilities due to privacy protection.
good,On a daily basis took many inbound calls and had various clients.  One client was Direct Energy.  Enrolled clients and took payments. Helped to set up reconnects for disconnected customers.
good,"Opportunities for advancement "
good,"A typical day at ADS would consist of logging into your phone and starting your day by speaking to customers about a broad range of topics about their credit accounts. You could take anywhere from 60-80 calls on a typical day. I learned to just sit and be yelled at on the phone, because they teach you to satisfy the customer and if that means you being verbally attacked then so be it, from their point of view all they cared about were their customer satisfaction surveys, and if you received a bad survey, you were put on a corrective action plan, no exceptions. Management was mediocre they were not bad, but also were not that interested in helping you become successful while in your position. And they never rush to resolve issues that are important to you. The hardest part of this job, is the stress that comes with it from having to take attacks from customers and providing them what they want but still having to meet company financial and customer experience metrics. As far as the job goes I cannot say there is much of anything enjoyable about it. Co-workers are the best thing about this place. Matter of fact if it were not for my co-workers I would've left a long time ago. Overall this is just another job you can add to your resume if you are looking to add more experience onto it. Otherwise if you want stability, advancement potential, and a company that treats you as a human rather than an employee number, you may want to look elsewhere."
good,"The ability for skill improvement is available, and atmosphere is friendly. There is a good work-life balance, and the company strives to improve benefits each year."
good,"Recognize clients financial needs and advise appropriate products"
good,Ok place to work.  Good opportunity to make money.  Advancing in ones own interest area not so easy.  Not much I want to say concerning this Job.
good,"Perform customer service activities such as sales, markdowns, stock rooms, train new employee"
good,"I was a customer service representative I took inbound phones calls from customer accepted payments and opened up new accounts for customer increased credit limits, did overides for stores."
good,Overall good company to work for and very flexible with scheduling.
good,"Typical work day included calling folks behind on their store credit card accounts to obtain payment or set up alternative payment plan.  "
good,My time spent with Alliance data was exciting. I was in charge of handling customer accounts with large retail credit card balances. My job was collecting debt owed to these companies on consumer retail credit cards. I was confronted with many types of situations through my interactions with my customers and I learned a lot about empathy. The management In my department had their hands full but I think they did a good job at trying to see each of us become successful. The hardest part of my job was listening to some of the struggles that my customers were going through. I found a lot of enjoyment in helping them find ways to pull themselves out of their current financial situations and becoming current and out of debt with my company. I accomplished this by listening to their situations and needs and then using that to help find solutions that worked for them.
good,company is well orginaze like at in company it has it's up in down very great benefits in some helpful employees
good,"there was a woman named amanda that was in charg of the homedepot experience she did a very bad job & lost her job for it ,you cant be a manager & buddy/friends with everybody!"
good,"there is nothing else, it was ok but i would not want to work there again. it would be a last resort. it can be very stgressful trying to make your numbers and they always change something like the way you do things or what chang the scrip some kind of way.; "
good,"free lunches, nice break room, and gym. Personal trainers. "
good,Highly regulated and structured environment working with credit card clients in a call center.  Fixed schedule with not too much flexibility availability.
good,"•	Responsible for reducing losses on fraud cases by setting up and investigating cases for recovery opportunities."
good,Pay at Alliance Data is Great overall as a place to work. You have to have to be able to deal with a lot. This job is very stressful. And will cause you to be diagnosed with Stress and depression.
good,"they are no longer in business, Sold to a company out of England."
good,The culture of the company is awesome. Management has an open door policy when it comes to employees needing advice or help. Certain company policies make it very difficult to have the job as the employee is held accountable for situations out of their control when it comes to accounts.
good,"Experience varies by department; it's a good company for what they do.  Vacation time and sick time are combined into personal time off.  No ""bank holidays""."
good,"My initial supervisor was very intelligent, but lacked supervisory skills.  I was given a job that was beneath what my position was supposed to be and when I did it well, I was reprimanded.  I loved what I finally was allowed to do, but their approach to employee evaluations and coaching is pitting everyone against each other to see who comes up with the best ideas that are easily actionable and profitable.  HR is no help and is only there to tow the company line.  Even the company president will tell you on Day 1 that you will get no where in the organization without creating relationships that will help you achieve your goals."
good,"As with any customer service job, those attached to ADS can be frustrating because people can be either or both uninformed and mean, both the internal customers and external clients and customers.  This is a frustrating place to work for those with advanced education or skills because they do not provide a living wage in the beginning and advancement seems pegged more to loyalty to the employer than to merit.  It is also difficult to believe in a place whose business model is largely dependent on selling and maintaining high-interest credit cards to customers of the clients who we partner with."
good,"Really overall a pleasant work environment , to work if you are very experienced , fast pass , up beat positive , Yet could have more tools to utilize in finding people and updating the information about debtor."
good,I enjoy the people but there is not a lot of movement in my building. I wish they had more opportunities in our office. The Easton location sees the most action and changes.
good,"Great benifits room to grow with in company. Lots of traning provided, constanly on the phone, long hours of sitting.Not the best inviroment to work in. if you like to work alone and are able to reach personal as well as company goals, this is a good fit for you."
good,Over all was ok company to work for if you want to just talk on the phone allday
good,"The challenging part is for the management to force some employees into lowest 10% rank of performance (a GE method). Although done in a relative rank, it is hard to define what metrics to use to quantify/justify this bottom 10% rank, thus subjective opinions matter more. To front-line sales function, this performance rating approach makes perfect sense to motivate employess, but to other supportive functions (IT, finance or analytics) this performance rating method approach will potentially lead to long term issue of high employee ""churn"" or low job satisfaction."
good,"Here I took customer service calls for two different companies. First starting in the canle are where I could post payments to accounts, change programming, and turn service on and off. I was then promoted to taking supervisor calls in the electric company division where I took calls from customers who were upset. I was able to set up payment arrangements, turn service on and off and send important documentation to the PUCT."
good,I enjoyed my time with my previous employer. I was internally challenged with my job duties and became a better manager because of it. My ideas were encouraged and often implemented by senior leadership. Working with some of the most talented people in Columbus sparked a passion to constantly grow within a great organization. I am looking forward to the next chapter of innovation and team work with my next great place of employment.
good,"this was a very strict place to work with,"
good,"One of the core values is ""Have Fun"" and they incorporate that into the everyday work life.  Meetings were met with music, various themes.  It was a decent place to work.  At the time I was there, they did require upselling some products for the credit card protection."
good,"My typical day at work starts by me clocking in and then signing on to the dialer system to start making calls and start collecting. I have learned a lot about the job in being a bill collector like how our systems  work to policies that we have to live by on a daily basis. The management at Alliance Date is very comforting and very helpful. If we ever had a problem, they made you feel comfortable enough so you were not scared to ask. I think the hardest part of the job is when you are calling an account holder and it is their daughter or son and they are telling you that the account holder had passed away. When someone passes away we have to get info about their death and it gets uncomfortable for me to ask them questions cause they don't want to talk about it cause it pains them to do so. Its hard to find enjoyment in the line of work that I do because being a bill collector, no one wants to talk to you in the first place. I guess if I had to find some kind of enjoyment, it would be with those once  and a while account holders that are really nice and can make you laugh."
good,I had a wonderful experience at this job the management was OK it was professional.  My coworkers was very friendly they had much respect for me an others one of the hardest parts was teaming up getting things done on time some worked fast an some wasn't but I did enjoy working there.
good,"As a sales associate I would answer customer calls, answer their questions and pitch a product when the opportunity was there. "
good,"On a typical work day I would come in clock in and then get on the dialer and start making calls to customers to collect on past due accounts. My co-workers and Managers were team players and very helpful. I learned how to collect using customer service skills will bring payments and new business. My favorite part of the job was reaching my goals, that gave me a since of achievement."
good,A typical work day consisted of taking scripted in bound calls. Flexible schedule for when I was a student in high school. Great part time job.
good,"Working at Alliance Data is a great temporary placement, especially when in school. They allow a flexible schedule with certain requirements such as 40 hour work weeks and occasional late nights. They also allow things such as being able to work from home and bonuses pending on performance. It is a rather stressful job, but the overall environment surrounding it equals out."
good,The traning is a three week teaching of policy and procedures about all of the companies they assist on the customer service level. The trainers made learning fun and exciting. By acting out senorios with fun material to better understand your job and also get to know that particular customer.  Helpful tools to develop proper skills is the key to excellent customer service.
good,"Alliance is a great place to get into and work.  Right now it's going through a major growth spurt so things are chaotic but it's a good place.  The managers are very hands on, the compensation is great and the people are really nice."
good,Great people to work with but some of the company policies could be refined to benefit both employees and customers better
good,"Its a wonderful place to,work. The training is fun and learning for opportunities to come. Management is okay but they try to me family orient as possible. Overall i wouldnt mind go back for employment."
good,They are always hiring. When I worked there they did give great bonuses.
good,Alliance Data is a great company to work for overall. Culture can vary from department to department. This can cause issues internally from time to time.
good,Would take in at least 70 inbound calls a day. Would explain there billing statement and take payments.
good,"no comment I was laid off while on leave, good company while I was there and they do make you feel that you are worth it.  But not transpartent about lay offs."
good,"Nice company, great coworkers. Too many hours for part time job when you work a full time job.  Would love to work here for a couple more years but can't balance 68 hours a week between both jobs."
good,"a very strict yet productive place to work, gives opportunities to move up within the company but it comes with the expense of not having a nothing work and life balance"
good,"Typical day, calling account hodlers to collection on oustanding debt, helping account holders with programs or arrangements to get accounts back on track."
good,"Wasnt really there long ,but my time there was cool.  Nice team of co workers and nice managment team from what I seen. I left because I had to move so I ddint really see much."
good,"Its a fast place environment, I learned a lot dealing with delinquent accounts. How to handle customers and different situations. The management at alliance is very helpful. The co workers are very friendly. The hardest part of day for I, is knowing I'm about to leave for the day. I enjoy competing in contest to win gifts."
good,"A typical day at work consist of calling numerous account holders to collect on past due credit cards. At Aliance I leraned how to be more understanding of someones situation and not everyone's situation is trhe same, the management of the company was outstanding I never had ant conflict with any supervisor and I also felt as if I could coome to them with any problem or concern i had whenever. My co-workers were just as amazing, we work as a team! everyone in the department had one goal and that was to make the account holders feel as if we were not just some collection agency trying to collect money but a collection agency who actually cared about their priorities. The hardest part about my job was to not get hooked, although some customers had legitimate reasons to fall behind on a bill I still had a job to maintain and that was to collect payments. I enjoyed a lot of things about alliance but my favorite thing was the games we played when the calls were low."
good,My hours were from 9am to 6pm. They were long days it was a call center so it was very fast paced. The managers were nice but it was all about business for TXU. They wanted us trained in and out on the floor taking calls.
good,Good job to have. Amazing benefits and starting rate of pay is decent and they also give bonuses based on performance. Co-workers and managers are super nice and always willing to help. The only down fall is the customers are really mean.
good,"I use to love the job they do pay well but, my hours weren’t flexible and I was never able to switch them even just on certain days temporarily it’s always serious and management is iffy"
good,Fun place to work good pay but they DO NOT want you to advance. Fast pace angry customers. Awesome coworkers providing help and knowledge of needed. Abe
good,Great company with great benefits and store discounts. Terrible management and opportunity for advancement.  Not the best bonus structure and no way to track your money collected.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Alliance, the people were awesome, my immediate management was always accessible and willing to help. They'll claim that they're supportive of you and your personal needs, but when it comes time to deliver, they fall a bit short."
good,This was a very fast pace Call center. Call after call. Had to be fast and answer calls quickly to meet a daily quota. Call center meetings were awesome and fun.
good,I worked here for 2 years and decided too quit recently management do a poor job at managing really don't know a lot about the positions that they are in it could be a better place overall all departments pay are different I wouldn't go back of I didn't have a job
good,a typical day at work consist of me at the recent job i was at i would come in look up my email to see if i have any accounts that need to be worked for my manager and while im  doing that im checking my ques to see accounts i can collect money on. On top of collecting we also take in coming calls regarding our credit cards
good,I was in the hospital I had broken ribs because I didn’t have pto left due to a death in the family they fired me. I had a doctors excuse and everything. My manager went to bat for me (as he said) but I was extremely hurt by it. I loved my position.
good,Working split shifts at least one day a week makes things a bit easier to deal with. Management was willing to help on some occasions with balancing work/life situations.
good,"fun place to work, great bonus plan, would recommend, not much flexibility, hard to advance unless you're very cool with members of upper management.."
good,Great work environment and great people to with as well as not so stressful work load and  love helping customers getting out of their financial situation.
good,Would work there again. The job was easy to learn and also taught me how to talk and deal with disgruntled customers. The pros outweigh the cons. Overall a good decent company.
good,"There are some pros and cons to every job. They strive on having a great work life balance because you can make your own schedules however it is a position that you rank against your peers. Ranking is the amount of dollars you collect against your monthly scheduled hours. Overtime is offered and is back out of your scheduled hours, if you don’t have a family then it’s a great job for you, if you do have a family FYI it is very hard to compete against the many people who work countless overtime hours, low rank means no incentive. They do provide lunch often and there is a lot of contests for gift cards."
good,"Fun, constant change, room to grow internally. Tuition rembursment. Lots of motivation, bowling, bingo, word search. Unlimited overtime. Great company."
good,Have enjoyed the work place but i have not been able to bonus due to strict regulations of call quality in my depart. All calls are of a escalated nature and I'm required to re verify and update accounts that had just been handle sometimes by 1-2 people before me.
good,"There aren't very many opportunities for advancement unless you know the right people. It's a typical call center where business needs come first, but the people you work with are great people. The culture is the best part."
good,"The company started off as great place to work, however, within the last year there have been many changes with management etc.  The changes have made it a slightly stressful environment.  Management does not care about the employees, only business needs.  Associates should feel more valued.  They offer great benefits and pay compared most call centers, but feeling valued is important to me as well."
good,"A typical day at work is scheduled. However, On breaks or lunch I love chatting and catching up with all of my co workers who always approach with a smile. What I learned is that you will not be happy with your job until you love what you do. The hardest part of the job are my hours, they do in fact conflict with my family life. The most enjoyable part of the job is the meetings and the special events that we have!!"
good,"Overall the stability of the employer was good.  There was a disconnect between management and employees causing and uncultivated work culture and increasing lack of employee morale."
good,"Alliance is a very ""professional"" call-center with a higher caliber employee (as they refer to it, Associate) working there. Very friendly people and work well overall to strive towards the same mission and values."
good,"I loved working for Alliance Data, however, moving 30 + minutes away made it really difficult. And their new scheduling system to change hours is not helpful with my son's daycare schedule."
good,I am forever grateful for my time with ADS. I developed my human resources skills with this company as well as my analytical and project leadership skills. The business acumen I gained is invaluable.
good,"Depressed setting, felt like I was alone on an island after I started. Some people working  at the location I was at seemed to really enjoy it so it may have just not been a good fit for me."
good,productive and fin workplace with ping pong table. The work culture is good and people are fun to work with. It's a very challenging environment with a very busy schedule.
good,Health insurance could be a lot more affordable as big as the company is. Promotions should be based off skills and ability to learn not who you are personal  friends with. Also need an incentive plan that is fair and rewarding.
good,"I enjoyed my time with this company. The schedule was flexible, good pay and great benefits. the location was near my home and there are dozens of food selections."
good,Stressful due to performance requirements and various other required standards and rule..can cause termination.   Communication lacks on several levels.
good,"Alliance Data allows flexible hours and work days, but the work is all phone based, and can be very stressful at times.  They used to provide occasional free meals and better bonuses, but for the most part, those have been greatly reduced."
good,"Even though we were told repeatedly that this is the last lay-off it seemed like they were constantly buying another company or replacing management and the first act was to lay-off another group of employees.  "
good,"Management just doing its job, usually left to do our jobs, very limited in scope. usually processing credit requests fro vendors, with a yay or nay result, very straightforward."
good,Alliance Data was a great company to work for. I learned a lot from the company in terms of Global customer service and finances. They offered competitive compensation packages and nice discounts.
good,"no willing to work with associetes hours and work every weekend,if call in sick it would be taking off vacation hours so not much vacation.would not work with you if needed help o any ."
good,alliance is the best company i have worked for they really appreciate their employees always keeping a smile on our faces striving for success. i am very glad to be apart of the team
good,Alliance Data was the third party vendor for Direct Energy. No complaints about the company. Only positive things were experienced. Met lots of now really good friends
good,"The first 2 years I was at processing facility.  Great people. Busy area, but great support. Got along with most everyone. The last year moved to another job. I enjoyed the knowledge I gained while I was there. But that job I had could be stressful at times, which was amplified when I was on call.   Co-workers were helpful when we worked together.  The outside contractors we brought in were great.  They answered a lot of questions. I mostly enjoyed working in the Data Center.  Manager liked to micromanage the department.  He made some promises, but they never happened.  Money was good, but I felt it wasn't worth the stress.  Still miss learning so much, and the friends I made while there."
good,"The company is a fast paced, performance driven. Have to be able to multitask while skip tracing the customers and making calls at the same time. The company says they are a company where work/life balance is not an issue and there is potential for growth within the company however, I do not feel that is the case. If you are not performing 100% and getting your boss's good bonuses you are not cared about."
good,Good place to work and make it a career. Lots of opportunities for advancements. Lots of daily calls and potential for commissions. I would recommend this company.
good,"The job was okay,less streesful and also the work life balance was okay,unfortunately i had to leave due to personal reasons,hoping to find a suitable and good employer to establish my skills and help promote the company and brand.."
good,Job is not too demanding - but can be at times. Employees and supervisors are good to work with. This company has many ways to advance within the banking industry.
good,"ADS is a solid company with a vision.  They are going through some organizational changes, however they should be better for it once it is complete.  I would recommend Alliance"
good,fast paced third party collections call center. I would have  to skip trace sometimes to find certain people on the account. setting up payment plans for repayment of credit
good,"Although the role wasn't didn't fit for me personally, the experience was great. I was able to learn a lot about retail and loyalty programs, and also learn what the corporate life was like."
good,"Work in a fast-paced servicing environment performing a variety of call center customer service tasks.  Taking inbound calls from customers and stores and respond to there questions and concerns.  "
good,"Inbound calls providing customer service to credit card account holders; Assisting with payments by phone, increase/decrease credit limits, lower annual percentage rates."
good,"the best part of my job there was making my customers life a littler easier eeryday, They also had an awesome bonus structure."
good,"log in "
good,They have strong ethics and great training and feedback from the supervisors. They make sure your completely ready and dont rush you onto the floor to take calls without being confident in yourself.
good,Company takes interest in advancing it's employees.  Keeps up with current trends for pay and benefits to encourage potential candidates to join the Team
good,Alliance is a great company to work for.  The average day you are making outbound calls and taking inbound calls to collect on past due credit card accounts.  To encourage employees by creating weekly games and you can win cash on the spot.  The people at Alliance a wonderful and always welcome new employees with open arms.
good,"making outbound calls"
good,A typical day included outbound calls to customers that were behind on their luxury credit card accounts.
good,"Numerous incoming calls"
good,This is a good company to work for. The only issue for me was the split shifts.
good,Great pay. Great place to work. Assisted bankers with helping card members find the best card for them also account maintained
good,Great company with wonderful benefits. Loved the atmosphere. It was a fun place to work for the most part.
good,"Great incredibly fast growing company.  Recent culture changes have made it difficult on the middle management layer, which have a heavy burden of stress placed upon them to enact the culture shift.  Executive levels are also under stress, but there is a huge compensation difference between those two layers.  Individual contributors and director/above are generally satisfied."
good,"This is a great company to work for however, I need something closer now that I have moved close to Dayton"
good,I handled A/R for major oil and retail companies credit card holders.
good,Was a great place to work until the split going manual and dialer teams company made sure to get opinions of to try to improve or fix any current issues

good,Human Resources was not very helpful. Very fun to win things for certain deadlines. Hard to make bonus each month.
good,Alliance Data is a great company to be apart of and they have many ways that you can elevate your self with-in the company .
good,This place is a growing and fast paced environment. The company has prided itself on the customer care provided.
good,"Company was fun until wrnt under, had to leave for another oppurtunity."
good,"Very secluded job. Very little interaction between management and employees. Overall, not a bad place to work."
good,I enjoyed working at alliance data and I enjoyed the flexibility of my schedule the management was okay the money was good I just don’t appreciate the way they laid everyone off in Akron location
good,"ADS  ""check all the boxes"" about basic benefits, community engagement and diversiy. With that said, there are other similar companies with much better benefits and way more engaged to the community."
good,Enjoyed working there coworker's they were a pleasure to work with my manager was always available when needed since it was a cal center for credit applications we had to make sure all information taken on applications taken were filled out correctly to insure that the customers information was protected as well as the company's integrity was kept in tact as well as we had to follow bank guide lines and we had to do this within the call handling time as well because we were graded on all our calls
good,"best place I have ever worked. Seriously, Alliance Data cares for their people and gives them every opportunity to grow. They are a smart company that is fueled by what it takes to stand out."
good,"Solving customers issues with their private label credit cards, helping with credit line increases, fraud, and new applications. I also help with goodwill adjustments with removing late fee remarks from customers credit bureau report."
good,"workplace culture- have fun / work hard"
good,"With the accelerated growth that the company has been experiencing, the environment has become a high pressure work environment with short deadlines and higher expectations for defect free alpha code (before any qa testing is even peformed)."
good,Daytime and most nightime and work day fast pace most days; The customer on the credit card department could be challenging at time and this could affect your job and cost you your job so that could be very stressful at time. I enjoy working there the nighttime and weekend work hours were difficult for me at time due to personal  matters. The company try to allow the workers ways to advance and supply different functions to assist employee with the stressful part of the job.
good,"It's a very fun atmosphere, but you're not paid based on experience. There is really no negotiations regarding salary. Also, if you transfer departments it is generally a pay cut"
good,Being a part of a start up business/department was very exciting with lots of opportunity to learn about the utility business. The hours/days were long.
good,"For the most part I enjoyed my coworkers.  We were involved with some rather interesting projects, particularly from a procurement perspective.  I collaborated with some very talented individuals.  It would have been a good place to stay on if I had not been accepted to law school."
good,"A typical day at work consists of, quite frankly, the mundane things using a dialing system to call numbers and leave voicemails.  The hardest part of the job for me personally is having system issues because then everything, as you can imagine comes to a halt. But that is just for the moment, things startup again. "
good,"phenomenal company and culture "
good,"Great place to work with great wages choosing your own hours but the management was hypocritical. lot's of overtime and flexibility in your schedule, stressful and drama filled workplace."
good,"I was working at Alliance Data as an independent consultant."
good,"Company not loyal to their employees long term employees, in which they will find a reason to fire you after you reach your highest pay scale and been their over seven years."
good,Autodial phone collections. Contacted delinquent clients through a dialer system. Required note taking and customer service required.
good,"a typical day at work consisted of me clocking in on my computer, getting on the phones and helping customers with there credit card accounts."
good,A very fast paced work environment. A good place to work which allows a work life balance for it's employees.
good,"I answered anywhere from 50-80 phone calls per day from customer associated with clients i.e. Victoria Secret, Express, Haband, and etc. Management showed me adequate respect and really cared about me the goals I set out for myself. The co-workers we really respectful and caring. The most enjoyable part of the job involved being around honest and caring people. The paychecks were good as well."
good,Promote good health to Employees. The company is flexible but doesn't present challenges. You keep doing the same thing over and over.
good,"Great, solid company especially for those who are either entering a career or a few years into. Not a lot of flexibility when it comes to the need for time off to tend to family members - reasonable requests."
good,Alliance Data purchased the utilities division from AEP. There were a few challenges when trying to combine what we knew as AEP with Alliance Data. Alliance Data was very competitive with salaries and growth opportunities.
good,I collected on charged off credit cards for over 30 different clients
good,"great people, in it for the long term however sometimes can't meet that work life balance"
good,It is a good place to work and I have worked with a lot of good people
good,Its an okay place to work with a lot of great people. The pay is good and the benefits are comp with the industry
good,"Good place to work. At times Director doesn't listen to your suggestions, other benefits out weight this disadvantage most of the time."
good,"I’ve been with Alliance data for 6 years. Culture is healthy, promotions are available, pay is decent for type of job.  No special skills needed all training tools are provided to succeed."
good,Culture is amazing. Tough environment to work in but culture is what keeps you there. Management varies on department. Great community work also and very involved.
good,"It all depends on what you can shake off and your tolerance level. I was in the collections department; so, reciting reparative voicemails were annoying. Plus, having to hit a target payment amount was also stressful. Especially when you’re collecting on people who were 5+ months past due. I was so burnt out and stressed, I wasn’t even doing 40 hrs a week and I made my own schedule. I begged and pleaded to be transferred to the fraud department where it would be less hectic and still I kept getting the run around until I finally quit. The company is great as a whole, however some managers on site don’t take their job seriously. Also, like all the other call centers...they run on favoritism"
good,"Overall I  enjoyed my time with this company. However this job is not for everyone although it comes with amazing perks, compensation and benefits. There are constant changes within the organization that end up negatively affecting the lower men on the totem pole (call center associates), little coaching and training are provided to those individuals that struggle with the role, the bottom line is most important (vs overall individual well being) and a high turn over rate.To advance you will need to learn to play the game, work hard and connect with the correct people.However if you are able to push past the negatives( that come with any job ) and are looking to advance your career, learn a few more skills and eventually move up, retire or move on with the company this a great opportunity."
good,"The biggest takeaway i can say about Alliance Data Systems is that they have a really good listening ear. Anything you want to share that has to do with your growth, the companies growth or general ideas, they will not only listen but help you move toward it. I created the position I am in today."
good,"Very competitive environment. A lot of changing, have to be able to  adapt quickly. Good benefits and good work life balance depending on what department you work in."
good,Fast paced and fun but management could have been there a little more to help in times of need. and the benefits were great from beginning with new hires all the way tot he end when I left the company.
good,"I enjoyed my time with alliance data, good company to work for has a lot to offer if you know how to get past the loop holes. Training is good and often"
good,"*Force managers to focus on the growth of their employees. There are some who don’t provide feedback and support and let their employees drown and/or fail. Then others who are great. Take notice!"
good,Great place with opportunities for advancement. Management demands accountability and hard work. Would definitely recommend it to any one looking for a career.
good,"Just didn’t suit me. I sat down for too long. The people were pretty fun, but not too much interaction at all, the only people you really talk to all day is the customers over the phone."
good,"It was fine. You can get a corrective action for any and every little thing. Once you get a written or final they take your bonus for the following month. They hire supervisors from outside thew company who have no clue what they're doing or just don't care about there teams. If you get hired at the Milford location. Don't expect to be in leadership, at all."
good,Great pay with potential for advancement. You make your own schedule within certain parameters. There can be a lack of professionalism at time which can be distracting.
good,A typical day at work involved working excel spreadsheets with account flagged for fraud trends. I reviewed those accounts to determine if they were fraud by verifying customer information using different background checks and searches.
good,Decent career development could sometimes feel trapped in a position. Plenty of departments to try and figure out which path you would like your career to go.
good,"ADS is a good place to work overall.  They have great benefits and options to work at home, which I do W@H  I would recommend this job to anyone looking for a steady job."
good,"Working in a call center can be fun and repetitive at the same time. The accounts Alliance had were easy, so getting the job done was a breeze. Follow directions and read the script."
good,"I had started working at Alliance Data as a collection associate over the summer before my senior year at college. All summer they had said they could work with my school schedule and even approved my schedule shortly after starting. Once school began, they said they were unable to comply to the requested schedule, therefore I had to put in my two weeks."
good,"the only thing that I had a hard time with was that when you need to change your schedule due to family things going on it was hard."
good,"Too many changes too quickly. Very frustrating. Supervisors aren't on the same page. Some are strict, some aren't. For the most part tho, it's a great company."
good,great work environment. But promotions are not based off of experience there. I came in the door with tons of experience in management. And I was over looked.
good,"Company has great benefits and pay, would refer to friend. You are able to work from home after being employed one year. Company also offers great discounts!"
good,The job itself is very stressful but alliance as a whole dose try to make the environment as enjoyable as possible! the people you work with are great to be around.
good,It has been almost 15 years since I have worked fro this company.  I cannot say what the atmosphere/culture is at this point as there have been many changes since I have left.
good,Great place to work and people are awesome.  Highly recommended if you are looking for a collections job.  Not a place where your only worth is how much you collected today.
good,"A typical day of work consists constantly taking phone calls averaging 70 to 100. I have improved my Customer Service skills. Overall, everyone is nice and welcoming. It is a good environment, and the people are like family. If I was ever to leave this job, the hardest part of leaving is leaving the daily relationship experiences that we have. The hardest pat of the job is the harsh customers that call in,although some are very nice. Another part of the job that is hard is that most of the metrics are not concretely based on how well that a Customer Service Associate serves the customer, like overall customer Satisfaction, First Call resolution, Late fee waivers."
good,Great opportunities for advancement. Positive work environment. He Health Clinic on the campus which is provided to employees at no cost. Very supportive staff and supervisors.
good,I enjoyed my time but it was time to move on to further grow my career.  I liked the culture but the pay was low for the market.
good,I enjoyed working for Alliance data. The pay was excellent as well as the benefits offered by alliance really paid off. i enjoyed the culture and gained well experience working for this company.
good,"my daily job at alliance data is providing customers with credit card balance, credit limits, assisting with credit disputes as well as helping customers establish credit. I am also required to hit a certain goal each month to receive a incentive, I have to maintain time management"
good,"Great pay"
good,"Taking on calls (customer)  one at a time, active listening and acknowledging customer's needs, and when closing the call make sure I have taken care of their needs, enjoy conversation (engaging with customer. removing fees, Late fees, returned checks."
good,"In training ""There are so many advancement benefits"", after working there nearly 2 years I saw 3 people promoted. Nice co-workers, decent management, bonuses were good."
good,"Alliance data cares about its employees, just as they care about their customers. Great company to work for if you put in the descent amount of work."
good,A typical day at Alliance Data revolves around taking 60-80 calls a day which are most customer service calls. The employees there are all great and the environment is also fun due to there are always contests and games going on. The hardest part of the job though in my opinion is finding the right way to deliver bad news among angry customers. Other than that I really enjoyed the interaction with my co-workers all of us bonded very well and even hung out on multiple occasions outside of work.
good,"Provided customers with information concerning previous transactions and payment agreements. Resolved customer complaints to 100% satisfaction resulting in customer retention. Kept record of customer interactions or transactions, recording details of inquiries, complaints or comments, as well as actions taken. Determine customer’s ability to make current and future payments. Giving full attention to what other people are saying, taking the time to understand the points being made, asking questions as appropriate, and not interrupting at inappropriate times."
good,"Loved Position in Tech Support"
good,"Educated and trained, leads,supervisors and dialer specialest. Also managed a collection team of 16 employes. Co-workers were awesome to work with always willing to help out where needed. The hardest part of the job was the long hours and holidays that we required to work. The most enjoyable was the staff there were many associates that were hard works, honest, dependable and always willing to go that extra mile."
good,Great business growth in the market place.  Great Leadership at the CEO and CFO level.
good,a typical day of work from start to end you were on the phone collecting on past due accounts. You had to be able to negotiate to get secured payments.
good,"When I get to work I check for any pending payments due in the morning so these can make it to the daily deposit, then I start balancing all the accounts that I handle, review any pending special assignments and work on these."
good,"Good company, as an employee, management is expecting perfection, no one is perfect? Overall one of the best places to work."
good,"For the most part, it was enjoyable, working with some supervisors and employees, developing verbal relationships with customer's who are pleased with the services provided and offered. Talking to hundres and maybe even thousands of individuals over time assistanting them with payments, questions they have in regards to their credit  card accounts. Also helping them resolve issue to better the credit statuts. The cafeteria was very good with alot  of edible choices, that were pretty tasty. Phones for us to use and computers for us to utilize on our breaks. Convenient location to get to and from work and ample oppurtunities to earn extra hours and cash and gifts"
good,Fast paced atmosphere
good,"A typical day at Alliance Data was truely professional. As long as you are on time expect to have a good day at work. I learned that there were no limits to my development in working for Alliance Data. Management for the most part were excellent, however there are some draw backs on joining the team until folks get to know you. Co-workers were grand but we all were well aware of competition. Hardest part of the job was with not knowing what the manager thought of me. There was a communication breakdown which I just tried hard to connect with. The most enjoyable part of the job was with working with end users with fixing their computers. I loved and still do like working with computers."
good,"Busy days, usually work on multiple projects at a time, there's always something new to learn. It can be challenging sometimes as there is always a shortage of resources. Being busy and making decisions, which will lead to a better quality product is certainly the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Constantly calling delinuent account holders to collect a debt. I learned howto deal with not so nice individuals. Nice management team. Co-workers were great we worked as a team. The best part of the job was the motivational games for great productivity.The hardest part was getting very old debts to be paid..
good,"It was a pretty cool job to have at 18. Was able to make my own schedule pretty much, and still have a social life. Pay and bonuses were nice, but Supervisors need to do better with coaching their employees. Lost my job because my supervisor didn't know how to coach me on how to do better and be better at the job."
good,The staff really works with you to help you succeed. The downfall is that you hear changes from consumers before you hear them from management.The job isn't for the weak
good,"A good company that does care about its employees but just remember, in the end, it's still a call center so make that what you will. "
good,Alliance Data is a good place to work. Good place to work if you are starting a call center career. The supervisors and managers are all engaged and are available all the time.
good,"The best thing about the job is the culture.  There is always some motivational something or another going on during the week.  It is designed to keep you pushing toward the ""company goal"".  Which is reasonable and attainable, competition is out there, on the call center floor.  Food/games/prizes and sometimes even music is provided to keep everyone going, it is a good time. Different companies do come in to add to the fun, activities are in place to keep things rolling.  I don't know of any other company that goes above and beyond like AD does to please its associates when it comes to culture."
good,A great company to work for. However it is very stressful. Collections department is not for everyone. The benefits are exceptional and the opportunity for advancement is available.
good,"Been with Alliance Date since 2015. People are great to work with. Customer care department too stressful. Alliance data makes it a fun place by doing lots of activities all over the year with holidays and special events."
good,"Loved the people, most of management was ok. It’s hard to get good hours and the actual job is repetitive and stressful. Customers are allowed to say absolutely anything to you and they want you to just take it even if it’s verbally abusive"
good,Although great place to work and advance the management staff was not helpful and not approachable. the office was very uptight and sometimes unprofessional
good,"Alliance Data is a great place to work but the competitive population in late-term collections is large, with no voice mail allowed for customer call backs to direct individuals, making successful contacts limited."
good,"alliance data is a fortune 500 company, and has been rated one of the best places to work for several years in a row now. The job is easy considering I have worked with the company almost six years now. It is a lot of knowing how to multi- task, and also a lot of problem solving. knowing how to calm down an angry customer consecutively in a timely manner. It is also very fast- paced and competitive."
good,Great company if you take it serious you will go a long way. I am currently thinking about going back. The only reason that I previous resigned was do to illness. If given an opportunity I would defiantly be  interested.
good,"Working for alliance data as help me grow in many ways, I am currently still employed with the company, the hours at this time are not flexible enough, I enjoy working with customers and answering questions that best fit our customers needs. I work really hard at meeting all of numbers every mouth and enjoy power hours and winning rewards."
good,"Alliance Data overall, is an incredible company to work for, depending on the department you look at. The company is all about health, quitting smoking, eating healthy, walking/running, etc. They also are one of the few companies that truly value family time, and you are given vacation time accordingly. Once you begin employment you start with 4 weeks of Paid Time Off. Four Weeks!! After five years, you get five weeks, which is fantastic. Our benefits package is outstanding if you have a family with children. Price is very good and they charge for a family, not per child. Within Security though, there are very few opportunities for advancement and it can be very political. Unless you are at the Easton location, you are completely forgotten about. Managers play politics big time and can become very disrespectful. Lately, there have been multiple managers that are on some sort of power trip and it is ruining the morale within the department."
good,"This is a fast paced job with many opportunities to travel and meet new people. If you are outgoing and can work independently, this may be a great fit."
good,great place to work. has a lot of opportunities for advancement. The pay could be better for my current position. Most of the supervisors and managers are nice.
good,"fast paced environment, helping several store brand name customers with delinquent accounts .extremely competitive job ank but requires a lot of patience  and ability to be able to de-escalate tense situations with angry guest as well to come to best solution to help them."
good,"A great job with many benefits, unfortunately located in Westerville where cops have nothing better to do than ruin your day. If you don't have a license or have any license complications I'd recommend getting them resolved before starting because the police drive through the parking lots and scan all plates to see if anyone is driving unlicensed or is warranted."
good,Incoming calls on average of 75-100 per day and also took escalated calls regarding credit card eligibility and finance charges.  Spoke to Commercial card  holders about their authorized users and credit increases and applicable fees.
good,"I hate working in collections, but this is a great place to work in that field.  It was a fun environment and they are good to the employees.  They pay well and the bonus potential is good for those who perform.  I just personally hate the competitive nature of the job so it's not for me."
good,Great job to give insight in the banking/financial career field. Also allows you to learn a lot about credit and how important it is to maintain good credit.
good,"You are never bored. You are always given a complex challenge  to solve. So if you like to think about problems that are not as easy but also not hard, then this place is great for you."
good,I worked second shift. The calls were fast passed but the job was simple of educating customers on their credit card accounts. Its for different store credit cards.
good,"it was good money, it just got stressful and repetitive, it was great if you needed a paycheck, just not a lot of opportunity for advancement if you have a family and a fairly rigid schedule"
good,"Great first job, good benefits, really well organized training. Cafeteria with healthy options, roomy cubicles and no pressure for sales. Fixed schedule and good sick days or paid days off options."
good,Overall Alliance is a great company. It offered good benefits to its associates. I learned how to sharpen my Customer Service skills. I also developed patience while working with various customers. The hardest part of the job was the sudden changes and very little time to adjust to the changes.
good,Its very quick paced and if you work hard and do your job good there is a lot of opportunity to advance or be promoted quickly. Managers and supervisors are great and take there time to listen if you have questions or a problem.
good,"I have nothing to say concern an company that is better than most company available to  work for I relocated other than that I would still be assist to this company, I is a fair company over all "
good,"Fast paced calls, 42-52 calls per hour with 12 resolutions expected on customers past due accounts. A typical day included a 30 min. lunch and two 15 min. breaks. I learned to be even more patient with customs who seemed to be extremely stressed financially, and who found it difficult to communicate pleasantly with a debt collector. The Rio Rancho office had a friendly, nurturing atmosphere. The hardest part of the job was sitting all dang day in my chair. I would have preferred to stand at my computer. Most enjoyable part was the compensation for a days' hard work."
good,I liked being able to help people get matters cleared up get on with their lives.There many ways to work with the callers and would use any and all I could access to make the call have a good outcome for them.
good,"Sort ail from Incoming to Outgoing, go around office and pass out mail  Then moved Collections located clients and arrange a pay plan..  "
good,"Laid back environment, where we collected on delinquent accounts. Really good work life balance being you got to make your own schedule for the most part."
good,I enjoyed working here they were good to their employes. They also offered a very flexible work schedule. The work environment was nice with a good outdoor area for employees to take lunch and breaks.
good,Teammates became friends. With each of us working together it helped to lower stress on busy days. Great to know there is support and assistance if needed. Growth and development is pushed by supervisiors.
good,"On a day to day, enjoyed interacting with clients from out of state and getting an opportunity to travel.  I learned being in the marketing area and understanding clients needs.  The management team had a lot of great leaders and had great coworkers too.  The hardest part of the job was not having a backup in the event I would request vacation time.  The most enjoyable part is being able to travel, learn and continue growing within the company."
good,"Alliance Data enjoys a strong set of integrated HR systems that provide a neat array of tools to assist the needs of staff and management in their day-to-day functions.  These were the best I've seen, including salary & raise capability to online training classes, job evaluation, payroll and benefits, etc."
good,"great place to work, good benefits, and nice people. I have learned how to use different systems at work on the computer. I have learned so many different jobs and a lot of info about Alliance Data. I have also learned a lot about credit cards and how we finance them."
good,The work life balance is great.  Management has an open door policy that they stick too.  Great co-workers that help challenge and help you grow within the company.
good,It was great place to work but not enough Growth and Development
good,"Challenged by a hyper-growth curve, the company has changed from a conservative mode to rapid-firing 'sales' mode, with fast hiring and rapid client acquisition. As it continues to grow, strategic planning (5-year forecast) will become important and risk management will be even more important."
good,I would need to keep up on my e-mails for management on what we may be promoting at this time for a certain store.
good,Very Professional promotes within and helps to build professionalism
good,"Thing went down hill after the economy changed, people got fire very quickly over the little mistakes."
good,"answering lots of inbound calls with no break in between, took away bonuses, implemented an unfair point system consisting of compliance which is hard to avoid or manage due to not being able to appeal"
good,"You have to be ready to work when you apply here, they put you to work right away and it’s a lot to take in right away. Overall the experience is worth it and once to get it, you’re good."
good,Fun place to work with nice benefits package and caring friendly staff.  Goal oriented and fast pace with time to be involved in special projects  and community events.
good,I enjoyed my time at Alliance Data.  I began my career in 2013 as an intern and moved to various positions during my 6 and a half years with the company.  Work-life balance is unmatched.  Compensation was pretty good as well and benefits and PTO are a plus.  Unfortunately the company grew too fast over the years and I was impacted by a mass layoff that took place in October 2013; the layoff was solely due to role elimination and had nothing to do with performance.
good,I have been at Alliance Data for almost 6 months now. Training is needed and provided constantly. Company culture is one of the best I have experienced.
good,"I enjoyed working at AD.  The people are really friendly and professional. The company tries to incorporate fun with the job.  Depending on call volume, it can be a very intense job but I always felt supported."
good,"Was a good workplace and did a lot for their employees.  The culture was fantastic and I learned a great deal there.  Advancement opportunities are available, but the pay does not always match what you can get in the market."
good,The job itself was great decent company to work for just not enough training or proper structure to help develop the skills needed to actually perform the job essentials.
good,"You work hard and make reasonable attempts to get along with people, you will do well as can be expected. Some projects for new clients or new products are fast paced whereas stable accounts that are just daily operations are somewhat slow paced. The challenge is with most development jobs moving off shore at least for one of the subsidiaries within alliance data. Their financial services particularly if working for Alliance Data directly and not a subsidiary - is a great opportunity. The subsidiaries Epsilon/Conversant are better to be cautiously approached since some changes are happening (publicly available information at this point). It’s a big company with data management that you have never heard of but have a HUGE client base across finance, telecom, pharmaceutical and retail sectors."
good,"Alliance Data Services is a great company to work for.  The culture is one of a kind.  The collaboration between management and associates is very productive and supportive.  "
good,"Everybody worked together and helping one another, always lifting you up always making sure we are up to date on the latest computer skills. Changing constantly and fast pace."

good,"Great place to work if your're great with people and know to to deal with customers. Great pay, lots of perks and benefits. Awesome people! They try to balance work and life, but it can get drain you, if you let it."
good,Alliance Data is a great place to put your creativity and innovative spirit to work. Management is very supportive of new innovations and ways of doing things. You'll regularly be tasked for stretch roles and do things beyond the normal scope of your job.
good,"Alliance Data is a place where you can relax an enjoy everyday, with also the expectations to work hard an make sure the customers were taken care of."
good,A typical work day at alliance as a customer retention advocate consisted of making calls and assisting customers manage their accounts to keep them current. I learned about the inner workings of the credit card industry from the collection stand point. Management was fairly organized. The workplace culture was comfortable. The hardest part of the job was implementing an additional fee for processing payments. The most enjoyable part of the job were the benefits and opportunity for growth.
good,It is very difficult to balance life and work especially if you rank lower than others. Your hours required to work are all depending on your monthlly ranking. I had another job at one time but was unable to keep it because of the hours required.
good,"The culture is amazing and fun.  The people that have been there for a long time say they are open to change, but they really are not.  The managers need to stand by their words and be open to change, challenge the status quo and standup for their people."
good,"Great company!  You are in a fast- paced environment, stationary at desk, on a team and are monitored for quality, adherence, government regulations for all inbound calls.Good salary and benefits."

good,"Well established company, opportunities for relocation. Enjoyed co-workers."

good,"It was a great place to work, lately we have been having a lot of layoffs though which has made work security an issue. Overall I have loved it but just recently have been feeling not as secure."
good,"Alliance Data is different from other banks,  you don't have your own goal  everyone works from  a strategy  sheet which caused a lot of cheating. We were not allowed to call the customer back we had rely on the customer to call back."
good,Good company to work for and good people to work with. Learned what it takes to be a team player and a leader. Also learned the value in being involved in the community.
good,"A great place to work due to the culture that is created and employees work together for a common goal. Recent financial issues resulted in reduction of workforce. While it is easy to learn a lot, there is not a lot of opportunity to get to executive level (Director, VP, etc)."
good,Voted as one of the top companies to work in the Denver Metro area.  Encouraged employee work life balance and participated time and donation to many charities in the community.

good,"This job always kept you on your toes. On an average day you're taking up to 50-100 calls back to back, so it does get a tad bit overwhelming. The job in general and the pay in general are amazing."
good,Alliance was pretty good to me. The environment was friendly and the work was nice as well. I believe that I'd still be there if they had full-time positions available when I needed it.

The hourly pay is fairly low in most departments but you have the opportunity to make up for it in bonus.

You were rewarded with points and you could use your pints to buy gift cards, they always had fun themes going on for holidays, fun team meetings, advance in the company quick as long as you are willing to do your job.

Anthony Walk, March of dimes, just to name a few. A typical day at work consists of negotiating with customers regarding their account status for payment. Management has an open door policy, and most importantly they listen. The co-workers and I consider working at Alliance Data a place where you work with family. Each person cares about the other. The hardest part of this job would be keeping up with the ever growing business demands. Alliance Data is a ever growing company.

It is no wonder they are always voted one of the top Best Places to Work in New Mexico in the extra large business category. Please hire me back!
good,"My experience with alliance data was great, higher ups actually insist on pushing you forward and helping you grow in whatever area. A great benefit that is offered is you get about 2 hours a month just to explore a different position of your interest. If you're in customer care and are interested in collections, you just have to notify your supervisor and they'll make it happen for you. Another great thing is your supervisor meets up with you about once a week to see how you're doing and if you may require some additional training in (for example) late fee negotiations, survey reports, or hold/handle time. "
good,The Job is taking customer phone calls about their credit card bills. The calls can become monotonous &  frustrating when they are angry. The company and the managers try to offset this w/games & great benefits & community involvement opportunities.

good,Alliance data allows its associates to grow and develop their professional and skills. I have been working for alliance data for over a year and I can say that I enjoy working for the company.
good,"It is a great company , people a Alliance is always happy , and they have their hand out to assist you in any way "
good,WIsh upper  management was a bit more reachable as well as supervisors. Upper management never has the time to discussed any concerns and personal progress within the dept. Upper management does not follow  the proper procedures and there's no loyalty towards their employees. Very poor ethics with promises to justified their decisions.
good,I experienced limited training to exceed in a new department which consisted of only 3 days other than shadowing co-workers that were not always there
good,Hours worked should not have anything to do with a employee if they need time off to a death in there family . I feel they were unfair to me and I was A good employee

good,"I honestly don't have anything good or bad to say.  It wasn't bad working here.  I honestly didn't love it.  There was plenty of growth, just not in any direction I'm personally interested in."
good,A typical work day for me is very busy or steady I feel I learn something new everyday by interacting with many customers. The management is great laid back and fun they really care about the associates. Workplace culture has lots of diversity which I think is important the hardest part of my job is customer surveys and having energy to keep up with back to back calls. The most enjoyable is talking to new customers getting to know them on a 20 min call.
good,"the company was bought by a larger umbrella organizaiton and they laid off 35 consultants, because they weren't doing project work anymore. oh well...."
good,It's an enjoyable workplace. I would recommend it to someone who enjoys a competitive environment and flexible schedule. I didn't enjoy mandatory weekends.
good,I enjoyed it a lot at first. I loved my job and felt very secure. The company went through a huge reorg and now I no longer feel safe and protected. I prefer to feel comfortable in my work environment.
good,"one always looks forward to get to work, learn patience with customers."
good,"Great environment, larger than average salary, stupendous coworkers, opportunity for growth in a wide variety of areas.  Great leadership!"
good,"over all good company to work for, work life balance is good, benefits are good too, scheduling is sometimes inconsistent though"
good,Alliance Data was a fast paced environment that kept the job interesting and fun.  At this job time went by fast because it was fast paced.  Alliance we made sure that we all did what we could for each other and our customers.  The hardest part of the job was making sure to handle each customer with care and thoroughness even though it was so busy.  The enjoyable part of the job was knowing you have satisfied and made the customer happy.
good,I worked with ADS for my senior project. They weren't too stressful to work for and kept a reasonable schedule. Our supervisor worked closely with us to make sure the project was the best it could be and was always friendly.
good,It is a great company to work for and they provide excellent benefits and perks.  I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,The business was owned by family.  As the business grew they sold to another business out of another area.   Great place to work at.

good,I worked here to get through high school and college. I enjoyed the people
good,too much of a long wait for promotion.  they will have you doing as much as they can without the compensation included.  they do care about company culture
good,"Great cafeteria, healthy food costs very little. Clear expectations. If you are not meeting expectations after 6 months, it's best to seek another job in the company, otherwise a written notice will keep you stuck."
good,"great work life balance, company prides itself on global operations, however, growth opportunities better exist for individuals who work in localized offices where leadership is located."
good,"Typical day is coming in to work login on to your system view outlook e-mail for daily work list. Log on to phone system and make 21 calls hourly manual dial occasionally auto dial. "
good,"Very fun place to work but they should choose managers more carefully. Lots of prizes, games and time off as rewards and an enjoyable job if you get the right supervisor. Leadership can make or break your career."
good,"Alliance is growing in hyper grown mode.  With that being said, the organization is learning and they grow.  A typical day at work included managing a team up to 27 customer service and collections associates with focus on providing exceptional customer service and increasing revenue.  In addition, many administrative task needed completed daily, weekly and monthly including payroll, audits, escalation line, and many other tasks.  This is a very diverse organization with many career advancement opportunities.  The hardest part of my job was not being able to satisfy every customer in each situation but trying my hardest was always in my efforts and being open minded and optimistic helped.  The most enjoyable moments were seeing a new hire associate with no experience walk in nervous, me coaching them and giving them the confidence and skills they needed to be successful and seeing them shine and celebrating their success later.  I learned many things and I would say the most valuable thing I learned was to act like an owner with everything that I was responsible for and to make decisions as if I were the owner."
good,"account maintenance ,new accounts, business  accounts, authorization  ,helped  new associate  with their question on through assist line"
good,"Telephone contact inbound outbound calls. "

good,"You're plugged into a computer for 8 hours a day, via headset. But it wasn't hard work and it paid well. Company seemed to care about it's employees more than most companies now days."
good,I loved my 1st to sups but then my last was a girl I came in with who went on a complete power trip I was one of the top performers but she had a nasty way of speaking to you
good,Alliance was a great job. It is a call center that collects credit care debt. It was very fast placed and very stressful. The anxiety was too much for me and for my well-being I was forced to quit.
good,"Good place to work at."
good,"OVERALL, ALLIANCE IS A GREAT PLACE TO WORK .. the structure needs work, the cheating needs to stop.  and the staff is great, as long as you go along with them, cross them and you are out!!"
good,"Productive workplace, Management is not the best, the hours are not the best."
good,I feel this was a great company to work for and to the right individual the opportunities are endless. They are great at training and promoting. They invest a lot of effort in helping each person improve to achieve.
good,"What makes this company a very good one is the benefits, dental, medical, etc. And the fact that is a stable and perm job that you can count on having."
good,I was employed here several years ago. Great call center environment and opportunities for growth. A typical day for me consisted in providing great customer services for residential and commercial utility accounts.
good,A great growing major company that a lot of people don't know about. They really compensate their employees and lots of benefits that come in handy without a lot of hassle. Flexibility with schedules and time off.
good,I loved working at Alliance data and appreciate all the opportunities I received in my 17 years. Most of my managers were open to my input and invested in my development.
good,"not too busy on a typical day"
good,"The overall morals of the company are excellent. They are fun and motivating but tough when it comes to home and work balance. The managers are nice and considerate, the leads are fun. The scheduling is horrible. The attendance policy is horrible."
good,"One thing that always stood out to me when it comes to comparing companies to work for was that Alliance Data provided superior training and tools to get the job done successfully."
good,I loved my position and even though my position was eliminated and i was laid off. The calls can be difficult and attendance is strict  but manageable
good,"on a  typical day i call account holders and try to get them to pay there bill, document each and every call. work with supervisors to improve numbers"
good,People was great to work with and for. Gave prizes for good results. Would have stayed longer if they were more flixable with working around my kids sporting schedules. Good place to work.
good,"Alliance data was a good company to work for.  The benefits were great and the training was outstanding.  My supervisor worked with me directly, and at times there wasn't that much business to get through each day."
good,This was a more laid back environment and the goals were not obtainable at all. They did offer unlimited over time all the time. The hardest part of the job it hitting monthly goals and what ever you missed the goal for that month was added to your goal to the next month. The pay out was good if you can obtain the goals.
good,I love working for Alliance Data I just wish there were a way I could be a full-time student and also maintain my full-time job here. I tried... I dropped out.
good,Good place to grow and find out what your'e really made of. People here are inspiring and want to really help you grow. Culture is outstanding and want you to succeed.

good,Alliance Data is a great place to work. The environment is fun and easy going. There are many perks and the Company believes in giving back to the community!!!!!
good,it was fun some days and no the others the work life balance was off there days off where never together which makes it hard to do anything with family which also makes it hard to plan anything
good,Overall good place to work. Of course working for a call center can be tough dealing with people especially when it comes to their money. But I love working for Alliance Data.
good,"A typical day at work is very slow-paced and VERY competitive. Constant work with no downtime other than breaks. I adored the management, majority were always in reach to help if needed assistance.I learned quite a few skills, mainly negotiation based. Everyone around was always friendly and helpful including the other associates. Hardest part of the job is the competitiveness and inside of the competitiveness, it is almost like always fighting for your job as well as against the people you work with. I  loved how flexible the job was, they give you as the employee a lot of power and it is refreshing and helpful for work and personal balance."
good,"I love the work environment, it is a great place to work. The people are awesome, the extra activities they provide are great also. The benefit are amazing as well. I just wish they provide more options for personal life outside or work."

good,"If you can put up with some pretty hefty awful bad times, they will reward you greatly when the good times come back around."
good,Helping customers with their private label credit cards and also assisting my teammates with questions working the assist line answering calls from fellow employees with any questions they had about their calls.

good,"My experience with Alliance Data was good. I worked with a great group of peers, managers, and leaders. The work was hard but rewarding.I would recommend this company to anyone that is willing to put in the effort to get the job done."
good,"Flex scheduling and great work life balance company. Alliance Data has a lot of opportunity for growth and they like to hire from within the company, before they bring in someone from the outside."
good,Alliance Data is a great place to work. The benefits are good and the culture is positive. It is very easy to get comfortable and complacent there. I'd recommend.
good,"Love to work here. But had a opportunity to taste the way things go in ADS. It was just a proof of concept, so had nothing much crucial to put here. Would love to work here."
good,"I was a collector with responsibilities to collect medium balance accounts.  When I had health issues, the company worked with me."
good,"Typical day: Screening for interviews/background checks"
good,"It was okay. I liked it, but i was just looking to move up in the company a little faster than they were trying to let me"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of logging onto my phone and my accounts to contact customers to find a reasonable solution to the situation in which they were facing. Taking the time to listen and problem solving created a bond between the customer and the bank. The hardest part of my job was to get a customer to understand that we all have been in some sort of situation and that there is always a solution to the problem. Once the customer understands and works things out, it made me feel good knowing that I helped a person and helped clear their mind."
good,I made anywhere from $2000-$3000 every two weeks. Bonuses included. It's only stressful if you do collections and that's not what you're used to doing. I would still be there if I would've transferred to customer care. I don't know why I couldn't make up my mind. Now I regret leaving. But we all learn from our mistakes.
good,My time at alliance was great I just wished they had a office out here in Las Vegas.  The company overall was the best company I've ever worked for.  It was hard to leave
good,All positions are driven by performance metrics. Schedules are fixed but can be made flexible based on performance. Call volume is high and can be stressful.
good,"Supervised 15 customer service representatives daily."
good,"No complaints."
good,"Your review "
good,Management at this place is the worst and they lw6 customers get away with murder and you gota just kiss butt to keep your job ...netween fiance charge changes in polixy and tgere ridiculous late feepolicy omg work here and prepare to b stressed out daily and leadership dosent care
good,It is overall a great company with lots of benefits there is some room for advancement but you have to spot on and its very competitive. If they would've paid me more then I would've stayed but I have bachelors and the amount is just not enough especially considering that they are paying people who are bi-lingual more. Not fair
good,AllianceData allowed me the chances to grow and develop my skills and be promoted to leadership.  It can be challenging but anything good is not easy.
good,Great place to learn and grow. I enjoyed my job and advanced from hourly associate to spupervisor. The company offers many opportunities to learn and grow.

good,Absolutely awesome place to work! Great managers and over all culture! Supervisor is always willing to listen to employees and supportive with advancement within the compant.
good,"I loved working at alliance data, There was some things that needed to change in order for the culture to be better. There is a metric that is used to evaluate your performance which is called Voice. Voice is the way the customer see the interaction with you. this is not a far metric  because you can be outstanding on the phone but if the customer waited on the line to long that could affect your score."
good,"Work was FUN!"
good,"great place to work, with awesome benefits. the only downside is the nature of the job itself: customer service. I hate the job description, but love the company. they really invest in people and give back to the community."
good,A great place to work with great people around you!!! The organization has good benefits & flexible when it comes to their employees.
good,There are a lot of changes going on there which makes it easy to get pushed out the door.
good,"Great place to work, awesome company, great employee recognition, community involvement, people. Not great scheduling options or opportunity to change schedule as promised."
good,"Alliance Data Systems is a really great place to work and the company is really involved in community outreach. A lot of companies say that they are involved in the community but, Alliance really does practice what they preach. I got the opportunity to organize food donations from a local church for the local food bank and painted playground equipment at a local government-subsidized apartment complex."
good,"Spent most of day making out going calls on dialer and physical dialing numbers. It takes team work to have the company succeed. Management for the most part listened and tried to correct problems. The coworkers were very cooperative, the hardest part of the job was getting incoming calls. The most enjoyable part was setting work schedule for myself."
good,"Alliance is a great job. They have flexible schedules, great hours to offer, and wonderful bonuses. I collected on retail, and yes the people actually pay."
good,"Set your own schedule"
good,You can’t work anywhere doing the same job making this kind of money.  Only problem is a very stressful job.  They offer work life balance but it’s hard when the job Constantly requires your attention.  Even when your not working your always thinking about the job
good,Working at Alliance Data was one of my favorite places to work. If you have the chance to get into Centralized Processing it would be a great opportunity.
good,Everything you will need to know will be located on the website about the position and if u no someone looking for work refer them so u can get paid..
good,Alliance data is a great company to work for and great benefits with good pay. The supervisors was very helpful and made sure you had all the items to do your job successfully
good,"Great place to work, great management. Corporate has an incredible culture and really makes coming to work enjoyable. Always activities and food around the office."
good,Would still be there if they had not sold my division out to Fujitsu. Really enjoyed the work and all the folks that worked at Alliance Data. Great place to work and to achieve goals.
good,I worked at Alliance Data from 2014-2018. It was a great place and atmosphere.  I became disabled having to leave my job. I was very upset I had to leave. The staff at Alliance Data are amazing and very professional. You get the training you need to be successful. They don't just train you and say go get them. They help you when it's time to be on the floor alone.
good,Management is not the best... schedule flexible and is a plus... pro and vacation time is very nice ...It all depends on who you work under... recently a lot of changes  as far as hours cut  and no overtime
good,taking inb ound calls for ayments collecting money entering information into the c omputer and also faxing information and filing and faxig the information over to the customer's.
good,"Working there was a grate opportunity, the pay was grate, the healthcare was phenomenal. the work environment was grate as well. If you are looking for a grate place to with good benefits then look no further. I challenge you to find better employment."
good,Unique.  Very catering to average associate.  Management philosophy based on creating positive environment for asssociates.  Strong theme on community giving back
good,"Alliance was a great 0lace to work as long as you don't kind selling fairly misleading products to people who are not interested. Being forced to offer, rebut, and essentially hound people to sign up for offers was without a doubt the worst part of the job. Virtually everything else was great. Good, supportive managers, performance incentives, frequent gifts of company logoed products, and good benefits. Overall, I had a great experience there, apart from the dreaded sales aspect."
good,"It’s an excellent environment the management team is great they treat you like family."
good,"Alliance Data is a great company to work for if you are searching for career for growth and development."
good,Technical issue resulted in my dismissal.   Without the ability to appeal.  Left me no recourse.  Company was great to work for but due to computer compatibility.   a coding error occurred.
good,Another top agency to work for in the Columbus area. The benefits offered to their employees are some of the best benefits I have ever received from an employer.
good,Alliance is a great place to work. Every time i come into work i am greeted by all my co-workers and friends i with with. It makes you feel really good to receive such a warm welcome. I have learned that Alliance offers Career advancement and future goals. I love the diversity of the environment of the cultures of people i work with. I learn so much from who my co-workers are and how they ware raised and different traditions. The hard part sometimes is not getting enough sleep to be more productive but I'm learning how to conquer that:).. I must say that I turly enjoy working at Alliance Data Systems.
good,They where outsourced to India and only other location was Columbus which may be closed as well.  I loved working there and it was very easy to meet goals.
good,The job is very stressful but the company does go out of its way to do things for its employees. You also need to be very self motivating for the very slow days.
good,"It was hard you have to multi task, answer phone calls process mail and be able to use multiple screens at the same time. People overall was helpful when you needed. No time to chit chat to the person in the next cubicle. Do you job and go home."
good,"Call centers can be a dreary or difficult place to work but Alliance Data tries to make up for it by giving fantastic benefits, keeping an upbeat environment, and genuinely taking care of its employees. Very very diverse and a wonderful place for women to work. The hardest part is remembering and all the protocols and dealing with certain more challenging callers."
good,this is a big company but gives you a very friendly family environment bonuses are awesome and supervisors and bosses take the time of day to make you productive as possible great for entry level collectors
good,"This company has the best work environment. Everyone is so positive and upbeat. People that you don't know will say hi to you. You get great benefits after working there for 30 days. You get plenty of PTO, monthly bonuses, and ability to leave early without pay if it has been slow. You get paid training that last 4 weeks."
good,This was y first job out of college and although the pay and benefits were just mediocre the overall experience of the environment was excellent. Was a great place to start a career or restart a career.
good,Great place to work it is a friendly environment. It is totally up to you to decide how fast you want to move up within the company.

good,I really enjoyed working for Alliance Data. I loved coming into working and working with the team members that I had. Working at Alliance Data allowed me to realize so much about myself in making me a better person.

good,"Fantastic work environment friendly and easy going management staff. Great benefits, numerous opportunity for advancement within the company overall great place to work."
good,"Many smart people work here"
good,I enjoyed my employment with Alliance Data. How ever I think sometimes management does not always make the right decision.
good,"Alliance Data is great place work.  They work hard to keep the company moving forward and take the time to recognize that the company would not function without their employees.  All employees are compensated well for the work they provide month-to-month.  The environment is always friendly and upbeat.  They often have department wide activities to keep the staff motivated through the day, week, and months."
good,I would recommend this to anyone who is just starting out for a new career of customer service .
good,Great culture. They really care about their employees. Enjoy coming into work everyday. 
good,Very busy call center handling customers credit accounts. Nice because every call can be different.
good,It was the best career I ever had. They truly care about each and every one of us. I had to leave because of medical reasons. I wish I was still there.
good,Alliance Data is truly a great place to work. Their giving culture is not only extended to their employees but the community as well. The also truly value and appreciate their customers.
good,"I work in New Accounts at alliance data, it is one of the best jobs I've had. I can actually say I love my job. I know other jobs at alliance can be stressful like any other job but new accounts rarely gets stressful. I hope to stay here for a long time!"
good,A good place for a career with great compensation. Very stressful talking to customers behind on payments and trying to rank to not ultimately be fired
good,"I truly love this place,  if it wasnt for me moving I would want to retire here. Not only is the pay incredible, but there's almost one month of PTO a year, matched 401k up to 5%, annual bonuses, great management and growing opportunities. Something I was shooting for but never got to pursue was the work at home opportunity.  If you're looking for a great company to work for, look no further."
good,"Alliance Data Systems is a GREAT Company there training is awesome & they are committed to training associates to the best they can be. Commission is good but you have to be HUNGRY to go after it, despite what the customer is stating to you or her circumstances. But they have the means to verify what she is saying is true w/ a glance @ her actual circumstances for 5/6 months past due accounts"
good,"I loved my job in terms of the customer servicing aspect, but it can become challenging to meet the required sales of the third party initiated sales if you are not personally adept to being aggressive with your approach. Its very competitive among employees because everyone in your department can see your stats but overall its a great company to work for with many incentatives and ability to land overtime"
good,"You can make it your own, you are in charge of your destiny. Plenty of advancement, training, diverse, friendly, lots of fun activity and chances to win things from the clients we serve, Victoria Secrets being our biggest client. Always adding more clients, definitely one of the top 5 places to work. It is fast paced and you must comply with call quality to advance but incentives and the pay is well worth it. Overtime is ample during peak season. The atmosphere is great and welcoming.There is always someone ready and willing to help if needed."
good,"Alliance Data has been an exciting place to start my career! I've learned a lot about the industry, basic retail skills, and have met wonderful mentors."

good,"This company is amazing. They actually care for their employees. If you're looking to do collections, this company pays the most in Utah. They actually have programs and things to HELP you get a raise! I've had many jobs and this is the only place that gets 5 stars!"
good,"We have a completely new building here in Draper UT that just barely opened last month, and it is awsome! Since this company is new to UT there is going to be a lot of potential for advancement, and many growth oppertunities.

Most enjoyable part is helping the customer at the end of the day. Being able to help your co-workers. Always coming together as a team."
good,"A normal day would be incoming and/or outgoing calls regarding past due bills. Doing this role I learned that circumstances change per person. This company has a great workplace culture. The hardest part of this job is getting people to pay their past due bill, and the most enjoyable part was receiving your bonus incentive each month for collecting as much money as you could. The CEO is an amazing person! He actually takes time out of his hectic schedule once a year to visit the call center!"

I really did like every manager that worked there. Being confined to a desk all day gets challenging after awhile. One of the biggest perks is the ability to earn up to $800 per month just by adhering to your overall schedule and receiving great customer feedback.

good,"Easy set scheduled work place. Many opportunities to learn and grow within the company. With a warm open door policy it makes it easier to get to know and understand your strengths and weaknesses to help yourself become a better representative with the company.

Rather working in collections or custom care timing is everything, but with help and support of those around me as well as my manger that soon became one of my strengths."
good,It paid very well. Came with Great benefits and nice schedules. I liked the extent of their training program. They also have a really nice cafeteria.

It is a fast growing environment so the expectation of steady forward movement is ever present.  That's a good thing and it is done professionally."

I learned a lot about how to use computer systems linked to phones to better perform operations and was the first job that I felt I could truly assert my strengths. A typical day was high call volume trying to contact customers who had fallen behind on the bill and trying to retain them as members of our company. Management was great and always showed me when their were opportunites to be worked on. They also strive to bring you up to standards to make extra incentives. The hardest part of the job was the list of litigation and the constant change of work habits. It was enjoyable to assist customers and feel appreciated for the assistance.

The management team supports you and helps you be able to do your job exceptionally.  The workplace culture is giving you tools to be successful at your job while having fun.  The hardest part of the job is when you deal with an upset customer but employees are taught ways to deescalate the situation so the employee is never alone.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you build with your peers and the activities you do with your team.
good,"To this day, I wish I still worked for Alliance Data Systems. Being young and foolish, I thought I could find a better job. And while I've found more productive ones, Alliance was where I learned what a paycheck meant. I was helping people with their problems using United Satellite Service Broadcasting's billing system. And every night, I worked to turn every call I got, into the last call they'd need to make. It was a fun office, though there were some management issues at times. I miss Alliance and hope one day, to work with them again."

I enjoyed managing my team, even though there are many obstacles that could typical happened in a day such as the AVAYA Dialer system going down, communicating to the sites the work a rounds by setting up bridge calls to communicate with the help desk while also informing management from the Operation Leads, Supervisors,Managers, Directors, and the VP of the status of the issues.

good,"Great place to work. I did recovery for about 10 years, got sick and had to leave but would like to come back. No other collection agency 3rd or 1st party pays as much hourly and would never compete with their commission monthly bonus. They have flex schedule meaning you make your own schedule anywhere between Sunday-Saturday. PTO is the best I have ever seen and you get lots of it. They even have so many hours that they'll pay for daycare for you and if you do not have kids you can give those hours away. Advancement is easy and great. The only thing I could say that would scare some people is that the Recovery Dept is very very competitive so If you do not have a collections background be prepaid to work harder than you ever have because the collectors there are hungry. Really nothing bad to say about the company. Great Place To Work!"

You are a person and part of a family.  I was shocked at some of the unfavorable reviews; I think that the employees were just not doing their job or something.   You re recognized, celebrated and rewarded for your work. As long as you show up to work, the possibilities are endless.  The CEO comes to the site and knows people by their name!  I would never leave this job, it would be hard to find any company that does as much for their employees and their communities like Alliance.  They even pay for me to go to the gym and to attend all sorts of classes onsite that have nothing to to with my job. I LOVE THIS COMPANY!"

When I am off for my three day weekend, I get plenty of uninterrupted family time. Through my work, I now have full health, dental, vision, hearing, disability, life insurance for me and my family each, plus car and home insurance. Even better, you start off with 2 weeks PTO, and 6 months later, another 2 weeks PTO. Amazing! They trained me in everything they wish of me to do and have trust in me and treat me with respect.

good,"This is a great company to work for. If you get the chance to work there take it, you won't regret it. Right from the start they make you feel welcome, and will do everything they can to make sure you are comfortable, and successful! I unfortunately had a very serious family  issue come up during my employment with Alliance Data, while I was still in nesting, and they were so great at working with me to help through a very dark time, I feel they went above and beyond for me, and I had only been there shortly over a month. they do not lie, when they say it's a family environment there. Anyway as fate would have it, this issue forced me to relocate to another state. Sadly I had to resign, the parting was amicable, and I am fully eligible for rehire! I honestly was stunned at the level of support I received from Alliance, and the compassion and empathy they showed to me. When ever I get back to Colorado, I can assure you, I will be going back there. "

Empathy is what's important in this role and organization. Anyone can do it why not you."

good,"Great supervisor encouragement. Everyone is always helpful and I mean everyone. The company is always presenting opportunities to their employees to get more money WHILE GETTING MONEY! It's primarily about how hard you are willing to work to be the best. Yes, the job is competitive but we don't just compete against each other but we encourage each other as well.

I learn new skills every day by listen to the customers as well as our team gatherings. Alliance Data was a multi culture company. The hardest part of my job was to get alone with the customers needs and wants. When our team will have fun time, coming up with new ideas, and when we decorated for our goals."

good,"Innovation, collaboration, demonstrated success by building and working with teams to partner on various projects. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is actually going to work and interacting with the people there. Every one is very polite and friendly. Even work meetings (which usually drag and are very boring) were informative but very fun and entertaining. They really try there best to make sure the work environment is energized and stress free. The hardest part of the job is not being drained by the constant call flow which at times can be full of unhappy customers  or the occasional irate customer and just remembering that every interaction is different and the customer is expecting that you make them happy.
good,GREAT benefits and advancement opportunities however you do WORK hard for each one of them. Excellent training and management environment that is conducive to success.

good,I would recommend Alliance Data to anyone who is looking to work for a company who appreciates its employees and highly encourages growth and development. I have worked at two Alliance locations and my experience has been the same at both. The company values its family and community and the employees feel appreciated by their leaders. The leaders push their employees to focus on their growth and development so they have the opportunity to try new positions and reach their full potential while with the organization. The only reason I left the company is because my fiance' and I relocated to a different state due to his job and Alliance does not have any offices close to where we will be living.
good,"An excellence place to work. I loved the hours, environment, management was great.  I would recommend this Company to anyone. If you do your job then no problems."

good,"Work life balance is encouraged.  Everyone smiles there.  Good salary or wages and potential bonuses.  Never have had a headache working here.  The executive staff are just as friendly, understanding, and just as human as the rest of us."
good,"A typical work day at Alliance Data was a very fast paced and professional, but an exciting, happy place to be. What I learned being employed with this company is, relationships positively maintained in the work environment and given the empowerment to make the best decision you feel necessary for the customer without a higher authority's approval, definitely gives you a whole different perspective on something that was just supposed to be a job. It was a good feeling to want to be in that building everyday and to love every aspect of your job, and being given those options and feelings makes you want a lifetime placement with a company just like this one regardless of where you go. Management was by far the best Part of this company. They do their best to make you feel well informed and fully capable of being the best you can be at your job, while successfully being the best mentor an individual can ask for. I rarely had a tough time with any part of my job, but when i did, it was only when I wasn't able to accomplish the goal I had set for my customer, due to an extreme and irate situation, or a duty asked by our customer that is unable to be met by the company. But the most enjoyable part of working for Alliance Data was working with the Customer's themselves. To de-escalate any situation and make each and every one of them happy with our products and services after an altercation, was a good feeling. Turning every negative into a positive call by call was a rewarding feeling at the end of each day."

Excellent location, very professional, cares about their employees, room for growth. I enjoyed creating rapport with customers; many of them touched my heart through our conversations."
good,"a typical day included pulling up several different emails and getting caught up to speed with new system changes daily. ive learn how to become a fast learning and how to multi task on several different cpu screens. My coworkers were such a pleasure to work with , when i didnt know or was unsure they guided me in the right direction. the hardest part of the job for me was ultimately leaving the company. the enjoyable part was the staff the managers the supervisors the whole management team wanted everyone to be the best so they gave us the tools to do so."

good,"On calls all day"
good,"best company i have ever worked for. great people, great perks!!"
good,This is a good place to start if you are new to the call center customer service. The only problem I had with this job is that the shifts are not convenient. You basically there all day long and they do not like to give people first shift. This is not good for parents who have young children they need to be at home with or if you do not have a daycare that is open late enough for this job. I feel they need to switch their shifts so you can start morning and leave around 5pm and the next shift start at 5pm.
good,"I would get to work early , boot up my computer and start to see what accounts I needed to work on or call people to get them to make a payment, sometimes I would have customers leave messages on my voicemail to see if they could get a credit increase on there account. check with my supervisor to see what else I needed to do on my shift in our department."

Management was awesome, co-workers were as well. Hardest part was nothing, everyone helps everyone. Most enjoyable part was gas cards and bonus money."
good,Alliance Data's culture is noticeable the minute you walk through the doors. After working at a major bank for 7 years i've switched to Alliance Data; the difference in culture and growth opportunities is so different I honestly should have switched a long time ago.

For the year that i have been with Alliance Data i have learned a tremendous amount of information including approving retail credit cards, credit bureau disputes, and also web responses. Customer Service has always been a skill that i have had working at McDonalds that will carry with me wherever i decide to work. Managenent and my co-workers are all a great deal of help with any questions or concerns i may have. Currently there is nothing hard about my current position, but what is most enjoyable would be working with customers among our every day lives giving them customer service that they would remember as a positive experience."
good,"Alliance Data is the greatest company that I ever had the enjoyment of working for. Facilities maintenance was a full days job. We covered the building on any and everything from top to bottom, front to back, side to side, inside and out. I learned some HTVAC, electrical, and some working with other people and sharing the work load. My co-workers were the best I ever worked with. The hardest part of my day was shoveling the snow and ice before the other employees got to work. Everyday at Alliance Data was a good day, because the management made sure that it was. They tried to do as much or more for me, and everyone else, as what we did for them. My manager, and Vice-President of the department and division, took our group stripper fishing every year, and waited on us like we were special. The mosy enjoyable part was that everyone worked together for betterment of the company, and for oueselves."

good,Account Specialist/Collection Agent
good,"This company is a great place to start. No one say, ""When I grow up I want to be a bill collector"". This company has a lot of avantages if you have the personailty for this type of business. I learned that people come up with the most out landish stories to keep from paying their bills. The hardest part of the job is not to take it personal. The most enjoyable was the bounces, and the flex work schedule."
