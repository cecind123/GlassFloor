rating,review
bad,"The hardest part about this job is its a hostile work environment."
bad,They treat people bad and yell at you and if you don't fit in thier crowd they get rid of you no chance of moving up and don't care about helping the get mad at u for them calling u and taking thier overtime
bad,Got laid off immediately after training. Management is awful and ruin the great job completely. It does suck staying in a hotel but that isnt the worse part.
bad,Look up precision railroading. It is a culture of attacking the workers and cutting corners trying to get people killed to make an extra penny. The railroad management is evil on a biblical level
bad,"Not worth the time. The company is desperately hire people because they are leaving faster then they can replace. If your a new hire expect to be furloughed for the first few winter's, or not have any sonority to mark up to a job."
bad,"Stay far, far away! Only looking to line their pockets and employees be damd! Oh you left a good job to come work here, done with training, out on the street you go!"
bad,No family life they are a modern day harassment company they hate there employees  seven day 365 days a year work environment they over hire then furlough u no job security
bad,"no home life, live on a locomotive, always on call never know when you going to work. big service unit to work in. always looking over your shoulder for a manager"
bad,"They will lay you off frequently which is to be expected.  They will not tell you this until after you have quit your previous job and went through training with them.  They will NOT stick to their agreements and will not pay your time claims.  They will try to make you violate FRA regulations, They will fire you if you do not abide by their rules/FRA regulations at the same time.  They want to get rid of the conductor position and push for 1 man crew positions.  They do not care about anyone's safety if it helps them meet velocity and production numbers."
bad,"Very unsafe  , no cares for the over all public or employees . Not what they used to be and continued to decrease the overall value of people . Not a safe company."
bad,Do not come work for this company. You will not be treated well and your position is not secure. Most people come here with full intention of getting full retirement after 30 years only to be laid off. The rail instructed only cares about shareholders
bad,"Management and union are working together to eliminate union workers and hire contractors to do all work. Benefits now cost employees and will retroactively charge for even unused insurance from labor agreement raises. This is the same illegal behavior that created the need for unions in the first place. Sad how corrupt the union has become, always siding with the company and never with the union employees  employees"
bad,Don't work here. They hire you just to furlough you. Waste of time. Don't leave your job for this place. Started working there may of 2018. After training and testing finally got on my own in August. By December was furloughed. Got called back to work at the end of March of 2019. Worked for three months. By July was furloughed again. Smh....
bad,"By far the worst company to work for. They are greedy, they don’t care about the employees. The union is week,and they just keep taking away from the employees. I actually think that Union Pacific is paying off the union’s. Don’t go to work for this place! Biggest 5 year mistake of my life!"
bad,"I had a career at Union Pacific and enjoyed my job. I went above and beyond as a salary employee continually working beyond my scheduled hours to meet the company's goals and make my manager look amazing. I planned to retire from the company, BUT was blindsided October 23, 2018, by the first round of lay-offs. I was at the grocery store when upper management called to notify me of the Unified 2020 Plan and that my job had been abolished. Hard work does NOT pay off. In reality, my managers job was abolished and she was given my position. Several employees who were laid off had their managers move into their roles. We felt so back-stabbed that our mangers took our jobs when it was their job that was actually abolished."
bad,It is a good job when they need you. But because of recent government and economic changes they will soon be cutting there work force almost by half..
bad,"Don’t care about there employees, your just a number and they hire and fire you in a heart beat. They put all these rules and then at there will they look the other way. You can’t ever actually work where u want to work because they will hire people to work there so your seniority doesn’t mean squat. Many of us have to drive 100 miles to get to work because we can’t afford to work near the work location"
bad,"Don't lose your family over this""job"" because they'll dump you in a toilet if they could....it looks good and appealing! I've seen families fall apart,women leave husbands,men end up with other women,people relocate for absolutely NOTHING costing thousands and then laid off. Don't DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!! WAL-MART WILL TREAT YOU BETTER!!! After all...they just cut off a WHOLE TOWNS JOB!"
bad,"Avoid this place! Worst place I've ever worked. Managers are nothing but thieves and liars. Greed is what drives this company,nothing else. No job security either."
bad,"Nothing needs to be said here but Stay Away and be thankful that reviews like these help you make an educated decision, if railroading is a job that youre passionate about then please check on the other class 1 railroads before even thinking about applying to UP because as soon as youre out of training you will more than likely be jobless so dont waste your time... this is a public service announcement."
bad,Your safety is a last priority. All they care about is shareholders. Zero work life balance. Management is always looking to advance their career by ending yours.
bad,This was once a great company to work for until they started precision railroad. Then turned on their employees to only show care for their investors and Wall Street instead of the hard working people who made this a once great company.
bad,Very poor upper management! All they care about their pockets and do not care about the little people. They will close an entire shop which will cause people to get laid off and ruin people’s livelihood and won’t think twice about it.
bad,"This company does not care about their employees, their customers, or the community. The work environment is extremely negative with a very poor relationship between employees and management. On call 24/7 with very minimal time at home."
bad,Getting worse. Hedge funders ruining an ok job that every year gets worse.. health benefits getting worse year to year .. 200 jobs cut for stock holder greed
bad,"Been here for several years. A hard working employee that never lays off, and yet I am currently on ‘partial furlough’, because ‘business is slow’. Ridiculous cuts, poor management and absolutely NO job security. Payroll will over deduct or not pay correctly at least once a month. And it is a fight to get anything corrected. Lots of promises made when they hire you, but very little follow through."
bad,It was a fun job while it lasted. There is no job security here. The managers will find anything to try and coach you on it. Employees on their probation period have to walk on eggshells because of how managers watch them.
bad,"Don't do it, they hire to fire you. The SMART union is weak and doesn't look after their brothers unless your all buddy buddy with the local chair. "
bad,"Company does not care about work life balance, employees are only seen as a number. Well paid jobs with lots of sacrifices. From ground level to management, it is all the same"
bad,"Company is run by investors basically. They do not care one bit about your job and future. You can have five years seniority and still be furloughed. We are absolutely disposable to them. They preach about safety, but it couldn’t be further from the truth. Don’t waste your time with this trash railroad."
bad,"Management is horrible! Worst company I’ve ever worked for! They will do anything to find something against you. All scare tactics. Go anywhere else, use any other transportation company besides UP."
bad,"Oh where to begin. When I first hired out I loved coming to work that lasted for about four years. As their was a constant change in management for the Chicago service unit and clearly became a place where you where constantly harassed about the most petty things that you could imagine. From closing a door making sure you face the door as you close it. To walking like duck because the walkways hadn’t been properly salted and it is extremely important not to get hurt at work. I came to work each and everyday and performed my job to the best of my abilities each and everyday. Going to work wondering if today will be the day I get fired that’s not a good feeling. The year 2016 they came out with this plan call G-55 it was designed to reduce the work force by 55% to achieve this goal they would lay-off, fire, forced retirement, and consolidating yards. This is just to make sure that shareholders received there millions in bonuses and that they don’t record a loss. You say what about the employees in transportation and there families they would say seniority rules they crunched the numbers and this what they came up with. Instead creating a better business model where you take care of each and every customer no matter the size or quantity that they ship, they puff out their chest and say hey we are Union Pacific Railroad we are #1. They are #1 for furloughing employees so that they don’t record a loss it’s all about the shareholders they don’t even offer employees profit sharing and incentive that would help grow. The company and incentive that would have made it better place for"
bad,Terrible place to work. Went through a shop closure and a mass furlough. Union Pacific doesn’t care about it’s employees or their families all they care about is profits. After 8 years I was furloughed because of their new business goals.
bad,"They love to hire then furlough you immediately, then bring you back later and abolish your job. Feel like a pinball. ................................."
bad,"The corporate philosophy is all BS. They only pay lip service to having an ""proud and engaged workforce"". They dont care at all. When we asked a high level corporate goon about management giving recognition to their employees for good work, he said, ""recognize yourself"". They also do not believe in increasing, or evening acknowledging morale. They say it's a personal matter. The corporate environment is toxic, and the management isn't much better."
bad,"When it comes to management, the left had didn't know what the right hands was doing. There was a knee jerk reaction for everything. Micro management at its best. Over safety with mgrs hiding in the bushes trying to catch someone doing something wrong. They could care less about performing any work as long as you didn't break any ""rules""."
bad,not a good family job.  you are on call all the time and they don't care about your family life one bit.  you never get to sleep and nothing is good enough for the bosses to be happy.
bad,Constantly worried about your job.  They are doing layoffs constantly with no updates.  Its just a surprise and embarrassment.  The culture has changed so drastically and its an unhealthy work environment.  I used to love working there.
bad,"First and foremost the hiring incentive is nothing but a scam/con. UP has no intentions in keeping you employed long enough to collect the entire incentive. The incentive is dispersed in 3 payments over a period of almost and up to 2 years from hire on date. Each and everyday after hire on management looks for the pettiest ways of firing you to prevent paying the remaining amount. In all of my years of working I have never seen more hatred and distrust between management and non-management than at Union Pacific. Union is VERY weak and tends to side with management, reps are more concerned in their own advancement with in the company than doing what is right for the employee. BEWARE!!!!"
bad,They suck really bad and the position of the sand and I will be able to make sure you have the right email address is well and I can get you a happy birthday and happy father's day
bad,"This is a sinking company ! "
bad,"This company is the worst company in the world to work for. I managed to stay for twelve years. It was a great day when I left and have never looked back. Their management is the worst. It is a horrible work environment. In Roseville they have cut employee positions regularly, depending on work needs and demand. They escorted managers off the premises routinely. They treat employees like a number in a very hostile work environment. There is no job satisfaction, they care little about your family life and expect you to work on holidays and Christmas."
bad,"Working for Union Pacific is great if you like being bull-whipped. managers have a quota to fire people per month, so they hide in the weeds with binoculars trying to find you doing something against the rules.  God forbid you get injured, they will fire you.  I have seen people hurt badly and to scared to turn it in for fear of losing their job.  they fire you for breaking a rule but often tell you to do something against the rules.  It's all good as long as it helps them.  It is a horrible place to work, long hours away from family, holidays missed, birthdays missed, everything missed, they do not care.  Think hard before hiring, if you're married you will get divorced, if you're not you never will be.  Home is where ever UP tells you.  So pack your bags.  Managers are so dumb, you know the ones that fire you by quota.  Most of them got there jobs by being injured and accepting a management position and money for not suing them  Now with trump in office I'm sure the railroad can get away with whatever they want to.  And believe me, it won't be good for the employee."
bad,"I don't knowv where the 5 star ratings are coming from, probably upper management trying to make this company look better than it truly is. This company hates their employees and micro manages with 5 directors per 2 workers. The insurance sucks for nonagreement workers, they took away pensions for new hires, they don't train you and set you up to fail. It's a no win situation at this place. Save yourself the heartache and stress and go find a company that will appreciate your hard work."
bad,Management has no dignity they treat their employees like dogs and always trying to find a way to fire you. Management will do or say anything to cover their butt. Pulled from service for 8 months for talking about white coller crimes not punished. Just an excuse to get rid of you.
bad,managers actually hide in the bushes and fly drones to spy on you to see if they can write you up and suspend you because they are required to find a certain number a failures every month ……..
bad,"Absolutely horrible place to work! Old, worn out equipment. Managers nit-picking their interpretation of the over bearing rules to pad either their ego or advancement agenda,  unsure which. Safety is #1 priority, right after production at all cost! Over-bearing rules written to minimize lawsuit judgments rather than to protect employees.  I could literally go on for days. Just do yourself a favor and buy stocks as the shareholders and personal bonuses are the only concern of management and higher ups. P.S. Don't even think about a home/family life!"
bad,If you want to have a home life don't go to work for this company. you are on call 24hrs a day and if you miss a call you are subject to termination. the pay isn't bad but its not worth the stress
bad,"Hustle and bustle everyday. Terrible environment for working mothers.  Low ethics and morals amongst senior management.  Long working hours, no quality of life"
bad,Pathetic employee care. Own personnel' feelings and emotions are what governs your suecess. A severe amount of racism and veteran discrimination across the board.
bad,"Sorry company, doesn't care about the safety procedures or contracts, a do it or else atmosphere, they intimidate and harass every day. The buildings you go to work in are full of asbestos, the engines are nasty the out of town hotels are nasty, no support from Human resources and as they often quote be glad you got a job"
bad,"Company really does not care about employees or employee advancement.  Terrible job.  Also, there is absolutely no scheduled time off, and 90 percent to transportation jobs you are on call 24/7."
bad,"Over hired, furloughed / laid off, nearly on the spot.  I mean, I understand the oil industry dropped out, but that doesn't mean you get rid of hundreds of workers."
bad,"Great if you like to work,  but there is to much politics and egos.  Everyone tries to get one and other in trouble to move up.  And your never home"
bad,"Company is stable (founded in 1862), has competitive pay, excellent retirement, and room for advancement. Rigid workplace culture (it is still a railroad after all) but that being said good place to work with great people. Terrible vacation, especially for new hires."
bad,long hours working and not home often. the management was hard to contact if you need help and the hardest part of the job is being away from home non stop
bad,Very poor management and supervision. Very dangerous decisions made like its nothing. People in positions that have no business there. My fault for not stepping up and going into the position.
bad,"The idea of senior employees (20 plus years) are absolutely not taken into consideration. If you offer suggestions on how to work safer, or more efficiently such as needing locomotives that can actually stop when you apply the breaks, or complain about the leaking oil, or even leaking gas from locomotives (Nov, 2019), you are told to use the unsafe equipment or you will be terminated for insubordination.  "
bad,"After 5 years of service within the company I still lack the feeling of security in my employment. There is no way to schedule your life around the work when you don't know when you'll be called or worse yet when you'll be cut off. The company boasts billion dollar profits year over year but, they toy with the lives of the men and women who actually perform the work via furloughs."
bad,WORST company ever to work for. They look at their employees as a number and try there best to fire you after training you. Unless if you have 15 years seniority then you better have a side job to supplement your income. If you enjoy time with your family this job isn’t for you. Management sucks!!!!!! Especially the big dogs in Omaha who love cutting jobs. Run!!!! Do not apply!!!!
bad,"If the company allowed me to do my and not harrassed me, I would still be working,  I Retired early!! Safety is not an issue any longer,  we used to talk Safety every day, not no more!!!! Management is the worst,  could care less about employees!!!!"
bad,Union Pacific is the epitome of corporate greed.  Every year they brag of record breaking profits but it is not from being more competitive.  Over the last two years profits are up strictly from down sizing and cutting man power.  They are currently negotiating to remove the conductor from all freight trains.  Safety has become a low priority to upper management.
bad,"Run!!! Don’t even think about working there. Horrible company, horrible managers and no reguard for employees. Lowest morale in a work environment I have ever seen  CEO is an idiot!"
bad,"Very bad for Retired Veterans. Union doesn't cover you, even though you pay dues. The overall company is very ""Good Ole Boy"". They don't look at your qualifications for advancement only if you are in good with the bosses."
bad,I been 6 years and still don't know if I have a job tomorrow. They will hire anyone so you can't trust that anyone knows what they are doing. 24 7 on call
bad,The place is a mess.  Management is incompetent and operates on the “buddy system.”  The employees work hard but the culture is demoralizing.  Mechanical management makes up rules and plays favorites.  The dumber you are the further up the ladder you move.
bad,"This company is only out for profits at ANY cost, doesn't care about employees or safety. Horrible family life, horrible schedule, treated like children,  wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy"
bad,"I worked as a manager and it was the most stressful, degrading, and toxic culture I've ever experienced in my 15 years of working outside of high school.  The salary might seem competitive, but when you work the required 70 hrs/week it pushes your family and loved ones away and that is not worth it.  Once you get in, you have little time to look for a job elsewhere, but this is the struggle you will get into.  UP usually hires about 20 managers at a time and the lifespan of most managers is under 2 years."
bad,"I worked for the Union Pacific from 1976 till the early 2000’s."
bad,always looking over your shoulder in fear of the next layoffs. you can be replaced.  and up is not afraid of letting you know it. I worked through 3 layoffs and each were terrible
bad,"This is the last place on earth I would advise anyone to seek employment. Management is pathetic from the top down. They micromanage everyone and everything. They watch you on camera all the time. They don't allow any sick days. Forced to work all holidays. They force terrible contracts down the crafts throats because they cater to the transportation department get them to agree with the contract then the other crafts end up forced to accept almost nothing in the way of pay increases. The Union dues increases have consumed the majority of our last several raises and the benefits have deminished over the last several contracts. They look for ways to fire employees. They brag about the profits, and won't purchase enough or decent quality tools,  materials or enough equipment to do their work. Pathetic place to work and getting worse daily. I've been there 9 years and am planning on leaving soon."
bad,"I would not recommend anybody work there. It’s a terrible environment. Everybody is pushed and over worked. Never been happier to find a new job. There is little training, horrible management, zero accountability. I never would have guessed this is how a fortune 200 company is ran. They recently “furloughed” 60 something people at there Melrose yard and are trying to get the same amount of productivity out of less then have the amount off staff. DO NOT WORK HERE!!!!"
bad,"Executives and most mangers were unethical, and did not care about you as a person. you were just a number. Had to call in sick to have time off with family or friends"
bad,"They don't trurly care for their employees or the safety. If you find a problem with a rail car or locomotive, they will run it anyways. It's a hazard to the public and employees."
bad,Do not recommend to anybody they are all about profit for share holders don’t care about the employees on good thing is pay and the benefits for you and your family
bad,"You give up home life and weekends and get harassed about signing off work. At this point you need 20 years to get a normal schedule. Company is going under at some point and is expecting remaining employees to pencil whip the work. No sick days and only two weeks vacation a year for the first 8 years and most of that is spent to offset missing weekends. One 20 minutes break is all you get per shift and no overtime unless absolutely necessary. Forced to work all holidays including Christmas. Management is incompetent and treats employees like criminals. Employees feel institutionalized and morale is no concern of the company. Used to be a great place, but leadership changed hands and now it’s terrible at best. On a lighter note it’s interesting to see how many people are quitting voluntarily faster than the company can lay them off. Also, it used to preach safety first, but it’s now production first and safety last."
bad,The most dysfunctional corporation I have encountered in my 50 years of life !  The only reason they are not out of business is because they are a monopoly !!
bad,UP was a great company but has evolved to taking blood out of stones and promoting knee pads over talent. Sadly they will sacrifice talent to save a nickel.
bad,"Used to be a great place to work. Corporate greed has turned this into a miserable job. Local management is so micromanaged that they have no power to actually make anything better. Employees are considered liability and not assets. Attendance policy very strict, no sick time, never have weekends off, working off shift, forced to work every holiday, morale very low. Miserable."
bad,"Company don’t really care much for employees. Just to make more money, they will ruin many employees life. The company is more and more profitable every year, yet they still decide to furlough people"
bad,After 15 years it's getting harder rather than easier. I know my job and I do it well professionally. All the management are liars snakes backstabbers and will do anything to appease upper management and I mean anything. I'm a union employee so I can't get my personal lawyer involved but I have consulted a private lawyer. They have intruded into my personal medical life and God forbid if you have a family member with a terminal disease. if they think you are wrong you are wrong and you have to prove yourself innocent it took me three years to prove my innocence which it did work but they still don't care they don't care about you at all. The day I got hired was the day they started trying to fire me. And if you want time off too bad and if you take a weekend off lookout.
bad,"Furloughs and layoffs currently going on, cutting down to bare minimum at every shop in all regions. No sick days, job abolishment's happen all the time. Your schedule is always changing hard to have stable days off. Working holidays (overtime paid) but is considered a normal work day if your scheduled, no weekends available unless you have high seniority. Working on locomotives is good, heavy work with cranes and lifts, good to learn new systems on locomotives. Currently hard  place to work a don't care attitude given by management and employees. Company says it is all about safety but keep pushing employees for more and more production,never have I  worked at a company with so many rules designed to be used against employees. Pay in California is not competitive and a don't care about the employees and only care for the shareholders and stock price. I can't tell you a happy employee at my shop all the way up to the director, its a bad situation."
bad,"Terrible Management, Terrible Lifestyle, Never See Home."
bad,"This is a good old boy network. As long as you are a yes person who never questions anything anyone higher than you suggests you will be fine I’m this company. But don’t look for mentorships, acknowledgement, value, succession planning here. You will find criticism, disconnected leadership, silo’ed departments and no communication along with frequent layoffs (three massive rounds in three months and once a year outside of that) terrible data and IT systems and a miserable unhappy workforce. People are willing to leave their pensions to find greener pastures here."
bad,"From the Shareholders to the CEO the company could care less about the individual worker. They want record profits and nothing else. I know of no other company that makes record profits in the BILLIONS  of dollars per quarter, and then decides to lay of thousands of its employees."
bad,They train you and then try to fire you! The management is uneducated employees who pick favorites and terminate everyone else. It’s not worth your family life and marriage. Don’t do it!
bad,They routinely lay people off to increase bonus of upper level management and board members.Quickest way to turn expense numbers around.  Watch out when October rolls around.
bad,Not a good place to work. They discriminate against minority employees and consistently add additional responsibility without commensurate compensation. Management is mean spirited and entirely profit driven. They could care less about their employees.
bad,"This corporation was a real disappointment to work for. I suppose if you don't have a home, family, social life, and enjoy living out of hotels it would be a living?"
bad,They only hire you to fire you. Termination Tuesday is what it is referred to. Training program is hard. Come prepared to study your butt off. Not a company I would recommend working for if you have a family.
bad,"Compensation is not very good in this department, however, some departments do pay very well."
bad,Large company that does not care for or value their employees.  You are an expendable person to them. The pay is decent and that is where it ends.  They pay a little more to help retain a percentage of the staff they don’t run off.
bad,"Don’t work here the company is changing and as of 2019 was voted the #1 worst company to work for in the country. The big plus is the benefits if you can make it to retirement you will be very happy, but the likelihood of that happening is a snow storm in July in Texas."
bad,The management is so far from the rocks. Used to be a great job but not anymore they need to get with the times. Depressing workplace with little to no happy employees.
bad,No home life always on the road gone. From the day they hire you. You are just a number and they will spend the rest of your days trying to fire you. Don’t waste your time
bad,They hire yo many people at one time then cut them off as soon as training is over. They care more about profit than their workers. They cut the work force in half and expect more trains to be run with only 1 person crew. Very dangerous
bad,"Employee life out side of work,health, well being, and safety have no room in this company unless it benefits UP. The pay, the benefits both medical and retirement are good, but there is no job security, you will be fired, or furloughed for up to 3 years, ."
bad,This is a terrible company. They are in the process of gutting the company in order to drive up the stock price. Then the big stock holders will jump ship and let it all burn
bad,"For a big company like this you would think that benefits would be great, but there not. Pay is great for train conductor or engineer , but you work a lot of hours to get that. Family , they don,t give a --- about that. In the shop as a tech the rate of pay is not bad ,but after all the deduction you ain't got nothing. And forget about taking proud in your work no one care , can it make a trip that,s all matter. To sum it up if you not a big share holder you have no say so . Just ask all the people that came to work to find out they was laid off with out notice."
bad,"NO job security, very dangerous job. No one in management gives a darn about any of the employees. All about the shareholders and the CEO putting another dollar in his pocket!"
bad,Maybe other job categories are better than “freight conductor“ but I do not recommend this position in the slightest… Treating your workforce like dirt is no way to retain the best employees!
bad,"WORST MANAGEMENT OF ANY ORGANIZATION I HAVE EVER SEEN.The first thing that people say to you when you start is ""Why would you want to come work for the UP?"". That was the most common question that I got when I started. Everyone that works with you that is not managment spends all their time complaining about how terrible the company is and how its the worst place to work. The company doesn't care about the employees and they are seen as dispensable. Therefore, they hire you so they can fire you. They hire to fire. That should be their motto. The UP will try to intimidate you during the interview process and then try to fire you as soon as they hire you. After you get through their 4 months of training during which you can be fired on the spot for anything. Then you start a 60 day ""de-rail"" where you start going to work in a non-training status but they can still fire you on the spot if you do anything wrong. After you get through that and your finally a union member, the management still trys to get you in trouble for anything and everything. They want you to go as fast as possible but then if you do then you're inevitable going to break a rule which will get you fired. On the other hand if you follow the rules and slow down you will get in trouble for slowing down the work; for which they will try to fire you."
bad,"Worked there 9 years and was fired for doing nothing wrong , UP has the union in their back pocket and is a joke , the company is 100% profit driven and shareholder catered . The don’t care one bit about employees, if they could get by without them and get away with it in blink of an eye but what do I know after 9 years of service with 0 injuries 0 discipline and fired because they didn’t have the tone to do a proper investigation and just let me hang"
bad,"Union Pacific is killing itself with their own processes, they want you to move quick, but then try to fire you on a daily basis.  Want to work all year? Better have 5+ years of seniority or youre getting furloughed.  They work you to death while there are guys wanting to work sitting at home having to find new jobs."
bad,"No comment, management cares more about hitting numbers than keeping employees safe. High stress environment with pressure to produce, and threats if you dont make production numbers,"
bad,"You are just a number, remember that. With the implementation of precision schedule railroading, its all about short term profits. In that we need to make as much revenue as we can this quarter. Next quarter will we figure out then. They are gutting the company and screwing over customers left and right. They are not worried about long term revenue at all. I have never seen senior leadership drive a company into the ground so fast. It is a very company versus employee culture. You are not on the same side. The company does not care about their customers one iota, its all about making the executives look and feel special. "
bad,"The work is terrible for your health, you work long hours and never sleep well since you are always on call and the company violates policies and union agreements to force you to work under the penalty of being fired."
bad,"Company only cares about shareholders and themselves. No work to home life balance. Constantly short staffed, which is self inflicted, by laying off employees to show a positive for their quarterly profits. Awful care for employees and would never recommend anyone to work for this corporate greed employer."
bad,"Riddled with corporate greed."
bad,Straight hot garbage  had 200 people working under me 6 months ago now about to get laid off for the 3rd time. All about shareholders. Could care less about employees. Greed! Greed! Greed! Do not apply for this company!
bad,the people i worked with at the railroad were cool but the management was terrible and they micromanaged everything to the point it made the work environment terrible.  they were always writing you up for something so you always were looking over your shoulder.
bad,Got furloughed after 12 years. Closed the shop I worked at corporate greed at it's finest. Stupid hours crappie days off. Management is terrible and couldn't manage their way out of a paper sack.
bad,"This used to be a 30yr career but now since they have implemented ""precision scheduled railroading"" shareholder value is the only concern they have. They have cut thousands of jobs across the country all so they can keep record short term profits and run the company into the ground."
bad,"I have been with Union Pacific for over 23 years. I have been laid off on 4 different seniority rosters in 10 months. Moved twice trying to keep a job. They hire employees knowing but not telling people they will be laid off in a couple months. Horrible culture, employees always on edge wondering when the the next round of lay offs will be coming."
bad,This company cares about nothing but the share holders and executives bonuses. Be ready to be nothing more than a number here. They will fire you in a heartbeat and not look back.
bad,"You are just a warm body to show up to work. Management has no clue how to run a train, the company will furlough you for no reason. They do not play legitimate claims"
bad,Started at UP in 2018 as a conductor and I have been laid off for 7 months. When they finally allow you to work it is one of the most backwards places on the planet. DO NOT WORK HERE!!!!!
bad,"You will only be a number, management does not care that you have a family to provide for, a mortgage to pay, etc. They will fire you in a heartbeat. We made record profits at our service unit and they rewarded us by laying off over 150 workers, just so they could pocket a larger bonus. I know the benefits sound great and the pay is competitive but at what cost? Definitely not worth it, trust me."
bad,The pay is decent for when you work. The biggest problem is they are to concerned about shareholders and not their employees. They will literally tell you that you are just a number to them that there’s people stacking up to work for them. They don’t care about your health your personal life or anything all they care about is what you can sacrifice to give to them. And when you give them everything you got they will furlough you and make you have to find another job until they decide to pull their heads out of their behinds and let you come back. The management has no idea what is going on and they can’t help you at all. A managers basic job is to rush you out the door. Doesn’t matter if your given good information on your job or not. Half the time they don’t even know it. The only good thing is the benefits and decent pay if you can figure out how to keep a job post it and let us all know because there’s a lot of good workers who are furloughed for no reason. And your union basically won’t do anything to help you either.
bad,"The money's good, the retirement is second to none and the company has a good cafe. "
bad,"They don’t value their employees. You will get laid off, even if you work your butt off. 7 years I’ve worked for the railroad and they laid me off and many other just to put more money into the share holders pocket!!!"
bad,"Do not plan on working full time for at least 5yrs. Do not feel like you can keep your job until 10+ yrs. Constant threat of being fired, harrasment from management, dangerous place to work. Production and profit are over employee safety,  but yes of you can wait years for stability then you'll have good pay and benifits. Compesation is due to lack of quality of life."
bad,Corporate is making drastic cuts in personnel and equipment NATIONWIDE. The serious lack of employees causes all of the employees to cross crafts and do dangerous work they are not adequately trained to do. Every day you are there you will wonder if it will be your last. This culture of fear allows management unlimited control over your livelihood without having to worry about consequences from  the unions.
bad,"This company looks at employees as union scumbags. They actively search for reasons to fire employees. They create unsafe rules that put employees in dangerous environments on purpose, so when the employee uses better judgement to avoid the danger and not participate in the unsafe rule, they can punish or fire them. Management is taught: write employees up because they work harder when their job is at risk of being lost."
bad,anybody can do this job.  If you are desperate sure its a good job.  My advice find a better skill or a more appreciative company.  I learned many skills however the efficiency is awful.  They are always looking to fire you and they are corrupt beyond belief.  It is a great experience but i feel bad for those who spend their entire career there.
bad,"Was a great place to work up until 5 years ago. 4th generation railroader here, they have taken everything away that made working here good except the retirement.  But these days your not gonna make it. Furloughs,  FTX, Critical rule violations,  MAPS."
bad,UP used to be a very reliable company to work for. But now you'll never know if you're gonna have a job tomorrow. They implemented a new business strategy called 'Precision Railroading' what that is in lehmans terms is they want to do more with less. Cutting jobs by the thousands. By doing this the operating ratio goes in their direction and the shareholders pockets get fatter. Corporate greed at its finest. And it's not like they will give you a 30 day notice if you get furloughed. I've seen guys get notified they are out of a job with zero notice. Working for the railroad isnt a stable career anymore and I'll advise any one who is interested in working for the railroad to find somewhere else to work. I've been here 10 years and my job still isnt guaranteed.
bad,Currently furloughing hundreds of people just to rais stock prices and make themselves more money they could care less about you or anything else as long as stockholders are making millions
bad,"You had better just stay where you are at they will use you, abuse you, then furlough because they think they can do the work with zero employees. I would not recommend this place to anyone who needs a stable work environment."
bad,"Leadership lacks innovation, initiative, and execution. "
bad,"Job pays well for what little is required of a train crew.  However, the work environment lacks professionalism in the low to mid level management areas.  Very little stability for newhires with high probability of being furloughed off and on for the first 8 to 10 years of your career.  Opportunities for advancement are not good at all.  Quality of work is terrible.  Sitting on a train is very boring, there is no pride in the work.  Definitely a job, and company, i'm not proud of."
bad,"Promise a lot of things, then stab you in the back. Managers make you do thing that are against company policy so they can get work done. But if something happens they leave you hanging for it by saying you shouldn't have volunteered to do it. How do you volunteer when you're told to do it by your manager, basically if you don't your fired. Don't trust UPRR they fill your head with lies."
bad,"1st - Managements job is to find a reason to write you up and/or fire you. Very 2 faced, tell you to follow rules but then scream at you for following the rules and taking too long affecting THEIR bonus!"
bad,long hours every day could be the last no time off scheduled on call 24/7 poor management poor working conditions stressful environment just a number replaceable not valued
bad,"If you like living away from your family, and want a company that constantly seeks to harass you or get your fired, this is the place."
bad,There is a reason why it’s called getting tail roaded management is looking to advance by stepping on employees furloughs happen to often right now Denver service unit stay away from it
bad,Retirement is great if you last that long. I think the main problem is that they have too many bosses. I believe that safety is the most important thing in work. When you have bosses that have a quota to fill on write ups then men loose focus. When a company is based on profits and saving money Union Pacific sure likes to throw it away.
bad,the company doe not give you days off or a schedule.. you are literally a paid slave.. they create their own law enforcement and have scare tactics from managers to enforce them..
bad,In the workforce for over 55 years 30 in military Union Pacific for 20 this outfit is the sorrist bunch I've ever seen from the CEO down to the lowest manager. This company hates it s employees !!  If your too lazy or too stupid to do your job and just can't cut the mustard than you move into management and stab you're-peers in the back to advance your career
bad,Management does not care about the employees anymore.  Typical publicly traded company just cares about pleasing the shareholders at the expense of employees.  Work/Life balance is horrible.  Managers expect to work 60+ hours a week.
bad,Have been employed here for 3 1/2 years and have worked less then half that time. Stay where you are . I gave up way to much to be this unhappy ! Moved to better my life and only made things worse. Still looking for new employment !!!
bad,"Management has very poor communication, and though they talk a lot about employee engagement, there is a massive disconnect between upper management and the average employee."
bad,You will hate yourself if you work for Union Pacific. I would rather lay down in front of a train than ever work for the Union Pacific again. I worked there for 4 long years. I understand that doesn't sounds like a long time but working for that company it sure as heck is.
bad,"Do not take a train service (conductor) job at Union Pacific! They will put you through an extensive month long classroom room training followed by on the job training. Then when you finish that they will furlough you for years until they need you! I was hired in 2012 and only been employed full time for 14 months! And not consecutively.when you are working management will be hiding in the weeds watching you, and they will fire you for a rule violation.Also you will be on call 24/7 , including weekends and holidays."
bad,Wasn't fun working here always had someone trying to catch you doing something wrong to get you in trouble but never to help you. No scheduled days off
bad,"Double standup,  dishonest, very good at retaliation(watch out), wasting company's money(remodeling same thing over again and again, hiring and promotions to the lack of knowledge(education) and lack of inexperienced and nothing but trouble peoples only)."
bad,"Good old boys club , no personnel life  They say"" your job when you are not working is to get ready for work"" Politics from top to bottom"
bad,Management relationships between crews are negative. Unions are weak and it is often difficult to get legitimate time claims paid.
bad,"I was so excited to get hired at UP because of the pay, benefits and retirement. HOWEVER if I had to do it over I would never have applied to this company. My class was furloughed after working 1 day after our conductor class. We were furloughed again at our 5 year anniversary. They have changed everything at UP. It is not for the better for the employee. Safety is #1 they say but trust me it is the bottom line and that is the shareholder's happiness. I love my job as a conductor when I can work but that is not very often."
bad,"Pay is great. That's how they get you in. You will work off hours, Weekends, and holidays. You will work in every weather condition the mid west can throw at you. They will give you very little vacation and dictate when you can use it. Be prepared to be constantly monitored by managers and cameras."
bad,"On the Operations Side, the management has been cutting employees for two years and plans to do more cutting this year. The management is openly hostile and generally turns into your biggest obstacle for getting things done. I  would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"You can work as hard as you can trying to be a valuable asset to the company and it will not matter . To the company  you are expendable , your sacrifices do not matter . The management will press you to take shortcuts, ignore fra rules but if you get caught it's your fault. If you like harassment and being treated like a dog then this company is for you."
bad,Invested months and months of time training only to be laid off (furloughed) over and over again as a conductor.  You’ll starve and end up divorced for a management force with the goal of getting you fired for any small infraction of the rules.
bad,"The company does not offer a good quality of life work balance. You will not have weekends at all, it’s a seniority base job. Will take you a lifetime of working there to come close to getting a good schedule."
bad,They give a false sense of security.  Guys took this job sometimes giving up over 10 yrs on one job to work for a company with no loyalty to its employees.
bad,Absolutely terrible company to work for. Zero job security. On call 24/7. There is an US verse THEM mentality with management. Management in now way helpful or appreciative. All the company cares about is its stock holders. The company is ran by wall street...
bad,They will hire you just to fire you. They dont care about you at all. When it gets slow they will lay you off and as soon as you get a new job they will call you to come back.
bad,Union Pacific would rather lay off employees to make more money. Making 2 trains into 1 train by making the longer to cut off an extra crew. It’s a good paying job but it is not a family job.
bad,Expect to be laid off. It’s a given. You are exchanging a good salary and benefits for zero job security. Understand that upper management will be extremely fickle and will change courses dramatically at the drop of a hat. Work will be chaotic and extremely unorganized. Expect to be your own manager and  fumble through things. Be prepared to explain every detail of your  best attempt to perform your duties later. The culture is one of frustration
bad,"Absolutely, the worst ran company in America. They will try to fire you the first day you are employed, They over hire by the hundreds because when they fire you they've got another person ready to take your place. The absolute worst managers I have ever worked for. They furlough like crazy, it takes years to hold a steady job and why would you want to because the managers will nitpick you to death. The only thing that they have going for them is pay and benefits."
bad,"The only thing this God forsaken company has offered me is a very decent paycheck, and the checks don't bounce. Very greedy shareholders, only thing on their minds is making more and more money....in any way possible. Of you are "
bad,"if you want to be underpaid and have a terrible schedule forever then take this job, if not run. I suggest anyone who is a decent employee to move on and find something better where you can be recognized."
bad,company is only ran for profits not the employee or his family. yes you are compensated above average but not through the training phases. so save up before taking the job. And its a seniorirty based company Zero job security and or placement. Management has it out for you so no need to be a go getter. Due to the fact your going to be working at a as you learn process and zero to none co worker moral your going to have to be highly self motivated.
bad,"They claim to be Military/Veteran friendly but what they won’t admit to is cutting off that same veteran/military members job if it saves them a dollar.  After they hire you, all you will hear about is all the ways they are trying to fire you.  They are trying to go to one man crews, and getting rid of Conductors.  Ultimately they want no man crews so they can maximize profitability and really live the corporate greed lifestyle.  Stay away from this company!!!"
bad,Imagine an environment where it's easier to get wrote up than properly trained. Unions have zero authority and are really there to protect the company from itself. I was there for only four years. I probably got bumped from third shift to second to first at least fifty times(no exageration). As soon as you get comfortable learning one job you'll get bumped and have to learn another one.
bad,Pay and benefits are the only positive about this workplace. Severe lack of career advancement unless you change crafts and forfeit your seniority. Management has no on the ground experience and tries to enforce work with no idea how it is supposed to operate. Corporate only cares about its investors and quarterly earnings and will sacrifice jobs/employees to make higher profit margins. Be prepared to get furloughed within your first 3 months of working.
bad,Don't work here they don't care about the employees at all. They are always cutting corners on maintenance and they ignore there own safety rules. All they care about is keeping stock holders happy.
bad,"Horrible place to work. Management is always pushing for production goals that can't be attained because they did not provide required information, tools, or parts in a timely fashion. Management always places blame on the employee.  No vacation for your first year and only 1 week your second year. On your third year of employment you qualify for 2 weeks. New hires are forced to work 2nd and 3rd shifts. You will not have weekends or holidays off.  I have been with the company 7 years and have middle of the week as days off and am often forced to work holidays. Company is currently furloughing employees to attain operating goals. You can believe this....I am on Indeed and other sites looking for other employment."
bad,Decent money after several years of seniority. Horrible management. Company only care about profits and not so much about employees. They preach safety until it affects their money
bad,I was furloughed after 6 months of employment and after I left a great paying job. Had I known I was going to be furloughed I wouldn’t have take the job
bad,Due to corporate greed this railroad has implemented precision scheduling railroading. They have cut the work force  to the bare minimum without regards of whether the equipment is or will be fix to fra standard. LAYOFFS is all you have to look forward to ie. Furloughs. Do not put your family's through this. Find a more stable job that well be there tomorrow.
bad,"I love going to day everyday not knowing if it will be my last.  If you like being lied to on a daily basis, working in unsafe conditions, and love not seeing your family, then this is the job for you."
bad,"Lots of old boy network, bad management and layoff culture. Struggle for women in technical positions and non-technical positions alike unless you are in a typical ""female"" role."
bad,"To many hours away from home for the money. They pay you for selling your life out. If you value your family and time with them, this job is not for you. I did this job for 12 years. You are probably thinking i am disgruntled and have neen let go, thats not the case. I seen value in time with my family over chasing an over rated job and pension. Good luck in your venture."
bad,"The company has no regard for employees safety or well-being. They do not abide by union contracts and treat employees very poorly while working extremely long hours in Varying climates. A typical day at work is 12 hours. There is no schedule, employees are on call 24/7 and are expected to not take any days off without penalty."
bad,Wort decision I’ve ever made poor management. You will get laid off after training. You better have lots of money set aside to last you the first five years until you have enough seniority to keep working.
bad,"Long hours poor management. If there's a worse way of working the railroad will always take it. Worst workforce management relationship in existence. Company only cares about firing people and cutting jobs, even to the point of excess and they loose money."
bad,"Company making poor decisions for workers. Job is not secure. Closing yards all across the country. Very stressful job, getting bumped all the time. No promises here."
bad,Look other places. Union Pacific is a prison. Limited time off with fear tactics from upper management. Poorly ran and life isnt there based on family life.
bad,"I wouldnt recommend this job to anyone, the company is a crook and they treat their employees terrible. Management trying to continuously fire you and look for ways to get rid of you is the worst factor of the job closely behind the very poor job security and even worse work to life ratio."
bad,Great compensation package however vey unstable...no transparency in the future direction of the company. Constant workforce reductions which yield low morale and productivity.
bad,"Long shifts, low pay, no benefits, no holiday pay, workers have no motivation, equipment is poor and not maintained. You have to put in 1 year of all that before you can be considered to move up."
bad,"Worked there for 11 1/2 years  between two different crafts and was laid off or furloughed as they like to put it several times. Most were only a couple months, but one lasted 18 months and another was only 10 days. No job security at all.  You’re not a person, just a number to them. Would have been a great job, if you could avoid being fired or being laid off."
bad,Stay away! Dumpster fire! Precision railroading has destroyed this company. They will furlough you in a heart beat. Management is constantly looking for ways to fire you. The unions are weak and in the company's pocket. Don't even think about getting a weekend off! They harass you over 2 missed day due to illness in a ENTIRE YEAR! STAY AWAY! GARBAGE COMPANY!
bad,"The work was good, challenging and rewarding for years. Then the activist investors got involved and have caused thousands of employees to lose their jobs. Not because the company is struggling, on the contrary, all we ever heard was bragging about record profits. Personally I’ve had to seek counseling because of the stress of their mistreatment. Zero job security!"
bad,"Was a good place to work, no job security just a number, for big business ,when thay are finished with you , out the door you go. Second shift or third shift is what you will work, safety only pertains with the company's schedule ,it's real important as long as everything is on schedule"
bad,I wouldnt recommend anyone to try to work at Union Pacific right now. The company is acting greedily where the only thing that matters right now is corporate greed and laying off many hard working employees just to make an extra buck for the shareholders.
bad,Lay off all the time. Not a very good place to work. Work is not hard but the harassment that you have to deal with from management is unreal. They threaten to lay off all the time.
bad,"Union Pacific is riddled with great employees that are stifled with overbearing and incompetent management. The company is dead set on imploding through industry proven failed business plans previously executed from competing railroads. I would never recommend any family or friends to ever work for this company"
bad,"Furloughed twice in one year. Didn't qualify for vacation because I didn't accumulate enough miles to ""earn"" one. If you have questions that dont pertain to rules, good luck. 100% seniority based employment. If you're new or very low on totem pole, good luck making any money. Work rules are also very situational. You are required to join a union and pay dues. Once you're out of training it's all uphill for at least 3-5 years or more."
bad,Terrible management. Working here will suck the life out of you. Not worth the stress and harassment from people who know nothing about the job. Managers are completely incompetent and the director for the Proviso mechanical dept is completely clueless and puts safety at the bottom of the list. More worried about making money not about the safety or concerns of employees.
bad,"Long days that run nonstop. Little reward for the loss of family time and missed days off. Mismanaged from the top down, more work requirements with less employees."
bad,Company wants what they want. Don’t care about you. You are just a number. Always having to look over your shoulder. Overtime mandatory if you are new and don’t know until couple hours before end of shift.
bad,Nothing bad to say about the people I work with but the higher ups are a piece of work.  Been at this company going on 8 years and with all the layoffs I'm back at square 1.
bad,"Hire you to fire you.  Management is out to write you up from day one.  You can do a good job, be a good employee, and the ones that are late, never show up on time, call in; keep their jobs.  While you set at home without pay, cause the company just decided to cut another 10 positions....."
bad,"Moral at all time low. Executive mgt, CEO seem to be putting stockholders first, disconnected from those doing the work. Mid level managers often not aware their staff was being cut until day of cuts. They are now required to carry the workload of those terminated (repeat of 2 yrs ago) with no effective knowledge transfer. Very disrespectful to those mgrs already overworked from previous mgt decisions. Safety is now a concern and emergency effectiveness reduced with numerous key and EXPERIENCED personnel cut. My coworkers were great and loved the work but no longer proud to have been a part of this company dispite it's amazing 150 yr history."
bad,Toxic work environment stemming from CEO. Massive lay-offs in the name of larger profits for stockholders. Work was fun but constant schedule changes make it hard to have a life.
bad,dont do it unless you are single and willing to work when ever or were ever they want. you are just a tool to them and they will treat you how ever they seem fit.
bad,"If you want good money, this is for you. If you want a company who pays you well and also cares about employees, this is not for you. They do not care."
bad,Liars-new hires are set up to fail. No job security HR must use robots. No backbone nor courage to care. Three types of managers: Greed Greedy Greedier is the UPRR way-precision railroad cutting into needed jobs with a  butcher knife.
bad,"Eight years ago when I hired it was a good place to work.  In the past year that started their 2020 plan.  Which will result in Union Pacific laying off about 30% of the workforce or 10,000+ people."
bad,Shareholders and profits are the only thing that matter. No job security work day to day wondering if you will have a job tomorrow. How hard you work does not matter. No business ethics you are a number and that's it. The only way to make more money is to get rid of jobs.
bad,This company use to be great. Over the last 4-5 years it’s gone downhill fast. Company executives truly see their employees as a number. They love to pour salt on the wounds too. Everyday some manager is trying to fire you to move up in the company. Once the company has made their money they’ll lay you off. If you don’t believe me.... google it.
bad,no job security or job advancement. management does not have a clue of what is going on with day to day operations. i do not recommend working for union pacific.
bad,"The management culture is terrible. They do not operate in any sort of reality. They have reduced the workforce so much one person is now doing the job of 3 people. The workload cannot be managed. Stress levels are over the top. Everyone is worried about their job being cut. They do not value their employees. They like to say they do by doing surveys and they talk about ""employee engagement"" all the time but it is just a smoke screen. They do not care and will fire you without even thinking about it."
bad,"Met great people there. Hours suck, management sucks exponentially the higher their titles go.  If, and a very big if, you can stay healthy, alive, and in decent health to make it to retirement (without being laid off permanently, coming down with some type of life ending disease, or a complete mental breakdown), railroad retirement benefits are better than social security (at this point).  They seriously do not care about you as soon as you sign your name on your hiring paperwork. Probably one of the best companies for family (that is if you would like to trade your’s in, never see them, have your spouses leave you and take your children away (yes, spouses because they rarely stay with you because of the stress you are under, the hours you are expected to work, the amount of time you are forced away from home), if you never want to see your kids anything (first days, before school, after school, sports, other activities, etc)."
bad,Unstable environment with no work life balance. Be prepared to worry about losing your job due to cuts.  There are great people that work there but the instability and executives looking out only for themselves will over shadow it.
bad,"keep moving, don't bother wasting your time applying, very contridictory place to work,  Management is very confused,  They like to talk LSS be don't practice very well"
bad,"Hard to have a family or friends because you are always at work. You are on call 24/7. Never know when you are going to work or when you are getting off. Managers try to fire you, so they can advance their careers. Very toxic work environment. I was very happy to leave even with a pay cut."
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend this place if employment to anyone. Constantly being harassed by management, they look for ways to get rid of employees until they’re in a pinch and need the employees."
bad,"Management has ruined the atmosphere here. They are inconsistent and treat veteran employees in a very unfair manner. They have created a hostile ""us vs. them"" attitude that has made it a difficult place to work."
bad,"Horrible working environment and poor management. If you are in the unions, you are fine. If not, you're a target. Look for a job anywhere else. Their corporate focus is on money only, no focus on quality of life, no focus on employee safety if it costs money."
bad,"Very closed minded and not veteran friendly to retirees. Retirement sounds good, but it only works out that way if you can give 30 + years. No social security benefits if you work here."
bad,If you are looking to find some where that does not value your opinion and strives to keep your morale and family life in the gutter then this is the right place.
bad,"I worked at UP in the Denver Service Unit. I was furloughed after being forced to Grand Junction on a 24 hour notice and while driving down to Grand Junction I was called to work. "
bad,You give up family life to make a living.  Managers do not care about you and your family but only care about themselves.  No team atmosphere.  Promotions are made via nepotism and brown nosing buddy system.
bad,"employees are already fired before an investigation even begins. They care more about profit than safety and are willing to put your life on the line to acheive this,"
bad,"they furlough employees with no notice, management is looking to fire union employees for any reason they can come up with, you are on call 24/365 and they call you to work anytime they need, they will only give you 10 hours at home before being called to your next shift that can be anywhere from 8 to 48 hours long, they pay and benefits are good when you are working but you never know how long that will last, there are guys who have worked there for 12years how are currently furloughed and have to find a new job, some employees where given only 2 days notice that they where being let go and the shop was being closed. UP brings in billions of dollars in profit each year and does not invest any of it growing the company or improving the equipment or in keeping employees. profits to wall street employees can sleep in the street is there motto."
bad,The company cut over a 100 positions in my service unit in order to accommodate the new 2020 plan. They have gone to ridiculously long trains and flat switching. No regard for employees. Great place to work if you are into subhuman treatment. CEO is corrupt and could care less about hard working employees who sleep in their cars just so they can work. Company is totally imploding.
bad,"In my 5 years years working here I’ve been promised big things and stable job security. They deliver on benefits and pay, but you basically sign your life away. Bad/unsafe/unsanitary work conditions, hypocritical safety standards, borderline scam-like customer service and intentional service slow downs, thousands of jobs offered then cut, you are a number and they have no problem throwing you away."
bad,Stuck on midnight or afternoon shift for eternity. Probably will never have a weekend off. Constant shift in management which has no true concern for their personnel. People are treated as if they are expendable and should be thankful for their job even when they’ve been continually treated like dirt their entire career.
bad,Hard place to work. Currently in a downsizing this place is starting to be difficult to work for. Look it up always scoring high on place to not work at.
bad,"Frequent furloughs even after 8 years of service, poor management. All seniority based. Company will hire new conductors and send them straight to furlough after training. Poor morale."
bad,I have been with them for 5 years and have been furloughed twice. Yet they make record profits. The job itself is relatively simple and the pay is great. The company and management on the other hand are terrible. They fire you first and ask questions later. They believe that they own you. They will use you and throw you away at a moment’s notice. There’s no stability. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"Work life balance is the worst that I have ever seen; it is even worse than the military.  No job security, you never know when you worked your last day for Union Pacific.  The only good thing about Union Pacific is the money, but you should consider it blood money.  You will pay a price for working for this company."
bad,"This company is terrible. You will make tons and tons of money, but you’ll never be home to see your spouse or kids grow up. They expect you to work 24/7 at any time, and managers non stop are always out to fire you. You’ll work your butt off for the company, to get fired and furloughed."
bad,PSR was a terrible idea. management doesn't care about the safety of their own employees. only the stock options they can advance to their share holders
bad,"Feast or famine. And now, the potential for jobs to disappear due to greed. Preach safety, but act differently. "
bad,If your single and have no bills give it a shot. Can’t depend on constant work. They hire you to fire you. Your safety doesn’t matter or the public’s safety. Only thing that matters is the share holders and stock prices.
bad,"They furlough a lot. They don’t care about anybody or anything except moving cars. The pay was great but I’d rather make $35,000 a year and still have a life than go back."
bad,"If you want a job where you are constantly guessing on whether you will have a job tomorrow or not, then this is the job for you. Even aside from breaking rules. There's NO job security, especially for newer employees. Pay is not that great considering all the stuff they take from your checks. FURLOUGH,FURLOUGH, FURLOUGH! Multi billion dollar profit company that keeps messing with employee's livelihood."
bad,"It is a job, there is a lot that people do not realize before they are hired on at the railroad and end up missing a lot of family time due to not know what they are getting into. You wi get your 40 hours a week but it is shift work and you never know what shift you will end up on"
bad,The job stability is not there. They will use and abuse you for a few months and then just like that you and your family are stressing about how you will pay for things because Union Pacific just cut you completely off. I've seen people with 13 years experience get laid off. Just dont do it
bad,"terrible managers, zero job security, laid off after 15 years, for no reason. if you like sleeping in your bed you won't be there much. don't apply you will regret it"
bad,"There is no certainty from day to day whether or not you will have a job.  This looming threat is very stressful for a person just wanting to do their job and make a living.  The pay is great when you get to work but for my hiring class there has been nothing but uncertainty and furloughs since we started.  Been furloughed twice in less than 6 months already and have not been given the opportunity to work more than 2 days per week since completing training. "
bad,Don’t ruin your life with this company the only thing good is the benefits.Learn to manage and invest your money in your current job.Not family friendly they put on a show like they are just to get you hooked on the money then destroy you and family just like a drug dealer.Shareholders are the only thing that matter.
bad,What used to be a great place to work has since gone down the drain. UP’s new business model proves that the company no longer cares about its employees only their investors. My direct manager is great but unfortunately the management team as a whole are merely just puppets for the executives in Omaha.
bad,"Managers are out to get you. Watching you via cameras/drones. Constantly testing. No job security. One minute it’s crazy busy, the next you’re w/o a job."
bad,The future of the railroad industry is diminishing by the day caused by greed and self preservation by our corporate masters. Safety 1st has gone out with the trash! I once would have loved for my own child to work for UP but these days I would NEVER recommend to them or anyone else's kid to work for UP. 15 years of seniority and I am planning on an exit of this sinking ship!
bad,"You want to work every weekend... check"
bad,"The culture at UP is toxic. Plan on loosening privacy, spouse, family time and your own self esteem. It functions like a Stockholm syndrome. You work when your friends and family don't, so you are isolated. A college kid will instruct you on everything from how to do your job to what to eat and how to walk. As a degree makes one an expert in all things. This is not a secure place to work."
bad,CEO gets a pay raise and corporate brings in a hired gun from CN. Pays him $200+ Plus $20M bonus if time frame is hit. But yet thousands of employees furloughed.
bad,"This company as big as it is has no job security at all. It is only concerned about making more money for them greedy shareholders and the people who does the groundwork they are not concerned about. They tell you all the LIES during the interview, get you to leave your job, put you through a new hire class which was about 5 months but now they cutting it down to a month and a half, then after the class put you on a board working 2 days a week or lay you off! A bunch on money hungry people at the top who cares nothing about the actual employees who make the company what it is today. This 20/20 mess that they trying to do is just that straight NONESENSE mess! And thats saying it in a nice way so this review can be posted! Trying to do more work with less people just to get more money in their already fat pockets at the expense of workers getting into finacial problems and issues loosing everything from homes, vehicles, and families. The people at the top getting $25 million bonuses when the employees that does the work have to try to live off $2300 a month before taxes being on a AW board working only 2 days a week or getting laidoff. A bunch of money hungry, selfish, careless people who is really bringing that company to its knees!!! If you have a good steady paying job, STAY AWAY from this company!!!!"
bad,This company doesn’t care about its employees at all. Be prepared to relocate your family several times. Employee morale is at an all time low in all department.
bad,"Do not even waste your time. The Union Pacific embraces everything that is wrong with this country and corporate America. I can’t express this enough, PUNT! Total joke. Literally ask anyone who has worked there for 2 minutes."
bad,"stressful, makes coworkers very selfish. everyone only cares if they still have a job even if it means cutting your throat to make sure they have one. Seniority is key, if you don't have that you're nothing"
bad,"I worked for this company for 13 years, before I decided to resign. I used to be proud to work for this company, but as the years passed, I decided it just wasn’t worth it anymore. Working for Union Pacific Railroad, you will spend more days out of town than at home. As the years pass, it will seem as if your children grew up without you. Your wife and children will get used to you always working out of town, regardless of how much they love and miss you. The railroad is a cut-throat industry and they will terminate your employment just to keep the shareholders making money. You won’t make a steady paycheck for your first 5 to 10 years of employment. Also, regardless of how much they preach EEO, they hire some of the most RACIST supervisors and managers. I worked for many of them throughout my 13 years of employment with this company. I’m really glad that I resigned from my position with Union Pacific Railroad. My family time is worth more to me than all of the money I ever made working for this company."
bad,"The railroad is chaos.  And Union Pacific is the leader in it.  I left a fairly secure job thinking the railroad would be a longer term option for career growth.  The pay is above average and the benefits are on the top end but management is shady, the practices are shady, and they will abolish your job, make up reasons to fire you, and try and skate around federal labor regulations and FRA requirements.  "
bad,"poor management, frequent layoffs, working nights with weekdays off. the manager you work for doesnt even know whats going on in the company until some big wigs show up and lay off 9 people at a time."
bad,Job is seniority based with no flexibly in their work schedule for family life.  Corporate policies leave much to be desired.  The environment gives the feeling of say one thing but do another. Many paths for job advancement were removed.
bad,"Don’t work here, bad days off and bad hours coupled with no real leadership.  You will feel pressured to do things wrong and unsafe just to make stock holders richer"
bad,"UP as a company is not what it once was not what it was 10 years ago. Leadership has been replaced with management and that management is based on replicating what is currently being done. The onus is no longer on the employees and customers but now on Wall St. The culture, what was once the pride of the company, has now shifted and is toxic to put it mildly. The work itself can be rewarding but one must have thick skin and be able to handle years of being relegated to the middle of the pack."
bad,Union Pacific railroad does not care or support their employees. Always looking for ways to fire employees and will not stand behind their employees. Would not recommend it to anyone. union employees don't stand with each other. Do anything to help management fire someone
bad,"God forbid you get sick or injured in the 30 years it takes to retire I have been with the company for 3 years went out on a medical issue because they pulled me out of service. I was having a off day, I almost passed out from standing suddenly and my vision blurred a little bit. I told my manager that I wanted to remain with someone for safety sake and finish my shift. I went on my rest days came back to ""you have to go see a doctor and get cleared"" blah blah blah. So I went to a neurologist, cardiologist they tested me for everything under the sun and said your healthy as it gets. 7 months later still cant return to work but they released me with a huge list of restrictions this has made it where the rail road retirement board doesn't have to pay me sickness benefits. Because I have been released I am no longer sick just cant perform any jobs. In turn due to my restrictions there isn't a job that I can do. Its like a loop hole to not pay you, firing you for no reason without firing you. Now i have to see if I can file unemployment and I am  going to find a company that isn't completely worthless. I worked my tail off my whole life heavy equipment huge military vehicles even rockets for a stint and the rail road is an easy gig if you can deal with the garbage and being a scrub for years with no seniority working holidays nights and weekends.  Whatever you do don't confide in a manager for any reason just clock out and go home they will nail you to the wall and you will be SOL. I hope another sector of the railroad finds an edge on this company and buries them I have never hated"
bad,Driving long trips and staying away from the office was the best way to manage with the company. To many micro managers that will try to get someone fired.
bad,"The worse part of working for a large Class-1 railroad is that you get typecast.  Once you have that experience on your resume it is nearly impossible to get considered for employment in any other industry or even any other class-1 railroad.   The industry is divided up between 5 major freight railroads. It is almost impossible to jump ship which leaves you basically unemployable if you get furloughed.   It's kinda like Hotel California.  You know the song.  You can check out but you can never leave. "
bad,No if your looking for just a job that pays well and has great benefits then this is the job for you. Now comes the but.....It has the worst management I have ever seen. The stress alone from not knowing if your going to have a job anymore. Managers make up reason to fire you. They have to have so many negative reports or it makes them look bad. There is no set policy for days as a union employee and that's how the company likes it. Then they can make things up as they go along. There is no home life so if you have a family kiss them goodbye.
bad,"They cut jobs on a weekly basis, horrible management, on call 24/7, do not follow union agreements, no time off, disciplinary action when you take off, twisted fmla regulations, they brag about hiring vets yet we can’t take off for medical appointments, zero advancement, they only hire fresh out of college students with zero experience as management instead of experienced trainman, reactive instead of proactive, etc."
bad,"Good pay for what I was doing - great retirement. Terrible management team - all about themselves and hiding behind their employees. I have worked for poor managers before, but this is by far the most selfish group I have ever had the displeasure of working for. If you have a family - forget about it. RUN"
bad,"Compensation was great, while the work lasted.  Employees are forced to constanty watch over their shoulder for fear of getting fired for infractions as small as putting hands in pockets. ( working outdoors in ANY weather condition). Forced to join union that only seemed to care about the old-heads and had no interest in helping newbies.  Forget about family time."
bad,"This job will suck your life away and still ask for more.  Your marriage will suffer, you will be constantly in fear of your job, you will find yourself yearning for retirement, you will not have a life."
bad,"Union based position;  Seniority based;  Work experience, Education & Background are not taken into consideration.  Continuously bumped from jobs because of seniority."
bad,I do not want to give an opinion about anything that involves with Union Pacific. I do not feel comfortable telling indeed about the the work place that I encounter.
bad,The company does not promote on qualifications but on a time/ buddy system. Personnel that have zero qualifications are promoted before person's that have years of experiance.
bad,"I seriously quit this job to become a cop."
bad,"Unless you're buddies with management they will do anything and everything they can to make your life miserable.  It's impossible to advance because no one cares how hard you work or how good you are at your job,  if you excel,  they raise their expectations more and more until  they're impossible to meet and then you get written up. This is an extremely toxic work environment.  No one deserves to be degraded,  humiliated,  and treated so horribly on a daily basis."
bad,"Company is completely mismanaged. Employee's are nothing more than a number. If you want to actually make a living and provide for your family, you'll never have a home life with your family. You only get paid if you go to work. Little vacation, NO sick leave, NO worker's comp.  So dont get sick or get hurt because you simply will NOT get a paycheck. They spend alot of money hiring and training you, and the rest of your career trying to fire you"
bad,"Union Pacific compensates their employees very well not for their talents and innovation, but for their inconvenience of working long hours without many days of holidays off. The culture allows for the good old boy system to prosper, and the status quo is embraced. The common thought throughout the company is ""Why change it, that's the way we've always done it?"" Union Pacific makes money in spite of themselves since they operate in an Oligopoly. Do not recommend working for Union Pacific unless you can not find work elsewhere; last resort only"
bad,The job is rough and the pay is low and rougher. Very low movement on advancement
bad,Okay job.  Good pay.  Used to be good benefits but they get worse every year.  Everyone is constantly worried about layoffs (furloughs).  Management can't make any decisions without Corporate approval.
bad,Good money but will fire you in a heartbeat. Management head hunts often. Constantly furlough as well. Would not work here for long. Get the money for a couple years and plan a out.
bad,Run Don't waste your time trying to get on with the railroad. The company only cares about their stock holders. There's no future in it. UP will be sold for pennies on the dollar.
bad,"I have nothing to say about this company as a piece, but as a whole it was poorly managed and the employees suffered as well as their customers and clients."
bad,"I've been here for 7 years with the company and I may or may not have a Job. I was cut off right before the Holidays. I have a family, my wife is 7 months pregnant and the company could care less about my situation."
bad,No job security when you're always being watched on call was horrible with only two hours to show up to work but they commentating you very well for the inconvenience
bad,"From the beginning, they tell you that there will always be work."
bad,The future I saw at the beginning or the year is not the future that the company is currently advancing towards. There reduction of supplemental departments causes great concern for my future
bad,"The work is not bad in general.  However, work/life balance is poor.  Compensation is not on par with sacrifices made for job.  I wouldn’t recommend it."
bad,I have been with UP for almost 6 years but have had maybe 2 years work of actual compensated working days.  You are constantly laid off.  It's amazing that after multi billion dollar profits per year they still treat their employees this way.  The Union does absolutely nothing for you but you better pay your dues so they can have their conferences in Vegas.  What a joke all the way around.  The pay is awesome if you could actually work year round.
bad,"Changing every day.Stressful no job security."
bad,Being on call 24/7 almost 365 days a year.  They pay well and have good benefits. I learned a lot about railroading.  I really enjoyed the guys i worked with there with the exception of managers.  There was a couple good managers but most had no idea what was going on or how to do their job.
bad,Management was going around just trying to fire people... Now U.P. has this idea to cut everything to the bare bones and save as much money as they can at everyone else's expense. So now many are laid off furloughed or forced 5 hours from location they were hired. And Denver Union SMART is the worst crooks ever collecting for themselves and not following any agreements made for the railroad to follow
bad,"Expect to get furloughed multiple times at this company. Can not build a life around this company because you will get furloughed more than once. if you decide to work here, Good luck explaining to your family how you got laid off again for 1-2 years"
bad,UP was an amazing company when I hired out. But after years of mismanagement from the current leader the jobs and the job security have Become less than desirable. If you like to work 80 hours a week and no longer be able to share in the lives of your friends and family then they will pay you well for it. I left because of racist leadership and no opportunity to have a life outside of work.
bad,You will be laid off for months (5 plus) at a time every year until you get at least 5 years of seniority. Their bussiness practices have ensured that employees are being cut more and more every year.
bad,"Horrible culture in which management is only interested in discipline and not in assisting crews.  Many managers do not even attempt to hide their excitement when they are able to fire an employee.  Union Pacific is also partaking in Precision Scheduled Railroading, which basically means they are laying off as many people as they can and still function.  They are demanding that the remaining employees perform the duties of two or three people."
bad,"Gave my all for 10+ years. "
bad,"Working for the railroad was very rewarding.  I met some wonderful people who have become lifelong friends. The work and pay are excellent, however, the company itself lacks compassion for its' employees."
bad,"Supervision not picked by aptitude qualifications. Headquarters creates knee reactions problems instead of test and evaluating to produce a solution. Safety culture only exists as a measure to eliminate any liability possessed by Union Pacific instead being concerned for its employee."
bad,If you want to be worked like a dog at all hours of the day or night without little notice and with a union that has no backbone and let’s the railroad do as they please then Union Pacific is the place for you. Worst 10 years of my life glad I quit.
bad,"New employees are only paid one third of pre-1985 employees.  One would think as the cost of living continues to rise in society today, wages would increase in 2019."
bad,Upper level management only really cares about themselves as well as company profits not the people doing the work to get them there. Cut thousands of hard-working employees to inflate  shareholder profits
bad,"Overall my experience with Union Pacific wasn't great. In fairness they go into working there with full transparency, but it wasn't a good place to work. Poor leadership only concerned with their bonuses, expected to answer your phone at 2 am to spend upwards of the next 12 hours on a train to sit in a hotel for  24 hours or more to take a train home, sleep and visit family for 10 hours. Then repeat. No homelife unless you put 15 years in with the company. To put in perspective I had a 12 hour leash in the military to be ready for a deployment, and went on 4  deployments in a 3 year period and I spent more time at home then I did at the railroad."
bad,Good money but horribly incompetent mid and upper level management. The main reason to not work here is you never know when you will be fired. They keep cutting with no end in sight.
bad,Terrible job work life balance.  No consideration for family balance.  Thorough training needed for new hires expected to become road conductors.  OJT consist of more than memorizing the written material.
bad,For today's technology in advancements and women's rights you think this company would have it together but they are far from out of the Dark Ages. Nobody wants to be on call 24/7 365 days a year and yet that's what they still expect. 20 years ago the woman stayed and took care of the house and kids. That doesn't happen anymore between being a good father and having a wife that also has a job this company doesn't compensate for time off. They're scheduling is horrible you never know when you will go to work or when you will get home. You sit and motels for days on end with no idea of when you will get a return trip. If you're young and have no family this is the job for you
bad,"The job wasn't terrible but it had terrible people running it from the top in some terminals. Work life balance was terrible as a manager, plan on working 15+ hours daily, working 7 days on and 2 off. and when you're off you'll sleep the first day away and you will neglect family functions and friends but oh you'll be compensated for it ""so they tell you"" would I go back....not a chance the only benefit was that I made 6 figures but getting paid once a month sucks, teaches you how to budget fast."
bad,"This is the only job I've ever had where managers don't lead, they only looking to write you up and fire you because it looks better to the FRA.  You have no schedule and very little family time.  you make really good money but at a cost."
bad,"Good Job great benifits, unfortunately this company has a horrible way of treating the em[ployees , all they care about is a body being present for work , You have no family life to speak of . ."
bad,Do not apply for this job!!! Every time you turn around the management is looking for a reason to fire you. Especially when you are new. And be prepared to spend 10 hours in a classroom and at least 5 hoirs a night studying for the first month. I wouldnt take a job at Union Pacific if they begged me.
bad,"Only positive about company is pay and benefits and retirement."
bad,Just not a good place to work. Days are long and no home life. Just not a happy place. It is a career you can retire from but will have no physical strength left.
bad,Right now I have nothing good to say about Union Pacific. They treated me very unfairly and were unjust in my leaving. They proved to me that I did not matter one bit after 25 years of dedication
bad,"The railroad ones you and you will live by the phone. Always on call. The company doesn’t care about the employees you nothing but a number. It’s very stressful due to recent PSR implementation, you never know when you will be cut and loose your job."
bad,They ont care about their employee this is the only company i worked for that hired you just to fire you They ask you to do extra work and you do it and then they deni your pay I have over 5000 dollars worth of claims they have denied if you word it wrong or if you dont impute it exactly its automatically kicked out they informed claims department to deni every claim because 80 percent of employees wont resubmit it so they are steeling your money from you They know they asked you to do the work we shouldnt have to submit a clain it should be automatic then they put rulles almost every ay for you have to know 1 manager says to do it one way and anothersays different 1 fires you and the other oesnt They have cut o many jobs just do lance fritz and stock holders can recieve more money not caring about the ones that are out there oing labor to fill their pockets billion dollar profits the 4 previous yrs but thats not enogh As long as their families are taken care of who cares a out us and the 1000s of workers they have laid off for greedy people Past employees loosing eerything kids getting sicker cause the dont have any insurens because of this company and even sometimes death i could go on an on but i hope they know where they will go
bad,"during the job interview The interviewers made it very clear that safety was an important part of this job and I be extremely safe and cautious while performing my job duties. Fast forward to before I was laid off no one in management cared about anyone being safe, only about getting work done fast."
bad,"Do not consider this place as somewhere to work. Their “2020” agenda is cut jobs and fire those that can’t be cut. Management hunts employees making the smallest mistakes and come up with their own rules on the spot to fire folks. Beware of this place, and stay far far away."
bad,"Very unstable job security. Can have over 6 years on the company and be told the next week you won't have a job. Good pay and benefits. Never get to stay at home, you will be relocated and management doesn't care about personal issues going on in your life."
bad,"There are so many places to make close too or more money   especially today without having to deal with the utter pistol in your mouth level of frustration and job moral like this garbage ""railroad""..No longer can the pay justify anything."
bad,Company  doesn't  care about  its employees.  Work on call for years based on seniority  and can be furloughed at any time. Jobs pay well if you can stay employed
bad,"Typical work day is between 8-12 hrs. Management is terrible and they will bother you about petty stuff, the, the pay and benefits keep people there but not a great company to work for"
bad,Company that doesnt care about their employees. They only care about the bottom line. Worked there for 5 years been laid off twice. Horrible days off. You have to work all the holidays
bad,"I was fired from union pacific for ""lying"" on an incident report after getting struck by a train, they are all about safety until they are in the wrong. Its a very well paid job, the hours are hard and you can never plan a day unless you take it off."
bad,"To sum it up, the employees are dropped into a shark tank to fend for themselves, while management (sharks) gets to pick the little guys apart. It's the only company I've ever worked for that hires people into a lower management position and their only job is to fire the union employees. It's a horrible company to work for unless you're looking into becoming an upper-management employee or are a shareholder. Safety and family isn't a priority with this company, but pleasing the people with fat wallets is. Get the idea?"
bad,"I have worked for this company for the last 10 years. I have been passed over for promotion 3 times. The 2 most recent promotions have been awarded to less experienced, younger Agents, with less than 4 years experience with the company."
bad,"Having a family to feed, this job is great. Watching your family that you feed grow up, that's a whole different thing. On call 24/7/365. This employer has great benefits, but the management is beyond incompetent and put you in incredibly dangerous situations all the time, putting the almighty dollar before the safety and well-bring of it's workforce.  Ultimately, you end up sacrificing your time for money, which is why I am looking elsewhere for employment."
bad,"The money is the best part of this career path.  Long hours, being on call 24/7 and then the management is always looking for a reason to fire or suspend you.  Job security comes with time but currently something like 40% are laid off."
bad,"this is a very demanding job on yor life, health, and time. anyone with a family has to know you may not see them too often but you will be making alot of money"
bad,One mistake during training and they fired me and another student.
bad,I would rather not say just watch the news and you will see how they treat their employees.  Corporate greed is fueling these layoffs and yard closures effecting many different nonunion and union jobs.
bad,The only upside to this job is the benefits but you are being paid to have no life. Expect to be furloughed and be managed by fear tactics. You may be forced to work in a location 5 hours away with a 3 hour call to work. Company goes against union agreements to make you do their will. Very corrupt company! Just watch heck on wheels... Hasn't changed much.
bad,"I love my fellow railroaders. Best group of misfits I have ever worked with. But the job security is terrible. You never know if you're going to lose your job that day or not. Managers are always out to get you, upper management wants to cut your job out completely. It's a lose lose. Money and coworkers are great."
bad,"Management is tasked to attempt to write up employees. Always worried about loosing your job. They dont care whatsoever about their employees. Layoff majority of their workforce right before the holidays. But, they do have great benifits and retirement if you get to stay there long enough to utilize it."
bad,"I've been putting off my review because I didn't know where to begin. It's been over a year since I left and I still get upset when I think deeply about my time with UP."
bad,The management is extremely aggressive.  They have to get their trains out in a certain time frame to get their bonus.  Other than that it's not an overall negative place.
bad,"When I hired in, railroading at Union Pacific was awesome. We were treated like we mattered....like family. "
bad,"People  you work with are great however "
bad,Dont unless you want to be fired. Only company that I've worked for that strive to fire you. Even if you have done nothing wrong. And don't take time off even if you are sick!
bad,"Great pay. No work/life balance. Management is crooked,sneaky and conniving. Will lie to fire you. Once you are hired you have to fight to keep your job. Union is good to have but us weak."
bad,They have layed everybody off if you don’t have 10 years seniority you will never have a weekend off.and you will get stuck on second shift for your whole career and they will just come in and lay you off one day
bad,"Good job great earning potential, No life, they own you 24/7"
bad,"been fourghloed a lot not working ,no personal life always on call , always cut off from working board it's more like a temporary job ,only call you to work like 3 months ago year"
bad,"Long days,  I've learned so much in the Rail industry, Upper management needs to be more involved and not so micro managed.  Individuals with a college education are telling us how to do our job, and they have NO railroad experience what so ever.   So much time, money and crews are spent on ridiculous moves and horrible call times."
bad,"The pay is good for my area. "
bad,"Very long training period with many tests that you have to pass to move forward. Managers are looking to fire new hires. In my first two years over 100 layoffs in North Platte, NE. Hire to Fire or layoff... Only working two days a week... Stay away...."
bad,"People complain a lot on the railroad, but they have been there for years and don't remember how bad it is out in the real world. The Railroad might not be as good as it once was in taking care of the employees, but it's a whole lot better than most. Like any corporation and the board of directors quest for extreme greed it plays out on the men and women of the railroads livelihood. Luckily there is a union that we pay dues that negotiates for us. If there was not the railroad would pay us pennies with no benefits."
bad,"Massive cuts in workforce. Told to do job improperly to get It done faster. Unsafe work environment. Management is hostile. Jobs all based on seniority, can't hold a job position."
bad,Just be looking for a new job if you start working there. Cuz you will be layed off. thats it work all the time never home. never see your family. And union pacific do not care about you or your family or your problems.
bad,"The pay and retirement benefits are good but the worry of being furloughed anytime into your career isn't worth leaving a previous good paying job. "
bad,A typical day at work is to either move locomotives at or clean shop. I  have learned that management is not their to help you advance. I get along with my coworkers and  am well liked. The hardest part of my job is the daily drama that happens at work. There is really no enjoyable part of the job anymore. Was a good company to work for when I started but with my education that I have they wont give me the chance for advancement
bad,"When trains are moving the jobs are plentiful but when production slows up you can’t work anything but 2 days a week,still the pay is better than 90 %of jobs in the area"
bad,"Was a good company at one time. But greed set in and they closed a lot of shops down, a lot of good people lost jobs, some relocated but only to find out they were out of a job shortly after"
bad,"The company is not up front during the hiring process. If you were told that after 6 months of training and making only $19,000 that you would not be able to hold a job ( seniority driven) and if you are able to work it wouldn't be in the area you were hired. I would never have left my old job for this company if I would have known."
bad,"it's am love hate job. complain about the working conditions we have to put up work but, once I sit behind the controls of am 4400hp locomotive, it all seams to go away until we stop. our contact is up and the up chairman says this contract will be years in negotiation because they want to get rid of the conductor. wow. it's all about the profits. I could write a book on the down right mismanagement, theft of our wages that we have earned"
bad,"Everything based on seniority.  Working hard, learning your job and getting locomotives fix gets you nothing.  Will still be forced to work the shift that others do not want with bad days off."
bad,"Union Pacific is extremely mismanaged with a focus on ineffective measurements.  Union Pacific does not encourage nor promote innovation but top down management style. "
bad,"Typical day.. Until you are called for a train or a yard job, you sit at home ready to go work unless you can predict when they might call you to come in.  Trains have a lineup you can watch by signing in to the system and if your in the yard you will watch a listing of all the jobs for the day and try figure out what job you will be needed for."
bad,"I thought it was gonna be an amazing place to work but they hired me and 20 other people for my training class and three more classes behind me ,  once I finished all my training i only got to work for about three months before my class and every class behind me was furloughed due to lack of work, your'e on call 24/7 so you never know when your'e going to work ,jobs are based on seniority  so as the low man you get repeatedly bumped off boards and have to try to find a new board to work on before you get bumped  again."
bad,"The management there is horrible, there is no morale within this company, your just a number, I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here, they only hire you to fire you. Your nothing without seniority!"
bad,Work you to death with little regard for family life or loyalty. They pay you good but you never know when or if you will loose your job or for how long.
bad,"The job has been rewarding, I love the people I work with and manage. Upper management is very disconnected from the people on the ground, and they are cutting in ways that make everyone's job harder and more stressful."
bad,"Tough to tell what the direction of the company is focused on, they do not care about your livelihood and family and will cut your job at the drop of a hat. They are focused on the dynamic railroad and to do more with less at any cost."
bad,"Management can not manage, now that they have gone to precision railroading everyone comes to work expecting to be laid off at any moment.  Managers have their personal items boxed up just waiting to be cut."
bad,The only thing that management is concerned with is the next earnings report. They don't value employees at all.  Currently their only concern is cutting headcount at whatever cost.  This is something that is unlikely to change under the current management team.  It used to be a great place to work and a sought after job.  Sadly that is no longer the case.
bad,"No sick pay, no weekends unless you’ve been there 20 plus years, that’s if you make it that long, they’re laying off guys with over 10 years of seniority right now on an experiment of cutting 30% of workforce to maintain the same work produced by the shops, can’t go to break room for breaks, cant leave for your 20 minute lunch, medical benefits have a high deductible to meet before they even kick in, not what you’d expect from a major company like this.  Stay away"
bad,They are only focused on driving stock prices higher for a short term gain. They are laying off thousands of workers in the last few months and are already having operational problems.
bad,Not a good place to work if you want to keep a job. If you get hired you'll work a little while then they'll furlough you till they need you again which could be a long time.
bad,"You are constantly making sure you are following company rules. You will be watched and monitored in office and on trains for compliance."
bad,"If you want to give up your soul, this is the place for you. The work is unpredictable, they lay off a lot, and you are always having to fight to get paid correctly. I would not recommend this job to anyone coming into the job market"
bad,Was supposed to be a great place to work. Was told it was a place that could help me provide for my family and make my kids proud. It instead took me away from my family and gave me back through furlough and right before the Holidays with no money to show for everything they put us through. they paid good but it didn't matter because in addition to having to cover bills Ipaid more in gas mileage and lodging because of how much I got bumped and forced around. The places I had to drive to were crazy far and had to be there with every call. would have been a decent job is if they didn't over hire and learned how to run their railroad.
bad,Life work balance is very difficult. Seniority is very hard to acquire . At this point I can't leave the industry because of mymy age. With the changes in the industry l don't see myself retiring from union Pacific.
bad,Was here long enough to watch the culture spiral down wards. Last time I spoke with some old railroad buddies still there I’ve been told it’s gotten worse. If you want railroad retirement then this is the place. If you want a better overall balance then you may want to look elsewhere until something better comes along.
bad,"Wasn't there long to find out ...... Didn't like it.. Money was decent made more at other job I had before I retired, pension is good from what I was told.. May never know ,..,..............................................................................."
bad,Railroads never accommodate anyone or anything but themselves. They pay well but according to one union operative they constantly  ‘over hire and over fire.’ They rule by intimidation and this is what spelled my demise. I got sick of the mind games and they got sick of my insistence that they treat us like allies that earn them profits instead of low life’s that only want to take what we’re not entitled to.  Why is not important just know what it is and decide if your up for the good the bad and the ugly.
bad,"Where the employees are treated like numbers, your opinions are not valued, your job is never safe and people who can not handle the job they were hired to do get promoted just to get them away from messing things up."
bad,"No schedule, no lifestyle, on call 24/7/365, want to fire you for taking time off. Will fire you for use of fmla. Micro management, not able to do your job. Have drones with cameras to watch you so they can give you writen notice. Management has a quota for employee wright ups, they call it safety, its a head hunt..."
bad,Its ok job if you can deal with the drama fast paxed lots of over time and the bullsh** from people that hs no clue how to run a company  the bosses talk out of both sides of thier mouth
bad,"When I started a up it was  a great company, however in my last couple of years were unstable. Upper management began to show less and less of concern for retaining employees"
bad,The last three years... very sad to see such a formally proud company destroy themselves from the inside out. All for the sake of shareholders making a quick profit. Screw the employees!
bad,"Safety was paramount which is great. Using those same rules to discipline you was not good. Rules were constantly changing. Rule book was 2” thick. When the big boss was not around we were expected to bend rules so management could meet their quota. It was a cool interesting job that was unfortunately sabotaged.  The threat of layoffs was constant and eventually true as  20+ electricians and machinists were laid off so as the chairman would say ‘give value to the shareholders’"
bad,"Union Pacific is a terrible company to work for, The job masquerades itself as a FT job, one that will allow for you to provide for your family and put yourself in position for the next phase of your life.. what it really is however is a PT/Seasonal job that will eventually furlough you or force you to work 4-5 hours away from your home and family. You will be bumped from one place to another and you won't be able to work unless you are willing to relocate your family (or just yourself) for an unspecified amount of time. The management is horrible and clueless and doesn't care about their employees, just the shareholders. You have to sacrifice your entire life just to make a living at this company, you will work on call for the first 3-5 years of your ""Career"" here and not know when/if you'll be working or if you'll be furloughed. If you're single and very young and want to make money and don't care about being bumped around or, not working for unknown periods of time, this job may be for you. If you have a family.. this job may not be for you unless you have tremendous support around you. You WILL be bumped, you WILL be forced to work an extremely long distance away from your home and WILL have to take care of your own lodging expenses while also paying bills back at home, you WILL sleep overnight in hotels 2-4 times a week away from your family, you WILL hate this company. If you are willing to sacrifice your peace of mind and your family life for the next 5-7 years..by all means apply. If you want and value stability, save yourself, and most importantly your family the trouble"
bad,"It is a nice family friendly place to work 19 years ago today are the opposite of the past, I was hired in April 2000. Today the company has a massive furlough it is like an avalanche coming downstream that swipes the entire village."
bad,They don't care about you at all. You are nothing more to them than a number. Everyone is disposable. I spent way too much time away from my wife and kids. I was told to just put in your time and it will be worth it. I gave 4 years to them waiting on my time to move up and all I got was laid off. I wouldn't let anyone I cared about go to work for them.
bad,The union is a joke.  It is designed to protect the lazy.  Record year in revenue howerer lots of lay off. It is a workforce reduction disguised as a layoff.  This company is not secure. Don't work here. The hire people and many of the employees had given up great jobs thinking that the railroad would be an excellent place to work.  Only to be laid off in under six months
bad,Good job with good benefits. Coworkers are friendly and willing to help and share knowledge. Optional overtime. Union occupation where job location and shift is based on seniority with company.
bad,"Under Lance Fritz this company has taken a nosedive.  Only concerned about the 'bottom line' and stockholder they have been laying off thousands of workers while giving out multi million dollar bonuses to their management staff.  Under the G2020 initiatives, there will be several more rounds of layoffs coming.  I would not recommend this company to ANYONE looking for a job.  There is absolutely no communication between management and staff."
bad,"It was a good company when I started. I very much enjoyed working there, but the environment has changed to an extreme that it is simply not the same place. I love the work and I enjoyed the people before most of them were laid off, but now I think it is time for me to find a more secure place to work."
bad,"Constant revolving door of managers, managers are overworked and under paid. 60-70 hour work weeks, no work life balance, say goodbye to all your hobbies and your family because the railroad will own your time. Omaha has no control over the field managers, the turnover is the worst I have ever seen. Cutting hundreds of jobs walking people out of the headquarters this is normal UP work life from year to year a long career with UP is a person accomplishment!"
bad,The company is afraid to treat minorities the same as everyone else. It doesn't matter if you work hard or not. Management shows favoritism during promotion's. Puts people in jobs they don't deserve. Promotes people that are going to get someone or their self killed. These people don't have the experience for the position. They talk alot of propaganda about safety but don't follow it themselves. In 13 years on 3rd shift I never saw the saftey captian come in and talk about safety to the guys.
bad,"I enjoy my job but the pay has decreased every year, and the medical insurance is terrible. The work/life balance is horrible, they expect managers to live at work and the headquarters has no idea what goes on out in the field locations. Working for Union Pacific is great if you work at the headquarters, the field is terrible."
bad,"Great pay, terrible work culture. On call 24/7.  No home life. No regular schedule. Management is constantly spying on you trying to catch you doing something wrong. They are now using aerial drones to watch you work.  They watch all your social media. If you work for them don't say anything or have an opinion about anything. And the Union you are FORCE to join is NOT allowed to strike so they are basically ""yes men"" for the company. The union are just leeches who you are FORCED to pay and are NOT looking out for your well being."
bad,I have never seen a place that spent money to train you then the day you were trained began their campaign to fire you. Everyone looks over their shoulder constantly. No matter what you do they will find something you did wrong if they need a failure. It went from a fun job to miserable. The new management style leaves me wondering how anyone will keep their job.
bad,For the most part very poor leadership from management and awful workplace moral.  The company does not care about the employees only the shareholders.
bad,Management is a joke. Even the managers hate being managers. The company doesn't care about its employees. They pit the old heads against the new guys all the time. Same with the union. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this job unless you're a single guy who doesn't have a life outside of work.
bad,"First of all, if you're thinking about becoming a conductor, you need to ignore ALL reviews by the folks in Omaha or in management for that matter.  Their experience at UP will be nothing like what you experience. "
bad,It is a typical union job. You have no rights and no job security for the first five years. Managements ONLY JOB is trying to write you up instead of ensuring you are trained properly.
bad,"Cutbacks at any given time. There is no sense of job security when working for this railroad, or any other. They cut me and my whole class after two years of working."
bad,"Not much home life.  Always on call 24/7.  Under appreciated by management.  They do everything they can to hire you, just to try and fire you.  Great pay, not so great atmosphere."
bad,Way too many negatives to count. The only positive is the benefits if you can stay employed there long enough to many layoffs too many furloughs Not worth the sacrifice of your life for the benefits and never knowing if you get the privilege to work and earn an income until you have significant seniority. Goooood school archaic way of doing business.
bad,"The work for Union Pacific is quite easy, it was being away from the family and always being on call that was the biggest test for me. There is absolutely no job security with the railroad, they very often cut employees off especially those with little or no senoirity"
bad,"I’m a five year employee. On call 24/7 and gone for days at a time. Zero scheduled days off and only home as little as 13 hours at a time. The company will lay you off overnight and if you don’t have the seniority to work in town, you can be responsible for your own housing up to 400 miles away indefinitely. However, trainmen make 60k-134k a year solely based on how much (or little) you want to work."
bad,"This company is for shareholders. The work/life balance is horrible. You can basically find yourself living on the road. The pay is better than most but really not worth what you sacrifice. Sadly you never will know when you go to work. You live by the phone and if you miss too many calls (which can be 2) then you may find yourself in an attendance program. Currently, they are at the brink of furloughing employees while making record profits."
bad,Would be a good place to work if you knew you had a future with the company. One day you work and then they let someone with more seniority take the job from you.
bad,"this job requires most of your life 8 day work week 10 hours days, away from home six days off but your first day off  is spent recovering from the long week and long drive home and your last day off is spent getting ready for the week and a long drive back to work."
bad,"It is a terrible place to work. There are no advancement opportunities and ever since they have run the place into the ground while implementing precision scheduled railroading, all of the smart rats have already run down the ropes of the burning ship and swam away to shore."
bad,Their only concern is every dollar they think they can save. Employees are only seen as an expense. This company will fire anyone for anything and make sure everyone knows the share holders are the only important people in the mix. They’ll trip over a dollar to save a penny without any concern for the big picture. Currently on a track of destruction with only short term gains in sight. Union Pacific will eventually derail and the new leadership will be left trying to rebuild long after the current heads have cashed out
bad,"The pay is amazing as are the benefits but your job is never secure, you can and will be furloughed and fired for any reason. The company does not see you as a person just a number."
bad,"I was fired in 2017 because a cabbie female lied about me calling her kid the ""N"" word because I state that ""it"" was pretty.  she assumed that ""it"" meant the N word while I meant that  ""it"" was a pretty child."
bad,"I loved working on trains, learning new skills, and taking in more responsibility. What was most frustrating is 30% of workers are lazy and make the rest suffer, union does nothing for you, management is disconnected, clueless, and treats everyone like theyre a number. No bonuses for anyone thats not a manager, no incentive for hard workers since everyone gets paid the same. No sick leave and PTO is horrible, have to wait 18 years to get 4 weeks! You get bumped around from shift to shift with weird days off constantly since everything is based on seniority, and once you have enough seniority to hold a decent schedule management abolishes those jobs and posts only jobs with horrible days off for no reason!"
bad,"If all you want is money and benefits and don't mind not have good work/life balance, then here you go. The culture is toxic, union versus management at all levels. Money allows you to provide well for your family, but you don't have the time to spend with them."
bad,Precision railroading is great for short term share holders but at the cost of safety and employees. the management is gutting the place trying to get the operating ratio to give the top more money
bad,"Money-hungry upper-echelon will send you home in a minute if it means pleasing investors and packing on a bonus for themselves. "
bad,Be careful they lay you off without giving you time. They do micromanage and company has cut a lot of things that they use to do for their employees..
bad,"I worked for the UP for 5 years as a Crew Dispatcher, which is a Union position. Rather than an cooperative attitude, top management took an adversarial approach with workers.  Additionally, they are more concerned with diversity quotas rather than obtaining competent workforce to advance."
bad,"It's an unfair company in all aspects. If I had to make a decision and do it all over again, I would have made another decision.  The pay is good and Fair"
bad,"After returning from my third deployment (second as an employee of UP) I was told that ""I needed to decide if I wanted to be an officer in the Army or a manager at UP."""
bad,"Would not recommend to anyone.  There is no job security with Union Pacific.  Management is exactly with it is, management.  There are no leaders in the organization.  Quality of life is poor.  UP has not and will not address rest issues and concerns.  This cause safety issues and concerns which has resulted in fatalities and personal injuries.  As TE&Y employees, you will not have a lot of time to spend with your family."
bad,"Terrible management poor planning"
bad,Would not recommend this job to work. Everybody on first and second shift will try to find someone one you and tell that you haven't done anything and try to get you fired
bad,Work life balance Is not followed and is a major set back having to carry a phone 24 7  responding to set backs or intruptions.     If you try to take a vacation your made to feel guilty and a ton of work is geared for you once you get back!    There’s no structure to when you can take a vacation.    It may or may not be approved by senior management
bad,"Great benefits, but they come at a price. As a conductor for the railroad, you are required to stay by the phone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The company uses you to their advantage without considering your personal life. The rules and regulations are strictly enforced upon union employees, however it is ok for the management to treat you unfairly."
bad,"People are quick to take credit for your knowledge, and will stab you in the back at any given chance. The work place there is very cliquey, and has an unhealthy atmosphere."
bad,"typical work day was anywhere from 12-15 hr days/nights, the culture as an OMT is deceptive....once finished the OMT program, it becomes a different world, especially if you are female. Sexism, harassment is rampant......reporting this to upper management only gets you labeled as a trouble maker and it becomes even worse. HOWEVER, the crews are amazing, they treated me with respect and taught me much.....this was the only enjoyable part of the job"
bad,"Union Pacific has drowned its employees with red tape. Management likes to hide from afar and watch employees with a spotting scopes, waiting for them to make the smallest error. For instance the moment you remove your ear plugs be prepaid to receive punishment. "
bad,"The brotherhood between some of the workers were great, made some great friends there. But what killed the job was management. Lots of people including myself have left there because of management. I'm really surprised the national reps have not got involved yet to see why everyone is leaving or to address what our concerns were."
bad,This company has great pay and benefits. But when business is slow they lay off starting with the new guys so you have to be willing to find other work.
bad,Worked for company over 20 years company is only about themself will throw any employee under the bus to save a few bucks.no FAMILY value don't care about your safety just how much it will cost them.If you get a raise it goes to the yearly health insurance hike.so you dont see any money just pay taxes on the raise.
bad,"I left a steady job to work for the U.P. and was layed off with in a year. I asked in my interview 3 different times if they had enough work for new hires and was told in no uncertain terms, yes."
bad,You'll make great money and have an amazing retirement if you can last that long. The railroad life/work balance is a tough one. It is often said you get paid for the difficulty it brings to your life and family not for the difficulty of the job.
bad,It’s a great job for someone who’s single. I worked for them for 5 years and never met anyone who was still married to their first wife. The work is not difficult but you will be on call 24/7 for the first few years and you will probably never work first shift until you’re ready to retire. Management is always trying to fire you.  Benefits are pretty good as well as retirement. The whole time I worked for them I ended up having to move four times. Best fit for this job are former service members or oilfield hands.
bad,"The good .... The Gross pay looks awesome on paper and the medical benefits are excellent. Most of your coworkers are just normal down to earth people who are fun to be around."
bad,Do not work for them they care only about shareholders and money they do not care about your family life and most of your managers their job is to find a reason to fire you stay away from this company
bad,if your looking for job security this isn't the place. the pay is good. work life balance sucks at first but eventually gets better. use this job as a stepping stone.
bad,Always working on call and have 2 hours to get there when your phone rings. There are a million ways to get fired. worked there for about a year and a half before they furloughed 100's of us. They are in the process of getting rid of every single job they can and still move trains. not really a good time work there.
bad,"I wasn’t planning on writing a review, but my company just sent me an email today congratulating me on 5 years of service and requested that I leave a review on here. "
bad,Retirement is good but the first 4 or 5 years will be rough. I could go on and on about certain things but it's the type of job you will have to experience for yourself. There are so many thing you are not told and you are left to figure things out on your own
bad,"The job was not hard, however, management made it almost impossible to complete your tasks at hand. You were only allowed to use the tools that the company deemed was the proper tool for the job. This list was given by engineers who had never worked on equipment. Toward the end of the company reduction, supervisors and managers were hiding and lying in wait to write an employee up on some type of infraction to expedite the reduction. The first layoff came right after Thanksgiving, with no notice. The company is driven by greedy investors."
bad,this isn't a job i'd recommend to anyone that's looking for consistency or stability. i've been with the company for 5 years and looking at my second furlough
bad,"Great Benefits for retirement and health care"
bad,"Laid off constantly. No stability, couldn't hold down a job. Empty promises about work incredibly poorly managed. All about the stock holders. Have a quota on how many people they have to fire."
bad,"The job itself is only as tough as you make it. However, the culture is counterintuitive to improving productivity. You are constantly looking over your shoulder, fearing you will get fired or furloughed."
bad,Toxic environment designed to make shareholders more money with no thought given to the employee or their family. Morale is horrible and at an all time low. People with 14 years plus experience don't know if they'll have a job tomorrow.
bad,"easy work, learned a lot about the railroad, management isnt the greatest, work place culture is decent, hardest part of the job is there is no set schedule"
bad,"Hard place to work. Managers are always against you. If you work hard it really wont get you anywhere, everything is seniority based, and you get paid by the day, or a trip rate if your on the road."
bad,"I have currently been with Union Pacific for about 5.5 yrs. I have been laid off once for 11 months and it looks like I am going to be laid off again soon. The company is all about maximizing profits at all costs. I enjoy the work I do most days and the pay is good, but employees are treated like second class citizens by the management. There is nothing personal about the company or management they treat everyone like they are expendable."
bad,The pay and benefits are amazing. I hated everything else. There is no way to have a life outside of work. The managers are always looking g to fire you. I don't recommend working here
bad,"Constant layoffs, do not care about safety, very bad management with little to no experience, horrible working shifts and hours, no quality of life or moral builders"
bad,Overall terrible working environment. Mechanical departments might as well be considered step children to transportation department. Every day is like the first day they moved freight. Left wishing it wasn’t such a toxic culture on both management and union sides
bad,"Overall experience with Union Pacific has been bad. You will be on call 24/7 with no predictable schedule. The ""train line up"" is never accurate, so when you think you wont get a call to go to work for 24 hours and then all of a sudden your phone rings. So even though they do pay well, you will not have time to spend said money. Management does not care whether or not you are experienced with the job tasks for the day, they simply want the train moved from point A to B. Obviously that is extremely dangerous. Overall toxic environment between management and rail crews. The job itself is quite easy as long as you are well rested and are familiar with the train / work to be done for that trip. "
bad,"Long hours compensated with a good salary, no quality of life and current management is not engaged with the employees."
bad,Not a good place to depend on for job security. Management micromanaged you thru a lot of everyday work. Not a family atmosphere. Not a good company. Be ready to get furloughed( laidoff) a lot in you first 5 yrs
bad,Affordable benefits and great retirement.  People who works crafts are an amazing group.  Mangament and corporate do a poor job of communicating with craft personal and this leads to lots of downtime. Efficiency is affected. They preach safety first but that goes out the window if a train is running late....and they're usually running late being the planning for outbound trains is consistently poor. The Director at the shop (Commerce) is disliked by all of his employees because he never ever has anything good to say about the hard work that everyone does. He bring moral down and that leads to negative attitudes by everyone
bad,"Not the same Railroad your parents knew. Everyone is looking to jump ship. Stay away. Start a career where you can finish it, not just get laid off until further notice"
bad,Frequent furloughs for unknown amounts of time with little to no warning leaving you jobless with no money coming in and depending on how long you’ve been there a short amount of time to keep your insurance benefits. Management always seems to be looking for people to fire for the smallest things and are very disrespectful like they are on a constant power trip.
bad,A typical day at work was usually fast paced and full of complicated problems to solve.  Now the constant eventuality of being laid off dulls the mood and makes it hard to want to continue employment with the company.
bad,"I had to come to work every day with people who didn’t won’t to be there and hated their jobs, and this was because of very poor management with little or no communication. They prefer you to work every weekend as opposed to having a schedule that would offer at least some weekends off with your family. Vacation is hard to take because you have to compete with everyone  who has more senerioty than you, whether they are in a different department or not. When I was laid off, and I was laid off twice, and even during my entire tenure there I was always treated like a number. Mind you, this was during record annual and quarterly profits when they decided to layoff.  Not only do they not offer any sick days, they expect you to take off two days with no pay and a have a doctor’s note for those two days to be accepted as an excused absence. The absentee notes (doctor’s note, obituary, etc.) are collected at the end of the year, so you have to keep up with them, and hope you don’t lose them or have your wife accidentally throw them away. The rules were long and distinguished and very difficult to understand. Even the supervisors were confused about a lot of the rules. Despite this, they were very strict and ruthless with implementation of their rules. If it wasn’t for the pay, cheap health insurance, and retirement, I would have ran the other way as fast as I could. This company definitely taught me that money isn’t everything."
bad,Great company as long as you possess internal railroad business skills.  Friendly environment. lots of opportunity for contractors.  limited growth opportunity
bad,This company has made it perfectly clear that employees are merely a liability that they have to live with. Management seems to set policy that is intentionally burdensome for no reason.
bad,Other sr directors did not listen and overreacted immediately when they didn't agree or hear what they wanted to hear.  When the last chief mech officer retired about 3 years ago it went downhill.  Now cutting to make operating ratio from 63 to 55%.  They monitored me going in and out of the building.
bad,"The work is good, the facility is old and decrepit. The management does not take care of their people at all. The company only cares about making money for the shareholders."
bad,"There is a succeed at all costs mentality at Union Pacific, at the steep cost of employees work/life balance.  This in turn leads to high turnover, both voluntary and involuntary."
bad,"Started out to be a great job. However the company and the executives just became all about numbers. Record profit years but the shareholders weren’t happy and wanted more. The executives don’t care  about the people actually doing the work, just pacifying the shareholders. This meant work force reductions nearly every year, give more work and less resources to do it with. If they really cared about the employees that way they say, the actions of the company would be different. I was told by more than one long term employee that Union Pacific used to be a great company to work for."
bad,Seniority based. Hard if you are married with kids. Never know when you will work. Sometimes forced to location you have never been to before. No weekends off until you have about 10 years of service.
bad,"They tell you to open your bank account and the company will fill it. This is true when you can work. Company management is a complete joke. Everything they do is to justify their existence, none of it relates to getting the job done efficiently. Hardest part of the job is trying to figure out when and where your next job will be. Can go weeks without working."
bad,"The railroad is a place where all of your time will be spent either at work or waiting on a call to go to work. If you are looking to have a career with balance with life, then do not go to the railroad."
bad,"UPRR is a great place to work when it comes to financial progressiveness as long as you are money smart. However, they expect you to work crazy hours and that your dedication to their company above everything (including family, friends, health). The company is going through a change where they are steady cutting operational capabilities in order to reach a certain goal so they can improve stock value. In order to do this causes its management team and union employees constant stress that causes a lot of conflict. Different lifestyle from any other industry."
bad,"Good pay and benefitals, easy work. But work/home ratio is very poor never get to see my family. Hard work is never rewarded in this company. If you have family this might not be the place for you. Also management goes through this place like no other."
bad,"Good salary but very hard on family life. You are gone from home anywhere from 30 to 80 hours at a time. I missed many Christmases, Birthdays, Graduations, ect. working for the Rail Road."
bad,"I rather not go into details but if you are looking for decent pay and no life with your family...train dispatching is the job for you. If you do no have a family member working in a high place do expect fair treatment. As a woman you are almost forced to decide if you want to have a family because when you do, you are looked down upon. You are a number."
bad,"Great pay WHEN you actually get to work.  Employed for 3+ years and spent half of that time furloughed.  Constantly getting bumped and moved around.  Wasted more money on hotels and travel than I actually made over the last 5 months."
bad,you are constantly looking over your shoulder to see if management is watching for the slightest mistake or anything they can interpret as something they can twist into a violation.
bad,They tell you how much they care about the employee. You are nothing but a number that they want to fire. They have to many managers that do not have knowledge of the job: but are always watching you.
bad,"No work life balance, working 12+ hour days with odd schedules 11 days on with 2 days off.  If any other managers are on vacation you can work 22 days with 2 days off 10 times a year.  No job security, high management turnover."
bad,"People stay at Union Pacific because of the benefits/pensions.  However, if you don't get that, you may wonder how this company stays in business.  It is incredibly old school.  Management tends to be in the 60-70s, so they still think they are working in the 60s and 70s.  Not a fun place to work, though there are many smart people here."
bad,"Pros ...Great pay /Operating Locomotives"
bad,We monitor the business critical systems that support the business and act to resolve problems when issues arise. I don't feel that my college education in being used so it feels like I waste a lot of time and money. I would like to move my career in a more creative path. Some of my most rewarding internship experience was time I spent on software development teams. Management acts a mollification artists and lacks the capability to solve any work issues employees encounter.
bad,"Day typically starts around 430-5am to get ready for conference calls and start daily planning.  Service unit review; productivity, budget, on plan scheduling, and conference calls is my typical day.  I travel about two days a week to visit my locations away from my home office."
bad,"Never worked for a Company before in my life that HATES its own personal as much as Union Pacific. They FORCE you into the Union, Zero Work Garenteed, Virtually ZERO Union Protections, Seniority Based Pull board for work. ALWAYS GONE, with NO LIFE outside of work."
bad,"management is very unprofessional "
bad,"Appears everyone is a Manager or has a title."
bad,Not very good working hours or days. Have no idea when you go to work when you will be home. Very poor management that constantly changes. Benefits and paychecks are the plus.
bad,"Been there 8 years and getting ready to be furloughed. "
bad,Travel often (some unruly places); Union dues every month; per diem is below national average; overall a great start in employment; here for retirement
bad,"knowing what i know know about the company,i would not apply to work there.there are no more safety meeting before we start work to emphasize  safety in the work place, this was so important to all of the employees."
bad,"The culture on the mechanical team was stay at your desk and look busy.  The time off program was terrible (10 days/year for first 5 years).  It is def a man's world.  Also, not a great place for a parent who is primary caregiver."
bad,Was a great company to work for until furlough.  A lot of opportunity for over-time.  Good benefits.  I worked in the yard and was able to go home every night to see my family.  Road conductor is much different.
bad,The company upgrades people from field working as electricians to higher levels in office with lack of training on good conducts and communication skills.
bad,Precision Railroading is destroying a once Great Railroad. Work load increases then goes away completely. Questioned for doing your job when following the Companies own Standard Work Practices.
bad,"If you enjoy unskilled managers that only specialize onmicromanaging, threatening, and poor planning? Than this is the place for you. Say goodbye to weekends and holidays..Union fees going up every year, medical fees going up every contract,  union literally bending over and doing nothing while th company treats its employees like rodents while they champagne it up with investors and planning the next furlough massacre. Don't take my word for it. Talk to a machinist or electrician that works here. Every engineer or conductor will tell u it's the best."
bad,Pay and benefits are about as good as it gets for a mechanic. Outside of that your not getting anything. You can expect to work evenings and weekends for 5-10 years at a minimum starting out. Vacation time allotted is not very good. You have no sick days.
bad,It’s a very hostile work environment. The management is very aggressive.  Just a doggy dog environment.  They do not care about their employees families or them.
bad,Your only a number. Your only a number. Again your only a number. 7 digits.  That’s all you are. Don’t waste your time.  Your family will hurt and you will too.
bad,"This place cares very little for the people who do all the work. They only care about putting money in the stock holders pockets."
bad,"The co just wants a warm body on a train. They don’t care if you’re brain dead because you’re so tired and have had no sleep. The hours off are not enough to complete life chores such as laundry, shopping, eating, sleeping before it’s time to go back to work.  You must pick what is important to you and do without the others. Never mind the fact that you have no time for family time. You’re threatened with being fired if you take any time off. There are zero scheduled days off.  You are on call 24-7 and you work just about 15-7! It’s a very dangerous job to begin with, but with lack of time off it is tenfold dangerous. They have a saying there—- some ppl employees have made it into a bumper sticker for their vehicle. "
bad,"After several workforce reductions the past few years, two large ones in the past 6 months, it has become abundantly clear that Union Pacific is only concerned with one stakeholder in the company - its shareholders. There is little concern for employees and the workload that is placed onto them after jobs are cut (the employees that are left behind are worse off being stuck at Union Pacific) and the executives leading the company are HUGELY disconnected from the employee base. While the benefits at Union Pacific are above average, I would never recommend it as a place to work until the leadership changes and more focus is placed onto other stakeholders with the company (employees, customers, or communities)."
bad,Terrible work environment. Management treats their employees like garbage. Not their fault though. That is the way they train their management. They train them to use the bully or intimidation method. The while place has bad moral. Nobody wanted to be there. Don't go there.
bad,"Currently going through an organizational restructure, so the culture is less than ideal.  Once the the new structure is rolled out and more complete, may get better."
bad,"Have worked at UP for over 10 years, and I would not honestly recommend this job to anyone with a family. There is no schedule and your home/family life will suffer due to this. "
bad,"I worked as a Special Agent for Union Pacific for approximately three years before being laid off. I was offered  a full relocation/move package to keep my position. "
bad,Managers don't have a clue. And not proactive for helping. Only care about firing someone!!!!! Being on call 24hr Our health coverage sucks. and the privacy act is violated. your watched 24/7 No where to change cloth if caught in the rain or ect.
bad,Very talented employees with strong dedication to company vision.  Union Pacific has embarked on a new strategic direction.  It is an interesting time to be a part of the continuous improvement efforts.
bad,Worker moral is horrible. Management is bad but company culture makes it that way. Unless you have 8 years or more of seniority your work schedule will change a lot.
bad,Shareholders run the company and most higher-ups have no backbone. No one stands for their people and everyone fears for their job. It is a more stressful job than it should be. Drains you with so much negativity floating around. The culture has changed for the worst.
bad,"UP is money hungry and doesn't matter how much they work their employees.  The have to pay their investors. "
bad,market is great but the greedy management in omaha only care about their pockets and laid us off a week after thanksgiving. would not recommend them whatsoever
bad,"Been a thru-freight conductor here for 14 years. Pay gets great in time. This is a union job so if you’re anti-union look elsewhere. Your first five years are very difficult as you don’t make full wage and you’ll be furloughed (laid off without pay) every winter. Job assignments are determined by seniority, so more time on the job = better shifts and more money. Road conductors work on call 24/7 365. Management is incompetent and will try to fire you. If you can handle all of that this is a great career with a nice pension."
bad,"Union Pacific used to be an awesome place to work.  But, due to the change in the corporate environment, it has become terrible.  The only thing that could make it decent is if you have a good manager (I had an awesome manager!!)"
bad,I have worked for 40 years and I have never seen a more adversarial work relationship between labor and management. Most employees I met asked me why I was going to work for the company.  They don't hide the fact that you will not have a life outside the job.  The divorce rate of the employees is extremely high.
bad,"Union Pacific Railroad has a long and proud history.  That history has been tainted by a short-sighted executive team that risks the legacy, customer satisfaction, performance and safety in order to meet some unrealistic performance numbers.  The workplace culture has been terribly damaged since the current CEO took control.  He has created a workplace environment that used to be one of loyalty to one of suspicion.  The strategy has been reduced to a variety of performance measures so management makes poor decisions in order to make the numbers.  It is very sad.  Hopefully, the board will recognize the CEO's shortcomings before he does irreversible damage to the company."
bad,"The current set of managers whom work for the UPRR on a local level, are unintelligent, and have no prior work experience doing what your assigned duties are, therefore; if you like to work for a place that hire off the street, or fresh out of college degree pedigree management, but no practical knowledge of what it is they instruct you to do. Than this is the place for you."
bad,"The work required was interesting.  The benefits and pay were awesome.  Management and union labor relations are in the toilet.  It was not uncommon for a laborer to tell off a manager and get away with it.  Violations of policy were often ""worked out"" by the union protecting a piece of trash employee.  I take pride in my work and didn't care for the constant barrage of new guy abuse and utter disrespect for management exhibited by my peers.  It could be the best place in the world to work if the relationship were not so adversarial."
bad,A typical day at union pacific starts off with a b/s safety meeting as management tries to act like they care about your safety. After we go to work management walks around looking for someone braking one of the 10000 rules we have here so they can write them an ftx (ticket) that management says doesn't mean anything. The most enjoyable part of this job is going home.
bad,"I didn't have a problem working for the company. The work was good for a college student, but it could get very stressful and they changed the hiring test to something very complicated with no way to study. Lots of layoffs."
bad,"This company provided me a great learning experience to management, but I would not spend my entire life here. There is no work-life balance and there is a major rift between management and the ground employees that is caused by upper level leadership instilling this culture into managers"
bad,"very little job security, always threatened to be fired in train service, not a place of employment with positive attitudes."
bad,Great pay and benefits for employee. Hard environment to learn in with little help or direction from management and senior co-workers. Very little time for family working for the railroad.
bad,i've been there 3 years now and i'm about to be furloughed. the company is super greedy and all you are is just another number to them. absolutely no family life and you can go ahead and cancel all the plans you ever had.
bad,Look up precision railroading and the damage it has done and is still doing to the employees and the culture. If you value your home life and would like to be appreciated for your efforts this is not the company for you.
bad,"The Union Pacific is a company that prides it’s self on safety. But that is only if it doesn’t cost the company anything or get in the was of production."
bad,Direct managers were great... CEO is appealing to investors by cutting corners and making work conditions unsafe.  One minute you think your job is safe ... the next your worried about having one. The pay and benefits are great.. they do not match any 401k ... alot of traveling... Usually 8 days working 10 hour days... 6 days at home... you travel to work on your days off.
bad,"When first started it was an enjoyable place to work. Then management changed and the moral took a dive. They tend to not take care of their people anymore, but their stocks are doing great and that's all they care about. A lot of layoffs are going on."
bad,Quality of life is not good here. Treated more like a chess piece than a chess player. There is a high rate of burn out. Leadership is more of a dictatorship. Not a lot of leading going on.
bad,They pay and benifits are good but the company doest care about employees just money. They start you off feeling good but then you go on furlough out of no where.
bad,"Working as a field manager for Union Pacific, there is no work life balance it's a work/on-call imbalance, to the point that some managers actively try to prevent you from taking your entitled vacation time so that it expires, because ""You're either railroad or you're not."" "
bad,"The work is not hard, and with it being a union shop even though you may work hard and stay busy its all seniority based.  This company is known for doing layoffs without any notice.  Not a reliable career choice unless you work at a major location and even then its not a guarantee that you'll be around until you retire."
bad,"Don't apply for a job unless you have a back up plan. The company is not stable until you've been there for years. Make sure not to burn any bridges before seeking employment at Union Pacific, you will more than likely need them later."
bad,After getting a tax break from Congress UP is still cutting jobs. Makes it hard to work there when every week you are looking over your shoulder to see who is getting cut next. This after they already cut a number of jobs and said they were done.
bad,My time at Union Pacific was overall disappointing. The culture of the facilities where I worked was incredibly negative. The unions prohibited productivity and led to downsizing because of this. I left voluntarily to obtain a more reasonable work life balance and to advance my career.
bad,"Union Pacific operates 24/7, 365 days a year. Holidays are observed, but many departments require you to work through them, including the major holidays. "
bad,Its a hard company to work for because it feel as soon as they hire you they are trying to show you out the door. if you have a flexible scheduled and can take being laid off for a few yeas it will be a great place to work
bad,Job is non-stop and quality of life is not there. The hours are long and pay does not match the hours worked. Even with 20+ years experience many decisions are questioned by less experienced bosses. New managers are told they are gods to union employees and have lack of reality dealing with mangers and union employees alike.
bad,"They hire, hire, hire, and furlough, furlough, furlough. Taking a job with UP was one of my worst-ever career decisions. Training is a joke. You will not be ready to go out on your own."
bad,"Poor work-life balance, No control over work hours i.e. start times changed often, nights one week, mid-shift the next, constantly forced to other locations hundred or more miles from home. Union representation were political, Management was over bearing and we were followed around during work shifts like criminals."
bad,"Great job, great benefits but will have no family life. Have to be married to the railroad. Worked at least 62 to 65 hours a week every week, but the pay was great. Very mentally challenging working with union employees and another management daily."
bad,You're always under a microscope. There letting the intra-structure deteriorate while putting money in stock holders pockets.  The Middle and Lower Management takes the grunt of all bad decision that come down from above. NOT a friendly place to work.
bad,"Stay away from this company if you desire:"
bad,"Extremely unstable if you're hired on the back end of the hiring wave. They will force assign you to another area of your service unit when you are furloughed, which will result in you living out of your vehicle. The pay is not that great after retirement, union dues, and an always increasing medical premium is deducted. Never encountered as many lazy employees as I did working for UP. Guys will layoff on a regular basis and play games to get days off. Once you learn the job it is the easiest job you will ever have in your life."
bad,"Union Pacific has become a terrible place to work.  The Manager's could care less about employees and are focused on their year end bonuses.  They treat their people like they are in jail watching you in all ways so they can fire you.  The hours suck and you work with a bunch of unhappy people."
bad,"The issue is the fact that they pay you a solid wage, they tend to take a little bit from you.  When you show up for work, they own you for 12+ hours if they want, and it depends on the managers on duty."
bad,"By following the company's policy, we transport customers products safely and efficient. I've learned all the requirements to be a certified conductor. Also with a promotion I've learned all the requirements to be a certified locomotive engineer. When working with coworkers as a team to get the job done, it is very important to have communication and trust in each other. The hardest part of the job is worrying about losing your job. From there massive layoffs to holding you accountable for someone else's negligence because you were working together. The best part is the medical benefits it has for your family."
bad,Union Pacific pays pretty well and the retirement benefits are great. You wont have much time with your family as the schedule is very unpredictable and the job is very unstable.
bad,High-stress you didn't know when but you did know....they find a way to get you fired. Bottom line and Stock holders are all upper management worries about with this mask of safety and we care about your family
bad,"Reader,"
bad,"The work life balance is horrible. I work an average of 13 hour days 6 straight days to get 3 days off. Now mind you, I work the night shift. I go in at 5:30pm and leave by 6:30am. So when I work 6 days, my 6th day goes into my 1st off day already. And the 3 off days are offset between the management team. I went 2 straight months not seeing a single weekend. I work 2 daylight 13 hour shifts every 3 months. The bonus doesn't reflect how hard we've worked when the company keeps cutting resources and employees. When is enough enough?"
bad,"I was looking forward to a career, instead I was treated like a individual who knew nothing about maintenance and was looked down upon by management. I was never more happy to leave a company."
bad,"UP pays well but with this new program to increase stockholder income it is hurting the workers. there are no spare trucks when they brake down. the infrastructure is in terrible shape and there is very little done to fix or improve roads, buildings or facilities except for the office staff and upper management. Layoffs are coming. less payroll means more profit even it means sacrificing quality inspections and air tests. UP will often step over a dollar to pick up a dime and yet they still make billions yearly. UP is manager and executive heavy. They seldom consult the work force on how to improve the processes. There are tons of rules and many managers eager to write you up for missteps."
bad,dont do it unless you really want to live there keep safe at work and follow all rules while working dont get discracted by the management team hiding
bad,The work life balance doesn't match up.  Be prepared for a huge disconnect from the field and corporate offices.  Agreement employees will work against you and your work schedule will not allow you to have full weekends off.
bad,"UPRR was a good stepping stone for me, but many people like them as a full time career. The job was enjoyable in the nicer months, but more miserable in the colder months."
bad,Great job and career! Long hours great benefits for a family to build.. besides the attendance policy's it's a great company I hope everyone can enjoy a great experience.
bad,"12 sometimes 15 hr shifts, I only had one Supervisor who took the time to teach the things that would allow me to move forward in the company.  You do not get brakes you eat when you can, I did enjoy working with my employees they never gave me a dull moment."
bad,"Union Pacific is a very different place to work than any other job because of the chaotic schedule. Being on call 24/7 and unable to plan things ahead of time can be very draining on an individual and their health and on family harmony. I get called anytime day or night one and one half hours before I'm on duty and then UP has me for 12 hours, or more sometimes. I'm only allowed to perform duty for 12 hours but that doesn't mean I won't sit around waiting for a ride home or to a hotel for another 5 or 6 hours depending on if someone in the Omaha dispatching center has thought ahead or not. "
bad,I DO NOT WORK FOR UNION PACIFIC I ONLY WORK ON THEIR YARD UNION PACIFIC IS A VERY GOOD EMPLOYER TO WORK FOR. very little chance for advancement little pay long hours with no brakes no raises what so ever. No sympathy from higher ups what so ever or gratitude. no over time until over 10 hours of work. Caliber auto transfer higher ups wonder why no one is willing to go the extra mile. My ramp manger is a good guy glad to be on his team anyone beyond that not so much.
bad,"not that bad if you like working midnights and poor management"
bad,"They ask"
bad,Union Pacific is a great place to work if your only looking for benefits. They care more about money than anything else. The safety of their Employees only goes so far
bad,I hired out 2018 and was laid off in Oct.2019. The benefits were good and pay was great but you have no home life. That is unless you want to lay off all the time.
bad,Really enjoyed working here until Precision Scheduled Railroading started taking effect.   The Company has put the safety of the communities it works in to increase the bottom line.   Employees with almost 10 years of seniority are being furloughed and injuries and derailments are at an all-time high.
bad,"I absolutely loved my work at UP. I was able to make a lot of friends, and great money for my skill level. At a local level with the co-workers, it's family like. Like most companies, you're just a number to anyone in management on up to the CEO. Management has a job to do, and they do what they're told, or else they'll be replaced quickly."
bad,"Union Pacific makes you jump through hoops in order to get your position, then layoffs/furloughs staff. Company is laying off people in all departments everywhere, ""in order to be more efficient.""  They are trying to run the railroad on bare minimum, and in the process, others are getting worn out. CEO's  are greedy, and just trying to make more money for shareholders. The morale at the company is very low."
bad,It was a great job to have before corporate greed stepped in and started laying off workers to further fill the pockets of shareholders and management.
bad,"Do you like Christmas?  Your children's birthdays?  Forget all that with the Union Pacific.  Its a fun job but you won't get to live a real life.  You will envy the schedules of police officers, nurses, on-call doctors, etc. You will have no schedule.  But once you get seniority (10-15 years) its less terrible, but by then you're on your second divorce.  Good luck folks, it'll pay the bills but you'll also lose your friends, your health, and family.  I am not kidding or just being negative."
bad,Union Pacific is a privately owned company with stockholders so any instability in the stock price can affect your job status and employment if you are lower in seniority which makes job security non-existent.
bad,The job is not difficult but the work ethics are poor. I feel the management hide in the bushes to try to fire you for simple reasons that can be easily coached.
bad,"good benefits, constant work. unorganized, no quality of life time. enjoyed the work , great coworkers, stressful job , and vary dangerous,  on call 24 hours a day."
bad,"Very complicated place to work,  don't expect weekends off, and not good shifts, not enough work force, not holidays or personal days off. not sick days"
bad,I love working for them but I don’t like how they treat their employees. You hire them send them through all this training and then lay them off. That’s the only turn off I have against the company.
bad,"I do not wish to review. They are laying off nothing good to say about them. My job got cut, and they keep cutting but make record profit. They aren’t hiring. I don’t know what else to say about them. Good benefits pay is okay. Worrying about your job while they make so much money sucks"
bad,"At the beginning I was extremely excited to work at UP, but after getting thrown around and mistreated for two years I had to give it up. If you think you’re going to stay at home you’re dead wrong, no social life is possible outside of work. When you want to work they don’t have work for you and they give you work at the most inconvenient time. Extremely good pay though."
bad,UP is a great job for single men who dont mind a struggle. Great benifits and pay if you can keep a job. Lots of time off work while you have young seniority that can be for better or worse. No work= no money
bad,"I was hired in 2014, job was going great until 2015. I was laid off for eight months beginning in November of 2015. The job was good but always had to watch your back because of management."
bad,My job at Union Pacific was great the pressures were substantial daily challenges and budgetary restraints made the job virtually impossible to be successful at
bad,Had a great time ...it is a tuff job at  times...seems like your sleeping or on the main line. The pay is absolutely there...if your single its a good job to have...most guys that are on the main line have been married and divorced a couple of times. If you have kids I don't recommend it
bad,"Learned alot on this assignment. Was able to complet what seemed like and impossible data center migration of a Tier 1 system with minimal downtime. Had to move 3 optical jukeboxes from St. Louis, MO. to Omaha, NE in a manner not to affect the massive customer service dept. Successfully pulled it of and gain allot of confidence and respect from my colleagues"
bad,Scheduling classes and preparation. Training fellow electricians in classroom and hands on. Learned technical aspects and training of Locomotives.  Management is multi tiered.  Love working with hands on projects and seeing a person have what is called and ah-ha moment.  The time when a person shows a intuitive showing that you taught them something.
bad,"In order to promote, you had to move. Managment was typical managmenent but healthcare for managers was extreamly poor compared to union healthcare and benifits"
bad,Union paciffic is all about courprut greed. This place was a great place to work now its all in shambles. The CEO and all the ones under him need to be fired trying to pull off a Enron stile money bagging.
bad,"its was a fantastic experience to be able to travel from town to town staying in very nice hotels, seen much landmarks and met a variety of different people. its an ethnically diverse company , fortune 250 company"
good,You never know if your working or not. Management treat you like your in kindrgarten. Very reactive company not proactive.
good,"This is a job that works all hours of the day with no notice for when you will be working. It isn't easy on you. You cannot not make appointments due to not knowing when you will be working. If you don't go to work, you will get into trouble. Yet at the same time they do not allow time for health appointments and such."
good,"I want to be home with my daughter, they under pay and show favoritism ."
good,No job security. Company changes its entire operation at the drop of a hat. If your seniority can't hold where you want to work then you're required to get bumped around to another location.
good,"Good company they just are uncertain of the direction that they are headed"
good,"Managers are looking to fire employees daily, get called all different times of the day and work some different attitudes daily."
good,Job is good and rewarding however they keep setting you up and then laying you off so much it is hard to plan anything. Management is made up of nonrailroaders. They try to tell 30+ year veterans how to do their job the way they think it needs to be done.
good,"Financially, great pay because I worked so much I never had time to spend it."
good,"union members were looked down upon by management."
good,No life at home if your a Minority good luck moving up you have to be in the in crowd to move up within the company even with a degree they will bypass you
good,"Currently the company is trimming the ""fat"".  Trying to do more work with less people. In the short term it will look good to stock holders but long term this company is going down the drain."
good,"Long hours great pay but no way of making plans being on call 24/. The lack of training is scary being, not even a good solid 6 weeks OJT and your lucky if you get the trains that you learn proper handling from."
good,"You will eventually become burnt out by the work load. Working 60+ hours a week days, nights weekends, and holiday will eventually drive you to seek employment else where"
good,"I was able to grow and gain invaluable skills at UPRR that I could use at my current job. this was a very solid place to work, but under staffed and over worked."
good,No family life have to work weekends and nights and holidays for a long time takes 20 years to hold a Saturday Sunday job on daylights. They layoff people then want you to work overtime to make up for it. Management follow you around to write up for every little thing. You will miss a lot of your kids stuff working here. And during the holidays if your rest days fall on the holidays they will force you to work 19 days straight. Vacation is terrible takes atleast 10 years before you can get a summer vacation.
good,"Great job just never knew when I was going to work, always on call. always under the scrutiny of management always trying to find you failing to fallow the rules."
good,"The company is all about Unified plan 2020, PSR and streamlining a service product that provides costumers with blah, blah, blah, blah. If you want a stable career, stable home life, and a healthy family. Just stay away from this place. You welcome."
good,Constantly laying off employees.  Work life balance was non existent.  They called and you went to work.  You could be home in a day or several days later.
good,be prepared to get laid off or bumped from your job.  if you do not have 5 years or more you are in danger of being bumped at any time. you show up to work and someone is there to take your job
good,"Your future with this company can be gone in the flash of an eye. The company pay well, but management focus is to fire you instead coaching and building you as an employee."
good,"Seniority rules at up it seems like anything less than 8 to 10 years its hard not to get displaced. Excellent benefits ,long hours,pay is outstanding for entry level positions."
good,But while your there you are going to work work work with little home time but it’s ok they pay for your time .......…..................................
good,very very hard work but retirement is good very very very hot   very hot bad management but workers we great uper management not so great but youll adapt
good,"Its a hard life so if your willing to sell your soul for a job that will never pay enough in the end then the railroad if for you.. Kiss the wife and kids goodbye , watch your kids grow up from a far. Lonely lonely lonely"
good,"The pay is good, but you never work 40 hrs, always closer to 60. Everyday you go to work wondering if you have a job with all the layoffs for the last five years. No forward movement, HR is terrible. There are other companies that provide way more benefits. UP is all about the $$, not the employees."
good,"Management has only one mission, to find a reason to fire someone. That is how they promote safety and rule conformity. No positive praise only negative. Pay is great, but you are on a rotating board so days off are sporadic. Everything is seniority based so don’t plan to work in your hometown unless it’s a major hub like Oakland, Roseville, Los Angeles, etc."
good,I liked all the people I worked with but the company as a whole does not care about the employees all they care about is making money with no regard to its employees and their family’s
good,"UP just implemented a new plan for more production wich all it was, the mechanics and electrician do 30% more work than before and fire 30 % of workforce...instead of actually coming up with ways of being more productive they just make u do more work. And this happens everytime there is a new C.E.O to show stockholder profit"
good,"Schedules are non-existent for a new hire. You will go where assigned when assigned or find yourself subject to discipline. Classroom training is good depending on your trainer. On the job training is woefully inadequate and you will hear constant ridicule from senior people about how much they dislike working with new-hires because of it. As if it's the new-hire's fault. Work-life balance really is the worst part though. Calling it a balance is a complete lie. You will learn to hate the sound of your phone as you're subject to call 24/7 unless its within 10 hours of your previous work (as your only guaranteed time off is at least 10 hours of mandatory rest after a ""shift""). "
good,"As the summary title states. There is no work/life balance. You are just a number. There is also a constant fear of furlough. Add on to that the terrible management and culture, and it's enough to make you miserable. The only reason most people stay is the pay and benefits."
good,"Pay is good. Seniority determines who gets the most desirable jobs. If you are low on seniority, you will get forced to live somewhere else to keep your job."
good,"Typical work day 12+ hours long wait time, managers always looking for way to discipline you. Not much time off for home life with a family while working extra board or road boards."
good,It is a great job for someone who does not want to have a life or ever see their family it does pay well and has great benefits but the hours are horrible
good,"UP has a strong Not Invented Here culture and an aversion to data based decision making.  There is a strong data culture in Operating and IT but a lack in Supply, Marketing, and HR."
good,"Get called to work with a  2-3 hour notice, any time of day or night, no schedule at all."
good,"I would not apply for a railroad job.  You will just get furloughed.  Money, benefits, insurance, and retirement are great while you still have them.  Other than that the lifestyle sucks weird hours, never home, on call 24/7 365 days of the year, managers are terrible.  The managers are out testing everyday trying to find failures to get their bonuses, micro-managed and their is NOT job security with the UP."
good,Running Locomotives is both challenging and rewarding. Being on call 24/7 and working every holiday takes its toll. Being on the road and in hotels every other day is extremely hard on a family.
good,"It was a small contractual company the job was heavy it was physical an outdoor job, the fun part of the job was interacting with coworkers and the weekend when no bosses where around. Hot days were a challenge to work in. Hardest part was when rules where changed constantly and safety manager was around. Had no lunch area so that was a challenge."
good,The typical work day could last 2 hours to 16 hours. I learned how to work with railroad cars and all FRA rules and regulations. Management or Non Union members could care less about their workers. I felt as if everyone was looking out for themselves. Another problem was never knowing what time work starts and what time work ends. My railroad career ended when they cut back and cut all of us off. Then could not tell anyone when we would be brought back on. The pay and benifits were great when working.
good,Its a great company if you are young with no family or older and more settled they offer great benefits and financial stability. Also the retirement is excellent.
good,"My experience was varied based on people. Coworkers were usually great to work with, management was usually terrible to deal with."
good,"With the implementation of Precision Scheduled Railroading many positions and jobs were eliminated. This did streamline the process somewhat, however, there are many managers who try to maintain the former culture toward rule violations of “big or small, fire them all”. Management is unwilling to work with those who actually perform the work, and most managers have never done the job."
good,"It all depends on seniority. The work aspect of the job is not bad, but at times job security can be stressful due to the constant economic changes and the company only see you as a number. I enjoy what I do I don’t enjoy inconstancy of the job."
good,"Upper management is out of touch with the industry and has made the company difficult at best to work with as a customer and getting worse by the minute as an employee. Paying stockholders profits over safety and sound operating practices. Unrealistic train lengths put the public and crews at risk. Poor maintenance of equipment placing crews at risk and increase the risk of derailments,"
good,"This company has good co-workers and great benefits. However, the management and company are going through serious changes. The cuts hit hard, and have every one with 5 years or less layed off."
good,working at union pacific could be very difficult for most. they do lay offf when slow but you do work days in a row when business is up. the pay is like nothing ive seen but with the government stepping in it kind of limits your money. you will be at work but you should understand the bump process quick because it would have you looking crazy in the beginning.
good,Don’t care about employees only money for shareholders at employees cost always trying to harass you at work and write u up no time for ur family always want u at work. No matter what will be on shift work for about five years on 24 hour call
good,Checking in and getting assigned to a vehicle. inspecting the vehicle and then waiting to get call for my first trip for the day. throughout the day I will complete several trip to and from different locations. The difficult times mostly when it rains heavy. I mostly enjoy interaction with people and the site seeing. At he end of the day have to fill the vehicle with gas and check it back in before going home.
good,"Environment is toxic.  Homophobia, misogyny are strongly prevalent.  Very strong disconnect between management and workers.  May be a result of complex union rules.  In your first year of employment allowed only three days off.  Because of seniority, following few years time off must be taken during first couple months of the year."
good,Could be the best company ever but the corporate worries more about making money and how much to line thenpocketa of investors and stock holder than what actually is going on!!
good,"Work is fine, no set schedule working road trains, management is bad. Great people that I worked with but management is out to try and fire you, especially if you try and take time off."
good,"Major Layoffs and job reductions are being made as we as management cuts and adjustments. Morale is at an all time low."
good,"Good pay and decent benefits, but management takes more away from its front line union employees every contract. You can provide a decent lifestyle for your family, but you'll never see them."
good,"The dispatch center is 24/7 operations. There are no flex hours or additional time off allotted for working 50+ hours, nights, and weekends. The culture is demanding, there is no concern for employee work/life balance. The culture is competitive and no room for advancement. The hardest part of the job is dealing with grieving families when an accident happens. "
good,Due to recruiting engineering college grads no longer does it matter how much knowledge you have accumulated and the desire to move up you can only go so far now. Went from management people who knew what they were doing which made for good management because they worked their way up. Now like myself you could end training college recruits that are placed in management jobs that you worked 13 years try to get to and now is not option
good,"no job is safe unless you are family with the bosses. If you are good at what you do ,you will not be promoted. Voicing your opinion is the first mistake. proving they are wrong is you final mistake.I did learn a valuable trades that is only valuable to union pacific "" track construction"". i can manage chaos with ease and deal with stresses that would kill the average man, while working 120 hour weeks. granted it has been 5 year since my last paycheck from you. overall union pacific is a railroad company. a person can stay in the shadows and have a 35 year career."
good,"Union Pacific is a great place to make a lot of money, but you won't have a life outside of work. The managers are always trying to fire guys as well."
good,"Although the benefits and retirement are excellent, it is not worth it when compared to work/life balance.  In this job, I was required to perform 24 hr coverage for 10 days before having 4 days off.  Sometimes those 4 days would be cancelled for little or no reason"
good,"No matter how good or skilled you are, the hammer falls on everyone.  Enjoyed running trains and working with some very good people.  Union shop, so politics and seniority rule the day."
good,"Every day, you are concerned that management is lurking in the bushes (aka weed weasels) waiting for you to make a mistake so the can fire you. No work/life balance, phone rings you go to work, never allowed to use personal leave days (compensated) to force use of sick time (uncompensated) to write you up for pattern layoff (which is any day you take off)."
good,"expect to be required to be available all the time. sounds like no big deal, but do it for a few years and see what it does to your psyche. made me sick, got me fired."
good,The industry is dong restructuring.  Be sure you know what you are getting into.  Benefits and salary are good.  Work life balance is not good but only 30 years to full retirement.
good,The management treat you like a number. They will work you for hours and days without any regard to your family life. Promotions and given to favorite and unqualified personnel.
good,"UP was wonderful to work with, but the weight of all the administrative regulations imposed by the Railroad and the Federal Railroad Administration makes it difficult to work and stay employed.  The days of hiring on with a big stable company like UPRR and having a 40 year career with a pension at the end, are over.  Technology with eventually automate lots of the railroad and there will be less need for manpower.  Look at technology for the future."
good,"Working for Union Pacific Railroad is both rewarding and challenging. The compensation and benefits are very good considering the qualifications and degree of difficulty, but the work environment and schedule are difficult to manage.  On-call, 24/7 including weekends and holidays and the company treats you like a number."
good,"typical work days are long and hard work is involved "
good,"Not a place to work if you are a single parent. As a crewman, you are required to go out on your train than come back and you leave when the board says. There is no set schedules and you are gone a day or two at a time and then come back. You work all hours of the day."
good,It's a good place to work but very unreliable when it comes to know if you still have a job... the CEO has implemented a new way of doing business which unfortunately hurts the employees
good,"I use to think this was a company I would retire from. Now, I'm not so sure. Layoffs seem like a weekly occurrence and nobody feels secure in their jobs anymore."
good,"Enjoyed my job, liked what i did, good pay, but the company does not care about its employees.  Money is their number one priority. Poorly managed business."
good,"This job requires constant walking on rigid rock at times for long periods of time. Can be very stressful in every way , physically, mentally, etc. You have a lot to on your plate in order to get the job done every day. The pay is decent but your body can take a toll."
good,"Management for the most part really do not care about the Clerks. the two locations i went to had horrible management. The work itself is really fun and cool, but the management is horrendous and fake. Any little thing they will try to get rid of you and they are big on favoritism."
good,"All management and most foreman for the most part are the biggest snakes and two face liars you'll ever come across, the company would be just as safe and better off without management doing anything to cut jobs and reprimand for duties that might not even apply to your craft. Ran by idiots"
good,"Transformational Supply Chain leader and Executive candidate who leads turnarounds to achieve top division rankings and KPIs, and company-wide strategic and sustainable change. Frequently promoted to lead high revenue divisions. Drive operational excellence through exceptional people leadership, broad collaboration, and continuous improvements. Build trusted relationships with Federal and state agencies, diverse unions, and key local leaders. Calm in high pressure volume, and challenging customer situations."
good,"Loved it at first then management got to involved with our work, that’s when things started to go south. I loved moving locomotives and putting them together according to the map that was given to me."
good,"Like the rest of corporate America, the company has placed stock prices and shareholder value above the needs of its staff,  field workforce and management. "
good,24/7/365 career. Low seniority for 15 years means off shifts (2pm - 10pm or 10pm to 6am) with bad rest days. I had Tuesday and Wednesday off for years.  Big corporations mean you're just a number and software is slowly taking a bigger role in being the big brother watching you.
good,"Although the pay is decent, you will have no life outside the railroad for years and by the time you do have time away from the railroad everyone you care about has moved on and will no longer be there to enjoy. The only attraction to working here is the retirement if you live long enough to actually collect"
good,The job used to be good until everything was all about the almighty dollar for the stockholders. Management has to make a name for themselves and let's their ego get bloated.
good,Great benefits with decent pay when compared to other class 1 railroads. On call 24/7 which makes it tough to maintain work/life balance. Its a great career and I wish I would have found out about the opportunity sooner.
good,"Seems like you work to excel however we are constantly threatened with layoffs.  I feel that I am given excess amount of work, and not compensated for the extra work.  This is a company of who you know and who you are friends with.  If management likes you/are friends with you, you excel and advance."
good,Typically most railroaders don't have a work/life balance. They spend most of their time on a train and in and out of hotels. The job itself is great. The hardest part of the job is being away from home so much and the lack of job security.
good,I've been with UP for 5 years. I've seen changes not for the better in that short amount of time. If you want to live your life 2 hours at a time then this is the place for you.
good,Ok place to work. If you don't need to work in the winter. It takes years to build enough seniority to stay employed or be willing to travel the nation for 25 an hour.
good,Takes too long to get normal day shift hours and normal weekends off. If a person is willing to put in the time it could be a great career. Merit  is not rewarded.
good,"Good stable job with good pay and great benefits, On-call 24/7 so no life away from work. If you don't mind being away from your family and being on call then this is a great job for you otherwise it sucks"
good,"Lack of professionalism, quality of life, and unrealistic expectations from upper management causes many mid level to entry level managers to leave this company.  After several consecutive years of being jaded I decided to move on rather than do 30 years of being miserable.  The most important lesson I learned from this company, money isn't everything in life."
good,A typical day at work starts with crew caller given you yur job and train id so you can be at the terminal at specified time to take consumer goods to the next terminal - crew change point.
good,"I struggle with the third shift and I do not like that management with delete my job and force me to apply to new posted jobs multiple times a year. It gets old, but I am very thankful for the people I work with or else I would have quit long before now."
good,"Good job for a single man, terrible life for a family man, need to review how many trips are made in a month"
good,"Physically challenging"
good,"Shareholders over everything.  Precision railroading has taken a huge toll on jobs, and moral. Pay is decent, and benefits good for now.  If work life balance is important to you, don’t work here."
good,My time at Union Pacific was ok after finally going under a 6 month training course which was very stressful. If you failed in a area on a test during this 6 month training course then you was let go. Money is great and benefits. Job security is not great at all.
good,Good place to work to make good money. However takes at least 5 years to hold a job. Seniority based versus performance. Too many old timers that wont retire but don’t want to work either. Management is geared toward intimidation versus making the employees and company a better organization.
good,"A great job other than you never know when or if you are going to work, there is always a possibility that you will get bumped by someone with higher seniority and cause you not to be able to work. Takes all your time and you never have time for your family. Also when they get slow they just furlough you and you are left without a job."
good,"They used to be a pretty good place to work for, but it is rapidly deteriorating. The common disregard for the rank and file has gotten so much worse, these people don't even feel human like anymore. I'm glad I got out when I did with some fairly good memories of how the UPRR used to be a family, union and company genuinely cared. Best of luck to you new hires!!"
good,"i thought i found a home at UP. the job had long, variable hours/ shifts day, night, any weather, holidays, and weekends. This was fine. The corporate culture however was terrible. Draconian enforcement of rules broke morale. Constant cuts to please shareholders left people with over 8 years of seniority furloughed. The job was great, the company was not."
good,Conductor training shallow. They gave u just enough info to b dangerous. The classes are worse then college. Test and quizzes every day. I liked it after I got cut loose. I was more able to learn what I needed to do and had great engineers that help out when I had questions. I then transfered to Portland and got furloughed the day I was to start my familiarization runs . Been 3 months.
good,"Very stressful job not for just anyone,  very stressful lifestyle not much quality of family time. Management doesn't care about your life ! Tough on family"
good,"If you're single, its a great job. Family at home? not so much. Out of town trips, and cold food if you're on the road. In the yard? 20 min lunch break on an 8 hour shift."
good,Being that it is a union there is no stability......someone that has poor work ethic can take your job just cause they have put in more time.....it's a poor way to keep good employees around
good,"The best thing that I like about Union Pacific Railroad is the unsupervised working environment. The hardest thing about the job is the work life balance. Although the pay is excellent, you cannot plan any activities without taking time ff to ensure your available to any future commitments."
good,Union Pacific really needs to take skill set into consideration over seniority sometimes. Passing up great employees based on seniority for promotions is ridiculous. Don’t work your good employees to death because they haven’t been there 10 years. Also stop allowing senior employees to down rate the skills and abilities of female employees robbing them of upward mobility.
good,"Force reductions, even during times of great economic success. Fast pace environment. More work than employees. The job was enjoyable as you were able to get out in the field and not always be tied to a desk."
good,The turnover rate has increased within the last few years.  This was once a place where everybody put in their time and based on seniority order things eventually grew to be easier with the work schedule.  Now the extreme discipline and continual erosion of the quality of life has more people leaving this workplace for another railroad or related industry  to do the same thing with a sense of accomplishment.  All of the older managers have since retired or have been replaced with a new mentality of management that demands improvement by trying to rule with aggression.  Instead of asking for something it has now turned into a direct order for anything.  There's not much left to do but keep your head down and hopefully get enough time in to earn the pension at the end.
good,"As a Machine service operator you are responsible for your safety and those around you. you pick a job based on seniority at line up. you are taught to do your job safely and efficiently. If the coordinators tell you not to do your job it causes conflicts. they cut corners to make numbers. important jobs are ignored or differed. the hardest part of the job if figuring out how they want you to do your job. "
good,"Furloughs and lay-offs a plenty. The new ""precision railroading"" no longer means job security and safe operating. It's about streamlining operations which results in the need for less shops and less workers. That means thousands of employees out of work overnight as shops that have been operating for 50+ years close throughout the midwest region and those workers with enough seniority to stay are working long hours with less employees to do the work as safely as has been previously done."
good,No advancement at Union Pacific. Management is horrible! Only job i have ever worked where your job is threatened on a daily basis! Love the workers and people i have met. But overall a stepping stone to where i want to be.
good,"Safe movement and switching operations of freight cars and trains in yard and main line locations. Learned switching and hump yard operations, critical time management, attention to detail, knowledge of hazardous material content and placement. Very unpredictable and sometimes stressful atmosphere. Other times can be incredibly slow paced. Very low moral due to constant struggle between union and company. Hardest part is dealing with management, outside working conditions and unpredictable and unsteady hours/schedule. Enjoyable parts are the camaraderie with fellow employees, great fringe benefits and pay and a sense of accomplishment knowing how vital your job is to the economy."
good,Great group of people to work with. A lot of them become your family because you spend far more time out on the road with them then you do your own family. Poor balance between work and home life. Great compensation and benefits. Job stability is a gamble. Jobs can be cut at anytime to please shareholders.
good,"You're a number here. You can make a lot of money but you will work all the time for it. Consider yourself married to the job and your actual wife at home to be your mistress. That's how it will feel. If you just want to make a lot of money though, then it could be the place for you. Great benefits too, It's just that I needed to have a life outside of work so it wasn't the place for me."
good,"During my time with Union Pacific I saw managers lie to negatively impact employees that they had a personal vendettas against, employees throw others under the bus for personal gain, and employees start fist fights on company property then report the employee that beat them while facing no repercussions. To work there you have to be adept at politics while your work ethic can lack majorly. All of this supported by the manager at the Dalhart depo."
good,"You will miss a lot of family activity and weekends.  Management mindset to to hire to fire employees. Senior base job bids, last hire first laid off during slow times.  Management tends to over hire."
good,"coordinating production time with most work time possible between train traffic."
good,"Safe workplace. Great consistent source of income,and always paid ontime. Great work place for all ages, fair workload, great  benefits , will start off working off shift with no so great off days."
good,The work area is really nice the only thing is that so many young people get hired that most don’t work and take the job serious. When only a handful of employees actually work. Some would get payed more than others and some would be cut short. I would work Sunday through Friday and still had no raise while those who slacked got raises and did as they pleased. Hopefully the job cite got better.
good,"Union labor, union health benefits and pay are fantastic.  Constant threat of lay offs.  No hope for working day shifts anytime in the next 10 years. Management and workers are constantly at odds."
good,"Troubleshooting and repairs include communications equipment, computer systems, main electrical generator, switchgear and traction motors driving locomotive wheels according to federal standards. Installation, configuration and maintenance of ethernet and wi-fi computer networking equipment and software aboard locomotives utilized in cargo transport."
good,"Good job, super long hours, and you have no room for a personal life.   No set schedule, you work on a call in basis. No set days off. WE hired you to work""   is what I heard a lot. No Christmas, Thanksgiving, or 4th of July. No sick days. You have to request your week off a year in advance.  It just takes a certain kind've person for the job."
good,4 weeks of extensive training that was well presented by an outstanding trainer. Some hands on training later on in the schedule. Study hard everyday because you will need to know it all.
good,"Set in a on-call 24-7 environment, there is little to no structure as far as hours are concerned. I've learned to manage my time accordingly, with very little supervision. Management seems to be set on hiring you to fire you, as they have little hands on experience, straight out of college. Benefit package is nice and robust. The hardest part of the job is being called in odd times of night and having to work through all weather conditions. Compensation and benefits provide a great life, but you wont be off to enjoy it! High divorce rate!"
good,High stress work conditions. Moving freight has become less important then local management making a name for themselves. Wisconsin division not suited well for current amount of traffic
good,Great job if you enjoy endless challenge and a fast pace workplace. Work and life balance is basically non existent. I enjoyed the opportunists presented to me to develop an awesome resume.
good,Traditionally demanding and heavily regulated employment.  Work life balance is extremely hampered.  The compensation and benefits are good.  Extensive travel required.
good,"Very ""traditional"" company - generally stable, but not very progressive.  They prefer to keep/promote from within, leveraging a healthy college internship program for new hires."
good,lots of driving time. You are always outside.  Micromanaged and unreal expectations from managers.  Most equipment is extremely old.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with multiple managers always looking over your shoulder.  Most enjoyable part of the job is excellent pay and benefits.
good,"Solid job that can provide for a family. No excitement or much challenge but a stead job that allows for a good life. Management is terrible and I often called it the most mismanaged company that makes money hand over fist,."
good,The management skills taught was good. The day begins with trying to catch up with previous shift production. The culture was safety sensitive and centered on employee empowerment.
good,"If you want a job where you can show up, hide all night (you will be on night shift or 2nd shift for years), have Tuesday and Wednesday off or some combination like that, then go for it. You will work almost every holiday for years, you'll have days off in the middle of the week, work second shift or nights. If you get sick, you better go to work. Some of the people there were great, but there were ALOT of lazy people who avoid work at all costs. Overall, it's the only place I've ever seen that tries hard to get you hired, then tries just as hard to fire you."
good,"They have the Best Health Coverage I've ever had. Every Doctor visit was $20 max. Hospital cost me $150 one time. You cannot beat the Health insurance, but it will cost you $200/month. Still not bad."
good,"Great place to work if you don't mind and every changing work environment,  your expectations of being home should not be high. Solid employment, but ups and downs like any job"
good,"wasn't really worth the wasted time!!!! I quit a really good job to go to Union Pacific only to go through their six month training and then be immediately laid off. The horror stories about ""They hire you just to fire you are absolutely true""."
good,"management could be better."
good,Great company for a single person with no family life. Not the best for someone who is just starting out with a new family and trying to establish in a new city or town.
good,"The work consist of long hours and time away from family.  Pay is good.  The hours are very long and sometimes you are required to work overtime, which the money is good but it is time lost from your family."
good,"UP is good place to start a career, however if you want to be promoted it seems that you have to know someone. I would recommend it to those who want to start a railroad career."
good,"A typical work day starts with a phone call giving you you assignment and a notification of 90 min to report to work.  I have learned with this job to expect the unexpected and count on working a 12 hour day so if if your day is 8-10 hours, you have had a great day.  A typical day can be a local job to an over the road job so you never really know until you get your phone call.  "
good,"not for everyone but I loved it."
good,Can be fun good people to work with very toxic management
good,"great pay hardest part is being on call and time away from family and working all holidays and working in all weather conditions rain, cold, heat."
good,"24/7 operation, strong time managment skills required, and concentrating in a fast-pace safety sensitive enviroment"
good,"company has drastically changed in the 8 years i have worked. Constant work force rediction, cost cutting to point of lack of maintaince for equipment. Almost no weekend off types of jobs"
good,"While I appreciate the income at UPRR and benefits, job security is poor. I am left having to try to obtain temporary work all the time because of the frequent lay offs. I cannot leave to find a new career or I lost all my seniority and benefits. After working there for 12 years, at at my age, starting a new career is  too big of a gamble. My family is left scrambling to stay afloat until we get train traffic again, and UPRR calls us back to work."
good,"Excellent pay and benefits. Good safety culture and program. Orientation training is comprehensive and engaging. Good training overall. Unfortunately, the closed-shop seniority boards system makes it impossible for new employees to make a good living. No support structure offered by the company or the unions to help new employees who are displaced. Not a good job if you have a family. I lived in a tent for several months after getting bumped around and ultimately being forced to work out of a terminal several hundred miles from home. Eventually, I was laid off and found a new job. I was called back over a year later, but I had moved on."
good,See above. Also poor job security in the current environment. But the pay was good and the benefits were pretty good for their cost. You will work nights and weekends and often have to work well over 8 hours. Really depends on what department you hire on with.
good,"Unless you are in management you work to be well taken care of once you retire. Until you reach a certain position you will be overworked and underpaid. The company is driven by the bottom dollar and not caring for its employees the way it use to. This company is to be an employee's matter company, but not anymore. Great retirement plan none better."
good,There is not a lot of balance between work and life. You are always on call and never know when you are going to work. You make good money but you done have a very good quality of life.
good,"No advancement opportunities. But compensation is good. Retirement is great. They were known for job security, but that is no longer the case. Not bad overall."
good,"Precision Railroading has changed the whole vision of railroading from when I first started working for Union Pacific.  "
good,Great compensation but for a 100+ year old company. My expectations for the way it is managed was very disappointing. It's a cut throat job security culture that allows zero tolerance for any errors.  Fast pace and rules driven corporation. On call 24 hours and 7 days a week.
good,Good pay poor home/work life balance. You have to learn how the system works with the union vs management. You cant make plans it never works. You will be laid off within your first year and plan on working another job on and off for the next couple years. If you are young or without a college education it can be a good job for you.
good,The ST LOUIS service unit had to be the worst in the country. I really think that`s how i lost my job there. How can the managers sleep at night knowing u just took away his/her job.
good,"Currently furloughed, but will pick back up where I left off when I get the call. Bad home/work balance but worth it for the pay. Good health insurance, but a lot of your check goes to union dues and retirement."
good,"Working with management/labor relations stressful, Cameras on property and service trucks stressful, Job security uncertain, Enjoyed working with co workers .."
good,New managers don’t have a clue and they just throw them out there. It’s too dangerous and there is really no one to tell. It keeps on happening time and time again.
good,"I really can't talk poorly about the job. The main issue was the constant threat of lay-off and then the eventual actual lay-off. Job security was the main reason I accepted the job, leaving a good job thinking I was upgrading, and then I had to look for another. It put my family in a very hard position. A position that I am trying very hard to improve."
good,"The pay and benefits are good, but they overtire and then employees are furloughed.  I’ve been furloughed since 11/2018 to current. I really like Union Pacific RR, but it is stressful in this situation."
good,it all starts with a phone call.  No what time of the day you have three hours to report to location of train.  Then take train from point A to point B and deliver cargo.  This could take 12 to 20  hours.  Then go to hotel and in 10 hours it all begins again just in opposite direction taking u back home.
good,"Good pay, bad management, and no work and home balance. On the job training. 24 hrs so be prepared for shift work. Work is not hard just be prepared for lots of rules and enforcement of those rules."
good,"The management is obsessed with profit ratio - sacrificing good employees to meet quarterly bottom line goals.  This was a great place to work at one time, but now it is just another lay-off happy corporation that is loosing good workers on a regular basis."
good,"This used to be a great job, but it is not bogged down with too many rules and regulations and mangers that only care about their bonuses and not their employees."
good,Your fist couple years you'll be working all hours of the day on call. You don't get vacation or time off until you put in a couple years with the company.
good,"A good place to work, if you can handle the stress. On call 24/7 365."
good,Looking at termination for a minor mistake with no chance of resurrection. If i were not in my derail probation i would have already been back at work.
good,"your schedule is a rotating shift on call schedule. so if your single its a great job that pays really well, but if you have a family it is very difficult to balance work and family."
good,"Freight railroad transportation is important to the national economy, but not a guarantee of job security. Complex company means a lot of opportunities to work with different departments and teams and always learning something new; Most employees are honest, hard working and want to do the right thing and serve the customer/help their teams; Company undergoing cultural and organizational changes - some changes are overdue and necessary, but the lack of communication about the changes has created low morale throughout the organization."
good,"Being an operations manager at UP is very challengeing. It requires working lomg days, weekends, and holidays. It is very stressful but the benifits are excellent."
good,"It is a great job! Just management and Omaha micromanage the place to the point of being ridiculous. Fear and intimidation is how they believe it should be ran with the FTX and EPE's "
good,"Company is wrapped in thinking it's the only possible organization that has brains. Re-names common industry language to be ""UP-ized""  They think that makes them special. Pension has kept the hanger-ons around way too long.  Hard to make change when people haven't kept up with the technological advances outside of the 4 walls. Want all work done in such a way that no audit could find a problem, which makes processes manual, cumbersome and overly time consuming."
good,"You work hard and receive great pay.  Safety is first!  Obey the company rules and expect others to obey them.  There is a lot of work, so you must learn to balance work and life in order to be successful.  Good luck!"
good,"There are some great locations to work at Union Pacific, especially road territories where you have more control over your work environment. However, there is a drawback with more late night calls requiring response. The terminal atmosphere is a mess, 13 to 14 hour days can be expected with no additional compensation. The employees are extremely competitive and willing to throw others under the bus for personal advancement. The Chicago area in particular is the most cut-throat and experience lacking management group I have worked for."
good,"Although my experience was relatively good,it was a tough place to work because of the seniority issues, dealing with the union, favoritism etc. "
good,"A typical day starts early and may not end until late in the day."
good,"Lots of traveling & overnight stays involved"
good,"Union Pacific has done a great job building a culture of safe production. Employee training is well-documented and opportunities for education are available if you are able to leave your territory to travel to the training location for a week or two putting you behind in work. Being an employee outside of headquarters, leaving your location is detrimental to the hands-on nature of the field. As a supervisor you will be distracted during training and managing employees is just as difficult with tasks required of them daily. Work-Life Balance is deplorable. "
good,A typical day and night on the railroad is a great experience. You learn how to multi task and plan ahead for your trip to be safety and rules compliant at all times. The people that work there are great and always willing to work as a team. The hardest part of the job is the constant testing and daily rules changing and trying to keep up with all the procedures that change without notice.The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you play a vital role in the US economy.
good,been at union pacific coming up to 16 years good retirement not a positive workplace job is threatened everyday poor manangement
good,"Union Pacific is one of the largest railroads in the world.  The workforce is very diverse and the pay and benefits are above average.  As with any job there are difficulties and learning curves but the railroad is very behind the times when it comes to teaching or training new people to do any job description.  The term ""that's the way we've always done it"" seems almost like a motto and is one of the reasons Warren Buffet said Union Pacific was one of the most mis managed companies he'd ever seen.  No communication would be a better way to understand how things are done.  You simply have to keep asking and hope you glean enough not to hurt yourselves or others.  This seems rather counter productive seeing as U.P. and all class I railroads are very rule oriented and safety conscious.  Having said that, being a railroad conductor is a very rewarding job once the micro managing stops and you move your train.  Rest assured the reason U.P. is not as productive and profitable as it could be is directly related to the amount of managers that make too much money and do no work or contribute to the bottom line objective which is to keep America moving with the raw materials and freight it needs.  If one thing could be changed it should be management.  If cuts were made to just 20% across the board in management you would have increased profitability, happier investors, safer employees not worrying about getting fired and less stress leading to a happier workforce that is more productive."
good,"The work was good. Thought and decision making going into the work was minimal. The management and job position structure was very poor. Very little management and subordinate interaction. I did not like how the jobs were set up, they are not performance based but seniority based. Whether or not you could do a job was not the concern there, only seniority was the concern. Family life is not considered in job placement either. A single parent is not given the opportunity to hold a decent hourly job compared to a single person. In other words, it did not matter to management if you had children and could only work first shift. They made no accommodations or considerations for them. The coworkers had really poor attitudes and the job site as a whole had low moral."
good,"Long hours, little personal life, on call constantly. Outsized expectations vs resources given. Upper management disconnected from day to day operations."
good,you will never have the same day you had yesterday. no one day will ever be the same. if you have low seniority you will be all over the place. the jobs not hard if you know what needs to be done. the day usually goes by so fast.
good,"Like it says if you like to be on call 24/7 this is the job for you. When you get a call you have 3 hours to get to work, once there you find out where your train is at get all paperwork done job brief with your engineer/conductor as to the work to be preformed. Ask the foot board yard master if you have a pick up or set out of current cars on the incoming train. If so pick up or set out to tracks that the foot board tells you to then get a track warrant and blast off. This is a great job if there is alot of freight, however your job is never secure. Management cuts jobs left and right, they like to run the boards thin which is great if you have the seniorty to hold that position because you make great money but your home time is non exsistent. When frieght is busy you tie up at your terminal and then get 10 hours of undisturbed rest then your game to be called at 10.01 hours of rest. As I said if its busy don't plan on seeing your kids much, however the pay is well worth it!!!"
good,This job requires working all hours of the night with no definite work schedule until you've been there many many years.
good,They hire you then after training they kick you to the curb because they hired too many people or something.  Had a job quit that job for a railroad job completed their training then got furloughed now i don't have a job!!!
good,"The overall job is easy and not stressful. If you enjoy working on heavy equipment you will enjoy working here. Management is based upon micromanagement. This system of management does not work well with the employees and the work environment is hostile. The work can be difficult but overall is easy and fun. The hours suck. Its a union based job meaning your job position is based upon seniority. There is 3 shifts. More than likely you will be placed on 3rd shift with a Tuesday , Wednesday off."
good,"I was on a texas two step working 12 hr shifts, but the days off "
good,"24/7 job "
good,"Though I loved and enjoyed what I did for Union Pacific, I found that this was not the best fit for me, my management still and that of Union Pacific were not the best match. There are many benefits to this company: benefits are very nice, potential for advancement is there (but few and far between), continued training is available."
good,I enjoyed the union but there some things they need to work on something's that's would help the employees a little more and make them feel comfortable.
good,Allows locational flexibility. Great long term benefits. Requires employees to work 24/7. Production is the most important thing so worker must be ready to go in to work at any point
good,Union Pacific Is A Great Company For The Shared Holders Not The Employees The Continue To Reduce Employees  To Satisfy The Share Holder And Take Care Of The Employees.
good,"It is a good place to work at with good benefits. It is a union job so you run the risk of not working at the same yard, until you establish your seniority."
good,The job is not difficult but the work hours and time away from home are terrible. They pay you to be available and pay well but there is absolutely no job security and they do not value any type of employee.
good,"Great place to work. Just know the railroad industry can take a nose dive at any time. Save your money, and work as much as possible. Furloughs do happen!"
good,"Great pay no family time. Always have a back up plan. Times do get slow and you will need to find another job until things pick back up, but worth the money"
good,"The job was physically demanding, Midwest weather conditions, Management changed every 6 months or so. Very stressful job. Though the job payed well the company did not care about their employees. And tried to keep people in the discipline system to keep them in line. Very few managers did anything to help their employees."
good,Pay makes up for some of the things you deal with. Workload is heavy some days and slow others . Not bad until they decide to make cuts and you end up furloughed like me currently .
good,"Started off as great place to work. But over the years the Job as gotten worse. Cutting of Employess with expectations of same work output. Cutting employees to hire contractors, doesn’t make you feel valued or wanted."
good,"Micro managing"
good,My experience with Union Pacific has been up and down for the past year. I have traveled from Dunsmuir California all the way down to Bakersfield and including working on the coast as well. I have met and worked with a lot of good individuals that have taught me some pretty good skills since I've been on the job. This experience has shown me that you need to learn how to adapt really quickly. For example you don't work with the same person everyday and you never know who you're going to get until you get to the yard office. That can be looked at it as a positive or negative as well. But overall I do like my experience with this job and I've had a lot of fun.
good,Great benefits and relativity good pay. But safety and rules oriented. 2 things: don't lie and don't steal. Everything else is usually forgiven or just a write up /  coach.
good,"Our shop is generally very productive and has accurate work completed, but we dont have all of the propper tools to complete some more major work which causes inefficiencies and time restraints in the mechanical department."
good,"12-14 hour work shifts in a 24-7 operations environment.  Few people have time for your struggles.  While that made things particularly difficult, it allowed for quite a bit of autonomy.  If you enjoyed solving problems, the work was exciting."
good,As a conductor you don’t have a personal life because you’re constantly on call. The job will take you away from your family. The pay is very good which pretty much the only positive of the job.
good,Great benefits good pay but no life after work schedule changes weekly NO WEEKENDS off and rare to work day shift in first 10yrs  strict attendance policy worked with some great people though.
good,"Working ever day with many challenges, working for leaders that micro manage and really show they have no true skills and should not be in the positions they are in ...they are more worried about cutting cost, employees, buisness, no clear direction of where the company is going , they are not building Union Pacific or America any more...They treat there front line men but especially their fron tline  women very disprectfully ..."
good,The job is great.  The company is making cut backs and if you do t have 15 years plus it doesn’t looks good. The pay and the benefits are good and the pay is good.
good,"I worked here for the pay and benefits. The schedule is seniority based. Starting out expect the worst schedule and job in the dept. Managers and Forman pressure for productivity. It’s supposed to be a safety first atmosphere but expect it to be later down the line. I stuck it out for my family’s sake, the pay was good. Expect to be furloughed at some point in your career!"
good,"The People you work with overall are great but the job security is non-existent.  The pay is great but there are a ton of very questionable and weird rules. As for the benefits cant really do a whole lot better. Management for the most part is easy to deal with, but even with the benefits that they offer i wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a family, unless you can get right to the front of a very large hiring session. Even then be prepared to be laid off within a year"
good,Toxic atmosphere but the pay is good and the work is easy. Management does not respect the union contracts and furlough people whenever it’s convenient for them.
good,Took what seemed like forever to get hired.  Then a little while later they shut the location down. Big blow when I left decent job for what I thought was a better one.
good,Meh...  they tell you a bunch of stuff that never really happens. I was told at new hire orientation that the only reason they pay as good as they do is because of the inconvenience the job places on you and youre family life. That appeared to be the only thing they didnt lie about...
good,too many conference calls . The job is not hard but you are micro managed or left on an island. good pay work life balance is terrible. Management always point their energy in the wrong direction..
good,"work hours are crazy, great benefits, relocate anywhere in the hub."
good,Very fast paced environment.  A lot of different things going on and managers all have different strategies on how to deal with issues.  Can be self-fulfilling when allowed to work through problems on your own but this doesn't happen often due to management.
good,"Wait for a phone call,  it can be anytime of the day very few jobs with a set schedule, then you have 1 1/2 hours to get to work and find out what your job for that day or night might be"
good,Good job but can be stressful due to rule compliance. Good benefits and opportunity to make additional money if you choose to work an on call schedule.
good,"Overall day job brief meeting work on electrical.   Stressful when certain management gets on foreman who then gets on workers, when there is not enough work at time to be busy full shift"
good,"Great place to work in terms of pay, benefits and promotion opportunity. Work life balance is not so great overall but depends on where you are working and what level of management you are working - there are the very few and far between locations that allow a decent schedule to make up for the 12 plus hour shifts. Basically as long as you are willing to move and work at least 60 hours a week then the world is your oyster as long as you can handle the bad with the good days."
good,The company is what you'd expect for a large corporation. The main concern is the bottom line and everything else is second. It isn't a bad place to work if you don't mind being part of a union and dealing with everything that comes with that.
good,"It's not about moving freight, it is all about following the rules. Even when it is not about safety."
good,"Work hours were not set, pay was good. Good health insurance; medical, dental, vision. You get two weeks vacation, assigned based on tenure. Overall good company."
good,Union Pacific has always pushed the envelope on hours they can work out of a salaried employee.  In recent times the current CEO and his upper leadership now openly admit that all employee are disposable.  They recently degrade all job titles and are working to decrease pay and benefits for all below the top tier.  Culture is very hostile from the craft to management and between departments.  Hard to get much done.
good,"UP was a great place to work until about 2013.  Focusing on Operating Expense to race other railroads to lower numbers has taken a toll on the workplace culture.  Two large layoffs and deep cost cutting initiatives in 2015 and 2017 has employees scrambling to do more with less and has left employees spending much of their time wondering if their groups will be the next to be cut.  "
good,"I loved the job, but with having a 5 kids and being married it was not very family oriented. 15 hour days and 6 day work weeks did not leave much time for family or anything else outside of the job."
good,"Union Pacific has flex work hours, which is nice if you have a family. They also offer 2 days a month to work from home. They are also flexible if you have medical or family issues."
good,gone from home a lot stressful work in environment all hours work by phone and no set work days way too many rules and regulations  seniority-based advancements
good,"On call always."
good,Cool place if you do not mind being stuck in a position for 20+ years. Individuals cap out on career advancement too soon at Union Pacific. No growth.
good,"The Manager of Terminal Operations (MTO)  oversees all aspects of operations within a given terminal. An MTO directs the classification of all traffic from how it will be received, to when it will be selected for processing and finally how and when it will be gathering for outbound objectives. "
good,Good company name but long hours.  Work life balance can be difficult to maintain.  nice retirement package but not enough PTO time.  Omaha isn't that great.
good,Loved working with the different crews                                                                                        typical work days are long but learned a lot                                                                                               like working passenger trains very interesting                                                                                had a very good training staff
good,"The people that I directly work with are amazing.  Everyone has each other's back and we help develop each other as professionals and personally.  The people we teach are great people and open to new ideas and willing to give things a try, even in an environment that does not always support the same philosophy.  Senior management is more focused on bottom line than the people making that bottom line or the quality of product that goes out.  The pay and benefits package is top notch far above the average."
good,Rebuilding the control circuit for older locomotives. Taking old relay logic out and putting PLC in. Replacing all associated parts to complete the update. Testing and troubleshooting problems that come up during the rebuild process.
good,"Not interested in doing a review on the company at this time n date.. You start off doing on call work, with no set days off,"
good,"The work is fun and interesting, and the company says safety is their main concern.  I believe in the safety first policy, but not the expense of peoples jobs.  The management tactics of being required to find a certain amount of safety violation, and hiding in bushes to obtain those violations, creates an us against them mentality.  If the violation is in fact life threatening and dangerous on the employee's part, by all means he deserves disciplinary actions.  However, when many of the safety violations are frivolous, it negatively affects morale.  For example,  failing to do long enough pause before stepping off the ladder of the train, or taking off your safety glassed when in the cab of the train.  Also the lack of job security and the failed proper management of the hiring of new employee's can negatively affect peoples lives.  When hires new employees are assured that the company is doing great and there will not be any furloughs, but then after you accept the job you are told you will be furloughed at the  end of your training and they continue  to hire more people."
good,"Workday begins with a job briefing on the work to be performed for the day, each employee goes to the locomotive their tasked to repair.  Had the chance to learn how to operate and repair GE & EMD locomotives.  I really liked the work I was doing, it provided a challenge that gave me a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day.  The hardest part of a typical day was working with co-workers & leadership that had less than 1 year with the company working on third shift with no real senior management to keep a professional atmosphere/culture."
good,"Great place to work, but expect long hours of stand still.  Sometimes your called to just moved a train less then 10 miles and sit.  This job is not for everyone."
good,I personal don't like how it's managed. Union Pacific could and should take better care of their employees. It's the management that the problem of this job.
good,If  you are a new hire make sure you do no wrong are you will be fired.
good,"The job is rewarding and it pays very well. However, the work/life balance is not great. It is also a very stressful work environment. Opportunities for advancement exist, but promotions  mean even worse work/life balance."
good,"Great for a single guy. Not so wonderful for a family guy. would not work for them again. After becoming engineer qualified moved me to Salt Lake City from Stockton Ca, with a weeks notice."
good,"The pay and benefits were good.. A lot of long hours.. My co-workers were great, but management was always looking to ""fire"" you. They hindered your job performance and caused delays with there ""tests"" and spying (literally hiding in the brush spying with binoculars) No joke!! it was a total Us vs Them mentality on both sides, which is never good for business.. You worked mostly on call which made the family life hard, but you were compensated for it financially.. Like I said.. If I would have started at 21 and single, I would have been set.."
good,"The position I held at Union Pacific as one of challenge having such a broad scope of responsibility with little resources. If there was one negative for UPRR it is work life balance. There remains positions that require more people resources."
good,"I worked on the Wichita Service Unit. If your not family, or close friends don't bother signing on with UP, they will run you off and the union won't help you. Excellent company, benefits (health care is expensive), railroad retirement. BUT management there sucks and if you quit or get fired you can never go back to UP, or potentially any other railroad for that matter."
good,"Morning Job brief, followed by light stretching. Head out to work site have a job briefing explaining game plan. Execute and finish work. I learned how to build and maintain track structure to FRA standrds and produce a safe work enviornment. My co-workers were some of the most interesting people I've worked with, very enjoyable. The Hardest elements in my job is the constant travel and being away from home. The pros are the compensation and benefits."
good,My job is flexible. I make my own schedule and can manage my time as I see fit as long as the work gets done. Servicing locomotives per FRA standards is done on a weekly basis.
good,good dealing with new cars..the bad the pay was to low the job was dangerious.hanging plates to different junctions so the cars can come off.you have byes and try levels..witch trys are higher over 15ft with no safety harnis.
good,Furloughs are common when working for the railroad but didn't expect to happen so soon and now there's words of complete termination. Other than that the I enjoyed the work and the people working for Union Pacific.
good,The first five years you get Furloughed. Have a backup plan in place. The Insurance and pay is very good. You can move up pretty fast.The job require a lot of traveling. Job also require a lot of walking.
good,Transportation company with great benefits.  Review the job responsibilities and the work/life balance going into the job.  The company is transforming and has reduced the number of employees by 13% in the last couple years.
good,"It was a lot of hands on labor. Work outdoors, no work schedule on call 24/7 management was always looking over your shoulder seemed to be a company that was more looking to fire you than to keep you working"
good,Union Pacific is a great place to work. The benefits are top notch. The pay is also great. You do have to worry about being laid off during the slow time which is difficult.
good,"Loved working with the coworkers, however shift changes all the time. Great benefits. UP is going through Precision railroad that unfortunately furloughed many employees across the country."
good,May earn 65K or more a year buy only bring home about 45K due to taxes and other deductions in pay. If you make it to retirement I heard the pay is decent. Don't depend on the company while you are working there learn a trade or try to find other means of earning money while you work there.  Have a backup plan.
good,I worked at this company for 14years and was laid off there is no job security. I would not recommend this company to anyone. That is looked for a secure place to work.
good,"good people to work with, pay and peridium was fair, travel to different work locations, some days were stressful some were easy, good balance. 8 on 7 off, 12 to 14 hrs. a day or night depending."
good,Unsteady work. One week you might work 60+ hrs the next 0. Management doesnt care about crews or their well being. They only worry about themselves...
good,Here today gone tomorrow. It’s a good job but you just can’t count on it to last. They only care about the shareholders. And the union has NO Backbone at all
good,"Never worked for UP, you should definitely look into giving an opt out instead of me having to type this out, having to use 150 characters before i can continue updating my account"
good,I Liked the work I was doing and liked the opportunity to learn new equipment.  They also were willing to send employees for schooling. Local management and favoritism were a problem.
good,My time with Union Pacific was limited due to being hired under an old contract with the Union and then anew one being ratified before i was through my probationary period.
good,The work at Union Pacific is great. The work group are professionals but management is not postal to their employees. Job security is poor and been laid off
good,"I pretty much developed a cynical feeling from the outset when I was hired.  I was 31 years old, married with a family, a Vietnam veteran, experienced and responsible. It was a very much ""us and them"", management/union culture as far as upper management was concerned.  I quickly  learned that if you weren't a suck up willing to relinquish your union contractual rights, you could forget about ever being promoted to a better paying management position.  For the most part, my immediate managers and supervisors were very good as were most of my peer group.  I enjoyed the work I did.  For those reasons, I survived to retirement.   A lot of things have changed, especially expectations of long term job security.  I knew some of the employees who were recently let go.  They  were very  good, experienced, key employees.  Unfortunately, the ones they should have fired a long time ago are still there."
good,Just didn't work out for me being a single dad and being forced to north platte. no way for me to take care of my son and work. I would recommend for someone who is single and no kids.
good,"The job its self is good. you get to work with alot of high dollar value equipment and you get to make an impact.  the culture is toxic, everyone from the unionized work force to your fellow managers will get under your skin, just because they dont know how else to conduct their day to day activities.  they bring their unhappy and miserable lives to work and they will dump it on anyone they can get away with.  you might have tough skin and will be able to stand it for a long while, but sooner or later all of that negative toxic culture will seep through your skin and will eventually kill you from heart attack. heart attack is the leading cause of railroad workers by the way.  so you better have kevlar tough skin to withstand this culture if you plan on making somewhat decent living."
good,"long hours hard work overall good people. must know your stuff to stay. not a job your can ""fake it till your make it."" "
good,The people who work there are amazing!  The management culture needs a ton work.  Always seemed like management was only there to figure ways to fire than manage production.   Overall a great place to work and support a family.  Excellent benefits and union based.
good,I love the department I work in at Union Pacific. UP is a great company with great benefits. UP is a very old school company and they are trying to modernize but they are behind the curve right now. I see a lot of younger people leaving the company and going elsewhere. UP is still an excellent company to work for and I am excited to see the route they take going forward.
good,"UP is a great place to work for an individual who only has a HS diploma, as the pay and benefits are great starting out.  There is some advancement opportunities, but a lot of it is political and who you know type of atmosphere."
good,Would be an amazing job if not for the chance of furlough always present for Transportation employees.  Safety culture is strong throughout the entire company.
good,"Pros.."
good,"It have been many years since I worked for UP. I think it is a good company, but was not a good fit for me. I don't care for unions. Had to work shift work."
good,"My father and two brothers worked at Union Pacific along with me.  My older brother is still working there.  Great advancement, great salary, great place to work."
good,"this is a really great place to work it had so many fun people, the ebergy was outstanding owners were amazing and every day I looked forward to coming to work...I really loved it here"
good,Its not for everyone but if you can get along and manage to keep your nose clean the work itself is enjoyable and the pay is exceptional. And there are lots of different locations provided they need people.
good,"physically demanding, weather conditions are poor at times, overnight travel, dangerous, demanding, good pay and compensation, excellent health insurance"
good,Company cares more about stock holders than its employees. They have no problem send everyone home during the holidays to save money with no pay. If you have less that 6 years you will not hold a position.
good,Lots of emails and meetings all within a confined space at your cube if you are at the headquarters. culture is very conservative and traditional but the training offered is awesome
good,"I manage freight trains, Amtrak, and employees daily to meet Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations. Also create logistical routes to ensure safe and efficient movement of trains. Communicate with numerous sources in the nation to assure the timely movement of train departures and arrivals."
good,"Union Pacific RR does some things better than other Class 1 railroads; specifically training. They are very good and thorough. Unfortunately, the employees feel that they are always subject to the scrutiny of management. Promotion and jobs are based on the seniority system, so new hires generally don't get the best jobs. Further, it takes some time to be safe from the annual layoffs that occur, also known as furloughs. The pay is excellent, if you can hang on."
good,"Good company, good learning experience. Need to learn how to manage people better than the operation because that will be 98% of your battle."
good,"Work life balance is tough at UPRR, depending on what job you are in. However, you are typically well compensated for being a valuable team member."
good,"Working at the UP was a great experience, co-workers and management were very friendly and helpful. As an Intern we were not given any Benefits, however as a full time employee I believe the railroad offers a great deal. On the downside the UP is currently going through a hiring freeze and its not likely that they will hire you at this time, and even if you do get hired there is a good chance you will be let go."
good,"It's a good job where I learned a lot about managing people but I wasn't using my degree.  Hours and days off can be less than ideal.  The pension, railroad retirement, insurance, and matching 401k are hard to beat if you can make it to retirement."
good,The work life is unbalanced. It is difficult to be promoted since most jobs you apply for they already have someone in mind. Interviews use the STAR method. Pressure can be intense and the job can be very stressful.
good,Working for PPDG was a good experience as a recently discharged veteran to get a job back with the military as a civilian.
good,"This company has a safety policy like nowhere else. And although this should seem like a good thing, trying to keep anyone from getting hurt and what not. It leaves you with no room to use common sense in day to day tasks. everything must be done strictly by the words in their rule book, which they use as a club to get people fired versus a guideline to work safely."
good,"Great learning experience,great co-workers, you work rain or shine,the hardest part of the job is putting up with management."
good,"Installing new electronic systems for special Federal project was great. Every now and then I got a chance to do maintenance and make modifications on various locomotives."
good,UP is a great place to work! I learned so much more than just switching out cars and building trains. It was a very dangerous job but the training they provided kept me and my co-workers safe at all times.
good,"Union Pacific is a good employer, with great compensation, retirement, etc.  The problem with working for the railroad, is your quality of life will suffer. The pay is commensurate with your poor quality of life. You may get home and get called to come back to work after your rest period expires. For managers are expected on call 24/7"
good,"It's generally a good place to work. But what I experienced was a disconcerting opposition between the union, the workers, and management."
good,Not a proactive employer. Often reactive to problems that arise. Hired too many at one time now majority are laid off waiting for work. Most are unable to find reliable steady income that will offset. My understanding is that is a good company to work for if you can make it 5 years with out knowing if you will be able to hold a job.
good,"Hired out in oct 2014 with the intentions of full time work. As of now I am not getting that option. The company is a leader in transportation and just like any company, they hit lows."
good,"your are a number and nothing more, they spend most of their day trying to fire you, managment has no respect for the employees trying to do their work. not an ideal place to work."
good,Would have been a great job if I did not get furloughed.  Great pay and benefits but on call work is not for everybody.  I wish the job worked out for me as I really looked forward to working at UPRR.  Hopefully others who have recently been hired do not face furlough as many of my class did.
good,"I love the benefits on our job. Where most companies insurance won't pay for certain things our insurance pays almost for everything... Also, the pay is great..."
good,"great job pull train into workshop for repair,clean and fuel.pull unit out for other trainman to add power to unit making the haul"
good,Great Pay and Benefits but long and random hrs of work. Train route is from Villa Grove IL to Chicago IL and takes about 10-12hrs on the train to get one way.  Stay over night in the hotel and do it all over again the next day
good,Work day consist of dealing with yard switching of freight trains in the open elements all day with little to no breaks in a 12 hr shift.
good,"A normal day on the railroad guarantees a good night sleep, you are never wanting for something to do. There is much more going on behind the scenes of the iconic train carrying its cargo through local towns, over mountains and across the great plains of America. Management has proven to be well trained and continues to develop future generations of leaders. The toughest part of working for this industry is grasping the geographical area which the tracks crisscross over this nation. In this we also find the best part of this industry – knowing that the economy is on the move."
good,"I enjoyed the work very much but due to the system used, on three occasions I did not get paid for work performed. This ultimately led to my decision to discontinue my employment."
good,"I worked as a Supervisor where I did job line-ups, safety meeting and data entry. I also worked as an Electrician, I did trouble shooting on problems associated with electrical components and safety devices."
good,Take on as much as you can and much will be given to you. If you work here you will really feel the sense that you are a part of something remarkable. Just dont be afraid of hardwork to see sucecss.
good,"Discuss Safety at the job site, construct and install equipment for safe and efficient railway operations, construct and install equipment for public safety and railroad crossings."
good,"heavy construction, electrical troubleshooting skills, learn to use all types of tools associated with construction, hardest part is the travel, most enjoyable part is the self satisfaction of completing or fixing a problem/project"
good,"Typical Union attitude...only do just the minimum to avoid trouble. A lot of sitting around and sleeping, especially on other shifts."
good,"Control and supervise the safe and efficient movement of trains authorizing occupancy of main track and sidings for train operations, track inspection and maintenance personnel."
good,"relatively easy job with great pay and benefits.  company leaders only care about the happiness of the stock holders even at customer expense.   most of the time you are left alone to get the job done, but managers spend your whole career trying to fire you."
good,"Long hours, away from home, good pay and retirement. Must be able to work safely and follow a very large amount of rules. Must be able to work in all weather conditions. Occasional heavy lifting."
good,"I am currently laid off but I still am employed for union Pacific. The pay and benefits are very good, but as far as your job security, it is not guaranteed. If you are working continuously depends on what jobs are available and their location."
good,"Benefits, retirement, earing potential are great but as I said, at a cost. The work life balance is tough when your on call 24/7 365 days. Everything costs but the family life and quality family time isn't always there."
good,Company is in cost/job cuts and has become unstable with all the cuts and not enough manpower to cover positions  not to mention they are talking about cutting train crews down to one man and will make it unsafe workplace.
good,Job is good if you do not have a family. If you want to move up you have to already chosen for the job. They go through the interview just to go through the motions.
good,"I learned how to think on my feet and grow with the company as needed. A lot of cross-training on ordering materials, deliveries, repairs, e-procurement  and safety training based on strict F.R.A. regulations. Company motto: When in doubt take the safest course."
good,"I loved working at Union Pacific, unfortunately job stability is not something they are able to offer any longer regardless of your position in the company."
good,Told you what you wanted to hear how safe your job was and tools would be supplied for every task and they did not deliver. Fellow employees we enjoyable and easy to work with.
good,"Never missed a pay check, and they pay an honest wage, but management/union culture on the Union Pacific can be difficult.  Managers are like police officers on the Union Pacific continually citing employees for breaking rules, and the culture can get discouraging for both those in management as well as agreement employees. Much of railroading is becoming automated, and the Union Pacific tends to be reactionary.  For example, someone burned themselves with coffee at one of the Depots so they ripped out all the coffee pots.  I'm not joking.  And if you work the road, where the earning potential is higher, they often hold the employees longer at their away from home terminals than home terminals. So if you want to earn the big bucks be willing to sacrifice time with family and say goodbye to planned events and holidays.  You'll hear all this in your hiring session.  Honestly, the work is great, and the fellow Conductors and Engineers I worked with are great people. I just wish the company didn't take the stance that agreement employees are always trying to break rules and get one up on the company because I saw a lot of men and women working hard and safe and doing a great job that seldom goes recognized.  Great job, poor management style based on fear and reactionary policy."
good,It was a great place work and I learned a lot in the field and in the classroom.i liked the work place and enjoyed riding the trains from different locations
good,"company mismanaged, work place was great loved the work. Came in every day and enjoyed working with local management and supervisors. The work was challenging and rewarding."
good,I enjoyed working here however upper management is to blame for most of the cons for working here. They made the most money the railroad has ever made recently then turned around and laid off 675 employees. What a way to say thank you for all your hard work to make that possible.
good,The pay was great and the benefits were good but when it got right down to it UP does not care about its employees. They have hidden items in the contract used to get rid of employees when they run out of work.
good,"Very demanding job. Long hours with little sleep. Print paperwork, load engine with fresh ice/water, load over night bag including rule books, license if required. Work on railroad track either switching cars in the local yard, or transporting railroad cars to other locations. "
good,The job is very demanding. Do not expect to have a great work-life balance. It is hard to accurately feel like your voice has been heard. Be prepared to lose promotional opportunities so that diversity quotas can be met.
good,Making too many changes which has degraded the overall appeal of the company. Still has great benefits but the ability to grow is very limited and if you do want to advance its a lot of relocating
good,"Demanding job, very stressful many hours on aveage 12 hours per day. Many time you work 6 days a week very few hours for family time.  Pay is great on average 200 to 220 per day and can exceed 300 per day."
good,"Distrust in leadership has grown and now it is difficult to ignore the murmuring/gossiping from coworkers. Used to be a job with good security and opportunities, fell as though that is gone now."
good,"Culture is very, very slow to change.  Implementing new applications require several levels of approval.  Also, management tends to not be engaged.  Executive leadership has slipped over the past 5 years."
good,"New employees get furloughed (laid off) quite regularly.  The pay is fantastic, if you can just get through the 1-4 year furlough bubble.  Guys I trained with at a station in northern Calif. were still furloughed after 3 years.  I transferred to a station no one else wanted.  Before I left, I had a great manager."
good,I have been working in IT for UP for last 3 years. It was a good company when I started. They have good health and retirement benefits. There are so many people have been working for more that 20 years. As an IT person I enjoyed working on latest technologies. But the culture is changing now. Management has changed. They laid of hundreds of people in last two years.
good,It an ok company transportation is 24/7 business and I am ready for a change.  Being away from home 3 days at a time and never knowing when your gonna leave or return is just hard with a family.
good,"Union Pacific is a good career job if you can handle being on call 24 hr's a day 7 days a week. and being away from home most of the time. Right now is a bad time for the Railroad industry, and its been the first time I seen this many layoff's in this excess.  Morale has been pretty low as of lately. Benefits has declined, and cost of medical has gone up. But all in all I can't complain, they have provided for my family for the last 14+ years. But changes do need to be made. There have been alot of good guys that have walked away for better opportunities, and the company has done nothing to help retain good train crews, they just over higher to compensate, then lay off when not needed.   Seems as though They forgot about the little guy, and are more focused on turning a profit. I will say that my pay over the last 5 yrs have decreased over 15k, and thats never a good thing. Especially for the lifestyle that we live."
good,"A typical day of work as a conductor is getting your paperwork, and seeing what your trip has to do. If you have to pick up cars or set out cars at the yard before you leave. After you leave it should be smooth sailing to your destination. "
good,"Trained locomotive engineers on the correct use of Distributed Power Technology, which was a fairly new concept in the industry at the time.  This process involved placing locomotives at the head, middle and end of the train. This distributed the power to multiple locations to create a more fuel efficient and safe operation."
good,"Lots of travel and good pay.  Working outdoors is good and bad depending on the weather.  Too many chiefs at times, management gets in the way.  Lots of looking over your shoulder."
good,I loved the type of work I was doing Operating Trains that brought the kid out. But the big downside was that the management was out fire you for any thing. Sometimes it made going to work hard.
good,I love my job but the management was awful. The hardest part of the day was dealing with a management team who seemed to be out to get you.
good,"Would not recommend.  Good pay ,but no time off. No balance of family / work. The company demands are  to much. The attitude is company first and family second."
good,"This is an exceptional job for a candidate whom would not mind a rocky work/life balance in the exchange for above average compensation.The relationship between Management and ground workers could use improvement, as well as the housing supplied to road workers."
good,"I enjoyed working for Union Pacific. Unfortunately I do not have enough seniority to hold a job anywhere in my hub. The lifestyle is definitely not for everybody. You have to be able to work on little to no sleep. Safety is a number one topic at Union Pacific which I valued. I learned a lot working with Union Pacific and my hopes were to have a career with them, but I cannot afford to be laid off on random terms as I have a family. The benefits are phenomenal and the pay is equal as well. I would recommend this job to someone who does not have a wife and kids. I enjoyed talking with all the seasoned vets and learning from them. That was my favorite part. The management needs some work. I think the mentality of management needs some adjusting. The hardest part of this job is working constantly with an irregular sleep schedule. A typical day at work would include coming in and getting your paperwork. You would thoroughly look over your paperwork to see what you are dealing with. You then would head out to your engine and wait for permission to leave weather it be from a yardmaster or dispatcher or both. You then start heading to your destination. There will be hold ups and you will sit in one spot for sometimes hours. You sometimes won't make it without hitting your hours of service. If you do make it you often times have work to do in the yard of your destination. You will complete it if you have time to do so in a safe fashion. Then you will take a van or taxi to the motel to get some rest. That is a day on the railroad.  Convenience"
good,great place to work but really unstable and manager to employee relationship is basically not there. if everyone was more on the same page it'd be the perfect place to work.
good,Work various hours and shifts. Working with heavy equipment in all weather conditions. All the time you are to be on call.
good,"Pay is good, a typical day would consist of getting your lineup, working on the locomotives you were assigned, go home, and start all over again the next day. Co-workers are very knowledgeable and eager to help you learn. Hardest part of the job is having to use your brain when trouble shooting locomotive defects. Management typically were there to help you and they will listen to your ideas and even ask for your ideas on how to make this a better place to work. The worst decision I have made in my career is leaving this company. The only downside (which is why I resigned) is that the ""buddy system"" is in full effect, so if you want to advance you had better marry someone high up or make some friends in high places."
good,Maintained and did the Upkeep on the platforms and Stations of the Metra Train Line. Carpentry and Bridge work. Good Group of guys to work with.
good,learned how to be a great manager under tremendous stress.conference calls all day..managing union employees
good,great company to work for .. great pay and great benefits .. great people to work with . not so good things: not so great schedule . no weekends off no holidays off and can get furloughed unexpectedly ..
good,Union Pacific Railroad is a great company to work for as long as you can withstand the time it takes to gain significant senority to hold a regular job.
good,"basically on call so you are always on 10 waiting if they call you .. you have be ready togo and arrival in 2 hours to your home base the hours are long pay is very good and you get see places most people can't "
good,Good job but poorly managed good benefits union based long hours and not a lot of home time with family always on call get called all hours good pay for what you do
good,I started the job as a single man now that I have family and kids I would really like to be more present at home and not just a dad that stops by for a bit .
good,"My time at UP was great.  Straight shifts mandated me to midnights, which were acceptable.  Three months into my career there, HQ decided to change operations to ""a more streamlined process"".  30% budget cuts across the board eliminated my position."
good,You have no family time with this company   You are gone day and night and on all holidays. The only time you can expect holidays off is after you have been there fifty years.
good,"UP will always be iconic in American history, so likely this too shall pass, but as of late, there has been a culture shift and it's no longer an enjoyable place to work. Managers seem so focused on performance and the bottom line that hardly anyone feels engaged or appreciated. I agree with the focus on efficiency and cost savings (to a point), but not to the point where your remaining staff is overworked and burned out."
good,"Rough hours starting out, but the pay is phenominal. If your a single adult who doesnt plan to have a home life for at least five years, then this would make a great career."
good,"They treat their employee like dirt , long hours with very little time off. You are always on the road, short help to get work done. I don't need to talk about this anymore"
good,The environment is very fast paced. Operations requires long hours often overnight. Different culture in the field than at headquarters. Lot's of room for advancement.
good,Way too much old thinking and bureaucracy. The quality of software engineering not stellar. A lot of politics. Need to be very careful to not argue with bosses.
good,There isn't a balance between your personal life and work life.  Always on call with a minimum of 2 hours notice to report to work.
good,Hours and days off are for someone who can balance work and family.  Employees are really great people who take the time to get to know you and help you
good,Working train crew at Union Pacific is different than working a regular job. There are no set hours and not a lot of stability. The pay and benefits are fantastic though.
good,"I enjoyed my time at UP quite a bit when I first came in. I learned quite a bit about troubleshooting, ticket management, asset management and even some scripting here and there when time permitted. However, during my time here, there have been numerous layoffs and just recently this year they lifted a hiring freeze. There were a number of fellow interns that were hard workers whom where never offered jobs that during their initial hiring was given as an incentive to intern here. "
good,They pay you for your inconvenience. Be prepared to work long hours. Union presents its challenges but PSR transition keeps all managers on their toes
good,"I learned a lot,it's a very good paying job and good benefits..specially for El Paso, Texas. the training isn't the greatest, but it is available for the self motivated individuals on the UPRR website. over all i'm grateful for my ten years working there."
good,"As a Conductor Union Pacific is what you make of it.  If you want to work hard you'll make money.  Also, if you can deal with lack of direction the career is fine and can be very rewarding.  When/if you get a good crew and a good manager that operate as one instead of being at odds the days go by quick and home life is a breeze.  If the opposite happens it can make for some nasty situations."
good,A lot of layoffs. And a lot of time away from home. It's a fantastic workplace if you can hold a job and make it a career. I would say if you are looking into working here make sure you already have a good saving account because you'll need it.
good,"I really liked my crews, but the moral has gotten so low that it makes it hard to enjoy your work. The only way to get a promotion is to move out of state, and I have 2 sons in high school. I am very much involved in the lives. I enjoy being in management a lot because of the sense of accomplishment at the end of the day."
good,"installing engines or power units, fixing all the strange machines on the track to include lasers. opto cells, controll mods. accumulators, structural welding, elec., hyd, trouble shooting and heavy equip. running a crane picking up OTM and rails with magnet and getting your own track warrants."
good,has good pay and good benefits and retirement. balance between work and personal life is hard being on call 24 7 365 get called to work an hour and a half before you need to be there around the clock
good,"Great Job for a single person."
good,"Awesome company to work for.  Very busy, never a dull moment. Worked through Mitchener Gaines contractor company for Union Pacific Railroad."
good,Personally I think that Union pacific is a good place to work but has room for improvement through managment knowledge and managment employee relations. I think that if this was in place along with concrete policys Union Pacific Railroad would be a better place to work.
good,"This was a great job to have. I took the job for benefits and was not disappointed. Great people to work with, lots of travel, and lots of fun!"
good,"Pay was great and so were the employees.  The job was totally not.appreciated."
good,"This job pays great but has hours that make it hard to live a normal life because of switching shifts. In my field I worked in the outside elements. Although it paid great, job security was very weak. Laying off hundred of people."
good,"Great pay, great benefits, awesome people to work with.  You get to see a lot of the country and meet people from all different walks of life. Great place to work"
good,"Union Pacific is a great company to work for unless they are downsizing. They are huge on safety in the workplace, in the office as well as the field. The job security is there unless you a upset a high level director or executive, if you do, make amends and make sure to get back on their good side, because if you don't they will find a way to terminate you even if you have a Union Contract, they know all the loop holes and once your gone it is almost impossible to return. I worked for over 9.5 years there and after a couple bad reviews with my VP, they laid me off and managed to find a way to disqualify me from returning to my union position. It destroyed my life. I loved my job and the people I worked with. It was a shock to be treated this way after such a long time of dedicated good work on my end."
good,"Fortune 150 company with historic significance. Good advancement potential, good employment for veterans and covers 23 states.  They provide on-going training."
good,I loved working as a Locomotive Engineer at Union Pacific but the company was extremely hard to work for. The managers are able to scrutinize almost everything that you do. The event recorder are read and examined all of the time and they also field test you all of the time. Very stressful and a very demanding job.
good,"Long hours, physical labor in all types of weather condition, but overall a good company to work for.  Excellent benefits/retirement."
good,Repairing locomotives was exciting loved the challenge each one presented.. Typical day consisted of a safety meeting then assignment of work.. I learned the processes in which to trouble shoot and diagnos issues with all types of locomotives using schematics and standard work parctices.. Management was very invlolved and wanted to make sure you succeded. Co-workers were great everyone got along and really enjoyed each others company.. the hardest part was the hours working third shift wasn't my favorite but the people I worked with made it that much better. Child hood dream working on Trains....
good,Productive hard working place how build track and to work safe around hazard environments. Season work an also you vacation days.. You can get in 401k you also health  insurance dental ins.
good,They provide excellent training. The benefits are not that good if you came from operations. There is plenty of opportunity to learn and grow. You can retire from this company
good,"I worked for this company for over 12 years and saw some of the best of times and the worst of times.  The culture remains a ""good ole boy"" culture with no clear advancement for college educated people.  There is a great deal of politics with advancement and virtually NO lateral movement within the company.  The people who work here are some of the best employees I've worked with, but the top leadership is diseased and does not allow for employee driven input or improvement."
good,"Great pay, mostly on call, difficult to gauge when or where you will work. Seniority based work. Some managers were great, others are ridiculous. Safety First!"
good,This job used to be good. Is quickly going downhill no longer fun the push is for production.  As a union job the union does nothing for you.  Unfortunately the industry is changing.  The job used to be family and employee oriented has now changed to  shareholders and profit.  Every four years contracts come up in the railroads slowly nibbles away At benefits and pay
good,"I worked in train and engine service.  It is a valued company, but working in the agreement side you face the ""Us vs. Them"" mentality constantly.  On-Call 24/7/365.  They hire supervisors that have never thrown a switch but tell you how you are not following rules, and interpret the rules in a way that doesn't make sense.  I enjoyed the engineer and technology side, and wanted to stick around as a leader, but they didn't select me for a manager promotion; I saw the writing on the wall and decided to resign.  I have not looked back, but have appreciated the amazing experience of work on the RR and the unmatchable comrade-re save for the military.  I don't miss being treated horribly.  If I had one word to describe the RR environment: Gritty."
good,"Long hours, disconnect between upper management and employees.  Unpredictable work balance.   Unrealistic goals for hours in the day.    Constant re-prioritizing required.    No normal day."
good,I enjoyed working at Union Pacific for the most part. It was eye opening to me though to see a company spend a lot of money and hours to train you as an conductor then spend the rest of your career trying to fire you. You have a lot to learn with the rules and regulations and union agreements. For the most part your on your own to learn the union agreements unless you get a good union rep.
good,"Its not what it used to be. Before you didnt have to pay for Ins you culd be an Engineer within 5 yeas now you would be lucky to even touch the throttle. There cutting miles so the pay really isnt that good. the Union is horrible they dont take care of you. Managers.... enouph said. But the one thing I could say is the people you work with are good people. Last but not least, I was laid off two time in a year"
good,Give yourself a pat on the back if you work for this company...lots of hours and stress but great pay for Company officers.  Union workers are offered great benefits with good pay for a stable career but have to cope with and unpredictable schedule.
good,Job paid very well the scheduling and seniority issue was outdated and unfair to newer employees.Coworkers  were all about self.Management usless.
good,"This is a fantastic job working with great people, however it is seniority based and if someone likes your job better than their current job, they just take it. also with 90 minutes notice after 10 hours of rest period, you are usually forced to work and rarely given much family time at all, you cannot plan 4th of July picnics, anniversary, birthday and holidays are all but a memory - I want to see my kids grow up :)"
good,If you dont have seniority then you life will be turned upside down until you have alot of people below you on the roster. Job can be anywhere and to keep it is always a struggle. Like I tell friends and family I'm employed but I'm jobless.
good,"Union Pacific has a rift between field workers & management. The people you work with are great & helpful. The hardest part of the job, are the long hours leave little personal time."
good,Pay very close attention in the interview. they are not kidding nor exaggerating.  They will greatly disrupt your life. they do not care. Just be fore warned
good,great people to work with.  Management has favorites.  Always dangling the golden carrot.  Empty promises every year while the company continues to make record profits.  Training is all self-taught.
good,"The philosophy is live to work, not work to live. If you want a job where you can go to your children's events, then this is not for you.  You can be in a hotel over holidays, birthdays and school events so if family is important to you especially with small children then this is not a recommended job."
good,"My typical day is I go to work, I get my list of cars to build a cerrtain train. I build the train as instructed. "
good,Good Pay and benefits but just a number. Zero job security for your first 5 years. Really sucks to not know if you'll have a job the next week.
good,Extra board employee that worked different sites depending on if I was working as an engineer vs conductor. As a conductor my seniority would allow me to hold just about any location. I would work road jobs or local jobs. Really enjoy the people I worked with.
good,It was an ok job.  Pay was decent but insurance sucked. Management dosen't care about the ppl at all.  Just a number to them.  Shift sucks but it's only 8 hrs.
good,It’s a good job and you can definitely take care of yourself and family just be prepared to work all types of hours and not have a lot of free time also if your seniority is low you may be cut off
good,"Really enjoyed the work, lifestyle and pay. I was 2 of 40 people to make it through a tough probation/training period. if not for boards shrinking with me being the lowest person on our region, I would still be there."
good,"Difficult to keep any life work balance, The environment requires a long committment accross multiple states, These movements are not paid for so as a result the conductor has to pay for multiple homes"
good,Decent pay with excessive amount of away from home time. Local management tends to be yes men without the ability or independence to manage in their own style. My local managers tend to apologize for being managers.
good,"Pay is decent, but jobs being cut or getting ""bumped"" off of a job is nerve racking. Some union representatives fight harder for some people, when it should be the same effort for everyone."
good,Economy change results in massive layoffs but when its good overtime is attainable.   Management styles could change dramatically to help ensure employees moral.
good,"Union Pacific used to be a great place to build a career.  The organization promotes from within and career advancement has been good up until the last couple of years.  The company is undergoing n extreme amount of change, both structurally and strategically.  This is  creating uncertainty for existing employees and customers."
good,This job will take your life and family.. they truly don’t care for the employees and will work you dry and replace you without a care. If you are single you will be in heaven.  But don’t plan on a life
good,"no comment. zero work/life balance"
good,"You get to work at whatever time they called you in. Gather up your paperwork, and find your Engineer or other Conductor signed to the job your called in for. Build your train or take it to another yard safely without getting past any signals and communicate with dispatch or yard master.The whole time trying to not get fired. Someone is always watching you. Hardest part of the job was not having a set time to get to work. They would call you at all hours at least for the first couple years before you build up seniority. Being outside was the best part."
good,"Good company to work for. Pay and benefits were excellent. Furlough is the worst part. if you can survive furlough for the first 5-10 years, you'll make it. If you are married, you will soon be divorced because some other railroader or manger is banging your wife."
good,"You may work a day shift consisting of 12 hours to 20 hours, then after staying in a hotel until rested by law, be subject to call for same position in reverse role , to take train back to home terminal. Gone away from home most of the time."
good,"Worked and qualified as Switchman, Brakeman and Engineer. Spent 11 years working mainly as a trainman. This entailed all duties involving railcar movement, switching and paperwork. Also helped Engineer remain alert and attentive. Helped comply with all track conditions and speed restrictions while traveling to various locations"
good,Freedom to handle problems that arise but micromanaged at every avenue. I learned how to safety work around railroad equipment.
good,Typical  job. Lots of micro Managing. Home life not so good always on call. The job is senoirity based. Never have a weekend off. always work nights.
good,"N/A"
good,Hours are long but pay is great.  Travel is a requirement and the job is based on seniority.
good,"Very unstable, no set schedule and not very family friendly. You miss a lot of events because you are always on call. Would not recommend for new family."
good,"While constantly learning new job skills, the overall feel of job security is very poor, furloughed every year. Great benefits, the pay is great while you work."
good,"Good coworkers good benefits.  No security or schedule  if you don’t like working in all conditions, or you have a family that you want to see daily, or if you want weekends and holidays off, then stay away"
good,"Loved the railroad life, but it is or can be hard on family time. Long hours, rain or shine you'll work hard and walk a lot. It can get boring at times depending on your job, but the wage and places or things you see or do are adventurous at times. BUT...they will hire you and then find a way to fire you! Its UNION so expect an eye at your back every second your on the job, waiting for you to mess up so they can get rid of you. And learn your rules very carefully and thoroughly. Overall,  I was glad to of been there for the only 4 years of my working life."
good,N/a no comment on up good for a single person or a person with no kids. Great pay but lately the raise in living cost has lowered that. Seniority is rough also as it can cause speratic pay cycles
good,Union Pacific is quite exciting to work for but the home life balance is very rough. Easy work. Called at all times of the day for work. working in extreme weather.
good,very well compensatated but long hours and not alot of fee time. but once you get use to the on call routine you will be fine. the weather elements gets tough in the winter so dress warm and you can handled it
good,"Great job just hours are not the best and job security is not good at all."
good,"If you think your going to be home as a conductor much. Think again. It’s simple. Seniority rules. End of story. Your seniority determines wether or not you even get to work, what month your vacation is assigned, and what job you can work when you actually do get to work. It’s tough and you have to be willing to hang in for the long haul. The plus side is you can make over $90k as a full rate conductor."
good,Work is slow-paced (atleast in the project i was in). Not challenging work environment. Very hierarchical in nature - cannot reach out to people easily without going through the higher management. Too formal work culture.
good,"High stress position with good pay and good benfits.  Perks of the position are only working 8 hours a day but just starting out you are on call anytime you are not at work, this leads to a lack of life outside of work."
good,The lack of communication from the Managers to trainees in Wichita is concerning and irritating. Managers at times did not know what the trainees were doing from one week to the next.
good,"Always have to be on guard watching and following rules. Management is always watching and testing. Not family oriented at all, you are away from home a lot."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was learning about becoming a conductor.  Learning all the safety rules that applied to the job.  The hardest part of the job was being away from my family.
good,Job security is excellent. Quality of life is not taken seriously. Compensation is pretty good all around. Morale is not very high so it is a challenging work environment at times.
good,The job has good pay and decent benefits. But the work schedule and hours are terrible you work off a rotating board you never have a set day off or go to work the at the same time. The contracts are getting worse and the benefits are costing us more and more.
good,"Job isnt to move freight, job is to know the rules. Very long New hire period with very little play and an excessive amount of obstacles to overcome to not be fired.... roll of the dice really."
good,Be prepared to have no social life.  On call 24/7 and employees are punished for taking days off o weekends. Managers hound employees to catch them breaking rules.
good,"Passed all tests and new employee requirements, but because of industry lows I was furloughed right after I completed my training."
good,"never no when your going to work.no home life at all."
good,You spend your day working around train schedules. I learned how to supervise work groups. Manage is hard to get along with. The constant traveling to other states at a drop of a hat. Working in popular cities.
good,"Good job. Just relocating due to marriage."
good,I loved my job but do to furloughs did not stay with the company.  The company does give you a sense you are just a cog in the system and its focus is completely on the product.
good,Not really a family first job but they are a reputable company that pays well. I did enjoy traveling while working for the railroad but eventually it becomes a lot on a family man.
good,Would recommend because of the pay and the retirement benefits. But the first three to four years are uncertain because possible of being furlough for a undetermined amount of time. Which has cause hardship on most member with family.
good,Good job with great benefits.  Days can be long in the yard or on a train depending on which job you catch. If you are on the road you will be on call every day with no set schedule.
good,"a work day at the road is vary demanding , You have to stay focus and stay safe work with a  out look of pride. and will be rewarding.I was very please to work for them."
good,Good place to work but management did create an environment where craftspersons felt they needed to constantly watch their backs because they would be disciplined for mistakes.
good,a lot of rules to remember but the rules are in place to keep you safe and alive. this is a very dangerous job but a great paying job. it is also a very irritating job because of seniority.
good,"The work itself is not difficult but the hours take a toll. Its a union bargaining position so everything is seniority based. There is a very high chance that you will be furloughed multiple times in your first 4-5 years of employment. You will work all shifts, 8-12 hours a day with 10 hours off between shifts. I have worked 1st, 2nd and 3rd shift all in the same week.  After a while it is possible to obtain a position where one would have a set schedule but it depends on your seniority."
good,"great place to work if you are in your 20's and now starting ut in life. the job security is none when you now start but after 4 to 5 years in you ae guarantee to make a lot of money for a job that does not require a degree, upwards three figures a year.  you will hear a lot of employees complain but none leave, just something to remember"
good,"Great job, very dangerous job requires you to be constantly aware. Watch back stabbing co-workers. Great pay and excellent benefits, nice holidays off but double time 1/2 on the holidays you do work."
good,I really loved working here but had some family issues come up and had to resign. If you want to work here make sure you are ready to work. You will be called back to work as soon as your rest is up. Not much time for home when you work here.
good,"The company itself is solid but some of the mid-management folks don't always act in the best interest  of the crews. The crew staffing leaves a lot to be desired. Everything could be smooth day to day if it wasn't going from one extreme to another. Typical day was a lot of sitting, waiting and then a lot of hurrying to get the work finished. The morale was low and staff cuts were making the work load pile up on the crews that did remain working. When we were working with fewer and fewer men this meant less sleep shorter turnaround."
good,You work 12 hour shifts and the there is no set schedule.   The pay decent and you get a raise and bonus every year which entices many people to stay.
good,Stressful not home much a lot of sonority moves made it difficult to know when you was going to work. Not home much that makes it hard on the family..
good,"Job security is low, pay is high. Benefits are nice, retirement is the best if you can make it that long. Coworkers are easy to get along with because everyone gets paid the same."
good,"Learn critical rules fast or it could cost you your job, workers that've been there long enough have no pity on you and get easily irritated at the new employees including the yardmaster. Other than that the pay is amazing, great for El Paso."
good,Good job and bay is great. The old heads get the good jobs and better pay. As a new hire you will make pretty good money and great befits. A lot of testing
good,"I will make this short. I enjoyed the job and loved the company however management recently changed and then decided to take the company in a new direction after 150 years. This essentially led to the decision to eliminate 10 percent of the workforce through staff reduction lasting until the end of 2019. As a result I was laid off. If you are looking for an individual who is a quick learner, resourceful, dedicated, well rounded career wise, been in a fortune 500 company's accounting department for 10 years and willing to commit fully to your company values and mission, then you should contact me."
good,"My position was a union position.  There are both union and nonunion positions at this company.  My work duties were strictly clerical.  i worked at the headquarters downtown which was a bit difficult, parking wise."
good,I enjoy working here but really need to make more more money and better days off .This is a good job but i would like for more advancement opportunities
good,Loved riding trains across Iowa. Work became spotty and had to drive 2 hours one way to work at times while being on call. Management likes to test you while your working which can make things nerve racking. Overall fun job with great pay and benefits.
good,"Community, employee, and industry relationships are maintained with governmental officials, community representative, union representatives, employee groups, and other railroads. Also, maintains a positive relationship with outside vendors and contractors."
good,"Able to provide well for your family, and great benefits.  Have to work weekends and shift work.  There number one goal is to work safe.. they drive that home every day"
good,24/7 operation everyone is on call. Must be flexible and focused. My responsibility was to move freight from one state to another without incidents. Working safe is paramount
good,"The job is somewhat repetitive but you are dealing with highly dangerous products. The pay won't necessarily make you rich, but your bills will stay paid. Retirement is probably the best benefit of the company. Overall, all facets seem to get along fairly well."
good,"Always connected. Over 13hrs a day, sometimes 11-13 days straight. Great pay but will put a strain on family. Alot of change within the past few years."
good,"Union Pacific es un gran compania, en la parte de operaciones, la cultura de la empresa aun es como una empresa antigua, donde no valoran la calidad de vida de sus empleados. esto no sucede a nivel corporativo, solo a nivel de operaciones. Los números es todo lo que cuenta, y no contratan suficiente personal."
good,Great place to work if you don't mind not having a good schedule for a while and don't mind being away for a few days at a time. pays well benefits are geart.
good,Bad leadership from the CEO through the executive team.  All yes men.  People right now are afraid to question the motives of executives and have fear for jobs daily.
good,"Great job with really good benefits. Challenges abound. Management is decent to get along with. Being away from home all the time, and spending a third of your life in a hotel room is a huge inconvenience if you have a family and/or children."
good,Good company. Learned lots of new technologies as;fjksdkjfklslfkjlskdjflkjsdlfkjsdlkjflksjflkjsdlkfjsdlkfjlksjf
good,"I worked at a Union Pacific subsidiary for my summer MBA internship.  They people were great but it is a very sterile, corporate environment that seems to lack innovation or desire for change."
good,"Good company to work for, just have to accept that there is going to be a focus on working strange hours for a few years before being able to enjoy a family. Plenty of options to advance to be a foreman but again you have to put in the years first. Mechanical side is easy going, just as long as you are in a main facility. Moneys good, jobs super easy. Managers are pushy and dim but can be handled."
good,"I really miss this job, it was my first job out of the Navy, and I was not ready for those jobs you retire at 26. I attempted going to college while I was working there, and I started to learn that there was difference in being full time college student, and full time employee. Working road truck bouncing across rails while busting out trig formulas for class homework was getting interesting, while staying on top what was due at a giving time. Had I just took it easy, and took two classes at a time I think I would have had more comfortable experience. Biggest thing to adjust to getting out of the service was huge step down in pay when we got out, and making up the difference was beginning to feel like being on a roller coaster, and had some part in my decisions to study Set and Exhibition Design."
good,Best Fortune 100 company to work for. Great working environment and great people to work with. Great management and good long term career opportunities
good,"Enjoy the job, just too many layoffs. I would not be seeking other employment if the work was more steady. Manual labor involved, and paid well for it. Good benefits. Alternating shifts, which is fine with me."
good,"You'll be working in any climate... all year long... every single day, no holidays, birthdays, grad parties for you anymore... Just don't plan on it anyways... Not a bad place to work, money is good, most of the co-workers are very helpful. Keep in mind that you're going to be furloughed at some point though."
good,Union Pacific provides a great compensation however the trade off is you can have no life. You are constantly on call until you get enough seniority to get off the extra board which can take years.  You are required to become an engineer which gives you a new seniority date so even after being established as a conductor you are then subject to being moved around again. You can be moved anywhere in the service unit which for Avondale LA goes all the way to the Mexican boarder. The insurance was $200 a month for an entire family which was good. A great job for someone with no family or other commitments.
good,"The day started at 0500, and ended at 1700.  I learned a lot about resource management, and how one person can impact the bottom line.  I learned how to manage people, and work through conflict situations.  The toughest part of the job was the hours.  I often worked 14-16 hour days.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I interacted with on a daily basis.  Getting to know them, and helping them become better at their job was very rewarding."
good,great place to work at lots benefits mangement is great co worker work together meet alot of different people keeping up with changes
good,"typical day at work can be long depends on the job. I learned a lot about railroading and the type of business involved. Management there is kind of tricky, some want you to be afraid of them others are pretty cool. Hardest part of the job learning the territory and different jobs. The most enjoyable part of the job is you'll never build the same train twice, the pay, and just doing new things"
good,"a lot of moving state to state unknow work hours on call 24/7, management out to fire you from day 1,co-workers will not help"
good,"Union job, you start at the bottom and work your way up but the economy will directly affect your job security, Enjoyed the work but you are on call 24hrs a day."
good,the work was good but the people where I work at in Salt lake was no good very bad people.
good,"Huge company with variety of avenues for an employee. Railroad, trucking, logistics, they have it all."
good,"As an Engineer a typical day involved reviewing safety bulletins, train orders concerning on track movement, train list containing proper positioning of cars in train as well as job briefing before work started and again if any changes occur. The hardest part of the job would be getting used to being on call and away from the family the majority of your career, that which gets better as you gain seniority. The most enjoyable part would be seeing the countryside enroute to your destination as well as meeting new people."
good,Communication with upper managment was non-existent. Company did not provide adequate notice of pending layoffs despite employee rumors
good,Great pay and benefits. Retirement plan is the best available and if your married spouse will receive an extra 50% of your retirement pay. Job is very stressful and most managers just want to write you up or fire you just to further their career.
good,You need roughly around 5 years of seniority before you are safe from being furloughed.  The furloughs can be anywhere from 3 months to 3 years.  I highly recommend having a back up plan with this type of career.
good,Management is the worst in the industry . Great pay but long hours. Great  training in the transportation fleid. Some good perks working for UP. BNSF management is a lot better.
good,"the job in all isn't bad, the pay is good considering, and the benefits are good as well. the only problem is starting out in your craft u have no seniority."
good,Good paying but you don't know if you are going to have a job or not from day to day. Very relaxed but not good communication from management. some heavy lifting.
good,Multiple positions available but the higher paying ones went to the employees with the highest seniority. The pay and benefits were good. Only drawback was that they would abolish jobs and the bumping that followed.
good,"it's a union job so starting out is going to give you rest days and shift thats not ideal to you, but it's a union job so the pay and benifits will be ideal I'm a machinist everything you check out will vary wildly by craft and location. and the longer you stick with it the better your shift and rest days will be."
good,Good job to have for longevity.  Great benefits and retirement package.  Definitely will make long time friends when working with Union Pacific.   I would go back if I got the desired position
good,I have worked here for 5 years. I have enjoyed my time here even though the schedule was sometimes difficult. Unfortunately decisions at the top have dictated a smaller Workforce. So all the most recently hired employees are being let go.
good,Compensation is great but very demanding on your personal life. All the benefits are there. Management is tough to deal with at times. You are always on call. Not the ideal for a person raising a family.
good,Iv worked here almost 5 years almost enough to be fully vested been furlough twice now and now I cannot get back on it was my dream job and I want it back but that qont happen.i love the atmosphere and all and the people are like family.
good,"Do your research. This job isn’t for everyone. The company hired you to work so don’t get caught off guard when they expect you to work every holiday and any hour of the day as a T&Y member.  A lot of people will tell you this is a terrible company to work for. That the managers are out to get you, the company walks all over you, your unappreciated. I will tell you this right now you have more easy days than hard and personally I don’t know a job that you can do so little and be paid so much. KNOW AND FOLLOW THE RULES. If you want to protect your job at least. The way to keep out of trouble is to know those rules better than the people who test you on them. Especially critical rules. If you have a good work ethic and don’t mind being away from family you will be fine."
good,"I enjoyed the actual work during my time at UP, but the work/life balance was awful.  I had to work on call and be readily available within a 90 minute window three times per day.  Working outside has it's pros and cons.  Sometimes it is awesome, but other times not so much.  It just didn't work for me because I had a small child at the time and the schedule was not working for my family causing added stress to my home life."
good,Family time and work location are out of the question. Company builds character in a positive way. Only issue is time work spent allows economic luxury but not enough time with family.
good,It can be stressful but overall it is a great company to work for. Being a locomotive enineer is something that I love to do and will hopefully continue.
good,Union Pacific was a great company to work fork. Many benefits but you had to work long hours. There was room for advancement if you worked hard and sacrificed for it. Was a fun place to work. Had events for the employees so they would mingle and do a team building event.
good,"Great job, great benefits, love to go back! I was not prepared enough to take the test to become a Conductor or Engineman. Next time I need more job experience."
good,I worked with a great bunch of railroaders that are like family to this day. Being away from home can be hard at times but the comradere and bonds that we developed are what helped us through!
good,Overall not a bad place but many rules to go by. Some are cut throat that work their. Most are easy going and make the job a fun place to work. GREAT benefits.
good,great place to work but always looking over your shoulder and management makes it hard to do a simple job. if you dont mind being away from home short periods of time its not a bad place to work
good,Good pay. Fair benefits. Work scheds hard.  Moving is required to move up. Some management stuck in past.  New employees need to understand the schedule is inflexible for field managers.
good,A lot of lay offs and furlough.  Company is great to work for but if you have no seniority it's hard to keep working without being laid off.  The benefits are also good with this company.
good,"Run the transportation plan that included supervising over 30 employees each shift. These employees went on duty at over five different site locations and were responsible for the daily execution of the yard's manifest (trains) program. Production and safety are the top drivers in this field as it relates to management."
good,"Union Pacific has done a great job building a culture of safe production. Employee training is well-documented and opportunities for education are available if you are able to leave your territory to travel to the training location for a week or two putting you behind in work. Being an employee outside of headquarters, leaving your location is detrimental to the hands-on nature of the field. As a supervisor you will be distracted during training and managing employees is just as difficult with tasks required of them daily. Work-Life Balance is deplorable. "
good,"You will work Between 65-80 hours a week, but you will be compensated. You will have to relocate and work with Unions on a regular Basis."
good,"I generally only work with one to two other people at a time.  A common complaint is that the company is way too rules driven, and not really safety focused, or production focused."
good,"Great place to work, great people to work with. Requires a lot of tavel if you work on the Rail Road Gangs.  This is a union job and requires you to join the union."
good,Great pay but no job security. Benefits were amazing. Would like to see more time off flexibility. Great co-workers that look at for you. The hardest part of the job is working 2nd and 3rd shifts
good,Good employer to work for. A company that spends valuable time training their employess. Each employee is well trained in various departments in the company.
good,Workers are great to work with really helpful.Work is very challenging. Management really doesn't understand the job so that makes it difficult.
good,"Union Pacific is a fun place to work. However any prospective employee should expect furloughs the first few years and should make sure they have sufficient savings to survive the hiring and training process. "
good,Union Pacific is a great place to work only down fall is the dealing with family issues. i actually can say i love my job and the work i do there.
good,Great job if you can withstand the economy and the furloughs.  There is absolutely nothing bad about the job when the economy is running high.
good,"Completely different than i had expected.  Very easy for a former military person like myself to pick up.  You need a strong work ethic and a willingness to accomplish a mission with little to no guidance and or notice.  Family balance is what you make of it, time management is key.  Excellent compensation and benefits.  Not what they promised as far as job stability."
good,"good place to work for, good pay,good benefits learning a lot about locomotives,good training programs, schedule changes often."
good,"Great job, easy work and great pay. Can easily make 70-80k in first 2yrs but no time for family or personal life for at least 5 yrs. Management sucks. Can get fired any day any time"
good,"I love the job itself, it is very challenging and pushes me everyday. Due to over hiring I am being laid off for an undetermined amount of time. Do to the constant on call schedule and the not knowing my future there I am seeking out something a little more stable."
good,"Excellent training and job support. Long work days away from home but excellent compensation. Managed well, all though for management to function properly there are a bit to many managers overseeing a single project (overly managed). Good work environment, most employees are proud of their positions and willing to help fellow employees improve. The most difficult part of the job would have to be the incredible amount of travel required to get to the job site (without compensation). I found it to be a very rewarding job with great training and support as well as being challenging."
good,"Good pay and you get to travel ALOT ...somtimes a high senority employee will bump you and you have to look for another spot, you work in all weather and walk alot in the yard"
good,"fun place to work, good for a kids first job. Not much room for advancement"
good,"typical day , it could start when ever they call (on call 24hrs) you learned something almost everyday, co-workers , we had to all work together to get the job done hardest part of the job was the long hrs most enjoyable part of the job was payday"
good,It was perfect job.  Didn't want to leave.  But it's so hard in the beginning because of seniority.  Never know when someone would show up to take your job because they had higher seniority level.
good,Very good place to work. Pay is competitive but work is hit and miss if on train crew. Expect to travel even if you are told you wont have to. Many advancement opportunities
good,"They hire you just to fire you. Follow the GCOR to the T or they will fire you. Management hides behind bushes and watches you work, and they get excited if they get to write someone up."
good,"Good company to work for. Offers room for growth and advancement. Family work environment. Good benefit package, Vacation ,Holidays Etc. Safety driven."
good,"It is shift work so you show up at a certain time, work up then you get your job assignment. You get a 20 min paid lunch in the 8 hour work day. No sick days and it's a Union Job"
good,"Its a job that goes by seniority, and as long as it plenty of work, its great to work but just as soon as the work slows down or jobs cut its bad for bottom seniority workers"
good,"New environment to work in .. "
good,"Union pacific is a very good place to work. At first everything was going fine and the  rules changed. Management was told that they where required to complete so many test per month and a percentage of the test had to be pass and a percentage had to be fail. So the whole pass, fail began to make the job very stressful."
good,"good pay,constantly being tested while trying toget a job done,always looking to fire an employee. was promised long lifetime job until they laid everyone off,"
good,"Good job with great benefits. Work is always there, something new to work on every day. Mangers are very helpful to get what you need to do the job. Overtime is nice when you get it"
good,"This company is a great company to work for, but unfortunately, it is being ran by PRS.  Until they figure out that PRS doesn't work, the company will not function properly."
good,Wish was allowed to continue with company. Questions i failed weren't related to my job description. On job training was actually more informative than what was learned in classroom
good,A great place to work. Senority matters when it comes to job security not work ethic or skills. Good overall pay and benefits. I would recommend as a job and hope to get back there soon.
good,"Great company, with opportunity, going through a bit of a challenging time currently. Managment is not connected enough with employees and are driven by CEO/board directives."
good,A nice environment to work in. With opportunities to grow within the company once other opportunities become available to apply for. Great people to teach you rules u don't know about.
good,received locomotives for rigorous test to either qualify in service or into the shop for the repairs recommended by the locomotive mechanical and electrical technicians doing the inbound and outbound testing.
good,"I enjoyed working here, but there was no open positions at the time of when my internship ended. They have their own fitness center and full catered cafeteria which was wonderful"
good,"Early mornings 6:30 am out at 3:00. Not all work days were the same, duties changed, Location changed at times. Management had a thankless job. most  all I had contact with were good to work with. Learned so training techniques. I had some opportunity to travel. learned Did a leg in the Olympic Torch Relay in 2005. Going outside when the windchill was 30 to 40 below, was hard."
good,"Typical office environment where collaboration is essential and meetings take up a large portion of the day as it is competitive and time sensitive in order to meet customer needs."
good,Very high paced.  Was not concerned about dispatcher job load.  Kept adding territory to my desk over safety complaints from many dispatchers about job load.
good,It's not a good place to work if you have a family but for the single person or someone older with no small kids it would be a great place to work just not with small children at home
good,"Every day you are addressing new and different challenges.  I've worked for many excellent managers and a couple not so great managers.  If you have an excellent manager you will get the opportunity to grow & develop. Unfortunately because turn over is so low chances for promotional opportunities are somewhat limited, which breeds competitiveness and politicking instead of team work and openness."
good,"Very demanding job, but rewarding. Hours are tough because no set schedule. No way to plan your life around work schedule. Great people work for them. No regrets"
good,"UP is type of company which makes you learn the team work, makes you an expert in domain, puts challenges so that the best in you comes out. Working with UP is a makes you a stronger and good decision maker in tough times."
good,Great company to work for with excellent opportunities for advancement. Challenging environment with multiple operations. Management culture is very tough if you have a family and value work/life balance.
good,The management at this company are held to high standards and are expected to constantly test. With doing this constant testing they are obligated to obtain failures otherwise they are considered not doing their job. This adds stress with Managment to employee interaction.
good,"Worked with a lot of good people, good place to work.  Safety is number 1.  Enjoyed learning and working on locomotives and troubleshooting them."
good,"Union Pacific Railroad is a strong organization that I would gladly work for again. The overall culture is positive and the pay and benefits are outstanding. My original plan upon getting hired was to complete my college education and move up within the company. Due to the closing of the facility in Denver, Co I would be forced to transfer and prolong my academic career. I believe that my skills and work ethic could be beneficial elsewhere. I learned how to manage my time efficiently and developed my interpersonal communication skills through working closely with management."
good,"Overall the railroad industry is a beast. You can be working everyday and then be out of a job the next. Expect to be furloughed within your first one to two years because of this. If you can make it past this hurdle, the benefits are great. Remember though that the rules are stiff, federally controlled and then even more tight within this Class 1 company. If you work the road, you are subject to call at anytime, the busier the tougher it is to figure out when you will work."
good,"This is a really good job that pays well with excellent benefits but sometimes the company goes through rough periods in which jobs, as well as money is cut. In order to really survive, seniority with the company plays a big role. Employees with high and top seniority have the most job stability while those with low seniority suffer when jobs are cut due to oil and gas prices and production. This job is very dangerous and one is to work safe at all times. Not only is your life on the line, but how you work also can have an effect on the next person, as well as the next like a ""domino effect."" Also this job requires work in all types of weather inclement so in the summer its extremely hot and winter very cold. Hydration is key and preached each and every day on the job. As stated before, this job pays very well and the benefits and retirement are exceptional, but people applying should also realize that you are away from home more than often. One should converse with their spouse or family before considering the railroad as a career. Overall, I enjoy it."
good,This is a great company to work for.  They have great retirement and insurance packets.  I learned many aspects of railroading and train handling skills.  The hardest part of the job was being away from love ones and missing out on family events
good,Always checked for compliance and safe practices. Fast-paced environment. Management varies. Co-workers vary. Hardest part of the job was the variability in processes. The most enjoyable part was the employees.

good,Benefits are fantastic.  Transitioning culture with high retirement rate over next two years.  Fantastic senior leadership with great vision.
good,learned sales and customer service techniques. good employees. enjoyed high physical out put.
good,While working for Union Pacific I was able to get promoted and had the opportunity to supervise work crews. The benefits were excellent. The pay was good. Life and home balance suffered due to the work schedule.
good,Too many cutbacks. Was hoping for a promising career doing something I love but seniority prevails in between the rails. Due to lay-offs I have no placement and have to find something with more stability. Maybe one day I can get back out there but times are tight and there’s some understanding there.
good,"its a good job, but when you are in the union and they start cutting positions and you are on the the bottom of the roster you will not have a settle job until everything calms down"
good,Good company to work for with good personal .Very good training and a new type of work with a great group of instructors.Enjoyed being a supervisor over a large group of great guys.
good,"The area I worked at wasn't the most updated. Facilities and equipment needed a complete overhaul. The benefits were great for those making a career, but for those starting out, a significant amount of income is kept by the union, and vacation is terrible starting out."
good,Union Pacific has good benefits and pay. The insurance is amazing with a low deductible. The hours are good (there are callouts and overtime required- but so worth it.)
good,"the work was not hard , it was a great learning experience , management was great , the hardest part was having to work in outside conditions, but most of all i really enjoyed working for the company."
good,"Union Pacific is a Union Company so employment is handled on a Union contract basis, once you have passed your probation period you are subject to Union Contracted employment rules"
good,"Very selective when it comes to becoming a freight conductor with a quite a bit of testing and job security was not protected until after a year of work.  Managers constantly test to see if you are rules compliant and there is plenty of training.  Overall, I loved the work and the people I worked work, but a family lifestyle is out of the question because the railroad comes 1st beyond anything else unless you have seniority."
good,"Every little boy's dream: to become a locomotive engineer. Although I was subject to call 24-7 for many years, it was a rewarding and interesting job that I wish I was still engaged in."
good,"UP have grown a lot in the 12 years that I've worked for them. The work like balance is a work in progress, but hard to manage as UP is a 24/7 365 days a year operation."
good,"Very flexible work culture; "
good,"You have to be commented to safety and travel.  The hardest part of the job will be missing birthdays, holidays and family.  UPRR has a lot of different work schedules that can balance work and family."
good,Good company to work for as an operations manager.  You will learn something new everyday and will be challenge to be productive and efficient and do so safely.
good,"Working at a 45,000+ company seems to be different than other places, but I wouldn't know yet. You can be a number and a person at the same time."
good,Fast paced call center in which you interface with internal and external customers.  Provide accurate and timely information on shipments.  Monitor shipments for problems.
good,I enjoyed working there and the people is great to work around. The company is great to work for. I made a lot friends there and they will take care of you.
good,Great company. great Benefits. work got slow in the hostler department in Long Beach and I was forced to resign because I couldn't pay my bills. High pay just not enough hours. Sometimes its good and sometimes its bad. I wish I was able to transfer to a different department. Good company just bad department
good,"Union Pacific Car Inspector, was a very physical job that on a day to day I would change train brake shoes and hook and unhook train engines,connect and disconnect air hoses all work was done outside rain or shine or the freezing cold Chicago weather."
good,Alot of favoritism goes on. They are working on the culture but alot of bad apples still exist and are allowed to exist in the management of the company
good,As one of the few companies to have been in business over 150 yrs the history of this company is like the history and construction of this country and I was always very proud of that.The company itself has always been very safety oriented and the job of moving freight is a responsibility i never take lightly.As far as the company is concerned all levels of management have always been supportive and they try and produce and environment that allows you to do your job safely and make a good living.
good,"long hours but learned to work with multiple personalities."
good,"Every day is unique and presents constant problems and unique situations to overcome.  Each day’s dynamic challenges with limited resources adds to excitement and sense of accomplishment daily.  Union Pacific being a transportation Logistics Company requires sound and timely decision making; wherein, each decision can either save or cost the company tens of thousands of dollars and can even lead to a customer shutting down if commodities not delivered on time.  The requirements of this fast paced job can be stressful, but also extremely rewarding in the sense of daily accomplishments."
good,This company is moving in the right direction.  Change management is key to this company's performance.  They have the right structures for process and management to execute it.
good,"Get ready to be called at all moments of the day or night. Along time away from home. Great group of co workers, when buisness is good its good, but can turn for the worst at anytime"
good,"Great job, pay, and benifits. I am currently looking for new and exciting opportunities for my family and I in northern Arizona."
good,overall a great place to work however its very time consuming you cant plan anything because you never know your days off
good,"If you don't mind poor management and being married to your job. The best money to be made is working the main line, the downfall is on call 24/7 and poor train dispatching."
good,"Through the years of working at Union Pacific Railroad, I got to learn a great number of things and work with great people. One of the most exciting things to do is to run the Spike Machine. I worked with replacing ties. "
good,"good job, lots of chances to move up in the company. Worked several places, and different jobs. The people that worked for me was hard workers."
good,"Very stressful environment and NOT an employee friendly company.  The work was interesting when you come into a mess, clean it all up, and watch it carry itself out.  The co-workers are always fatigued.  The worst part of the job is how much you are away from your family."
good,"I began designing and writing software, which later advanced me into systems engineering and project management.  I worked with Union Pacific subsidiaries, primarily with billing and accounting-related programs.  My management was open-minded and willing to explore employee-led suggestions and approaches.  My co-workers were very supportive towards each others' learning curves and upward mobility.  The most difficult part of job was supporting batch runs which required my attentiveness throughout the night.  However, this was balanced with the strengthening of my personal skillset across several engineering disciplines"
good,"In charge of the Locomotive blue network witch includes NLR, FTW, and ST Louis terminals. I find opportunities for enhancing service, increasing productivity and reducing costs.  I work in planning and analyzing data to monitor performance and plan improvements and demands of corridors lines to ensure that we meet internal and external client needs."
good,Build trains and work with dispatchers in delivering to suppliers. Learned Fra rules and regulations for trains. You work with a different co-worker everyday depending on seniority. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the schedule and new rules. The best part of the job is the pay and benefits.
good,Since I have held  three different positions in this company I can advancement is great.  I have learn about union laws and how it pertains to payroll and guidelines with the employees. My co workers were willing to assist with any problems or questions I ever had with my position. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to get so much experience in different areas of the company making myself more educated about my different jobs.
good,Mandatory 12hr. shifts with time and a half. Day went quickly because of heavy work load. Enjoyed workig outside within the elements.
good,"Absolutely loved working for Union Pacific. Started as a Brakeman,"
good,"we work until we are done we go by the rules and the managers directions. it doesn't matterwhat time of day or what the weather is, we wrok it and do it right"
good,I Came Unto The Job Uneducated About Anything Dealing With Mechanical Services And Learned A Number Of Skills Involving The Trade. The Coworkers Were Very Hospitable And Made The Job Much Easier. The Managers Were Fair At Times I Think The Hardest Part About The Job Was Dealing With Them Lol. I Believe The Most Enjoyable Part About The Job Was The Job.
good,"I really enjoyed working as an Intern for Union Pacific Railroad in their IT department. They provide plenty of resources for learning the necessary material to contribute effectively for your position, and there is plenty of room to grow in other areas as you can choose to study and transition to other jobs in the company easily on a 6-12 month basis."
good,"I loved working for UP, it was a rewarding, challenging job! Great benefits, challenging tasks and a great long term career. I highly recommend it to mechanically minded, active, energetic people!"

good,"I loved everything about this job except for one thing & that was they have a bunch off layoffs, in which I am currently in. They have great pay, Okay management, great people to work with,& you have fun at work a lot of times"
good,Great place to work if you want to make money and want a long term career... good pay with good benefits such as retirement and medical... not much advancement
good,I worked for the company for 23 years and of course it has pros and cons like any other job. We started out with a job and safety briefing. Got our work assignments. The company for very safe conscious.
good,Union Pacific has some good people and caring people that work togetherand they  have good retirement and benefits for the employees family and have advancement within the company
good,"A typical day consist of 25% completing normal job task and 75% following the vast rules and regulations not only to complete the normal task, but also all the way down to navigating the facility."
good,"The atmosphere and culture make it a great place to work."
good,"you're on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a weeks, you have a 3 hours response time. once at work you'll print out track warrants and printout of your trains. get update with dispatcher of incoming traffics.once on the trains you'll keep track of speed and be on the look out for any damage tracks. a day can last from 8-14 hours, depending on the flow of traffics."
good,I thought my experience was a good one loved the work and people. I had 2 great mangers . I work outside on a raised track . I was left to do my work tools always on hand made my job easier.
good,"For most part, good inter action with co workers. Safety highly stressed. Communication highly stressed. Attendance policy in later years got to be way too strict, however it was due to too many taking advantage of it in past. Need to work at all hours in all weather conditions"
good,"Good company. Excellent benefits. Does affect your quality of life with long work days and unorthodox work hours,but the compensation has potential to be worth it in the end. really all depends on the individual."
good,"I tested the air brakes on the rail cars. If they failed it was my responsibility to make the necessary repairs to the cars. I learned to use a welder, cutting torch, manual air tester, computer tester, various hand tools. It was also my responsibility to make sure the proper parts were ordered to make thoughts repairs. We try to stay up on the styles of cars. If there are major changes there could be class room training. The hardest part of the job can be trouble shooting the cars. The best part of the job is knowing when that car leaves the shop knowing it is a safe and reliable car. Its  enjoyable working with others."
good,Union Pacific is a very fast pace environment. Requires a lot of long hours and dedication. The people their are great to work with. The hardest part about the job is juggling work life with personal life. The pay is really good and the benefits are great.
good,"Loved the job was great at what i did learned to run engines. The best part was outside work, and the pay.. Traveled to lots of new places met lots of people/friends"
good,"I personally loved working there.  Good pay and not much stress.  Gained good work knowledge and experience from co-workers who I will miss.  Management was poor, especially on second and third shifts (management seemed non-existent).  All the difficult troubleshooting always seemed to stay on first shift and with all the same individuals.  No accountability for those who chose to slack-off.  I won't miss that part.  Not bad benefits, but not much vacation time, especially if you are a new guy (takes 8 years of employment just to get 3 weeks of vacation).  Unfortunately, UP closed the shop in Denver due mainly to the lack of coal trains.  I took a buy-out from the company instead of relocating.  Overall, my experience with Union Pacific was a positive one.  I am thankful for their offer to relocate or take a buy-out.  If I didn't have to move, I would have stayed with the company."
good,Good paying job.  Good benefits and retirement benefits the only thing is that everything is senority.  Its about a five year plan and have to deal with getting furloughed.
good,"Union Pacific has provided me with the ability work safely, while also getting the job done in a timely fashion. There was also a great retirement program."
good,relaxed pace. attention to detail. Very strict rules you have to follow since it is a dangerous job. Overall challenging and good pay.
good,At Union Pacific it was a job detail oriented place to work and it took everyone working as a team to get things done everyday. I worked out of Shakopee MN. it was as close to working with family as you could get without actually working with relatives. It was my job to take the train safely from Shakopee to wherever my destination was that day. It may seem simple to some but the work was 90% mental and then they asked for another 110% in the way of safety. I am really great at leading a team. every trip the engineer is the one who hold the burden of the trains performance. So he is the one in charge of the team on the train. It did not matter if there where ten inches of snow on the ground or if it was 100 degrees outside the work still had to be done and done safely.
good,"Pay is great, but travel is difficult to raise a family and I have to live far away and commute on weekends to see kids.  Railroad spends a lot of money to hire someone, then spends years trying to fire the same person they just hired."
good,"great job,greatest people to work with met people from all walks of life, truly one of the greatest expereinces of my life"
good,This company provided great work experience and advancement opportunities for entry level applicants. In ten years I was able to change positions 4 times and grow both personally and professionally.
good,"The Union Pacific afforded me the opportunity to begin my employment at 19 years of age as a communication lineman. From there I was able to work my way up to Denver Command Center Locomotive Manager. The UP promoted an environment of positive working relationships, growth potential and longevity. I enjoyed the intensity each position provided. Although there were many unique challenges, the comradery I experienced with my co-workers left me with lifelong friendships. The most challenging aspects of my job included coordination and control of employee scheduling, budgeting and confronting Colorado weather conditions. Each day presented its own demands but was extremely gratifying."
good,"Great company with great benefits, and the working environment was good. There was always someone there that could help me out if I had any questions about anything that I was unsure of."

good,I enjoyed both the mechanicl work along withthe security work at UP
good,"My day was normally productive. I would move freight on part of it's journey across country. It was always relaxing to out in the open air and traveling. As long as the freight was being moved safely and efficeintly , the management was always incourageing. My co-workers were normally up-beat and a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job was getting a large train moving and controlling it after it was moving. The most enjoyabl part of the job was at the end of day, when you knew you had completed another successful trip."
good,"This is a job where you must be able to travel extensively across the United States. On any given moment you might need to pack and move a few miles to thousands of miles. The personel I worked with on the most part, were extremely hard workers."
good,Fun place to work. Lots of time away from family wasn't cool. Pay was good and benefits were great. Travel was heavy and that was the only bad part. company wasn't a bad place overall.
good,Good benefits fast paced good pay travel learning experience good environment helpful people helpful managers good accommodations fun work environment
good,"Nice place to work. Everyone was very helpful when I was an intern. However, it is very large, and sometimes difficult to get things completed in a timely manner."

good,"At  7 am delivering a freight train from San Antonio, Tx to Houston Tx  and after 12 hours proceed to your designed hotel to rest for    10 hours. After resting in hotel you will delivery a train back to       San Antonio, Tx"
good,"a typical day would be in the morning will start with a job briefing make sure that the vehicle has the proper amount oil ,and the vehicle overall maint"
good,"Union Pacific is a well put together company, great benefits, good pay, and retirement. Maintenance on the railroad is hard work. They have newer tools to help relive some of the work load."
good,"Lots of good people here. Couple bad eggs that’s anywhere. Great pay, travel. Mangers were helpful couple just trying to get promoted at your expense."
good,Okay company to work for except the week life balance money is pretty de ent. Veterans should help out the newbies more in order for us to work together as a team.
good,Its great working for them if you like to travel. You get to meet lots of people and the benefits are great. The only thing is that the travel can be extensive keeping you away from home for long periods of time. The pay and benefits are great.
good,Fast pace and very safety oriented organization that treats there employees with respect.  Many job opportunities and family oriented.  Competitive pay and benefits.
good,Working for the railroad is different than any other job I've had. I love the work that I do in a challenging environment that provides new opportunities every day.

good,"Started as apprentice , went to machinist , went to shop supervisor . Sent me to Salt Lake City College to become EMD &GE locomotive certified passed and certified"
good,"I highly recommend the internship experience if you have nowhere else to go specifically. It was well paid, easy work, and I enjoyed my time. I don't know that I would stay there though, simply because it's located in Nebraska. They were also much more lax with the interns than I assume they would be with a full time dev."
good,"Strong teams and people who truly want to do the right thing, but recent executive leadership has been reactive and scared which has resulted in a fragmented company vision and less than ideal working culture."
good,Good place to work. Some advancement. Although long hours sometimes. I would recommend Union Pacific to most anyone. Not a lot of paid internal training.
good,"good benefits.  good location,  professional environment.  Must pay for parking though.  Enjoyed my time there.  Would work there again if they needed my skills"
good,Very good company to be employed for. benefit package is a pro. Opportunity for advancement is vastly available. Conn's. Travel away from home for long periods of times.
good,Good company to work for. The pay was good for the area. The benefits package was far better than most. Military friendly. As a mechanic working on Locomotives i was guaranteed 40 hours a week. UP held up to that even during the slow months.

good,The Railroad is a great place to work and has great benefits and retirement.  You travel a lot but you get to see a lot.  You meet some great people..
good,"Great place to work in terms of pay, benefits and promotion opportunity.  Work life balance is not so great overall but depends on where you are working and what level of management you are working - there are the very few and far between locations that allow a decent schedule to make up for the 12 plus hour shifts.  Basically as long as you are willing to move and work at least 60 hours a week then the world is your oyster as long as you can handle the bad with the good days."
good,"my job was all outdoors work, changing brake shoes on passenger  train cars and inspecting them before releasing them into service.Stopping and releasing locomotive engines for service daily."

We work all odd hours day and night, in the early hours of the morning. The benefits are worth the adjustment."
good,"A stable company and a good place to work.  My co-workers were helpful.  I have learned how important the rail industry is to the transportation world.

The company I worked for ( RAILCREW XPRESS) was the company, and they really working for Union Pacific as tranportation and their culture/ values are fine as long as it benefits them; which in turn gives Union Pacific a bad name. Union Pacific is just the loction RailCrew Xpress is the company. I will not say the company it self is the problem."
good,"work really isn't that hard for the pay, management is awful, you will never know what is actually happening within the company.  Coworkers are normally pretty cool, gossip is rampant like middle school girls though."
good,Good place to work if you're young. You will get laid off a lot your first 5 or 6 years. The higher ups are always changing things which can be frustrating.
good,"I learn something new every day. I like meeting people. I make my job fun. I'm a reliable person. I don't mind overtime. The work is not your typical day at the job. You still have to pay attention at all times. Your work schedule is not the same each day. Overall, a great place to work."
good,"Many lay offs and cuts.  Can work hard and long hours but there is a very strong lack of job security. They pay very very well however, there is a strong demand for work.  However, regardless of how hard you work and exception work ethics you're always susceptible to being laid off. Each year the company I had witnessed layoffs and cuts."
good,the job is very demanding and can be stressful at times. I enjoy trouble shooting and finding solutions. I am ready for a new challenge and motivated to learn. I have worked for the railroad for close to 27 years. My father worked for the railroad for 35 years. And his father worked for the railroad for 42 years. I guess railroading is in my blood.
good,A most typical day at work was you got woke up at some God awful hour and was told to sit on a train for periods of up to sometimes 18 hours and never move.  Management looks for you to make a mistake.  My co-workers were completely amazing.  Some of the smartest people I know work for the railroad.  It's not like some people think where the guy sits and waves to people at crossings.  The hardest part of the job is avoiding managerial traps.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the great people I was fortunate enough to have been able to work with.
good,Really love working there but based off of my low seniority i am unable to hold a job and currently working 2 days a week. Hopefully things pick up and I'll be back to full time.
good,"Run paperwork, review job briefing book and warrants, bulletins, etc. with other crew member, get ride to train. Contact Yardmaster, depart terminal (line switch(es), loosen hand brakes, etc.), Contact Dispatcher. Observe and document signals and restrictions, Sometimes pick up or set out railroad cars at various locations. Arrive at final location and swap with another crew, or yard train (separate cars, take engines to Roundhouse). Get ride to hotel for 10 hours undisturbed rest.  Wait for call to take train for return trip.Management may test at any time, both structured and unstructured tests. People who do similar work are meeting at the main terminals and also on other trains and at hotels. Managers are friendly but will try to test you to an unreasonable level and sometimes too frequently. The hardest part of the job is never knowing when you will be called for work, missing birthdays, holidays and many personal events.  There is typically a 90 minute response for reporting for duty. The different routes and variations in terminals are challenging but enjoyable."
good,"If you would like to live at work and never see your family, this is the job for you. The Union Pacific is not a family oriented company. The company pays very well, but you must sacrifice your all of your time.  It is impossible to make any plans when being on call, 24 hours a day, seven days a week."
good,"Great benefits and money, but the uncertainty of having a job is always there. Not the best job to raise a family. Very time consuming and long days away from family."
good,Low pay...expectations of working long hours and employees are not the best.  There were two lay-offs when I worked there and was holding my breath that I would be laid off.
good,"High Level Stress work environment with more than acceptable compensation, safety culture, and a rigorous push for a decent work life balance and an unrivaled retirement package.  The people that work there are very serious about the success of the railroad."
good,"This is not a job for the weak.  Long hours, no schedule.  On call 24/7.  Away from home a lot.  Strict rules and guide lines.  No holiday pay.  The culture is what you get paid for.  Benefits have gone down hill over the years."
good,"Lots of new challenges, always an opportunity to learn new things in the scope of the job, management encourage grown. "
good,Favorites favoritism they like to help buddies but if you aren't in with someone you will never be treated equal.The pay is amazing and it is an amazing company I just was in a bad location
good,"I wouldn’t recommend working for this company, they’re having major lay offs and horrible working conditions. UP was rated the worst company to work for in 2019."
good,"I enjoyed working as a Crew Dispatcher, and would do it again in a heartbeat. My co-workers and managers made for a fun work environment. There were plenty of options for advancement."
good,"Consisted of working 4 hours a day and could work at my own pace as long. My own schedule , worked alone, overall just great environment and very easy."
good,Great Work force to be apart of. If you're looking for a company with good pay and heath insurance for your family UP would be the place to consider..
good,great company with the great benefits and pay. Lots of travel and the possibility of getting laid off without notice. Unions are very weak and don't do much to protect employees.
good,"Great company fast paced good pay "
good,Good paying job but I am making about $345 for 8 hours. Everything after that is overtime and you can only work a major 12hours by law in the transportation department.
good,"Great place to work good people and highly motivated atmosphere. Most be on time and highly motivated to work no matter the weather conditions, Always ready."
good,Union Pacific is a good company to work for but the management there is very racist and prejudice and don't care about the brothers there and are very unfair
good,Marketing and Sales is the lifeblood of Union Pacific Railroad. They push every worker to maximize profit which is beneficial to understanding the business fast.
good,"Great company, opportunity for advancement limited as a result of culture of not always working for UP Railroad."
good,A wide variety of opportunities for a long and varied career in a stable and highly respected organization. Education and career growth are encouraged and supported. Opportunities are constantly posted for employees to determine their own career path.
good,"Union Pacific es la mejor empresa de enseñanza de idiomas en la que he trabajado, en lo que respecta al trato hacia los profesores, las facilidades, la confianza y el respeto y valor por nuestro trabajo. "
good,this company was great to work for.  it provided growth potential and opportunities. great benefits and nice working environment. i would work there again if the opportunity presented itself.
good,I love this industry.  It is a fast-paced challenging job with its rewards of problem solving and helping build America with a great team of dedicated professionals to engage with.
good,"Responsible for all aspects of fluid rail terminal performance.  Supervised agreement and non agreement employees.  Ensured all operating goals were attained on time, and within operating budget."
good,love working there and serving the customers that walked in everyday. the pay was average and the hours were long. good place to get experience
good,"Typical work day of 12 hours on-call to a particular assignment.  "
good,"Very customer oriented.  Quality craftsmanship. Always went the extra mile to make the customer's ideas come to life. Fair and honest pricing, used quality materials, great people to work with."
good,Great place to work and grow. Good benefits and the pay compensates the hard work and long hours. Good place to look down the line at a full career and retirement.
good,"Great long-term company to work for  if having a family. Also, included outstanding benefits for employees. If you enjoy traveling there are a lot of different options available within the company."
good,"Great Company to work for as a lifelong career.  Good jobs and great Benefits.  Warehouse duties, driving forklifts, stocking and receiving locomotive parts. Learned many warehouse skills including driving different forklifts, jackstackers, learning Union Pacific computer system.  Management o.k.  Co-workers easy to work with. Hardest part of job lifting 95 lb. locomotive parts. Otherwise loved stocking the shelves and ordering parts through the system"
good,Union Pacific Railroad is a great company to be employed by. There is always an opportunity for learning every day you go to work.
good,"Working on the railroad was not difficult at all. The toughest part of my day was working in the outside elements. (extreme heat, rain, etc.) The most enjoyable part of the job was the camaraderie amongst the employees.  Everyone got along great for the most part.  I learned the ins and outs of transporting freight."
good,"Giving a list of tracks needed to be switched out.  Usually 90 to 100 railroad cars. As foreman you determined how to switch out cars with the least amount of moves required, saving time, fuel, locomotive wear and tear."
good,"For the past 14 years I have served as a Journeyman Signal Control Maintainer for the Union Pacific Railroad.  For the past 5 years, I have served as a Field Signal Control Planning Supervisor, and was responsible for ensuring that my Company remained in Compliance with both State and Federal environmental policies and guidelines.  "
good,"An enjoyable place to work with some long hours, but nice travel co-workers."
good,"I working on the road, while riding on the train, seeing the different location of our services unit."
good,Well paying job. Good benefits. Fast-paced work environment.
good,Team work is a large part of working at the UP. The IT department is always innovating.
good,operating a tamping machine was a typical day
good,Work is great very strong company the employees come to work ready and willing to work hard.
good,Good company to start at an earlier age. Not a good fit for everyone. Very difficult testing  and training. Very knowledgeable training staff. Get lots of sleep.
good,"This is a good company to work for. But you must be prepared to be away from home quite a bit. Also, furloughs are highly probable when starting out. This for all Railroad companies."
good,good place to work good pay and benifits. long day way from family and home. very little time to rest and spend time wife loved ones. pay is execellent
good,great place to learn a rewarding craft. Pay does not compensate for high cost of living areas. Such as California. Work culture left many uneasy employees as management were instructed to write up employees.
good,"On call so never know of when you are going to work which resulted in lack of proper rest. Learned a lot about locomotive operations over the most demanding territory in the nation. Management had lack of communication with operating employees which made it difficult to know certain aspects of what they wanted at times. The people i directly worked with were decent and easy going. The hardest part of the job was getting proper rest due to lack of knowing when you were going to work. The most enjoyable was the travels and sights I seen, a very prideful job."
good,"Hard to get on, but once your employed it is a great job. Benefits are number 1! Amazing compensation. Wonderful co workers. Brotherhood!"
good,"Union Pacific is a good company , need to involve personel or keep them informed when new material is going to need attention, job postings, locomotive training. And keep employees informed."
good,I was in the transportation side of the industry and although it was exciting what i did and i loved every minute of it and the employees i worked with. the life style was the hardest part. I was on call 24/7 and that may not work for everyone.
good,"Good Company overall. "
good,Small department that has limited resources and budget. Great work practices and opportunity to learn. The department requires assistance from other law enforcement groups in the event of major incidnets.
good,"After 10+ years of dedicated employment I was released in their new program called workforce reduction. 100% compliant, 100% safety record, and no disciplinary infractions...Now, Isn't that something?"
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my job with the Union Pacific.  They treated me very well and pay was amazing.
good,Its a good company but I think they worry more about the company than the employees but you have to have good employees to make money.
good,"Its the railroad, never know if your going to have a job tomorrow, but while im still here its a good learning experience going from maintenance of way to a locomotive shop"
good,Great job for individuals looking for a craft to gain experience however in today’s economy lay offs are prevalent.  Contract negotiations are drug out with red tape at every step.  Company great but be prepared for the way unions work.
good,"Just do it this job is not for everyone but there is only one way to find out. The pay is good the company is fair, and the people you meet are the best part."
good,"Excellent Company to work for. Operations has pros and cons with lifestyle, but overall a great company. It is a 24/7 company, and working in the field comes with being on call, working overnights, holidays and weekends. Non field/operations lifestyle very family friendly."
good,Everything depends on your manager and luckily I had a good one but the culture is stagnant.  Things move at a slower pace.  But great opportunity to work with big numbers.
good,I loved working at Union Pacific.  I learned so much there as it was my first internship.  Their technology stack is great and there staff knows how to build code.  I ran into some work politics that cause my work termination though....
good,Productive work place with lots of benefits. The hardest part of my job is the quality of life I have working here. I get to see a lot of scenery while at work.
good,"Day started @ 8 am & continued til 4pm"
good,first factor job good pay cool people but managers and higher ups just want more and more from you everyday cant make any of them happy
good,use radio communication following fra regulations to build locomotive train consist to operate and drive trains for union pacific  railroad according to the assigned train orders. perform job and safety briefings  and set up locomotive shop
good,A typical day at Union Pacific is remaining alert to operate a locomotive engine through various signals. I learned how to communicate with others and pay attention to details.
good,"This is a place where you can learn grow and be challenged. The management recognizes skill and wants to see employees succeed. Certain positions can be overwhelming, and job security isn't the best but when it comes to merit, UP takes care of its employees."
good,Job security sucks for younger seniority guys. Great training programs. Adequate safety gears provided. Great benefits and pay package. Safety is a number one priority!
good,Be prepared to move around ... you will not be at home often. No schedule. .you will not be able to hold a job in Houston.  You will get two hour advance notice to head to work. No scheduled off days nor work days
good,"Typical day at work included job briefing  information about train. This included reviewing rules, route and/or train restrictions, possible Haz Mat materials and emergency responses. Inspection of locomotive engines and ensuring train was together and ready to depart (checking for air brake inspection slips, putting online correct number of locomotive engines for train and intended route, and ensuring air flow reached entire length of train). While in route, observing all rules and speed restrictions as applicable to our train. Understanding and obeying signals and verbal instructions from dispatcher for our train's movement.Also responsible for either repairing, correcting or removing defective equipment in route."
good,"Union Pacific has great employees, benefits and compensation. It was a pleasure spending 30 years of my career working in various positions throughout the company."
good,If you dont mind dealing with cry baby lazy co workers then this is job for you but if working hard is something you want to do then this isnt the job for you the culture is work hard for 2 and relax for 6. God bless america.
good,"Railroad work is satisfying and the pay is better than most jobs, making life very comfortable. very safety orientated job, but a safe career choice for long term stability"
good,I loved my time at UP and wished I could’ve stayed in some capacity of another. I was furloughed and never received a call back so I have been diligently trying to find other openings within the company that offer more job security than being a conductor.
good,"I was a marketing intern at Union Pacific and I enjoyed almost every part of my experience. Unfortunately, this was an unpaid internship and I could no longer afford to be an intern."
good,It was nothing to come in to work and new that you where going to have a good day. The people where cool to work with. The environment was stress free.
good,I love working for Union Pacific it has taking care of me and my 3 sons for almost 21 years. I would trade it for anything. I hope my sons work here one day.
good,Union Pacific is a great place to work.  It is a retirement job with some of the best benefits in the country.  If you ever have a chance to work at these company take it.
good,"A typical day at work consists of gathering paperwork, conversing with management about what needs to be done for the day and discussing with co workers the duties at hand."
good,lifestyle change that will completely through you through the loop and have you frustrated and upset. Once you get pass the poor management and the seniority issues everything changes for the better
good,"Long hours with little time off.  Crucially important to the nations economy.  If College life is the extent of your life experience, I would highly suggest looking elsewhere."
good,"I really enjoyed the people I worked with, they were like an extension of my family.  In a time where pensions are disappearing, it's nice to have worked for an organization that still honors their retirees."
good,"I have worked for union pacific for about thirty years during this time I have learned a lot about the railroad and outs operations. How to work safe and be productive, wail maintaining a high quality of work."
good,Work is outdoors and at night. There is a lot of responsibility that comes with the position. Management is concerned with safety of everyone involved within the operations.
good,"Enjoyed the time I worked in KC, learned alot and made alot of good friends. Start out with morning job briefings, then get lined up to work. Lunch later and then finish up the day. Work safe go home safe"
good,Overall great experience. Gained experience in a variety of commodities including agriculture. Company of strong management and experience.  Top railroad company in the industry.  Learned a great deal in my 31 years.  Was responsible for both large sales teams and direct account management.  All business activity included business development and existing account development.
good,It’s a good company just work is slow at this time so they are laying off.  It’s an experience like no other job you will ever work. The work schedule will take some getting use too.
good,I enjoyed working there but I had to relocate cause I lived 3 hours away but overall it was good met different people and yes you could advance to different departments or positions
good,"A great place to work that makes you feel like you are truly part of the team that “Builds America”. Since it is part of the transportation industry, the work schedule can be a challenge to manage, but the overall rewards of working for such a historically important company far outweigh the challenges faced by a 24/365 work environment."
good,If it was not for family matters I would have not left.  A motivated person can and will work up the corporate ladder.  The hours are long  but rewarding.  On top of that you get railroad retirement.  It is better than social security.
good,Union Pacific is a great opportunity for anyone wanting to make a career. Union Pacific was my dream job for as long as I could remember. All I ever wanted to be in life was a railroader.
good,It was a great job for the past 6 years but unfortunately getting laid off. I would highly recommend Union Pacific but just expect to get laid off at some point
good,"great place to work to make a lot of money. family time was cut short. on call 24/7. built trains in training, went to the main line to transport trains."
good,"Working for the railroad you assemble and move trains throughout your district. Depending on your assignment you may travel overnight and bring a different train home the next day. The pay and bennifits are great, the people you work with are true professionals. The hardest part of the job is walking distances on loose ballast rock and working outdoors in extreme weather. You are on call 24 / 7 , this makes it hard to impossible to schedule any family or outside activity. Your job security is completely based on seniority. Management is top notch and very helpful."
good,This was an amazing opportunity to work for a large company that was made to feel personal and small. Always striving to make us better with training and education. This was a job that allowed me to be in back and front of the desk and to be hands on our clients.
good,Union Pacific is a great work place. There's great retirement and benefits I like working there. The work schedule is a little tough for a family but manageable. I'm just looking for something with a little more pay with better working schedules and chances to work overtime.
good,"I loved working for the UP. It was a rewarding career. The people are what makes the Union Pacific a good place to work. Management has its ups and downs, but that is the way of the world."
good,the SP was an excellent company to teach me railroading. the people at the company were exceptional would not trade experience
good,I enjoy riding and working with trains. The people I work with are good people. Great benefits and great pay. The retirement is one of the best out there for now.
good,"Good pay for hard work mostly in a work partner arrangement.  Choose your partner wisely, or you'll be doing the most.  Good benefits.  Good training available.  Learn as you go, from a more experienced partner."
good,"I have learned quite a bit as a manager at Union Pacific.  One of the most valueable things I have learned is acknowledging who your customer is.  As a manager, my customer was not only my superior supervision however it my customer were the employees under me as well.  The most enjoyable part of my the job is the great balance between office environment and field environment."
good,This is where I thought that I was going to retire until the economy collapsed and I was furloughed twice  in one year and could not hold on any longer.
good,"Lots of travel, differing work assignments, great pay. Unforseeable layoffs."
good,It is one of the best jobs I have ever had. The company is great and the benefits are awesome. The people there are understanding and will help with any question you have regarding to the job.
good,"I truly loved my job. A typical day included delivering materials to the shop, unloading trucks, checking in materials and stocking materials. Everyone in the department worked well together."
good,"Very good company, room for advancement, many different crafts. Excellent benefit, and retirement package. Only downfall is Union shop and may have to travel until seniority gains."
good,The company is very Process Oriented and focused on deliverable and on timeline. It helped me to focus and implement on new technologies from the Testing perspective.
good,Not an easy job but you're well compensated. You mostly work independently without anyone bothering you. Moral isn't exactly high but you rarely see anyone leave.
good,"The company reps aren't lying when they tell you the railroad comes first in life and everything else comes after that. If you're single, this is definitely an excellent company to work for. Great pay, amazing benefits, and the retirement package is perfect!"
good,The benefits are amazing and the pay is great. The management is good for the most part but the job can get hectic and stressful at times. Most positions are pretty physically demanding and can incur overtime with little notice.
good,"Union Pacific provides challenging work, professional growth opportunities, while holding employees accountable and rewarding them for good performance"
good,"Great place to work, very safe work environment, I would recommend this place to anyone to work at. The people you work with work together as a team and look out for one another."
good,Starting off the shift as the the lead man i conducted the safety  meeting after that i was to call the yard master too get the work load once i got the work load it was my job as the lead man to go and lock all the tracks so all the other car man can begin their inspection.something Ive learned working on the railroad is that you always double check esp  when locking up the tracks at. Management i just understand that they have a job to do and they would NOT allow us to cut corners they enforced safety they expected you to do your job safe and that it. Work place culture very family oriented. No real hard parts of the job. Most enjoyed part of the job i enjoy the craft good benefits great pay and i enjoy the craft.
good,I enjoyed my time with the railroad. In the first five years you have to worry about furloughs but all in all a very good company to work for. I would definitely recommend anyone taking the job if given the opportunity.
good,"Working for Union Pacific is a pretty standard 9-5 job.  The office is your typical cube farm.  I was definitely challenged in my work, and I learned a lot in the time I was there.  My manager and more experienced teammates were also willing to lend a hand or explain something to me if I didn't understand."
good,Don't worry about why just do it like they want. It was much easier for me when i quit trying to figure out why. There are good days and bad. If you hang in there the retirement is about 3 times social security and 5 to 7 years earlier than ss. I would do it again. I retireď with 37 years
good,Having to be away from home for 4 days but usually 8 days. Other than that I really enjoy coming to work everyday. Even when off I can't wait to go back to work.
good,"I learned to control and maneuver train cars in accordance with Union Pacific rules. The days often ran long, but was well paid for the extra hours. The co-workers are all seasoned rail men, and I enjoyed talking with them, and learning from them. I enjoyed the job as a whole, it's a fun job"
good,"Crew chief was a very rewarding but very hard job. There was days that were slower that we could try and catch up on things, but for the most part it was a go go go job. Younger airmen were definitely the busiest people on the flight line. From the moment you step through the door to the moment you leave airmen will be doing any and all tasks that are available. Start of shift could be morning (launch jets), evening (quick-turns), or nights (catch jets). No matter what shift you were on there was always jobs to do. They could be a few big ones or a ton of little ones, but no matter what you were never done. If you thought you were done because your assigned jet was caught up you were swept off to work with another crew on their jet. This could be somewhat aggravating at times, but over all made us a tight group of workers. Also taught us not to be lazy and get the job done so you can give your friends a hand with their work if it was harder. Hardest part of the job was the long hrs on night shift and the long exercises we would do. Though it had its up sides, at least for me, and that was launching and catching the jets, that was fun."
good,union pacific railroad is a fun yet demanding job. As of late its really hard to hold a job in the midwest due to less demand for frac sand and oil. however over all holding a conductor position is fun. A lot of responsibility but continues to be rewarding.
good,"Interesting job, no day is the same. Working on call 24/7 is not for everyone. Great people to work with. Hardest part is getting a 2 am call. Most enjoyable part, your coworkers"
good,Traveled a lot and managed work force in implementing new systems and software at various locations on the railroad..  The hardest part was being away from my family but otherwise had nothing but good time with any position.
good,"Pay was good considering the economy,the work was pretty easy and fair."
good,good career oppurtunity
good,A typical day consisted of arriving and retrieving paperwork. Once you had paperwork you were taken to your train. It was then in the hands of the dispatcher. Trains were taken daily to a town called Clinton in Iowa
good,Good job  limited off time and very hard to plan around very demanding job with uplanable work days and start times. High stress environment with very hands on work environment
good,Great place to work with benefits work life balance can be a issue at times. Government 12 on 10 off regulated but overall great experience. Plenty of great benefits
good,"I worked as a clerk & chief clerk for Alton & Southern Railway in East St. Louis, a subsidiary of Union Pacific railroad.  My job included keeping track of inventory (rail cars), transporting crews, keeping updated billing on rail cars and as chief, managing the clerk department, building train consists and dispatching crews.  Overall work environment is good, though you must have a tough skin to be female and work in a predominately male industry.  The hardest part of the job is being low on the seniority roster and working double shifts 2nd and 3rd for several days.  Lots of lost sleep the last year and half I worked there. Physically, I couldn't take the sleep deprivation.  This girl needs to sleep.  I do miss the work, then men and everybody that worked at the railroad.  It was an awesome job, just not for me."
good,"Union Pacific has been good to me and my family, Learned a lot working for UnionPacific! The company did have new hire classes where they trained us for the job , they had conductor class along with remote control class. The training lasted a total of 6 months . They definitely were training for the job you were hired for."
good,"Working great hours and shifts. The safety culture is very important and valued there, it really makes you feel safe and the people around you care. The toughest part in my opinion is having a welder job and not welding or advancing with your welding skills. I really enjoyed learning other parts of the job even though it wasn't welding."
good,"Working with the locomotives was a great learning experience and very enjoyable. The regular schedule in the mechanic shop is definitely a plus. Working swing or overnight may be difficult if you have a family, but great benefits otherwise."
good,Everybody there is super friendly. It is a family atmosphere at Fort Worth facility. Wish I could have stayed longer but the company had other plans. So be wary if Union Pacific ever decides to change operation you might it furloughed
good,Frequent travel made the job challenging.  The position kept me engaged to perform my best and I was provided support from management to get the job done.
good,"Absolutely loved  my time with Union Pacific Railroad.  Learned so much in the short time I was employed with them.  Loved the people, loved the fact that there was always opportunities to learn new skills and knowledge.  My experience with management was top notch.  Great benefits and a very good work/life balance - something that this organization has made a priority."
good,I felt extremely fortunate to have worked at Union Pacific for 23 years. It was a great job and I learned a lot about accounting while working there. I would most likely still be there if they had not relocated to Omaha.
good,my job was to fuel and oil trains during my 8 hour shift. hardest part of the job was the working in the weather especially winter. the most important thing was the safety of our job. doing the job properly and safely.
good,In the IT department you are able to leverage your knowledge and work on different projects throughout your career.  Education for your job can be free or paid for with company reimbursement.
good,Union pacific railroad is a very good company to work for. The only reason I did leave the company was because of so much away from home time there was.
good,"There is alot of down time, not much urgency towards our projects. Management was good, my manager allowed much time for my volunteer work.  I really enjoyed my team, and our agile transformation"
good,"There really isn't a ""typical"" day at Green River diesel pit.  Sometimes it is feast or famine, for the shift I work.  Most days consist of doing a distributed power link up on 2 trains.  We also will work locomotives that come in on terminating trains.  I have learned to be patient with new employees, I also enjoy training the new employees.  The train management is usually a college graduate, who wants to change the world, they do not have the knowledge on how the railroad works.  As far as the management I work for are good people to work for.  Knowledgeable and the come from the crafts, carman or the locomotive craft.  The hardest part of my job is, trying to get trains moving when we have the yardmasters, management and the dispatcher riding our backs while we are trying to get the train rolling down the rails.  I really enjoy training new employees and the satisfaction of seeing trains roll out, knowing I worked that power or got the train running again."
good,Really good company to work for they value their employees and there are plenty of opportunities for advancement u will love it
good,Many opportunities to grow professionally.  Lot's of required and optional training available.  Salary very competitive
good,it is most definitely the most exciting job I've ever had. you learn a lot about how to assemble trains and how to operate them on the freight side. On the commuter side of things getting the opportunity to work for metra was extremely fun. it was more fast paced than freight but you get to meet a lot of nice people and travel to cities you may have never seen previously.
good,"I was hired on by Union Pacific on January 12,2015 and haven't looked back since. I worked for the company all the way until October when a downturn in the market and economy forced the company to make multiple furloughs in which I am currently a furloughed employee with no immediate callback date. However, despite this I have no complaints about the company. The pay is more than fair, the benefits are second to none, and you have a lot more home time than people will tell you even if it is slightly irregular.
