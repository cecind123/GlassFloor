rating,review
bad,"Poor management, poor integration of Teradata and Aprimo, terrible training, did not take advantage of existing customers, Manager not engaged, management turnover"
bad,"All new management with little Teradata Knowledge or experience making all the business decisions, mostly poor.  Too many hours, too many new people, lot's of layoffs (expect 2 a year)."
bad,Horrible company.  Ran like the old NCR company.  In real financial trouble.  Find work elsewhere.  Management is out of touch with the changes in the industry.  Very old school company.
bad,"Interesting business in the Data Warehousing and Bid Data business areas. Focus on Licence and HW business, developing its consulting capabilities."
bad,"Mumbai office is hopeless. They allocate job profiles, mindlessly. Lots of confusion. Even after allocation to projects, there was lot of reshuffling. People were shifted projects, after being allocated for a month. "
bad,Great work life balance because managers cared more about  their own agenda instead of working to make the company successful. Practices and processes lack innovation. I left Teradata because I was scared of being irrelevant in my career. Comp plan became a disincentive  I witnessed many of my peers careers bring stalled. They don’t give you the tools to advance or keep up with current business practices or technology. Multiple reorgs and downsizing is demotivating. This company is shrinking when the competition is  growing. HR is a train wreck and lack humanity.
bad,"In a reorganization process, there is a lack of communication between management and the team"
bad,Lots of churn.  You will need to chart your course carefully.  Great products.  Lots of politics.  You need to keep your head down.  Less politics within teams.
bad,"Worked on a newer cloud product and Management has zero vision.  Avoid if you want to save your sanity.  They have no visibility into cloud vs on-premise and are still, completely reliant on large physical hardware."
bad,"- Nothing much to be said."
bad,Great history but currently transitioning to a SaaS world and struggling.  Most likely an acquisition target at this point.
bad,"Management is not open to suggestions, and continues to make decisions without supporting data.  Recent changes from industry to geo-based for sales and support organizations was made quickly without understanding culture and customer impact."
bad,The corporate solution to fiscal issues is to layoff employees.  There is never any attempt to fix the problem that caused the issue.  The issues are usually poor upper management schoice in corporate direction.
bad,Interesting company. Gone through a lot of changes since I worked there.
bad,Work/life balance is terrible.  Compensation is well below industry.  Management within the Controllers group is poor and will blatantly lie to employees.  Career advancement during my tenure was non-existent across the entire company. Working on your vacation is an expectation.  They provide a corporate phone which as an international company called at all hours of the day and an expectation of working 24 hours a day as well.
bad,"If you have a decent managers in the office, things will be good, if you don't its gonna make your work life suffer, don't expect much.  There is a park near by that you can scream atthe end of your work day but its closed during the winter.  Most managers in IT seem rather level headed, but something is changing in the air."
bad,Training was sparse and not always related to the job on hand.  At times new software would be added with not training available.  Support was limited to break/fix and not training.
bad,"This department has a very childish attitude, there really was not team efforts.  Everyone was out for self.  Other department seemed to welcome diversity and valued employees opinions.  Meeting other employees from other areas was very nice and they were welcoming and helpful."
bad,"•	Experience with different system nodes (Teradata 5400, 5500, Intel Romely servers & Dell PowerEdge 2800, 2900 R710 and R720)."
bad,Great ideas and equipment to work on. Fun technology but people are not so much. Change management too much which resolved to no raises and also not knowing what is going on with the latest projects or each individuals work.
bad,Totally mismanaged and no focus at all . Not sure the road map they have and totally confused currently . Need to develop plan and new technology to survive in market .
bad,"new mgt is not communicating at any level and long time employees are and will be walking. "
bad,Bad Company. they don't care for their Employees. No Extra pay For Extra Hours worked. No Assistence provide for any Certifications. Higher Management is never reachable.
bad,"They need to work on improving communication, enforcing work ethics, and removing obstacles to sales.  I learned a lot there and made good money.  They’ve burned a lot of bridges with customers."
bad,"Teradata struggles in 2 key areas-- management and marketing. Neither are valued at the senior level, so the company suffers.  The people are kind and many of them smart. The culture is variable depending on your location and manager."
bad,"Teradata used to be a company with innovations, and was a leader in the industry.  With management changed in the past 10 years, short sighted in seeing the future, plus limit the spending in R&D, no new technology was developed, and instead, just trying to catch up and to be a follower, with what they call the ""industry trend"".  Ended up in too late to deliver the products customers needed."
bad,"The senior management is old school, hard time modernizing. This is an old boys club. Lacks diversity. Is currently in transition  and lacks clear direction. Is late to the cloud offering and has no serious analytics practice to speak of. Highly focused on selling EDW, which is a dying business."
bad,"The current management has ideas that may not be the best for the long run, but they are set on carrying them out.  Hopefully they will not harm the company too badly in the process."
bad,Have friendly coworkers and they would like to help you in need. But the management is doing something clueless and keep laying off people trying to make Wall Street guys happy.
bad,"Good place to work, but no longer financially stable. Co-workers always willing to help. Very smart engineers. Good work/life balance. Pay was decent."
bad,I enjoyed my work very much. Working with our customers and partners and assisting them with their issues was rewarding for me.  It was a great team that I worked for and the manager was exceptional and I learned a lot from him. I will miss them all.
bad,"Back when I worked for Teradata, the Manhattan office was a fun place to work, although I did not spend a lot of time there. I had a great consulting assignment with Standard & Poor's. Teradata corporate management, at the time, was truly antique. The total compensation was also quite low, which led me to seek employment elsewhere."
bad,"I would not recommend Teradata at this time.   Job situation is unstable - they hire and then do mass layoffs.   Middle managers, at least the two I worked under, were incompetent and had no clue what people were doing.   Pay is below industry standard, though benefits are decent."
bad,Worked there as a consultant for 6 years until I had to leave due to personal reasons. Very data integration heavy company. Lack of focus on the business imo. Mostly work through IT departments. Nothing bad to say about it but will be interesting to see if they can make the transition from data integration technology vendor to analytics/big data company.
bad,"All management is new after CEO sacked in 2015.  Teradata missed the Cloud train and is in catch up mode.  However, no cash in the coffer so it could buy a smaller company to leap in the Cloud."
good,Corporate/company changes are on-going.  HQ has been relocated to CA.  Local company footprint/presence is rapidly decreasing.  Good vision and good people.
good,challenged with Hadoop and Cloud analytics offerings -> slow to no growth;  would be best to merge/ sell company;  selling marketing analytics is only firs step..
good,Leadership team and strategy somewhat antiquated.  Need to invest in Marketing and Business Planning
good,"Transitioning from hardware and perpetual licensed software to cloud based, subscription services is difficult and revenues drop significantly.  It's unavoidable in order to establish a consistent revenue model.  Others in the business go private in order to transition.  Teradata remains a public company to their credit."
good,Mixed bag employer & job opportunities limited. Good-ol-boys club mentality with supervisors/managers. Questionable HR practices.
good,"People in the same jobs since I've been here.  Pay is below average. If it wasn't for a good work/life balance I would have left long ago. Once you're in, established and show value you will be stuck in the same job unless you leave or are laid off."
good,provided the opportunity to learn a lot and gain new experience and expertise.  Last three years in transition limited ability to have significant impact
good,"Responsible tracking and auditing travel & expenses for over 30 countries globally which is cultrally interesting and challenging. We have a good group of people and great contacts within the other department internally and globally. Hardest part is at times the language barrier, but we work with it and in the end it works. But, this can also be the most enjoyable, learning about all other parts of the world. All in all a great company!"
good,This is a Consulting Services.  This job does not offer room to grow your career.
good,"Good company to work with. Above avg. salary. "
good,"There was a nice laid back IT officevibe. If you did your work well and showed up to work on time, there was a decent amount of flexibility. The company recently has experienced a reduction in force with lots of uncertainty ahead. Top level execs have received multimillion dollar bonuses/pay outs meanwhile throngs of low level employees even with years of service will receive paltry in comparison severance packages. I wouldn't recommend pursuing a position here during this transitionary time."
good,"Management does not perform in the 21st century.  Workplace culture is good, but suggestions and collaboration with management goes nowhere. Had 5 different managers in 4 years and never met or saw one of them!"
good,"Starts out well.  New CEO was former customer and went back, went to Harvard for an Exec MBA - knows everything now.  Solid Board of Directors but afraid that their market making ideas are way past their prime!!"
good,"Excellent company, older technology, poor leadwsehrip, and no marketing. The company was literally run by the management firm (BAIN and CAPITAL) oinvestment company that took it over."
good,"Work environment was great and was able to work from home. First boss was great til he was laid off.   "
good,"Low bases, but good commision plan if you have the right territory and a large install base.  If not, very difficult to sell into accounts without a Teradata strategy."
good,"The work life balance is good. "
good,The equipment is cheap and minimal.  The work load is large and more tasks added all the time.  Management is in another country or state and have no idea what it takes to get the job done.  The manager three levels up is a bully and the manager two levels up an out of touch control freak.  Departments don't work well together and at times actually hamper your ability to resolve issues by refusing to do their part in the resolution.
good,Fast paced environment.  Things are constantly changing as they move to the new business model.   The work life balance has really been suffering for the last two years.
good,"Learned that old school companies need to begin transforming earlier in the product life cycle."
good,The project I am working on Marketing Analysis application. A great team to work with and exposure to lots of technology within the big data Marketing Analytic.
good,"Too much business, not enough skilled people.  High turnover.  Good compensation.  Limited career path.  Very inefficient in processes.  Leadership not trusted by the market place."
good,"Work/Life will depend upon the group.  Some groups are very Agile/helpful, others are entrenched in politics.  It would be wise to interview the interviewers to evaluate if the department will be a fit."
good,"Teradata is a company moving through an exciting transformation. Teradata's history means they are built to serve enterprises - like no other competitor. It is a great place to work, where you will have endless opportunities to move into different functions, jobs and make your own career. Given the size of the company, there is not a lot of bureaucracy or politics. If you have a great idea, you will be given the time and space to be innovative and do amazing things for customers. The biggest strength is the amazing people you will work with and the experience you will get working for some of the biggest (most impressive) companies in the world who are Teradata customer"
good,"Do consultant careful focus on the client. A typical day at TD is winding route, you can past the time at deploy your task or as is common to made trainning."
good,This company is closing down its Dayton branch. It is relocating to San Diego. I am confident there will be some positive opportunities for those looking for employment on the west coast.
good,"Provides work life balance"
good,Teradata was a fun place to work and I thoroughly enjoyed my time there - I was brought in to break a vertical and although it was difficult at first when we hit our stride we were incredibly successful.  The teams that i worked with required close collaboration and we were winning and growing the business by building relationships.
good,"mass layoffs in IT. Outsourcing most of IT to India. All decisions made in San Diego. Dayton, OH HQ is a skeleton crew with no management. "
good,"It was one of those rare people that just didn't manage well. It made it really difficult to work there. It happens every once in a while, and this was my once in a while I guess."
good,"good management a lot of experience, I do QC, S5, typical day at work to do outside of warehouse, my enjoyable is I do my job that done all day shipping and receiving."
good,"Good Place to work, salary structure is also as per industry standard."
good,Sustained Engineering team on project RTIM (Real-Time Interaction Manager) which is self-learning decision server to select the best messages to be presented to the customer while the customer is interacting with a channel (call center or web site) where the customer initiated the interaction.
good,"Regarding software applications, Teradata has not yet figured out what it wants to be when it grows up.  There have been many divergent paths taken; none of which have led to a successful applications software business."
good,"projects are pretty simple. work life balance is great. working environment  is pretty relaxed . work from options are provided."
good,"I am new to this company for 1 week, too early to judge this company.  Will let you know few months later."
good,"the incumbent of this position is a technical specialist who contributes to the conception, development and implementation and support of several management tools in the delivery of Bell’s Managed Services (MS) for environments such"
good,Very fast pace company. generous with vacation days. Learned how to managed stress and to prioritize workload.  Good opportunities for advancement within the company.  Some departments need to some management to take management class to learn how to manage people.
good,"The company is great but going through changes, not all changes are good though. The management is a bit older and can find it hard to relate to the younger workers."
good,Review to be provided in person. Overall positive place to work.
good,"Good Company with top rated analytic products.   Teradata is the world’s largest company focused on analytic data solutions through integrated data warehousing, big data analytics, and business applications."
good,The work is challenging and rewarding. The product is winning in the market place.
good,"While I have enjoyed my time at Teradata, and fill the people I have met there have enriched my life, I fear that I have not learnt any new skills."
good,"Great exposure to R&D management, collaborative environment."
good,"Nice campus, large breakrooms and great cafeteria. Plenty of space to work inside and outside on the campus. "
good,"Teradata is a spin off of NCR and operates along the same lines, to this day, as NCR once did.  They are about their bottom line and will take steps to cut costs in every way possible.  This includes outsourcing jobs to other countries and eliminating one job role to consolidate it with another, giving their existing employees two or three times the amount of work.  They will then call that employee that remains, the 'elite' associate because they survived the layoff/consolidation.  In addition, they didn't pay overtime for years, but required it regardless of that fact.  Associates signed legal documentation stating they accepted that fact and would not sue them for time and a half.  Ohio law has changed to protect against this now.  I do not recommend this company."
good,"Good people, good focus on customer but going through a transition which has led to multiple layoffs. This has created a great deal of uncertainty for the employee base."
good,"Company offers flexible working hours, excellent people to work with worldwide in Teradata and good customer base. Great product based company with good long term vision"
good,"There were many opportunities with Teradata to learn and contribute to different teams. I enjoyed my job since I was focused on developing software tests for the new complex Teradata's features. "
good,Working at Teradata introduced me to working in a fast pace office setting by teaching me how to handle stress and meeting deadlines and special projects without impacting my work quality or professional demeanor.
good,"Good thing about Teradata is its work life balance. "
good,Fun place to work. The company is going places. Good coworkers. Good place to learn new technology.
good,"The people that I worked with were awesome and really embraced me as an individual.  However for the two years I was there every month there were layoffs and I was laid off twice.  Also they hire you as a contractor so they can skip out on having to pay for benefits.  The people I worked with were great, but the company as a whole not so much."
good,"Good for people looking to get into IT and Sales roles. Have had good mid-level management, in my experience.  Large company that has been around for many years.  US and Intl opportunities are available."
good,"Working in the CTO organization on the recently divested software division was an experience of working with truly dedicated and highly intelligent & skilled individuals.  Seem Teradata part just couldn't find a means to execute in the initial vision for the software (marketing) division, even with global acquisitions."
good,Flexible work timings. I could work from home on Fridays if needed. Also my manager was good to allow me to carry forward my vacations to the next year if I needed a long vacation.
good,Teradata is one of the best companies which is working on big data domain. The learning capacity is very huge and Teradata provides a very well established environment to learn new things.
good,"Teradata Corporation is a proven leader in its field of data warehousing, with very effective personnel staffed throughout from entry level up through the executive suite. In my part of the organization (sales and marketing), there is a heavy reliance on a national / international network of far-flung resources, many who work remotely from their homes."
good,"Great technology environment, I enjoyed the challenges of working in several different client environments.  Architecting and providing client solutions was very rewarding.  Spent way too much time away from home."
good,"Plenty of opportunities to do different tasks"
good,"work remotely"
good,"I like the product and people, but management is driven by SFDC and is too micro managed. "
good,I've joined Teradata after Big Data Partnership was acquired by Teradata and became Think Big. My involvement was integrating BDP into Teradata's processes and systems and preparation of the final statuary accounts.
good,"Teradata has been a good company for employment. Average benefits.  Many opportunities to learn technology and database features."
good,"Our work environment is fast-paced, flexible and fun and our commitment to excellence extends far beyond the boundaries of our jobs."
good,"An interesting, innovative company to work for with a highly collaborative culture."
good,Working at teradata was enjoyable because of the people I was able to work with. The management team has not be very good or well received. Advancement is also very difficult.
good,"There is a collaborative culture at Teradata - to a point.  Certain areas of the company are better to work in than others.  Try to be in California, or you may struggle."
good,"Its a nice company to work. Work is challenging. People here are always committed to work. Though initial payment is good, increment is very low. Overall its a good place to learn."
good,"My day consists of updating our current ERP system by fixing code, writing new code, testing, and creating Oracle forms. On top of upgrading the ERP system, I support the current system by helping the business users solve errors or problems they come across. My manager is great. He's very laid back as long as our work is completed in the time it's allocated to. Upper management could be better but still good people. The hardest part of my job is juggling all the work that's given to me in a given day. We are a $5 Billion company and our ERP team only consists of 14 people. Between supporting the current system and upgrading to Oracle E-business suite R12, time has to be managed well. The most enjoyable part of the job is staying busy."
good,"Great work location flexibility but poor work life balance due to 24/7 On call support ."
good,"Staff was friendly and the company seemed to really care about making working there a positive experience. Wonderful health benefits and there's a great cafeteria, too!"
good,Teradata is an overall good company which gives good benefits to the employees. The management is supportive and the work culture is very nice. Vacations and salary is also competitive.
good,"persone disponibili e ambiente confortevole, multinazionale con management tedesco."
good,"Started as a graduate, got selected to be a part of the Data Science team. Worked on various Data Science, Web Analytics projects for multinational corporations. Was an eventful experience!"
good,I enjoy working for Teradata as it has provided many opportunities to grow and advance in my career.  I also have met many wonderful and caring co-workers and friends.
good,"Teradata has the most ethical, intelligent individuals working toward generating answers for businesses.  Teradata offers full lifecycle solutions from planning to implementation to support."
good,"There are two/three major campuses in California, San Diego, Los Angles, Northern California. Great people to work with. Inherited culture from NCR...."
good,"I really enjoyed my work at Teradata. Teradata gives you a lot of freedom.  It is a great place if you want to get a lot of new experiences because they will throw you right in.  You have to be able to be scrappy and learn things quickly.  You have an opportunity to work with a lot of different clients and there is a lot of autonomy as far as how you manage your relationship and work with the client.  "
good,The work culture is friendly.  A good place to learn new things through online/Web seminar.  Each work issue could link to other co-workers then most of the needed information can be obtained by email or phone call away to solve the problem which depending on the issue priority.
good,"Learned Teradata, friendly environment, good technical courses available on learning  website, good people, timings are 9:30 to 6, transport available"
good,"- enjoyable place to work"
good,"You can see yourself growing upon multiple technologies."
good,Enjoyed the people I worked for and with.  Typical business with good and not so good situations you deal with over 25 years.
good,"Voted one of the best 25 companies to work for."
good,"Work is never the same on an given day.  Closely work with Sales and Accounts Receivable to ensure all customer files are accurate and in order.  "
good,"Has different activities that employees can leverage during their free time to enjoy a Work-Life Balance. Being in the company for almost 4 years, is what I can consider as one of the most fruitful times in my career. The company has always been people-oriented and always makes it employees their priority."
good,I would handle all warehouse tasks.  I learned how to deal with all different types of people because Teradata is a very large and people that work there come from all over the world.  My manager is a cool guy but could handle is emotions a lot better.  There was no hard part of my job.  I have a lot of warehouse experience and this job is like a walk in the park.  Best part of my day is going to our coffee shop any playing pool with great co-workers and having great conversation.
good,"Teradata is not a bad place to work if you want to move to Atlanta or San Diego.  In my 9 years there, I have learned a lot but the work culture has shifted some in the last couple of years."
good,Changes come with changes in technology and Mgmt may or may not respond timely. Sometime they may and sometimes they may not.  Never assume they will and always be on top of your own career management.
good,Pretty fast paced environment with no shortage of issues to resolve. Generally pretty good management leadership. Not much help from other analysts who don't know much about the product which can increase workload for others
good,"Causa crisi, licenziamenti dopo avermi detto che avrei iniziato a tempo indeterminato."
good,"As a GSS Pre Sales Consultant,  I worked with Teradata solution architects and service sales teams to create custom advocated solutions, including hardware and software configurations in addition to service for installation.   A major responsibility is to advocate and educate customers and Teradata Sales teams on the value proposition of BAR in relationship to the data warehouse.  Customer WebEx, conference calls, and e-mails are used daily for consulting with the field.  I am very comfortable with customer facing activity and I have constructed and presented many Power Point Presentations for my customers."
good,"Nice place to work ,Management need to work a lot. Lot of learning "
good,"I enjoy working here at Teradata.  However, I feel that I have reached my full potential and fell there is no longer any advancement for me here."
good,"I enjoy working for Teradata as Sr. Constultant, unfortunately working from home or travel full time is not for everyone."
good,"Es una buena empresa para trabajar, con proyectos grandes, lo que hace que se trabaje en muy buenos ambientes laborales"
good,Great people  great technology  great product         Good benefits and compensation  continued training and skill enhancement  impressive customer list and satisfaction
good,"- Consultants actually work at client locations."
good,"I had two stints with Teradata. My first started in 2010. At that time, the Teradata database and hardware were the gold standard for data warehouses at large corporations. Optimism was high within the company and I felt passionate about the company's solutions. As new technologies arose over the next 4-5 years, Teradata was slow to change and eventually got left behind in several areas they once dominated. When I left in 2015, a total company reorganization had begun and the pain was being felt throughout the company. "
good,"- Good work/life balance"
good,Great company but has limitations with management changes and lack of corporate direction. Company is re-inventing itself and has experienced several layoffs and other restructuring.
good,"Very professional and Multicultural place to work. As per market, the salaries in general are similar or under industry/market, but for the jobs responsibilities the pay is good.."
good,"Productive and fun workplace"
good,I have been at Teradata for almost 12 years. They have been fair and supportive. The difficult issue with the job is being dependent on sales people for livelihood when the emphasis of sales is not consulting.
good,"Great place to learn most updated features of Teradata. "
good,"Une superbe entreprise innovante et visionnaire, au sein de laquelle la prise d'initiative et les défis étaient quotidiens."
good,"Ultimately it's the team or the people you have to interact with."
good,it's cool over here.full of learning environment is here.management is also good.here you can manage job work/life balance.
good,"Good Compensation structure with great work/life balance."
good,"Working diligently with account managers to provide a sufficient service to clients – helped me to inherit grander communication amongst colleagues and heightened my confidence levels when working in a team."
good,"Can learn new products. Management was very week.Co-workers are good and friendly in nature."
good,I was past of customer service division and working on an internal project. It was easy sailing in my project. Teradata do lots of consulting work as well.
good,"Great company to work for!! The trainer is just AMAZING, very knowledgeable, collected and selfless. Positive work environment where people feel valued and appreciated."
good,"Good work culture and highly motivating company to work. Is is a purely technical company for many. Good scope to learn technical skills (especially Teradata as technology)."
good,"Good workplace culture. Great place to learn and apply your knowledge. "
good,"I really enjoyed working for Teradata and moving up the career ladder. However, this was all dependent on me networking and making connections within the company. Only twice was I approached and offered a move to a new job role / promotion, by a former manager. It was because of my strong work ethic and relationship I built with them, not because of company policy. Things have changed recently with all the management changes, so I am not sure how it all works now."
good,"Dia tipico en el trabajo - Lleno de trabajo "
good,"I have been at Teradata for 4.5 years now and have had 5 titles and 6 supervisors with at least 8 different sales strategies. The technology is fantastic! The customers are amazing. My work teams have been awesome. Executive leadership is lost. I hate that I'm even writing this and putting my resume out, but I truly love our company. However, I am faced with the 4th reorg since I joined in 2013 and worry that this might be the time that out of touch leadership cuts too deep."
good,AWS and Azure are changing the way in which companies procure and using compute resources.  AWS has the ability to scale tremendously and offers customers the flexibility they are looking for in order to only spend money on usage.  Customers no longer need to invest capital into hardware sitting in a datacenter they can simply pay as they go and get technical upgrades on the fly
good,"I have been in several projects and I can say that I did enjoy my work in all of my previous projects.  A typical day at work would be working on the assigned tasks for the day and making sure that work is done on time and with quality.  I was the team engagement lead in our team and I make sure that there would be times of play, it may be a simple lunch with your co-workers, or a summer outing for the whole team."
good,Uluslararası bir firma olması nedeni ile kendinizi sürekli geliştirerek hergün yeni bilgiler alıyorsunuz. Farklı ülkeleri ziyaret ederek farklı çalışma ortamlarında kendisiniz sürekli geliştiriyorsunuz
good,"> Every working day in a calendar year is a normal working day - we have to work on your assigned tasks."
good,"The work was not that much of fun, days were the same nothing new to motivate the workers. I learned a lot about self-learning as I had to work hard to get any information of how to get my job done as my manager was quite busy all the time. Moreover, I have learned how to manage my time to deliver the tasks on time. However, on the technical side, I have learned about hadoop, database analysis and how to deal with big data. Also have learned about Facebook and twitter API's so I could fetch the data. What I found most difficult is that as an intern I had to work through all the tasks by myself with no help most of the times. What I liked the most about this job is that I have learned how things inside companies go."
good,I was lucky.  At the right place at the right time.  My experience at Teradata was nothing shot of a great American story.  My experience demonstrates what can happen when a company looks at an individuals skills from a personal prespective and evaluates what that person could accomplish when given the proper opportunites.
good,"The company is very focused on success with good strategy for the future.  The people are great to work with and are very talented and  dedicated .                                                                                                                                                                                                                 "
good,"nice workplace and good working environment but only hectic and lazy freshers sometimes "
good,Best place to grow and learn. humble people with vision and full of talent.
good,We can learn lot about datawarehouse and parallel processing.
good,This company is the best company I've work for as of now. You will find the best data warehouse and crm consultant in this company.
good,We have flexible timings and friendly colleagues who are approachible any time. There not much scope in terms of learning in the company and your career growth as well. Management decisions also not that extent.
good,This is a very nice place to work and you can have the opportunity to explore more on products on which you have the interest to work and show your knowledge on multiple technologies
good,"Work at home"
good,"A good company, have good life jobs balance, but with old technology, old style management, slow to change and full of political things, have to try something to survive."
good,"A positive work experience, however layoff/ separation wasn’t favorable "
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Teradata for the most part, have had some issues with former Managers that were let go for confidential reasons. I enjoy the Teradata Cares options to help people in our area who are less fortunate. My work is good, helping associates with their credit card issues. Teradata is an ok place to work."
good,Working for a product company is always a good option compared to service IT companies. Teradata provides good work life balance and medical benefits.
