bad,This place is terrible. The hours sucks most of the managers suck. A few decent people that's about it. Steer clear of this dump. Someone just died from working there. Not worth it
bad,"This place runs on ""ism's"" favoritism, cronyism, classism and elitism. Your job title is your class and they are sure to let you know you are beneath them.  If you know how to play the game go ahead and try, but don't mess up. If you do they will go out of there way to get rid of you and/or damage your reputation. Human Resources is a joke, they let this place and themselves commit criminal acts every minute, look it up it is in the news."
bad,When they used to be solar city back in days. Man I would say I learned everything from here. Since they got to tesla this place sucks good luck with the bad pay rate and slavery
bad,This is an amazing spot to watch shooting stars. shoot for another sun is well worth the burn. over sees the good deeds and proves fake hope it still alive and was marked a bad personfor good things held guilt when I am still inocentit till this very day other co-worker can get you black list for there pride was never even given a chance to speak no time for me paperwork is king there
bad,The company is very unorganized the management sucks everyone tries to snitch on each other so the management can like them. There’s no parking and u have to work 12 hours with 1 lunch and 3 10 minute breaks overall everything sucks about this company
bad,"Tesla is a company full of color preferences individuals who don’t care about your well-being and make inappropriate slurs towards colored people. They just want to work you until you leave earth. The colored folks get the worst treatment unless your part of a mahfeeyuh (they get intimidated). And the Non consented touchy touchy feely incidents is up at an ultimate high. And most of all, they under pay you!"
bad,"Just because it’s “Tesla” doesn’t mean it a great company to work for. Managers are terrible, pay is trash. You’ll do way more work than you get paid. And no job security. They can literally fire you for ANYTHING WHENEVER THEY FEEL LIKE IT. Employee benefits are great but that’s about it. I’m not a bitter worker but it just makes sense to be completely honest before somebody applies and waste their time trying to work for  Tesla"
bad,"Very strict about attendance, no sick-Call. They expect you to be a robot. The traffic to and from work is terrible. They only allow one way in and out through security It’s always a hassle. They are super secretive so you can be fired for using your phone camera while at work."
bad,"Not a place a family man should work. Disrespectful team leaders. Discrimination at it's best. Not enough money paid to live in Reno  or anywhere nearby. If you want to live in your car or tent and save your money great. Pray you don't get hurt or sick. But hey believe the hype and see it for yourself first hand. More like a labor slave camp. If your military stay far far away. Unless you like to be treated lower then low. Hundreds were let go who had a 2 year contract given 8 k in stocks to be let go in 11 months 3 weeks right before the stocks matured and left stranded in NV. After Tesla brought them there put them up for two weeks. Ask where you will find an over priced house "
bad,"They need to be union! From day 1 I experienced verbal abuse, was told by my manager and HR that I migjt be to Old for the job! I was only 43! After 2 years of hard work they fired me on my day off after developing advanced carpal tunnel and tendonitis"
bad,Terrible company to work for. Terrible compensation & screw their sales team out of hard earned money. No support from upper management. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone.
bad,No support they work you to death! Managers change every 3 months not a fair review. They are not flexible with your schedule and no support to advance.
bad,"They want warm bodies to fill vacant seats, they care not to give your proper instructions. They overwork you and Cafe next to nothing you are human and have a life and obligations outside of work, or during your shift for that matter."
bad,"The Tesla Gigafactory outside of Reno NV is disregarding Nevada law regarding overtime and employee termination. "
bad,"HR was the worst.  Allowed harassment, discrimination, punished workers for reporting it, restrained promotions, learning/training opportunities.  Bonuses based on bias, then not paid.  Really bad management."
bad,they don't care for their employees. worked injured for months. no medical assistance. treated like animals.  They don't care about you as a person.  They only care about making money.
bad,Management is not fair . The up managers does not care about you. They just care about their bonus. When they dont even know who you are and what you have been done for the company.
bad,"Tesla will use their employees until they are physically, mentally, and socially worthless."
bad,Tesla sucks poor leadership that only cares about ping pong games amd has no clue about how to run a warehouse management lies about opportunities for advancement no raises even after being there for a year constant revolving door of people management does nothing but stand at their computers all day then tell you your not moving fast enough total waste of time DON'T WORK FOR THIS COMPANY THERE ARE BETTER COMPANIES TO WORK FOR!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,Very little structure from management multi tasking a must mass layoffs if company doesnt make money always chaotic working condition not your normal automotive company
bad,"They work you to death and there is no excuses to be late or absent even if your on your death bed. Elon does not care about his employees. He lays them off any chance he gets and the company is breaking major labor laws. The management is micro, very unprofessional, and poor. The company newme that was there before tesla paid employees $35/HR now its $20/HR. Employees are waa"
bad,They hire only to meet state requirements then cut you loose like you are garbage. Lies from the get go and leadership is missing direction and purposes
bad,"I regret taking the job with Tesla. If I had researched the company more prior to agreeing to the offer, I would have known that this company was not for me. I have worked in the automotive industry for 25 years. By far Tesla is the worst company I have ever worked for. I do not recommend working for Tesla. Management is far to confident in the decisions they make. And when a plan fails in the service department, Its never a management issue. Its yours and you will take the fall. "
bad,"Tesla does not believe in the customer or follow its own mission. It seeks people who are tech and environment driven and managed by people that come from the auto industry and their values are the complete opposite. My advice is to walk into a location and ask employees if they are happy, you will be surprised to hear honest feedback."
bad,"From the time you apply they start lying to you, this company promises the world to their employees but you find out fast that is not the case. Injuries are high because of poor work conditions, you are nothing but an expendable body to them they want you at Tesla on the line no matter what. They expect you to put everything  health , family, and even safety second to the company and their production"
bad,Incompetent Management and only want yes people even if it is the worst possible way to do the job- they are the most crooked HR and Illegal work strategies to run in crisis mode everyday it really takes a tole on your body and mind. Everything about this place and the car being made is unsafe!
bad,"Tesla was a horrible place to work."
bad,Worked on an offsite parking lot they provided hot water and we had to pay out of my pocket for ice. got blamed for cars being stolen and management did not appreciate when you give your honest truthful input.
bad,Poor management. Never available when needed.  poor compensation. The culture is not that of team building or working together it is every man for himself.
bad,Sexist/racist company - management are full of yes men . You won’t advance or get a raise unless you are favorited. The stock options are terrible because Tesla Stock is constantly falling. They say you have 15 days of vacations a year but that’s at 8 hours. You work 12 hour shifts so it technically doesn’t add up to 15 days. You get zero sick time. Management picks and chooses who they want discipline for certain things. There is no structure what so ever. It’s extremely unsafe. Management has recently told perm employees that if a temp makes a mistake to let them know because they will just get a new one. The company illegally fired a bunch of employees because they were pro-union. Human Resources is a total nightmare. The director is lacking any sort of skill. She doesn’t return emails or phone calls and is extremely rude. They’re payroll department forgets to submit time cards all of the time and then you are made to wait until next pay period to see your money
bad,"To much to honestly type out but one of the most prominent problems is the people in charge know nothing about the people they over see or the jobs they perform, tend to only be where they are out of brown nosing and walking over people or just coming from completely different companies. If you suggest anything or try to talk to them about the tasks at hand, the jobs you've performed longer than they've been part of Tesla itself, they tend to take offense or use they're power to shut you up, even going as far to reprimand you. I worked in the seats factory down the street from the main factory, and I cant exactly speak for that factory itself, I've heard its 2× as bad. And on top of that I watched as they illegally wrote down names of union supporters and ended up firing all of them, which is now part ofmany lawsuits against them.."
bad,"Good company to work but racism is here, discrimination is here and very stressful and hopeless environment. To be successful here, you must have to be a game player and smart diplomat. If you are hard worker, they will throw on you more and more and more hard things-they never appreciate. They never care their employees, they say something during hire but they will throw you on different role- Big Lier! Only good thing , my previous 2 supervisors were very nice but third and last one was getto and racist. I can’t believe this is 21st century’s United States of America and racism  is still in exist, even in visionary  company like Tesla. Sorry"
bad,Favoritism is rampant. Advancement is only for the favored few. You need to get close to the higher ups in order to move up. No value for hardwork and long time senior workers.
bad,"Place is toxic gossip like high school  from the bottom to the top if you ever watched the show ""Survivor"" its just like that people form circles drama and lies drug use is heavily present alchohol use is common i wouldt invest stocks into tesla after been working thier supervisors get paid 80k-95k usually cant find them @ bar"
bad,"Tesla is just a status.I gained lots of experience during work at the Tesla, but job environment was awful. Nobody was happy working at Tesla, and I expected more from it,but unfortunately it was not professional workplace."
bad,"Zero job security, terrible pay, long hours, and absolutely no work-life balance. You always have to work weekends, and the shifts are typically longer than 8 hours. Upper management is non-responsive, and they do not enable you to succeed in your position. I spent everyday worrying whether or not I would get laid off, despite high performance in sales."
bad,You will not make it in this company if you are not good at brown nosing. Hard work only gets you more work and you are never compensated to what you're worth. You will never get reviews done as they should be done on the time they say it should be done. There are people who have less time working there than I and they are making better wages and bonuses. The company is full of empty promises unless you are a brown noser
bad,"They screw you out of reviews and bonuses they constantly rid of supervisors leaving teams with out proper leadership over work and under pay 90% of tooling and machinery is broken and you have to figure it out because their maintenance team is a joke, management is a joke."
bad,"If management doesn't like you they bully you and push you out any way they can, they don't help you or have any positive things to say or do for anyone unless you are kissing a@# the whole time.  I will never go back and work for Tesla as long as the same managers are there.  Lets keep in mind this is the solar part of the Tesla company and not the car or battery section."
bad,Tesla isn't a good place to work at all. Management is poor they hire people in management based on friends rather than if someone would be good for the job.
bad,If you are offered a job here run!  They pride themselves on teamwork and then lay off an entire office overnight.  There was no job security and the pay was not near enough for the work that was done.  Management was not there for the people at all.
bad,"The company has great vision, but poor execution. Days drag on, and management focus on unimportant tasks. You learn a lot, only to be passed up for a promotion to a managers/interviewers friend. Not much is done about associates who perform poorly or complain about other associates, as if the high school mentality is allowed."
bad,"This company is falling apart. The morale for this company is going down and the workers drive and spirit died long ago. Tesla truly doesnt care about its employees, we are just numbers to them. Very disappointing"
bad,"Avoid this place all all costs! After being with the company for 3+ years I had to argue for a raise and if you don’t they will walk all over you without a single care, management is colluding against everyone! If you have a problem with someone in management they will single you out and make sure to fire you. Even HR doesn’t care if you reach out to complain about unfair work practices. HR personally told me not to contact them if I have a problem with my supervisor. This place is a joke and I literally feel like I wasted 3 years of my life at this place."
bad,"If you’re an employee with Tesla, consider yourself nothing. They will do away with you like you didn’t ever matter, after selling you the world, lies"
bad,"Tesla does not care about people at all - not their customers and definitely not their employees.  The Mt. Kisco store, particularly the delivery team, is extremely understaffed, and as a result spread way too thin and can barely manage daily deliveries, let alone all the other duties that come along with the delivery role.  The staff is constantly drowning in work with absolutely no light at the end of the tunnel. The delivery experience from the customer perspective is terrible - at no fault of the staff in Mt. Kisco - we are all doing the best we can given the situation. I would not recommend working here to anyone. This is the absolute worst employer I have ever had."
bad,"Heavy hours with high cost of living . Was not a career to persue if you want to maintain a balance way of life. working from 6pm to 6 am with mandatory overtime was extremely hard to maintain and when needed to do overtime due to high cost of living , the overtime was canceled . The company ask for to much and just doesnt seem to help when you needed."
bad,Very racist company to work for and favors whites over minorities. Soon will be sued. The whites get the easier jobs and fake laidoff to get rid of the people they did not like.
bad,not a good company its ok and the pay is good but poor managment crazy hours change days all the time and switch up hours constantly and all ways working until the next shift to start for yourself
bad,"They treat their customers unfairly and treat their employees even more so. It doesn’t matter that you are early every single day and do your best, you mean nothing to Tesla."
bad,"Micro-managing, under compensated, insane workload with unreal expectations. There are some great leaders but most of upper management has changed to frequent for any consistency."
bad,Work u like a slave until u quit. Can’t use your PTO without being ridiculed.. management is terrible and unfair don’t risk it they layed off 2000 ppl in a week. Job is insecure.
bad,"The money is good but the people are not worth working there. Bad environment, smoke everywhere from the robots wielding the metal. Bad for your lungs, if someone work there for a long time, god help them. Miserable place to work."
bad,"Working for Tesla has been a rollercoaster since the day I started. First off, in my interview they promised advancement, and even went so far as to offer me a promotion about a month into working there and then took it away for no reason and just told me to keep working and it would come. We did this back and forth dance for about 6 months, and come to find out they had been doing this to every person on staff. Promising a promotion and then taking it back. Not only this but as a CES there's no opportunity to make commission. Any vehicle or energy system that you help sell, all you get is a pat on the back. There's no incentive to work hard and do well. They hourly pay isn't terrible but for a place like Hawaii where cost of living is so high, the hourly pay at Tesla just doesn't cut it. I had to start looking for a part time job in order to make ends meet, and when I found one the managers made my schedule so that it would be impossible for me to work another job even though they had my exact schedule for the other job. The management doesn't like to be given constructive criticism, and expects you to go along with everything they say, no questions asked. Not to mention they treat you as though you're a teenager and this is your first job. No trust. I would not recommend working in this environment. I do believe in the company, I just don't think they have the correct way of doing business. Oh and by the way, employees do not get any discounts on vehicles, nor are there many opportunities to even get behind the wheel to get comfortable with what you're trying to sell. All"
bad,"This job takes 10-20 years off your life, no wonder everyone is young there. It takes advantage of the fact that we don't have families and works us until we are burnt out. The managers are demanding and try to be your friend, but then they just throw things on you for no reason. It's overwhelming, and you're always yelled at by rich and snobby customers. It is not worth your time."
bad,This company is so wrong the barely pay you anything for Slavs work. They make you sign this bogus contract that waived ur over time pay for 12 hours daily until you hit 40 hours weekly. You can’t start with out signing paper. So unprofessional
bad,Every day is pretty much the same. you come in clock in and and you have the position that you are assigned to on line line. You have a partner that helps
bad,"If you like long or short days depending on the weather, never a stable schedule, co workers that are not willing to help you learn how to assemble proper equipment, and then turn around and try to rush you, then this is the place for you, everyday i went to work i felt like i wanted to throw someone off the roof, and i did not enjoy the fact that most were spanish speakers, so no bond was built."
bad,Corporate capital. That’s what I remember getting referred as when I worked there.  I was working six days a week at 16 hours a night. Graveyard shift from Monday night through Saturday night. I didn’t leave me any time for my family. So I had to make the right decision for them.
bad,"Been here 6 years. No one takes it seriously because:"
bad,"If you like being treated like a robot ,late reviews late on raises ,lazy management who promote brown nosing  instead of competence and hard work ,if you enjoy being lied to and manipulated then it will be the place for you"
bad,"Bad company. I am 28 years old and was only getting paid 15 while I see an 18 girl I started with getting paid 16 just because she has ""booty"". Nope n"
bad,"They will lie about job security and trick and con you.  Did not like the managers there, very conceited and unapproachable, they never tried to help very much and seemed to have some chip on their shoulder.  I hate that ""corporate attitude"" they have, actually glad that it's over with them, dull and uninspiring.  Got a bad feeling from a lot of the management there, very creepy and soulless people."
bad,"etiquette and no professional experience whatsoever. zero integrity as I said, no resource allocation experience in one specific department. The rest of the company is awesome!"
bad,If you are prior law enforcement mikitary and take a job here you will soon realize you heeded my advice. This security and investigators (males) are a bunch of gossiping back stabbers. Enjoy inhaling all the carcinogens and never being offered a protective mask.
bad,tesla is a cut throat place to work if you have a set schedual for school i do not recommend work here they do not care for employees life outside of work place
bad,Great company until a car company bought our solar company. Massive layoffs! Tesla doesn't care about solar and is putting little money back in to the business while it tries to mass produce it's behind schedule cars. The management tells you they want to know how to make processes better but when you give the feedback you're labeled a complainer and troublemaker. You need to participate in dress up days like princess and cheerleader day or you're labeled not a team player. Extremely unprofessional company!
bad,Was a former employee in el paso tx 1st of all never got a raise of pay or any promotion for 6yrs this wasnt only me it was 25 of us alot off travelin
bad,very racist place to be employed. the employees there at predominantly white males. they are all guilty of sexually harassing the female workers and nothing is ever done about it.
bad,"Managers have no experience in the automotive field, also managers only looking for people with no experience in the automotive field. Anyone with automotive experience stay away not worth the stress."
bad,No wonder we haven’t made a profit and have a high turnover of staff. Looking elsewhere as my face doesnt seem to ‘fit’ anymore and you have to be part of  club and sacrifice your life..
bad,"Its hard to to stay the face of Tesla on a daily basis when parts aren't available, cars are breaking down regularly, and you have to try and convince people that their brand new car is somehow reliable than a gas vehicle. No support,  no culture.  Our service center wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years, either giving things away to essentially buy good surveys.  It's sad when the company needs to save money, but then inexperienced managers come in and make decisions that cost lots of money. And honestly, Tesla does not care.  They say they do, but over 7 years I can prove otherwise.  As long as people are happy and we keep giving away things, it's ok to not be profitable.  So sad.  Then since we have no parts, we buy them from 3rd parties and try to pass them off as Tesla genuine parts.  Ebay, RadioShack, anywhere they can get parts to look good and not fail surveys in shortages.  It's called consumer protection act, and it will bite them."
bad,"Although to outsiders Tesla appears to be a cool place to work, the sad reality is that management is completely unorganized and the culture is toxic."
bad,This company is poorly managed. They will lie to you and waste your time about any hope of advancement. They will try to under pay and over work you as much as they can. Working here was the biggest wast of time.
bad,"Employees were expected to work 12+ hr days for more than 7 days in a row. "
bad,"broken promises, commitments, lack of integrity, zero knowledge of how to manage in the startup environment, innappropriate and illegal hiring practices, preferencial distribution of labor/resources, 100% unwarranted disciplinary behaviors, contradictory to individuals statements, zero review after 2 1/2 years, did not honor hired position title and salary committment when hiring manager was no longer employed (who if wasn't there initially the entire company as a whole would not have succeeded if it weren't for him, tried to backfill his position with 5 zero knowledge/zero start up experience, zero volatile and high paced work environment, extremely knee jerk and zero professional etiquette and proper business behaviors/accumen, zero effectiveness, very poor management/supervisory skills, had no knowledge whatsover of how to prioritize business needs in the environment. Love the company and the people but had to share this given my committment to being genuine, honest, of high integrity, passionate about Tesla Motors and it's direction, huge respect for the man at the top and his incredible gift to hire driven, intrinsically motivated individuals who have a thirst for knowledge, passion to succeed and do the right thing. it's an incredible gift he has. So, that's my first hand opinion from individual who began in spring of 2011 and was one of the first hires at factory. Saw everything first hand during infancy stage, during the mass exodus employee departure in 2015, release of all regions, true success and teamwork but also the incompetencies and unfortunate manager level"
bad,"Lower pay than competing jobs."
bad,Tesla is a great company for helping the environment. However they do not have much pay raises or room for advancement. We had to work long hours and was told it is mandatory.
bad,"Very long hours"
bad,Horrible treatment of employees by managers and human resources.  They color code you and depending on your color that equals your success.  There is a lot of lies and deception. You never get paid for your hard work.  If you calculate your hourly wage by hours worked you realize working at a fast food place and working overtime pays more.  The worst behavior comes from the corrupt mentality of the managers who want you to sign up everyone even if it hurts their finances and budget.  Its not for people really trying to help humanity and the planet. You see the ugly greed that exist when a good company allows corruption.
bad,"No training program in place,they expect you to learn so many things all at once within a few days.But in reality it would take you a few weeks to get comfortable with everything.Very poor management,management plays favoritism to certain employees while others bust their butt .You work very long hours 12+ hrs a day 5 days a week and then weekends too.Make sure you have a back up plan because ,you think your doing well  and the next thing you know.Your let go for no reason.Very judgemental,nothing is good enough no matter what you do.The only daylight you might see is morning.Other then that,you will be going home at night sometimes past 8pm.Be prepared to never see your family."
bad,"Innovative products very motivated people, but unrealistic targets. Long and stressful workhours, no open communication."
bad,"Morale is low, weak management support, lack of communication across the company.  Elon has great ideas and due to constant changes the company is unable to implement which grew frustration with both internal and external customers."
bad,"Horrible company and site to work for. Management is non-existent and not very helpful. Training is next to none.  Should this be your first job, then youll be okay as its a good starter job."
bad,"I have nothing i can say to this company."
bad,Work Several days per week with more than 12 hrs per day. There is no life other than Tesla. It is an expectation to work that many hours and days per week.
bad,management was terrible I didn't like how I was treated the culture was terrible I feel I was treated different cause of my age. I could train people but i couldn't become a lead or mgr.
bad,"The Company is a lot smoke and mirrors.  13 years and they have not posted one dollar in profit.  How do do it,  Government subsidies and selling carbon credits to fuel manufacturing car companies. "
bad,"Management have no respect what so ever with your life outside work and will change your schedule without asking for your opinion. Also advancement is more about who you know and not what you do, in any area supervisors have zero idea on what you do. Leads have zero idea about the process they suppose to learn and only got the job because they suck up to blind supervisors who doesn't know anything about the job process you do. If you are a highly skilled worker this place is not for you."
bad,"Pros"
bad,Working at the factory itself is great but if you are off site at the PDC which is Parts Distribution Center for the world management is horrible and they do not care for their employees they treat you really bad different than the factory workers.
bad,It was a great place to work. Nice people. We all worked well together. Would have liked to have stayed longer but had gotten laid off. would be willing to go back to work there.
bad,extended hour no advancement or pay raise. neven know when the shift will end or if there weekend shift. supervisor don't solve worker problem. unfair advancement
bad,they work you like a slave . I had 6-6 times and would hardly see my girl anymore. I went to work and slept. on my days off I would sleep all day too.
bad,this company doesn't give you proper breaks. they don't pay you well at all always makes a excuse to not give you a raise. managers treat the workers bad. all they care about are their numbers and a lot of people get hurt and they don't care.
bad,a day at tesla is never the same i learned alot at tesla motors the mangement is never satisfied they pump you up then run you into the ground there are to many odds for one the system needs to be refreshed at all times and your expected to make miracles happen within a certain time frame good luck with that the only good part of the job is it's day shift but if your lucky you see daylight good luck to all that apply.
bad,"6-7 day work weeks, don't plan on having family time because you will be looked at as if you don't give Tesla enough. Upper management could care less about the thoughts of those working below as they have all the answers and you're always wrong."
bad,Long hours and the company doesn't care about their employees. They mostly hire from temp agencies and they don't give you flexible hours. Only 12 hour shifts
bad,"No management"
bad,This is a very fast pace company with a lot of growth and opportunity to transfer to other areas of the company to improve your skills.
bad,"The funny thing about this place is everything from the CEO to his management because they are all a joke!! They sell you this dream about being part of something great but in reality it's the most horrible place that I've ever worked. I have never worked at a sweatshop until I worked here so I will more then appreciate my next employer because I doubt it will be a fraction of how bad this place is to work. It's not safe   for employees at all there osha reportables are through the roof and there is people that been there for two plus years without a raise and the famous line they must teach the management to say is JUST HANG IN THERE THINGS WILL GET BETTER. So, if this is a place you would like to work best advice I can give you is apply at your own risk!"
bad,"As no processes are in place, QA struggles a lot fixing minute development issues. Developers have better job opportunities"
bad,"Need a lot of work to improve work culture, salary package is very small."
bad,expect to work 70-75 hours every week. no support from upper management. quite chaotic
bad,"Smoke & mirrors. Each day fear for your job & cover your tail. Tin-horn mgmt is automotive clueless, arrogant, condescending, biased, disrespectful & power hungry. Motivation by intimidation. Looking for that 1 chokeable neck. Mega hours and guilt with no reward. Most employees fear for their jobs daily. Many terminations and quits since well before deferred launch. Eventually, will be entity needed to represent the peasant workforce. All about stock value. Witnessed many employees from around the world come into the company only to be jacked around, chewed up and spit out. Horrible place. Don't settle for these clowns as you will ultimately be sorry. Eventually all of this and more will come out. The vehicle beauty is just skin deep."
bad,"I worked for tesla motors for almost 2yrs. Never missing work. I missed one day of overtime due to miss communication by myself and supervisor. I was let go. "
bad,"Some days can be stupid slow from 3-4 hours straight doing nothing or “5s-ing” (cleaning around your area), and with the thoughts of having 8-9 more hours to go in the back of your mind will drive you crazy. Sometimes the pace is picked up, but the majority of the time is mindless, and without your phone or without your music you will suffer."
bad,"Managers are incompetent, petty, and backstabbing.  ""Stand and Suffer"" is the name of the game at Tesla. "
bad,"Held in an associates position (Walmart Wages)   for 15 months even though I applied internally to 226 open positions.  Only one interview for a mechanic tech in fifteen months and I was told ""not qualified"" even though I have 25 years of maintenance experience.  I also hold a Lean /Six Sigma black belt - Change management certified and Airframe/ powerplant mechanics certification with 25 years in the aerospace industry.  The arrogant recruiting/talent team uses the ""friends and family"" plan.  Everyone else is relegated to manual labor, and menial tasks.  BTW - I also have two masters degrees and a Ph.D. in org development.   A dismal place to work, avoid at all cost - Tesla Gigafactory - Sparks NV."
bad,busy no life stressful and management has there favorites they are to concerned with production then our heath or wellbeing I wouldn't  recommend this company
bad,"Worse place to work for, worked for GA3 there’s drama everywhere and management it’s terrible Supervisors and Managers only help their favorites other than that good luck. even if you work hard they’ll fire you whenever they want after your review u can get bonus so HR is firing people before you get them and there’s no future in that company it’s honestly the worse place you can work for ."
bad,"Culture-less, cut throat environment, completely unstable. The company is unable to attract and US residents to work there so they are supplying workforce with visa foreigners. Not recommended for anyone, as this company is on a brink of complete collapse."
bad,The manufacturing facility in which I worked was extremely unorganized. There was no office and had to take my laptop computer throughout the plant to get anything done. My initial job offer stated I would work 4 12-hour days one week and 5 12-hour days the next week (6am to 6 pm). In reality it was a 5am to 7pm position 5 days each week. No consistent communication with my direct supervisor or upper management at the Gigafactory 1 facility.
bad,"The car and technology is amazing!   Co-workers are the best of the best.  Management is extremely poor.  Tesla hired  “luxury handbag” managers  to run its  company. It drove the company into the ground and several locations closed.  extremely poor quality management . If a manager does stand up for what is right they are terminated very quickly. And above all of this, if you are a female, you will be paid considerably less than what the mill workers do"
bad,"The idea is a great one but they are doing their best to screw it up. People in charge have no auto manufacturing experience. Its like high school in there, the dumber you are the better you do!"
bad,"I was hired and told that if I was performing well that I would be taken on to a full time position.. my numbers were great and attendance as well. I would see everyone in my training group drop out of no where.. & then out of no where, I was dropped too. Sneaky company."
bad,Tesla is an awesome company with no regards for its employees safety or well-being. Tesla treats its employees like trash no raises and multiple jobs done by one person. Tesla offers no job security unless your a butt kisser. Being a hard worker doesn't grant you job security and when the chopping block comes around no one is safe.
bad,You have no life management have no clue what manufacturing companies is run like but it won’t be around for long they run it like a tech start up company not a automotive company
bad,"If you aren’t eating, breathing, and thinking about Tesla 24/7 365 then you won’t last long here. Don’t call off because you may not have a job the next day. Don’t make plans on your day off because you may have to work and if you can’t make it in you may not have a job the next day. And if you don’t take the job seriously (plan on making it a career) then be prepared to get cursed out over it in the morning meetings. You will literally work sun up to sun down. Monday-Friday and most likely Saturday’s because it is a revolving door. You have to give them 2 weeks notice for a day off. So doctors appointments,  DMV, and anything else you may have to do is going to be hard to do. If the weather is bad, even if all the warehouses around Tesla are closed and your kids school is closed you are expected to be at work. For $16/hr you can go to another warehouse. Don’t be fooled by the description, you will either be picking or packing, same thing you can do at another warehouse that pays the same or more."
bad,"From the start of your work day, you feel the stress level is starting to rise up. There is no recognition to their employees. Day to day, your are guessing if you are working 8 hours or 12 hours. No one will communicate to their employees. Pretty much, it's a guessing game most of the time. Job work life balance is not recognized. Management are mostly lacking on experience and no knowledge of how manufacturing works."
bad,"Where to even begin!? In my 2 years i have had 6 supervisors. These supervisors are in charge of who gets a promotion, probably see where i'm going with this. We don't have the proper tools to do the proper maintenance. I have equipment that has no Preventative maintenance or parts list and it has been in use for over a year! we dont have the correct hazmat half of the time and if OSHA seen what our ""hazmat lockers"" looked like, we would probably be shut down on the spot. Its only a matter of time before someone gets hurt!"
bad,"No job security, shady business practices, and poor management sum up the environment in the business. There is little to no communication to employees and often are left to find out new policies or internal changes on the news."
bad,"its hot working there, somtimes heat gets up to 120 degrees. i was scheduled for 12 hours a day i worked far away from this job. i had no life working there and neither did anyone else, they dont give you the choice to change your hours or get less. i wasnt getting the amount of sleep i needed i worked extremely hard to keep up but i just couldnt at tesla."
bad,"This is one of the most unprofessional bizarre places I have worked in a while. First they are letting people go left and right, the next day you come in and you don't have a manager, still no word. Another couple days of layoffs then the scum finance manager lets you know what went on. Work balance is terrible, first week I was working over 50 hours. Don't work here, its not enjoyable."
bad,"Worked here for 2 year and they fired me cuse of favoritism "
bad,"I was previously a part of SolarCity before it was bought out by Tesla. While there wasn't a lot of room for advancement or salary increase the culture was something that I could appreciate."
bad,"Management is unprofessional and treats people unfairly"
bad,"I could go on and on about all of the reasons why I wouldn't suggest working for this company, but all you have to do is read the headlines and it's clearly evident. "
bad,"Like working for the army,: hecktic, disorganized, poorly managed, high turnover in management, predominently young, inexpereinced  working culture unable to admit mistakes."
bad,"Overworked and underpaid. Very rude and unprofessional coworkers, managers and staff. This place takes no consideration for ergonomics and will work very hard."
bad,"Company made me resign as I was out for 4 days due to illness (under doctors orders and I had a medical note). What type of company treats employees with suck disregard? I worked there for 2 months and was promoted 2 twice, until my illness, then your gone. Worked 6 days a week, with 1 day off."
bad,"but.... all management are in cahoots making a problem you have very hard to seek help i speak  for a lot of people, they emphasize on safety each and everyday and that whole place is a hazard with construction going on and having gate put up while production is still flowing which the aisle are crazy small and blind spots Galore! forklift equipment my lord osha needs a closer look asap !"
bad,"New start up company ....old bad employment environment. I worked in the corporate division of Tesla. Compensation ...for full-time employee's is not great. Seems like blue-collard workers and ""corporate"" are 2 separate cultures and most don't want to have anything to do with each others ... almost segregated. Don't get me wrong ...there a few that are friends."
bad,Very little opportunity to move up In the company. Leads are good but supervisors are often not available if you have a problem and are not flexible when a personal issue arises.
bad,"Terrible management. Lack of care or consideration for employees and their lives, they expect you to be married to them. Apathetic to employee concerns and even worse for customers, absolutely a foul experience. I would not recommend this company."
bad,"They can careless about if you get hurt on the job, training is a joke and so are the supervisors. Every job have its cons and pros there’s nothing to good I can say about this place. It’s one big high school for adults basically."
bad,"This company is a dead end. Or they will be force to do things that you don't want to do, or get threatened that you will lose your job. They are always look to hire from the mainland not from hawaii."
bad,"This company is unprofessional and disorganized. Hiring managers with no automotive experience. No one's knows anything, mangers couldn't be more hands off. Constantly unavailable and never have any answers when asked questions. Basically slave labor here. No one cares about their jobs."
bad,No matter how hard you work it will not help you! No room for advancement. Managers never help or know what is going on from day to day. All they care about is producing material. No on site H.R. everything is done over computers.
bad,Ghetto unprofessional racism men wanting to fight women’s. No women rights at Tesla. Arguing and fighting. No air flow. Always overly hot. People always getting hurt at Tesla. They do not care about there employees health they just want the job done. Worst company I’ve ever work for in my life
bad,Tesla management is terrible and run very corruptly. They do not care about you whatsoever and u are just a number in their system. Work hours are brutal and people abuse their power.
bad,"Worked here briefly. The hours are long and it's boring and repetitive work. The warehouse is small and the system is ridiculously slow. There are a lot of safety concerns, but they are brushed off. Inventory is a joke. There are employees that have been there for 2 years and have yet to see a raise or promotion. There is definite favoritism. There are leads that will follow you around to make sure you are working. God forbid you take a bathroom break! Management is not sympathetic or understanding of employees with families and especially single mothers. They do not care about you, it's all about numbers."
bad,i learned everything there was to know in seats. how to build all of them model s model x front and back seats and model 3 front and back seats. even learned how to install them in the cars. i was a master at my department. but when you tech someone new and your boss promotes them to a area they never even touch thats a real slap in the face i thought him model 3 seats the guy goes to front row model x and s seats. how and why? in 6 months to a lead when. this company promotes on favorites not on hard work or on people who know the job being the hardest worker and fastest i seen it and i told others who came who have same drive like me they did not belive me till they seen it themselfs. seems like tesla keeps the hard workers in same spot so they can push the lie and promotes the lazy people who sneeks off the line to talk with the boss all day. lots of safty regulations thrown out the door. you get hurt they send you to there dr. who gives you a fake answer and trys to make it look like you did it to your self and the safty team also do the same. talking to you like you fake a back injory. and still expects you to lift the 80 lb chairs alone when clearly its a team lift and they will deny it is a team lift and say oh i can do it so can you but they dont do it. making people do that all day yeah it will mess up your back. they con my department to go to the AWS. so the first vote we had we rejected it cuse you get less hours then they changed our shcedual to something that just didnt make sense they then hired a bunch of new people and made us revote so they then influnced the
bad,"Only thing going for Tesla is the benefits.  Other than that dont expect to make plans to have a life outside work.  No paid sick time, 1 minute your said to work a certain amount of hours and then changed last minute, no parking and management is a joke."
bad,The best thing that ever happened to me was being terminated from that joke of a company that can't manage to be profitable. And it's incredibly wasteful. Electric cars are NOT environmentally friendly.
bad,The product itself is great but very insecure when it comes to job stability. You are always nervous about if you will have your job the next month if  they decide to make changes. poor management and training.
bad,Definitely a waste of time. Promises they cant keep. No room to grow. Constant favoritism. Supervisors and managers dont care about production associates. Quantity over quality. Every shift for themselves zero teamwork. All about which shift can make more.
bad,"They will just use you every chance they get. You definitely feel taken advantage of. You often will not get paid commission due to unrealistic goals. In fact they did not pay commission for an entire quarter because no sales person could hit the goal. Also they decided to let go almost the entire sales staff with no warning. Many found out on twitter they were no longer employed. Those that they didn't let go they pushed into jobs they know would force them to quit and we did so, having to leave with no severance. It was with out a doubt the worst first company I could have worked for, not upset I did though, I learned what I'd like to avoid in companies moving forward."
bad,"Constantly changing, constant lay offs. Closing stores. Never any security in your job. Over working, unrealistic goals. I have had 6 managers in 2 months. 7 in 9 months."
bad,"Mit dem Spirit der Tesla Inc. aus den USA hat die Germany GmbH nichts zu tun. Das Management ist einfach nur grottig und Mitarbeiter werden wie Streichhölzer benutzt. Bezahlung ist unteriridisch für den Stundenaufwand und die Provision mit ca. 0,1 vom Bruttoverkaufspreis für ein 120.000 € Auto ist nur noch zum Kopfschütteln. "
bad,I didn’t really like the job it’s was minimum amid 12 hour a day so I didn’t really have time and I’m still in school so it wast a good job for someone in school
bad,Nightmare to work at.  Zero stability within the workplace.  No advancement.  Over-staffed with extremely low production.  Would be surprised if this company lasted another year.
bad,"I found the management lost in understanding leadership and bring out the best in people. As a career automotive professional, I never felt I worked for an automotive company."
bad,"Tesla? More like Stressla. Unnecessary stress, bad leadership, low pay, long hours, will get fired for no reason.  Stay away. They expect you to sacrifice your entire life just to get one more car fixed. Personal time isn't a thing, and if you dare to leave after your scheduled hours are over, you aren't ""committed to the mission of Tesla"" actual quote from my boss. There is nothing outside of Tesla.  Not worth it for $21/hr"
bad,"Es wird hier viel verlangt aber selber sind keine Profis und erwarten von einem bestimmte Sachen, welche sie selber nicht schaffen."
bad,"I joined Tesla 2 years ago. Its very cool being apart of the electric car movement! To start off with the management at Tesla across the board is terrible. They are not from the automotive industry and they do not know how the industry operate. "
bad,Tesla is nothing but high school drama if you kiss enough butt you will get promoted. If you don't you get nothing if you challenge authority you get punished. Very high school and to much drama
bad,I worked here for 3.5 years. I was walked all over by the carpet jockeys in the office as in you aren't rewarded for working hard and submitting to their standards. Work here if you like a cut throat management and no job security.  They promote people that kiss a55 before hard workers. I had a horrible experience working here.
bad,How long are we at the gigafactory expected to work these long hours with no proper supervision? This is ridiculous. All the extra security was let go and we are working so much overtime that it doesn’t make sense. Bring the old management back. Nobody is happy.
bad,"Tesla is one of the worst places by far I have ever worked.  The management doesn't know what they are doing half the time because of the CONSTANT change, and no one is approachable because of the ""clicks"" and constant gossip.  For it being a ""fortune 500 company"" they don't match a 401K at all, and instead of giving raises, they give you some matching number in a stock form.  Now for me not having a clue on how stocks work, its absolutely pointless.  You will feel singled out and worthless unless you reach 100% productivity for the day, per my managers words, ""These are MY expectations"".."
bad,Management is not on top of leveling up production associates. There is not room for growth and cannot switch departments until a year later. Would not recommend working here .
bad,"Many quit or were let go due to terrible management. If you stayed quiet and listened strictly to management rules then you were safe from repercussions. The workplace culture was not very good (i.e., certain types of harassment). Many of the customers were wonderful to interact with, though."
bad,"Touts “Radical Entrepreneurship” as justification for a lot of poorly thought out strategies and very bad decisions.   These bad decisions impact your life as an employee and also result in a very poor quality of the product.   I lost several good teammates last week to a mass layoff disguised as performance reviews.  I have a year until my shares are vested, assuming I survive the next performance review.  Take the job only if you are willing to drink the Kool Aid."
bad,Stressful long hours . Management only car about numbers not about workers . Be careful joining Tesla you will slowly lose your outside life due to all the hours and days you work
bad,Production is the over riding priority. Everything else takes a back seat. No union representation so the company is free to do as it will until it gets caught. Safety and employee rights are an afterthought. They must be prodded to do the right thing.
bad,If your face does not fit you wont be there long. No development structure. No chance of promotion if you are not in the club. Be ready for long boring days talking about future products that do not exist.
bad,"Mismanaged from the top down. No real people with automotive backgrounds to guide things in the right direction. Most management is ego driven. They refuse to listen to employees that could actually help management shine."
bad,"Very disappointing. Management has 0 leadership skills. Culture based on ""I will look good by making others look bad"" is promoted. Colleagues doing extra hours pure on fear of being fired if not. Sad place to work."
bad,"The work environment is horrible. No work life balance. No quality coding. Not suitable for developers. All they do is support."
bad,"Worked at this place for about one year. Great Coworkers,  management sucks! Place needs a union to be a voice for the people,  because they force you to work long hours and really never reward you.  Pay raises are stock options.  If you like working for nothing this is definitely the right place to be.  Forget about spending time with your family. This place will be your new family. Even on your off days you'll find yourself trying to catch up on rest. The cars are beautiful, but that's about it!  I would only recommend kids fresh out of high school to work here.  Established individuals can only make ends meet by putting in a lot of OT."
bad,"Was constantly harassed by coworkers with HR literally laughing in my face. A typical day included verbal attacks, physical pranks so far as to pour a toxic chemical in my respirator. Overall a terrible place to work on to of being terminated"
bad,Working there is okay at first you learn new things but management is horrible there are lots of favoritism in the workplace. Had a family emergency and the supervisor did not let me go. No way I recommend this company. Also the workplace can be hazardous with all the chemicals and etc. !!! They don’t respect the employees!!!!!
bad,"After leaving a steady job, I joined Tesla thinking I'd be treated fairly and be respected for taking initiatives. But the management I was working under had too much politics and favouritism. The service manager hated customers and always used to make people follow his orders even though it wasn't a good decision for the company. I complained to HR but nobody took an action. Ended up resigning."
bad,"Management is a total joke ."
bad,Company over worked and never held up to the promise of moving around. Always understaffed and the turn around of employees is crazy. Got hurt and the job made me feel like I wasn’t a priority even after the ceo said he would sit with people and figure out what was wrong but he didn’t it was just to show face for the public but they don’t care about the employees at all. They do what they have to do at bare minimum because it’s law
bad,"Lack of motivation, constantly hearing what a bad job you as a group are doing rather than speaking to the offending individuals. If the line breaks it is operator error, rather than poor engineering.  Management doesn't follow the company policy, they make up their own policies, if you question their policies you will be wrote up or pushed out of the door."
bad,"A typical day: Hella buisy, under pressure"
bad,"no work life balance, schedule is 7:50am to 6:45pm Monday to Friday and sometimes mandatory Saturday. If you call off they take it out of your pto hours no questions asked even on a mandatory saturday. They been talking about schedule change since January 2019 and still haven't changed the schedule cuz they cant keep people. The supervisor that hired me was fired cuz he sold personal information about the company to competitors."
bad,"loved the overall idea of the company, but at times seemed as if the management lacked the ideas or even vision to get there. very unhappy workplace. quota came first over customer and employee experience every time.."
bad,Tesla is a terrible employer. They do not care about workers they make u rush to put out cars. They use tape and other corner cutting methods to build cars faster. Unsafe working conditions
bad,Job will burn your body out management treats you like children big time favoritisms supervisors having relations with workers they don’t care about your health constantly worried if your going to get fired or written up for the dumbest thing 10 minute breaks well technically 5 mins because walking back to your station is 4-5 minute walk one 30 minute lunch for a 12 hour shift horrible
bad,I felt there was not much to learn and it was very simple and repetitive work. It is very demoralizing when the culture is so discriminatory and not what it was promised to be to employees in orientation
bad,"Tesla is a product that I believe in 100%. Going green/electric is the future and Tesla does it the best."
bad,"Good place to work on paper, but Tesla has a micromanage culture that will not allow room for new ideas or provide opportunities to excel. Upper management does not care for its employees."
bad,I worked at Tesla for a year and out of the blue my permanent postion (as I was a full-time employee) was terminated. The reasoning was not sufficient at all and quite unprofessional as myself and my team bust our humps daily to exceed goals for Tesla to only be told the our positions have been terminated without any sufficient reasoning.
bad,"worked there for a year, broken promises, no personal time, no advancement, no raises, no vacation time, bad hours or lack of care for personal preference of hours"
bad,Every day employees stressed about the next round of layoffs and those of us who did not get laid off would have to absorb their jobs with no additional compensation.
bad,"We worked our butts off for this organization and were tossed to the wayside as if our hard work and dedication was nothing.  They also promised to bring us back after the lay off and now have been told the funding is gone.  Stay away from Tesla, Elon Musk does not care about his employees."
bad,"Depending on where you are in your career this may be a perfect fit for you.  If you are willing to work unlimited hours and sacrifice all non-work relationship, you have found the perfect match!"
bad,"Right so, I've been working here just over a year. I started as a normal production associate and moved on up from there (by way of sheer luck). "
bad,The culture of working with this company is that of the addition of a narcissistic and codependent romantic relationship. It was the greatest lesson yet one of the most traumatic experiences of my life.
bad,Worked here for about six months it was the worst experience of my life. Modern day institutionalization. If you want to have a balanced work and home life I would not suggest this job. Especially if you plan on commuting. It’s not worth it.
bad,Same as every other tech company now. They will only pay the top people what they want then the rest are left to pick up the pieces. Tesla name carries weight and they know it.
bad,"I was very excited about working here. As a production worker I can tell you working at Tesla is no joke, you’ll have coworkers yelling at you to hurry up and shaming you when do wrong. I complained several times to my supervisor about my horrible lead who was nothing but a bully. Nothing was done till I couldn’t take it no more and was left in tears. By that point no one wants to work at your company. There’s people who work their that are not doing their jobs right  and are preventing others from advancing.  I was the best in my station and learned everything in the first week. I left because I felt like I was in high school and I just left high school."
bad,There is no support from the manager even if he knows about the capability of a employee. On the other hand the work hours are too long and there is no work life balance.
bad,"Run away from Tesla! Don’t fall for the big lie they picture in the interview, management cares more about attitude and personality instead of the actual abilities of the employees, if you fake smile and kiss butt you’ll be loved, coworkers are very nice and helpful, they have meetings twice or three times a day and nothing really get resolved, warehouse is very small and a big mess, the program they use to process the picking and shipping is old and slow leading to a constantly errors which you will blamed on, 10-12 hours at day including Saturdays and it doesn’t matter if you work through a agency or direct hire they still would get rid of you if they don’t like you enough."
bad,Musk is driving this place into the ground. Management is really poor. Most of the employees seem to be temps from California that have a  ghetto attitude.
bad,"Rampant favoritism, rampant drug use inside plant and in the parking lot.  A lot of production waste, and employees on headphones while building vehicles, which causes many defects to go down the line and have to be reworked offline.  Management is ineffective in dealing with employee issues.  Bullying and cutthroat environment, and many employees concerned with only themselves and their next quarterly review."
bad,"The typical workday starts with the target items need to be completed for the shift. The workflow is incumbent on the smooth functioning of the robots as the job was synchronized. So, not much to say."
bad,"Management didn't have you back and they weren't concerned you had the proper tools to do your job. I wasn't given adequate time to train my material handlers to ensure they knew how to do their job properly."
bad,"Everyone from SolarCity is super bummed at how awful Tesla's culture is. Lots of weird micromanagement from higher ups. Lack of transparency. Seems like we will not do solar anymore. Stripping away titles, PTO and bonuses. Not worth it. Avoid working here if you can."
bad,"Management is horrible.  Everything comes through last minute.  There is no prior planning.  Politics is what drives everything, to the detriment of being able to get work completed.  Some people are very nice but others are absolutely horrible.  There is no work life balance and no one cares."
bad,"Tesla is probably the worst company I have worked for I left mercedes Benz, trying them because I believed in this company and how they would be the future of this industry, but I was wrong. This company has to have the worst management and HR department EVER. The pay and benefits are good but that's it. The balance of work and your life is bad too. You spend 11 to 12 hours a day there."
bad,"Insane workload and company culture based on fear. Never sure about ones position and if you still have your job the next day. Company is build on people who just follow orders, without any leadership"
bad,"If you care more about money than time, this is the job for you. I found it hard due to the fact that there is no job/life balance. Coworkers were great, and the hardest part of the job was not knowing when you were getting off each day."
bad,"Scan/Receive material"
bad,"If you like to share your personal information with strange companies every 3 months to get rehired 4 times a year, then tesla is for you."
bad,depends on which department you are working. in my department is so hard so get promoted. too much politics. ethnics groups always making a hostile environment. worst work environment ever. company don't care about their employees.
bad,Terrible management and no work/personal life balance at all. Dreaded going to work each morning. Favoritism and inconsistencies in procedures. Job culture was extremely negative and employees under valued and disrespected frequently. Direct manager  would consistently speak down to direct reports in front of employees. Management was not being held accountable for mistreating employees or for their inconsistencies in disciplinary action (favoritism). Management would constantly go back and forth on procedures and was not consistent in processes.
bad,i don't recomment making this job a career life job . theres a lot of favoritetism in this company and they run this place very very poor . a lot of employee gets away with lot of stuff and the good working employee gets treated poorly. while the other slack of work
bad,They work you 60+ hours yet never any raises or never moving up. And they under pay like no tomorrow. They move any one up that they feel like is a friend or a teacher's pet.
bad,I worked at tesla for a little bit Over a year. There are strict deadlines for production and long work days. Depending on where you work at the time there may be times where they make you do mandatory overtime and have to work 6-7 days a week 12-16 hour days. My supervisors would tell us we were working on Sunday 5 mins before leaving on Saturday night. They push out bad products because they need to make numbers as well.  My boss also told me he didn’t believe me that I was sick when I was s called in one day and was still visibly and audibly sick from the week before. I don’t recommend working here unless you like to be treated like a number and like feeling easily replaceable.
bad,The work atmosphere is very competitive.. they have no communication between management to production associates every thing is very secretive an it's extremely hard to keep employment...
bad,"If you are an ex military officer,ex-con, don't want anything in life but to be used this is perfect. Super high turnover, greedy immature situations with a lot of terrible management. Heartless and cruel."
bad,Left due to new manager coming in and trying to muscle around he was given that position due to the fact the old one leaving and we had no one else I rather let them hire from outside instead of this guy .spent almost 8 years there and left because of a person that can't understand nothing coming into work with a bad aura and attitude 2 other people left because of him that had spent years there Tesla did a wonderful job on giving the wrong person the job
bad,They will use your PTO for anything. Even if they send you home early for their own faults or lack of production. Everything was fine until the criminals were hired as management
bad,"This place has more problems than they can fix. The lack of job opportunity advancement, no raises for the most dangerous work in the company, every week someone is trying to figure out how to get cheaper and cheaper, employees from different departments are fired seems every quarter to cut back to adjust finances, never has the correct material to perform jobs, people showing up to work drunk driving you, people not showing up to work, people stealing time since day one it’s the culture, no bonuses or raises nothing to look forward to, everybody hates their job, if you want to become an electrician and not learn a thing here’s an easy way to do it causes there’s literally no training hands on"
bad,"Unless you really need the money (which is the only thing tesla has) dodge this company like the plague! its a sinking ship looking for anyone to blame for its failures. ""pass the buck"" rings true here."
bad,Very unorganized from day 1. 3 months and never got to do what I was hired to do. Set up to fail by requiring me to work in field (HVAC sheet metal) I had no experience in! I am a Plumbing and Piping designer/detailer.
bad,"Tesla is a company that offers more money then a lot of places near where i work. But they mess your schedule around so much that you can't do this job & still have a life with your family. Hectic, UNSAFE, fast paced, & overworked in an environment that is truly miserable. I have worked 12 hour shifts before & can do that without a problem. This place makes it nearly unbearable... Been here over a year & only stilldo it because I have to take care of my family."
bad,"This by far was the worst experience of my life!  I was hired as a temp employee, and was thrown on the phone in about 4 days!  How would they expect anybody to learn anything like that?!! The assignment was supposed to be from 12/10/18 to 03/10/19,but they let me and some other people go on 01/03/19!  Right after the new year??? Are you serious??!!! Who does that???!! I’d never work at this place again!"
bad,"By far het slechtste bedrijf waar ik ooit voor heb gewerkt. Met name het ""service"" gedeelte is werkelijk om te huilen. Denk aub nog een keer goed na op het moment dat je hier wilt gaat solliciteren. Werkdruk is torenhoog, mensen vallen om de haverklap uit met burn-outs of andere aandoeningen. Management is ook echt om te huilen. Structuur is niet te bekennen in dit bedrijf. (Amsterdam)"
bad,"Tesla was a dog eat dog place with very little direction but fantastic results are expected.   When I was there was no coordinated planning for the Marketing IT staff."
bad,No time for family. No compensation for immense overtime for salaried employees. Unchecked power for departmental management. Unreasonable expectations set by our CEO to the public with the production floor bearing the burden of an unqualified engineering staff.
bad,"They like to blame people for things instead of machines failing. Whenever they cant figure out an issue the scapegoat is the people. Working for this company is fun at first, and then the people here show their true colors."
bad,Money is OK by Stockton standards. It needs to go union. Make sure you pucker up and kiss butt to move up. Its a really cutthroat environment. You can go far if you work hard.
bad,"The Folks I worked with (Co-workers) day to day were amazing people. Regardless of the hardships, poor management, folks stayed positive/hopeful of changes to come. I stayed hopeful, and tried to maintain a positive outlook."
bad,Good job to have if you need one but probably not a great career. There’s a lot of people ho hate their job. Very hard to keep a positive attitude due to the fact that everyone feels mistreated. ( not my personal experience)
bad,"not bad, but not good... really if you can, go somewhere else, but if you live to work and nothing else it's the perfect place for you. other than that decent pay and good benefits."
bad,"Tesla hired too many people all at once. At a previous company, I would receive 1-3 opportunities per day. With Tesla, I received 3 inn 6 months. The appointments that were set were very unqualified and didn't even know I was coming for a meeting."
bad,"Grown to be a terrible company to work for.  Especially Service.  Regional Service Manager continue to be the downfall of the company, but hold others accountable.  It's a sad culture they have going on."
bad,Base is 30k commission is another 30k. Poor benefits. Chaotic management. Lack of structure and real cheap compensation. They are cust based but not employee focused.
bad,Not all its sold as... How they promote makes for poor working environments. More often than not you will know more about your job than your supervisor or lead. Snakes throughout the company!
bad,crazy work hours need more employees to maintain work load need more training and better work instructions
bad,"Auto detailing for tesla was Difficult. Hard paint and cars not Covered with plastic When Delivered  ..had Thousands of bugs and scratch marks on new cars. With very Limited time to detail cars. Staff and Area manager Very argumentative ,HR Department offers no support. Long hours with almost no time to take a Break..   daily changes make things extra confusing for employees"
bad,"They took an exciting car company and ruined it with retail mall culture. Routinely lay off masses of employee's, and if you're not solving problems in Fremont then you're an expendable asset with no name."
bad,"Managers are egotistical and difficult to deal with, any resources for accessing HR are incredibly difficult to acquire, and usually leads to some sort of reprimanding. You are treated like a slave and there is absolutely no standing up for yourself or others unless you wanna disappear and never move up. Very similar to Amazon"
bad,"After working with Tesla for almost 4 years, I was laid off. I was the highest paid in my department, and the top performer of the department as well. I was given the excuse that I cost too much, however they could have laid off several of the lower performers."
bad,"Great place to work for three months. If the management doesn’t fire you without reason before then, the monotony and lack of movement will drive you to leave."
bad,"Forecast Abfrage 10 mal am Tag, ständiges Nachfragen wie es ausschaut ob eine Bestellung reinkommt, wöchentlicher Startegiewechsel, keinerlei Entlastung bei totaler Erschöpfung, private Termine dürfen kaum wahrgenommen werden während der Arbeitszeit, kein Work-life Balance."
bad,"Layoffs one month, the next month closing down multiple locations, including mine. its not signs of a thriving company but a crippled one. every time a new vehicle or version is released jobs are cut. if you only need a job for a few months then Tesla is the right place to work for you."
bad,"They fired the entire delivery team. Then, to us in the sales team, they raised our goals to where nobody in the team had ever reached, consistently. There were probably a handful that did, but for the most part, 90% didn’t. They did this to fire us and get away from playing unemployment benefits. This place is cut throat. They should have just let us go as opposed to putting on this facad that they did. I would never recommend anyone work here. Stay away. "
bad,"Tesla is a very fast paced job were what you do one day can be vastly different than another, you are given limited training and are expected to be able to function at beyond 100% at all times. It will take months to any feedback on performance since they have a hard time retaining managment."
bad,Working 6 days a week 12 hours a day everyday takes an extreme negative toll on your body and health and with minimal help of easing jobs for workers by minimizing the work it is added to your task with less time to accomplish the job.
bad,"Company could be much better if they had better management. There is favoritism when it comes to occurrences and absenences. Employees are allowed to hang up on customers and are not punished for rude or inappropriate behavior so they do not practice the customer service policy they preach. They are always bragging about change so nothing is ever consistent. Also, shifts are always changing unless you have seniority and there is a lot of work required for such low pay. If you have children or you are pregnant I would not recommend this job since they still threaten to fire you even if you have a family emergency. Overall the benefits are good but maybe with new management and trainers the company can have the potential to do better"
bad,"Training is just two weeks of promotional videos, when you get to your desk, you will not understand what you are doing whatsoever. "
bad,"The compensation wasn't worth the work load. I found Tesla to be a stressful sales position. I have worked in sales for a long time, but this is the worse. Their sales tactics, that are mandatory, are pushy, rude and quite outdated, unless you like harassing customers shopping in Home Depot."
bad,This was the worst job I have ever had. The managment expects you to break your back and work long hours and weeks. All ur co workers hate there jobs(mostly) so don't expect them to be nice to you. You are an easily replaceable slave so you never feel your job is secure. This job will make any other job feel like a walk in the park I think. Give it a shot if you think ur up to it!
bad,They dont care how hard you work or how long you’ve been there your job is never safe 8 yrs + they let go a lot of hard workers for no reason at all too bad
bad,I was hired and laid off within 7 months. I hoped them build the team and create the mission. They laid me off  as well as a lot of the other managers. Don’t work here unless you are willing to risk your job security.
bad,Dont get me started. More bad than good minus pay and benefits. Management really is poor. They prefer quantity of quality products. They dont follow their own policies. I can make a liat of negatives but i wont
bad,The supervisor in livemore was very aggressive. Acts childish. Even told me to work through my lunch off the clock and told me to take my lunch later. The supervisor only favored caucasians. Hr partner gives incorrect information when corrected he couldn’t explain what he said previously and is unable to guide you to the correct information. Misleads
bad,"This was by far the worst job I have ever had. The commute to work took an hour and a half on a regular day but, if there was an accident or fire you would undoubtedly be sitting in traffic for a few hours. The road rage is ridiculous and I would have the worst fear I was going to be involved in an accident one day. Yes, I was rear ended one day. Working 12 hours is okay but when you are not allowed to sit down for any of those hours your body begins to ache and get tired. Not only was i working 12 hour shifts but they made me sign up for mandatory OT every single week and it did not matter if i had something going on in my personal life. If i did not make it in for OT i was given an occurrence and you are only allowed 3 before termination. Their attendance policy was so strict you could not even do a punch one minute early or one minute late without getting in trouble. The management here is on a severe power trip and they treat you like you are a nobody. I truly felt like a number here. I lasted 6 months here because the money was very good and the benefits too."
bad,"No work life balance, nor do they care.  "
bad,They hire managers(service managers) with absolutely zero auto background.  He was clueless as to what was going on and only cared about himself.  The Regional Service Manager also had zero auto experience and it felt like he just blew smoke.  The benefits are good and so is the pay.   Everyone else there was awesome.  Just a total lack or true and real leadership
bad,Mediocre pay with no life balance. If your single and have nothing better to do but make money and not be able to spend it this is the job for you. you don't like weekends this is the job for you! Management its hit or miss...benefits are great but thats it.
bad,"a typical day at Tesla Motors, Lathrop. we come in and get all our PPE from our company vending machines, after we have our daily meeting where we discuss what machines are running and which ones are down. We then get told what part we will be machining. Once we know where we go we then prepare that machine and go through daily procedures as for checking all parts of the machine are fully functional. we then run production the rest of the shift."
bad,"Too many hours work and no compensation for salaried employees.  Hourly employees underpaid and have to depend on OT, and there was a lot of it. Usually announced at the last minute on a daily basis"
bad,"Honestly, I have been a fan of Tesla since the early days. I was very excited to start working at Tesla and assist customers who are as passionate about the vehicles as I was. Unfortunately, the job was not as I expected. Constantly dealt with frustrated customers call after call. The resources given were not enough to answer their simple questions such as how much it would cost for tire installation! You’d have to get in touch with the service center which (the customer had originally called) and ask. A lot of the time the service centers didn’t answer due to being so busy. If you work service support, prepare to deal with-"
bad,If you live in the Bay Area THIS PLACE WILL NOT PAY YOU ENOUGH! If Elon comes around be prepared for someone to fire you !! He fires someone when he shows up in a department!
bad,"I enjoyed working with customers education them on Telsa products and services. Tesla offers great benefits from day 1 of employment. Their training was terrible, but I came in the door with skills needed to perform my job.  They were misleading about the sales compensation payout, but I stuck with company to help my sales team become successful."
bad,"The workers on the assembly line were not allowed to sit or lean on anything. This increased the risk of blood clots forming in one's legs."
bad,"There are two ways to do things at Tesla: the way you are trained and the other way. There is corruption in management, corner-cutting, and rules that change daily. No second meal period, and if you speak up about anything that is wrong.. expect termination."
bad,"WORST MANAGEMENT EVER...lead he trys to help you out best way possible,  other than that management ESPECIALLY THE GM is GARBAGE he has no clue what he is doin wit his target goofy lookin self CLOWN no advancement no assistance in wanting to better your career everyones favorite line ""IDK"" or ""thats tesla""...company wise its ok.. but this location as a whole is TRASH..apply just dont come to this location they"
bad,"If you work here, you better cross your fingers and hope they like you, because it's like working in a prison. They are thug minded to the nth degree. While the factory is quite big, and a lot of people work there, maybe it was just the few people I was exposed to on the night shift... but there seemed to be too many of them to say it wasn't most. At first they were nice and courteous, but that all changed when a couple of them decided to start picking on me. This guy walked up to me, said he wanted to fight... Was I supposed to? So I filed a report. Holy cow did they all despise me for that. I've been threatened, constantly reminded that they know where I live, put in unsafe working situations...etc. and it wasn't just coworkers, but superiors included."
bad,"Work here if you want no life and your body literally gets torn down. No sitting allowed. Long 12 hour shifts. Only 10 minute breaks where you have to be back at your station before the 10 minutes are up. I’ve never worked a job where I got Carpel tunnel syndrome, knee issues and varicose veins. Almost non-existent rotation of job at different stations. Not worth it!"
bad,The management sucks. Your coworkers are on drugs. Some of the management comes in drunk. It is very unorganized. And if the management doesn’t like you for any reason (they may not have a reason at all) then they will sabotage your work to get you fired. They clean sewage pipes while you’re at work so you will inhale the fumes. It is a horrible work environment! This is a horrible job. Beware of the Fremont Factory!!
bad,"If you want to work for a mission that has no intentions of being profitable work for Tesla. You also need to be ok with zero job security. If you want to work for a company not a mission(companies only job is to make money) than run for the hills. My job is great but going away. If you work in the factories you are a miserable zombie that is lead by a narcissistic maniac that likes to play with rich peoples money.(Elon is a genius. With that said step aside and let your dream grow by letting the qualified people run the business and you stick to the engineer and science.)   "
bad,Very productive and engaging place to work with plenty of opportunities to learn. You need to be focused and be good at time management. Over all it’s fun
bad,I believe that Tesla has its place but do not agree on work ethics. Long hours no gratitude. Ownership does Not believe in family just business. This is a 24/7 company. Very hard to keep up
bad,Could you sell solar to the sun? Do you mind being cursed at by customers inside the Home Depot? Can you walk into a home and repeat the same sales mantra 100 times a month without boring yourself to death? Do you like driving around in a small car for 4 hours a day?
bad,I was on time for interview but not 10 minutes early.  managers have their head up their Asssss.  Waste of time and really was a disappointment. They seem to be a strong brand and have a good reputation in the market but Management in AC needs an attitude adjustment.
bad,"Long 10 to 12 hour shifts, sometimes 6 days. Fast-paced environment and if you can not keep up mentally and physically, this is not the job for you. You will eventually burn yourself out."
bad,"The pay was great, but the hours were brutal. It always seemed like I was the only one in my department taking their brakes on time and covering for everybody else. I felt unappreciated and ignored by upper management. Very immature work environment with little regard for safety."
bad,"tesla the work was fun and it kept you busy but if there wasnt anything to do, management is on you about not having anything to do and expects you to be constantly doing something."
bad,One of the things that keep happening is that you can get lay off at any time. Only the people that has been there for a while will stay in the company.
bad,Management is poor in implementing processes to improve work life and just reverts back to how things were before starting out. Training is lacking and you seem to be punished for that. Has great potential for a place of work but never gets close that.
bad,"The place is loaded with a gang mentality, hip hop and rap, foul and outright sexist and racist music fill the place. Everywhere music is blasting away from personal boom boxes. It seems that half the employees were covered with tattoos. I suppose it's today's multiculturalism that adds the additional sweetness to mundane tasks.  Toxic fumes fill the air. Just too good to be true."
bad,"Very stressful but not rewarding, working as non human and management was care as much.  Great team members however, too hectic work and everyone seems to be distant."
bad,"Management ( supervisor, leads) NOT very Truthful at all. Supervisors and leads need to work on Team Work."
bad,Fast pace and very low compensation not enough for the hard work that at the end you get hurt due to repeatative work. Free snacks and pool table
bad,Sun. to Wed.
bad,"Good company to work for. Poor company to transition, lied to a lot of employees with Solarcity to Tesla merger, “acquisition”.  Was offered a severance package that didn’t cover time lost, where I would have otherwise been looking for another job I was giving the company 110%."
bad,"Tesla is constantly attempting to reinvent the wheel. Their systems will make no sense to anyone with shop experience. Its a popularity contest that does not promote or reward those who deserve it. Interaction is based on cliques and reminds me of high school. They hire burger flippers as service technician and expect for the more experienced people to train them, with no incentive. The shop leads and managers have ZERO automotive experience outside of Tesla and wouldnt make it anywhere else.ere is no infrastructure for advancement it, except the age old ""brown nosing"". The automotive practices are suspect at best, due to lack of experience. Axle grease being ""cleaned"" from inside of wheels beacuse the customer did not complain. Life threatening comebacks every week and due to inexperience  and a svere lack long f craftsmanship"
bad,I feel they do not consider certain things when it come to placing one in the different departments. It is face pace you have to finish your job before it is someones turn to do their job and if you are new most likely you will have other employees showing you how new you are. You are constantly being watch by all other employees and if you are chosen to stay on it is because you are liked not because of your work performances. There are to many young people with no manager experience in charge.
bad,"Dont even apply good pay sure, but such a waste of time literally no chance for raises unless your supervisor is hella cool, other than thay your screwed"
bad,No structure. Never knew what I would be doing from one minute to the next. Long hours not leaving much time for my family plus the location was so remote that a 10 hour day would turn into 12 or 13 because of the commute
bad,"The company refuses to hire more staff or reward current staff. Overtime is mandatory. Usually, work  6 days a week, 60 hours a  week. No work-life balance."
bad,"Tesla has been going down hill, not very happy with the direction of leadership. Reported to multiple managers in less than a year, wild changes in strategy."
bad,Yo creo que sería mejor si en esta empresa se fijaran más en tu trabajo que en chismes
bad,"Work place culture sucks, Management very biased, typical day at work was always stressful and no breaks and/or lunch.  The hardest part of the job was watching everybody else going on the breaks or lunch.  The most enjoyable part of the job was going home."
bad,wasn't something i saw myself doing long term. there was not much of a balance working with them the hours didn't fit into my life. So i decided to do something i like to do and construction wasn't it
bad,"My time with Tesla."
bad,"Lots of drug dealing and rampant drug use going on, so be mindful who you’re next to, running that dangerous machine you’re using! Supervisors (they prefer to be called “managers” lol), are all kids, with ZERO people skills whatsoever, or the middle age lady who will talk to you with ZERO respect for you as a human - and WILL throw you under the bus in a sec! And tons of homeless employees there - very odd!"
bad,"If you have no life and enjoy people telling you that if you take a day off your assignment will be ended than I strongly suggest you work for Tesla, if you enjoy supervisors throwing you in a hole and making you figure it out work for Tesla!"
bad,Morning meetings witch was most of the time a waste of time. The Leads had bad management skills. It took an hour before you knew where they wanted you to work. A lot of Nepotism. Management wanted rotation on jobs but most of the time it wouldn't happen and  the same people that were favored got the easier jobs. Managers seem to have a blind eye to what went on the production floor. Sexist Environment.
bad,"Want to be on the A team at Tesla well you need run and work Nod your head a lot in meetings,go along to get along ,try not to be black at least while at work,And if you could learn any old spiritual songs this would help time past."
bad,"The company may have great products, but the culture, the work ethic, the environment is toxic. Management do not know how to manage. There is no job security. You may have a job one day and then be unemployed the next."
bad,This place is terrible to work at. People are rude and they constantly snitch on you for doing the most minor things. It is a very stressful environment to work in and on top of that your fellow employees make it more stressful.
bad,This place hates African Americans and will try and ruin your name or make you submit to them. No amount of money is worth my dignity or self respect.
bad,It is a great place to learn if you have problem solving characteristics. The hardest part of the job is all of the problems that you have to solve without having a concrete infrastructure in place to support you. Far from a regular car company.
bad,I quit my job to work at tesla and when attending my interview was told I was going for a certain position with a higher pay. Come to find out later after I have already accepted the position that my pay was significantly lower then told. Also was put in a completely different position then applied or interviewed for. Would not have taken the job if I knew the company would have done this to me. Know I don't even make enough money to pay my bills and support my family. As well as I was put into the same position as people who are felons and criminal background as well as people with little to no experience. I feel that my skills are not being put to use and feel very underpaid.
bad,"Poor leadership. Bad communication. Favoritism and chronyism. Not female friendly. Lots of information hoarding, fear, and back-stabbing. Team mates would beat each other with a pool cue for $3."
bad,"Interns have not treated well....my mentor is a real a*****e......not recommended....Managers are busy firing people, people are busy in damaging things instead of building things...."
bad,"Loved the people I worked with. Loved the benefits. I truely wanted to retire from the company."
bad,The benefits are good. Home and work life are not equally balanced. Work environment could improve drastically. Professional relationships and chain of command need improvement as well.
bad,"This company is FAR from honest with their customers. Rude trainers who don't believe that people should be able to make emergency phone calls, and if you don't fit their fold, they'll kick you out. If you have a strength in Data Entry, but was hired as Production, which is a weaker strength, they'll fire you instead of putting you where your strengths are. That's precisely what happened to me. "
bad,I worked there for a month.. They dont care about the
bad,"Needs an overall safety check, not safe for any employee, not employee friendly, cant advance in management easily. Management is hard to get a hold of,"
bad,"management are not encouraging . too much jealousy, hostile, double standard. dead end  job. no growth. they are all about number. supervisor set up good  employees."
bad,"Pay was good, work was easy, but management sucked if you don't kiss their butt. Your a moden day slave if your working here. There is no concern for safety, just keep production up."
bad,Tesla is a cuthroat and scrapy company that challenges you from day one and only the strong survive. You meet a lot of great clients throughout the business and you sell a product that helps the environment.
bad,I was really excited to work at this company when I was hired. After working there a few months new changes and developments happened every week. There were no raises given the entire time I worked there and there was no 401k compensation. They expected you to get all of your work done efficiently without providing all of the necessary tools to get ot done. And there was no communication.
bad,stressful work environment would not recommend people with family to work there. benefits paid for. To many layoffs work load is not that bad. great coworkers
bad,Management has a competitive against other managers. In result feuds employees end up getting terminated due to managers being over controlling in areas that don't belong to them.
bad,"Tesla would be a great place to work if management starting in Silicon Valley would act differently."
bad,Management is horribl. They are very colicky and only promote friends. No positive feedback. Never sure if you are going to have a job each day. I have worked there for a year and a half and have been thru 4 layoffs
bad,"All model 3 are built in tents with 2 portable restrooms for 180 associates and not enough water inside. Often you see associates leaving the restrooms without washing hands because of lack of water and proper sanitation. Inside the tents, there is a lot of safety hazards and no cooling or heating system at all. It gets to a freezing point in winter and burning hot in summer. Every week, an associate leaves the area in wheelchair because of safety hazards. If you are not very careful, you can get amputated easily. There is no quality control and only quantity matters. The supervisors are caring and nice but they have a lot of limitations from the management to properly address all these safety and other issues. A lot of oversight on what you say and do so be careful."
bad,"I had a very unfortunate experience at Tesla and the sacrifices I made seemed futile at the end. I was lead to believe I would have transitioned into a permanent position, was even doing onboarding training and was let go prematurely. Middle Managers and Top mamagement were not transparent in their communications, disorganized and irresponsible in some of their decision making and does not care about their staff. The hours were very long and targets were unrealistic...I still feel exploited. Staff moral is very low, job security is very low, the staff turnover is very high and the work environment is extremely volatile. Met some great team members on my level however I would NEVER recommend anyone to invest any part of their time or future with Tesla, it is not worth it at all."
bad,"I really enjoyed my job at Tesla. The most major problem in production is that they promote very young kids who have no experience or work ethic, and put them in charge. The supervisors are equally young and do not know how production really works. They say safety is their priority, and quality is too. Neither of these are true"
bad,"Predominantly operates on crisis mode of management. "
bad,"Most engineers are stretched incredible thin, no work life balance. Demands from the executive team that are not possible. Easy to lose your job for being in the wrong place at the wrong time."
bad,"Total disarray, from the ground up. The Anti-Handbook company lingo is never going to work. The people who work there are mostly from other industries. McDonalds, Post Office, and various pizza delivery businesses."
bad,"4 years with the company and all I have to show is a couple shares of stock, certifications from minimal paid training, less hair from stress and always watching my back. It is not a professional work environment. I have a lot more to say, however I will not continue to bash them. Elon can contact me at any time if he wants."
bad,Employees come and go. They couldn't work the 10 to 12 hours shifts or never get enough recognition to advance. I wouldn't recommend anybody with a family to work there.
bad,Terrible place to work they lie every time you turn a corner. And everyone tries to stab each other in the back. The management doesn't care about the employees and we are way understaffed.
bad,"I was sold a big image that turned out to be far from the truth. Tesla has a lot of work to get its retail/gallery division operating effectively."
bad,"Fast paced, long hours, exciting technologies, horrible management, Very low wages for super high skill sets. No bonuses or pay raises in the engineering group I was in."
bad,Extremely fast paced so no work life balance. Cut throat culture. Hyper rapid growing company. Provides excellent cafeteria food for lunch but not free. No matching 401K.
bad,"I was hired and worked one month as a Product Specialist.  The interview was great, job another."
bad,When I left the company there were only four employees out of 70 who were there when I started. It was an educational experience that I will never repeat.
bad,"A typical day at work starts around 7AM,  and lasts until roughly 7PM, Monday through Friday. Being at the office so much has given me the opportunity to not only form tight bonds with my coworkers, but also with the Engineering staff that I support. This much exposure to working with such brilliant Engineering teams has enabled me to ramp-up quickly and be successful well ahead of schedule. "
bad,attività con buone prospettive di crescita ma inesperienza neofita data anche la giovane età del proprietario. Nel complesso buona esperienza.
bad,"my day at work would include a safety meeting in the morning and blow on a breathalyzer. Drove a crew of 3 to 6 men to the site. Planted geo phones for 13 to 14 hours a day. Helli bags where dropped and we laid the gear out. Sometimes we did gear with quads, sleds, line trucks, or packed it in by hand in the ruff woods. We all had to get along or we got fiered."
bad,Push the world to electric power on the broken backs of the workers. Pay is good but you will burn out in less then two years. Management is pushed to do more with less and all of that stuff rolls down hill.
bad,If your okay standing In the same place for 12 hours and not worried about moving up in the company and just worried about that check then go for it.If you do want to make a career out of Tesla good luck.Job opportunities to move up are slim.Job security is a joke you can lose your job anytime remember.And expect to receive no respect no matter what title you have.
bad,"I went through 5 interviews to get this position. When I received the offer I felt like I made such a big accomplishment and I felt proud to wear the Tesla ""T"". Soon after I started I realized the only perks were the benefits and saying you worked for the company.  This job drained me physically and mentally. Stressed me out so bad that I have stress related illnesses... you add it up."
bad,Management doesn't care about the employees and what really works they attempt to maintain numbers to show things work but as the customer have said on multiple social media sites they don't. A revamp in Management is needed to bring in fresh ideas and possible a new way to look at process and training. Which would be a start to maybe getting TESLA Solar back to the Glory days of SolarCity.
bad,"Tesla's mission should be, ""To save all of humanity at the sacrifice of a few."" Initially, the lack of a work/life balance was ok because you really felt the business supported your development and career progression. As the business continued to try an appease stockholders, the culture became more toxic and people operated from fear of layoffs and lack of transparency."
bad,I have to initiate production improvement by developing eye and hand coordination to eliminate misses and increase output because the company's management has no idea on how to improve production. They only have the production manual to follow but this does not improve output.  At the start off production in Fremont they missed to hire qualified people and simply rely on the supervisor's recommendations which mostly his/her favorites.
bad,Good pay but not enough for the amount of work. Management doesn’t communicate clearly. Certain policies are in direct conflict with each other. They don’t seem concerned with the physical or mental health of their employees.
bad,I don’t trust the management to make sound people decisions.  My group is great.  Management is too overwhelmed to care about team.  Felt disregarded.
bad,"One thing I really like about Tesla is everyone is super intelligent but the management is decent  .In terms of job security , process it's just a nightmare because employees are not cared/recognised for what they do .There is lot of overlap in the work and standardization is missing ."
bad,Just too long of a work day for the pace required. Very chaotic. Dept's don't work with each other on production numbers. Mandatory OT then send you home after 3 hrs. Send you to other depts. that don't need any help. Just very poor Management of Associates and Production goals. Several associates will be moved to 3 or 4 different depts. in any given day
bad,"they do not value their employees, there is no work life balance. even when you are on vacation you have to answer phones and answer emails.  you are working 24/7."
bad,"This is a factory, just like any other. The culture that is promoted by the company is not reflective in the workplace. The management structure, while flattened to resemble an IT business platform has reformed itself into a mass production - top down management structure.  Unfortunately, the mentality of their previous employers had carried over to a ""do-as-I-say or else"" relationship with hourly employees. It is not uncommon to have your employment threatened at least once a month or more in a group setting. The ambiguity surrounding the guidelines for advancement is unmatched. All available information pertaining to it is obsolete, the rules and metrics are unstated, and keeping your pay private because it ""causes people to quit"" is openly promoted. "
bad,"I'd been at Tesla for about 7 months, almost 8, I'm considered one of the ""seniors"" or ""veterans"", which is laughable to me because at previous jobs I would still be considered new.  Most people quit after 3 months. Customers are constantly upset, often about things that someone in the company did or said to screw them over, and then you have to try and find a solution. The problem is the only way to communicate with almost anyone is through Skype or calling and they never respond, you will sometimes spend hours trying to help one customer resolve an issue that you would think should be a quick solution. "
bad,"Tesla is Elon’s money pit, therefore you have managers that will have employees work on scheduled days off even after goals have been met above and beyond. Breaks are the California minimum and just getting to the breakroom and still have time to sit is a challenge. If one shift lacks, your shift is obligated to make up for the low product numbers. And if the robot goes down or there is a system wide problem, that also falls back in the associates.  Tesla is good for people who need a quick paycheck and there is little to no career opportunity here. They hire just about anybody and work you until you get injured, fired, or quit. Tesla does give an excellent benefits package but if your looking for a retirement package look elsewhere. It is a great step for someone trying to learn production. Would I recommend Tesla? No, unless you really need a job and are willing to put your family, relationships,  and kids second."
bad,"Need to have an attention seeking personality - quick wins with making even the small, very visible. Flexible, but long hours. Many managers have no formal training or experience."
bad,"The department where I have worked has had  a totally  lack of structure and integrity. Very unprofessional leadership , and unfriendly work environment. I have worked in the entry level position like a material handler ,but still had 6 supervisors, who  gave me cross instructions and contra orders. They have no any clue or knowledge about corporate environment and constructive working methods."
bad,"Working at tesla was okay the first year or so I felt like it was a little more organized at the beginning. Once production starting ramping up it seemed to become just a job where you come in and do your job and go home. At one point we didn't even have a lead or a Supervisor so the welders would come in and run the line our self with no help from management at all. Even though I didn't like the environment I tried to make the best of my opportunity and I applied my effort into learning as much as I could . I learned how to operate various production vehicles, communication skills, power tools, and mig aluminum welding."
bad,Tesla does not appreciate it's employees. There is an ongoing joke with everyone who works there that their badge will one day not work and that is how they'll know they're no longer employed.
bad,"To move up in this company you must brown nose your way. You can be a great employee but get passed over, skipped and moved so that a brown noser can move up."
bad,"The company sounds like a dream but this place is a mess. Literally and metaphorically. Management is detached from reality and blame everything on associates when they can't get their numbers even if it is a supplier issue or waiting on an engineer to fix something who are usually impossible to get a hold of or a response from via email or text and they usually treat and talk to associates like they are beneath them because management cant afford to lose any MORE engineers. Poor communication from even low level management such as leads and supervisors. Lines go down multiples times within a month week if not day and constantly bouncing from one to the next. Knowledge and experience mean nothing to advancement and recommendations only go out to those friends with other management. If your want to go anywhere else besides a Lead position you are given no attention by your lead or supervisor."
bad,"Sadly the company really does not care about the employees, they look at them as disposable. Sad but true. Management doesn’t have automotive experience making the shop hectic to work at."
bad,"This company has great potential, but not nearly enough leadership to reach it. Basic communication and collaboration do not exist which plays a part into many other areas of working here. Development is scarce and not supported. Feedback is not followed through with. Management is not made up of leaders."
bad,"It is  a sales environment that is extremely micro managed, to the point it's makes customers uncomfortable, because of the aggressive nature of the mandated sales process."
bad,"I got hired at Telsa (temp) in March 2017 and worked everyday and only missed 1 day due to death in family.  i was only late once and tried to get certified at several different stations.  In June I kept asking about my conversion to become a permanent employee. I ask my lead, supervisor, supervisors manager, recruiting, and even my staffing agency. For 2 months i got vague, little to no answers.  To me i didnt get hired because I didn't hang out with my supervisor after or before work kind of thing.  Like you have to bribe to get a spot at Tesla.  I wouldn't recommend anyone working for them.  Plus, the pay is 1/3 less than other motor companies."
bad,"Company wants to make a positive impact on the environment. The product is beautiful. The work is fast paced and physically demanding with long hours.  The starting pay is fair but the structure of leveling up, raises and promotions needs to be better implemented. The management teams need to be more in touch with their groups/associates. The majority of the associates work well together."
bad,if you decide to work be prepared to hurt all the time. be prepared to never spend time with your family because you will be working all the time. if your not working then you will go home spend a couple of hour with family and then go to bed. you will never work a 40 hour week. you will never be able to make plans for the weekend because you will most likely be forced to work.
bad,"Very Productive workplace, at times overworking employees with 10-12 hour work days, 7 days a week."
bad,They say their there for you but their actually there for themselves. You can’t trust the word of your supervisors or your peers. The money is good don’t get  wrong but management treat employees unfairly and we don’t get paid enough to get discriminated against
bad,"I moved across the US for a job at Tesla. To be completely honest, if I had known that it was a lie about how family matters and training that they would provide, I would have never left he company I was with for over 11 years. "
bad,"Management there is not about helping a person rise through the ranks. Once you’re in a  role, that’s what you’re expected to do for the whole life at Tesla. So if you’re in support and want to branch out, you’ll have hurdles placed by your very own manager to trip you along the way. "
bad,Highly disorganized and toxic environment. Not at all recommended. Not professional nor straight forward. Under trained Management and very toxic combative style of every day work environment.
bad,"If you start in a department and dont make the cut, they bounce you around til you either quit or just settle. And it could be easy or difficult. Its your typical warehouse with automation and people. Extremely tedious and repetitive. And all in steeltoes and on foot for 12hrs. Zero chance of advancing due to favoritism and well there are thousands also trying with degrees. So your best bet is the labor part"
bad,"Management consists entirely of higher-ups favorites, with no consideration for whether the person would actually be an effective supervisor. A management structure should be based on who the most qualified candidates are, not on favoritism."
bad,"Unrealistic goals are set that constantly change, no set procedures on how day to day office functions are run.  Management wants to be able to sit back and check boxes instead of work directly with their team."
bad,"Tesla makes great cars but the people they hire for managerial roles are abysmal. You never get pay raises, and the managers are only concerned with themselves and their bonuses. Speaking of bonuses, Tesla does NOT offer bonuses to non managerial employees. Only stock options that only have value after 4yrs of vesting. "
bad,"Don't plan on having a moment to sit down if you are in a production roll. Even when machinery is not working, and there is nothing else to do, don't sit. And when/if your lead tells you to not sit, and your coworkers are sitting, they are allowed to sit apparently. Leads act like children and play favorites. The design of the place is stupid.  You would think that all parts would move on a conveyor in a 1,2,3 flow process. That isn't so, carts of parts need to be walked from one end to another."
bad,"Very bad leadership, very unorganized, job culture was not family like it was protruded, very difficult to managed life and work when working 12 hours shifts"
bad,"Overworked, good pay and benefits. Took a toll over time but was fun. Management is always too busy to help with simple issues. I learned a lot about warehouse work and safety procedures."
bad,"Tesla was not a bad employer and most people there seemed to try and keep the company culture alive until they ramped up production in 3/18 and had a mass hiring event. They hired anyone and everyone, often without making sure background checks and drug test had passed. This caused fallout in the new hire rate and they just kept hiring to have enough bodies to meet production needs. When this started, the quality of the average production associate decreased, there were more safety and quality issues due to all the new hires not being trained properly or not being a good fit for the job. Since the push for more production came all the way from the top, management stopped caring about anything other than producing and let other issues in the workplace go unchecked. It is not so bad depending on what line you are on and how much manual labor they have you do. A lot of it just depends on who you know and if you get along with management outside of work so they can recognize you and give you job advancement opportunities. If you are a good worker, show up every day, make suggestions, and don't cause trouble, but don't buddy up to management, you are just another replaceable worker. Their production scheduling is poor and you often end up working overtime if it is available just to make up the hours from your regular week because they send people home early due to production issues. Sometimes, overtime is great, other times, its mandatory. There is poor work/life balance. There used to be a lot of workplace perks to working here but that all slowly went away as it became just another"
bad,The people at Tesla is messy. The management is horrible you have no life if you have a family prepare to miss a lot with them . You get Hardly NO pto to take off or go on vacation . The pay was good but still not enough for CA living oh and they well fire you with no warning for NO REASON!!! Also there is a lot of favoritism which makes it hard for people actually doing there job and working hard to move up
bad,"When end of quarter comes the expectation is that you work 15hr shifts. Your career progression hinges on your ability to bypass lunches,breaks , or any personal commitments outside of work."
bad,"A typical day at work for Tesla includes capturing leads and generating business from existing leads. This is done through meeting people on the sales floor, capturing and entering their data in Salesforce and following up with them to coordinate product demonstrations. I learned a lot in this role about electric vehicles and sustainability. I was also taught customer facing skills which helped lead me to a high volume of new orders. The workplace culture is fine, it is mostly comprised of young inexperienced people who are just starting their careers. The hardest part of the job is the lack of communication from the corporate level, the lack of strategy when organization changes happen and also the uncertainty for growth within the company and job security. The most enjoyable part was working with customers who genuinely loved the product and the mission."
bad,"People smoking weed at parking lot, takes 7-8 min walking to reach your working place.  Terrible place to work.  No place to eat your food, no table and chair, so just stand up and hold your food while eating. Only the best thing there was the benefits, that’s all."
bad,"Tesla is going through massive changes and right now is not ideal time to join the team. I think in the future, it may be a good place to apply, but let them get settled."
bad,"I was employed with the company for a year and have seen a large number of people come and go. This was either due to Tesla hiring literally anyone off the street that could pass a background check, or people becoming fed up with the disorganization, poor management, or poor leadership that goes on at the gigafactory. The recruiters and other associates you will listen to at orientation have little to no idea what’s is going on, and if they think they do it is because they are going based off of outdated experience within the company. They will try to paint you a pretty picture of what it is like to work at the gigafactory, but take that with a grain of salt. This is a corporate job through and through and is ran like one. The disorganization and lack of experience in management is astonishing. They do not know nor understand how the departments they are responsible for function, and they have absolutely no interest in trying to learn when issues arise that require their immediate attention. They will simply kick the can down the road so someone else could be held responsible. Training is a joke and you will have to rely on yourself or a trusted coworker for help. I had to correct a training document put together by someone well above my pay grade because It contained incorrect information. Had it been followed someone could have gotten seriously injured. Attendance is a very controversial subject. There is a strict policy currently in place which every supervisor is supposed to use and implement amongst their team. That is not the case however, as they will pick and choose"
bad,My experience at Tesla was something like high school. Some good people scattered through out the company. They need to do random drug checks because for a minute I thought I was working for Scarface. I left the company after a year and I wouldnt go back for nothing.
bad,"If you are introductory this is a great opportunity. Experienced quality members beware. There is no quality backbone. There is little structure. If you are ambitious, this is not the place for you. You will actually lose knowledge working here."
bad,I was told I could not get hired directly into mgmt. I have 29 years of mgmt experience. I would have to be promoted up from the line. I also applied for mechanic. I have 3 years of experience. I have been working on the model 3 line for 10 months now and the last 5 mgr have came from outside and all from the military. Most of the mechanics have never been a mechanic before or even worked on their own cars. This place defies common sense. There is no way to predict if you will be promoted or if you can move to another position based on your experience and qualifications. I am left to get another job or hope something will change. A lot of hours spent wondering how the he'll we stay in business the way this place is ran. It feels like a bunch of amateurs are in charge. They will hire any moron. A lot of the people have no manners. A bunch of filthy animals.
bad,"Managers at SC (now Tesla) are completely unaware of certain policies. Integration is horrible. Pay is VERY VERY low. Newer hires after me were given over a dollar more. Tesla is very aware that their pay is exceptionally low. I lost my job because I received 4 different set of instructions on how to handle a medical leave and was ultimately terminated for ""no call no show."" Customers are uneducated about product they are signing up for. Customer service is the absolute worst, I've never had to say ""I don't know"" to a customer so many times. If you like a job where you can be rude to people over the phone and enjoy arguing with and getting chewed out by customers for very low pay, then this job is for you."
bad,Great cars in tesla and i respect their values on creating cars and products for the future. Great technology when it comes to the cars but poor management when it comes to taking care of their employees. Also the hours and days change too often it really affects people and their families.
bad,"The mission at Tesla is awesome. I love the fact that a positive impact is made in the world. "
bad,"I began at Tesla like most: bright-eyed, and bushy-tailed, ready to make a difference. I wanted to help the company achieve its mission of accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy. What I quickly found was that there are way too many chiefs and not enough Indians making this goal happen."
bad,Tip: be ready to change everything you thought you knew about Tesla!!  Your life as you know it is about to change when you accept the job. Work and home balance is virtually impossible so be prepared to drive yourself mad trying to find a middle area there.
bad,If you Looking for a quick buck it's ok but far as long term opportunity have a back up plan. Endless hours to work .. but very lil safety support or appreciation of employees . They are all treated like expendables . A lot of favoritism amongst employees and management . No real respect unless your willing to  snitch on anyone . Take physical and mental abuse
bad,"- Management is out of control. They do not know how to handle their emotions."
bad,"My direct manager put me in many legal predicaments. I was treated rather poorly and often as a proverbial doormat if you will. I was relentlessly dedicated, worked many hours, and did work of higher paid staff. I received no review, or pay increase in over two year. Management preferred to operate behind closed doors and acted off of third person information. total interaction with staff members was roughly 2-4hrs per week."
bad,"Want to over perform and push your way through the ladder of thousands in your career path?"
bad,"Working at Tesla Motors was very exciting. I learned many lessons that I will cite for the rest of my life. I really invested a great deal of myself in learning the culture, and caught on quite quickly. I made many great memories at Tesla, and who knows, I may some day return."
bad,Very fast paced environment with limited ability to express or grow your own ideas! Support and development by management is not encouraged.
bad,Tesla offers benefits... That is about it. Management is none existent and the company seems to thrive on the idea that someone else will do it.
bad,"The company seemed very self-centered. They only seem to care about numbers. I wouldn't think Elon would be like this, but the Corporate heads that demand things from employees are ruthless. "
bad,"Man hat keine Jobsicherheit. "
bad,"Work is from 6am-6pm, work management was very strict, the hardest part in this job is of course hours, but parking was hard also because it takes me 30+ min daily  to find a parking spot, but it is a factory, the most enjoyable part of this job is seeing thing built, having first hand on installing parts on vehicle."
bad,long nights and decent pay. not for everyone. working 6pm to 6am is not for everyone. Some people won't be able to do the tough hours. it didn't work for me
bad,"The work is interesting, hours are long, pay is ok.  Management only care about numbers not quality. Company has great benefits.  Many safety issues and injuries due to the pace of the work."
bad,"Physically exhausting due to physical work and on your feet 11 1/2 hours a day."
bad,To .much runs like a sweat shop . One day off only and 12 hour work shifts . Hard to get any time off ! Management will not support your career growth.  You will get job burn out .
bad,Was a great work experience poor management due to lack of training constant turnover on work force Fast pace work environment with minimal safety hazards lot of people lot of movement heavy traffic within the factory
bad,"I worked in the solar branch and my particular office in Connecticut used fear and intimidation tactics to try and squeeze more productivity out of its employees. Always went  through great length in making me feel as if they were on the edge of firing me and making me feel like i was a worthless employee. For example they had a meeting with me to degrade my performance and hit me on factors such as my attendance, work ethic, improvement stagnation, sales numbers, job site errors that costed money.... Yet i hadn't called out in over a year (the one time for my best friends passing, and three times in 3 and a half years of employment), the best sales numbers and costumer satisfaction for my job division in the north east, and no job site errors for over a year (nearly unheard of). Hmmmmm lol.....Yet i worked for a week filling in for a guy that got hurt at another branch. They were very reasonable/fair to work for. And they put in a request to have me transfer to their office."
bad,Never felt my job was secure and paid less to do more. Everyone seems to be under a lot of stress creating a toxic work environment.  Always changing processes without considering impacts of the changes.
bad,The company opened a brand new store to lie and say they were closing to get rid of people. They laid off the highest paid employees just to keep temps running the store never received stock options complete waste of time.
bad,If your young and a technical individual you might be ok. They don’t recognize individuals who show up even in the snow and never call in sick. It is catered to younger people who party. It seems like they weed out the older people..
bad,"The compensation system in the energy sales side of the business changed every quarter year which resulted in much frustration among the sales associates. At the end thousands of sales associates were laid off just before they could reach their quarterly bonuses. Quite an immoral treatment. I avoided the first round of layoffs but my working conditions deteriorated as the energy sales was rendered secondary to car sales, basically an afterthought."
bad,It really depends on the position you start in and which department you work for. I found it to be a mixed bag. Some people were able to advance and compensated respectively and others worked themselves to exhaustion and didn't receive acknowledgment.
bad,"Tesla is a good place to work, however, with that said there are dangers that they don't tell you about when you are hired, and they are; adhesives, the smell of adhesive is very strong in many area's with-in the Gigafactory, and most of the adhesives can can cause a number of health problems from Lung & Repository issues to Heart, and reproduction issues.I have heard of people going blind because of the adhesive (temporarily), or becoming sterile, having nose bleeds, headaches for a long period of time, sore throats, or just out right quitting because of the effects of the adhesive."
bad,Production workers a disposable. You can work your butt off and it goes unnoticed. The hours are long and since the hours were cut its not worth it to work here. Sometimes its very unproffesional work enviroment. No 401k match and they split any bonus into 4 payments instead of giving you what you deserve.
bad,Due to the recent layoff employees are forced to work multiple stations. Mandatory overtime. Management doesn’t care. One goal and that is the production target. If the production line doesn’t make the number during the week be prepared to work Saturday. Stocks are a joke also. They get taxed then you have to pay taxes on top of that. Stay away!!!!!!
bad,"A typical day at work involves daily standup followed by routine work on tickets assigned to you and join meetings with qa,build team. We have lot of uat sessions for every feature we develop and take constant feedback. In the past year there have been 3 layoffs so that is why there is a negative vibe."
bad,"Tesla purchased a failing, local tool and die shop then retained all of the management. Retained managers run company like the failed shop, not Tesla."
bad,"Management is an absolute joke. Without a degree or military experience, forget about advancing. While the hourly wage isn't terrible, it's below par when compared to any other auto manufacturer. Plus, the pay rate is not a livable wage for the location which causes many employees to live hours away. Between the long hours and hours spent driving for many, your work/life balance is nonexistent. The only good things here are stock options (with vesting periods), and really really great health benefits."
bad,"I worked at Tesla for only 7 months but it felt like 7 years. The environment is toxic physically and mentally. New ideas may be given a nod but impressing higher level management seems to be the priority. "
bad,tesla is an okay company to work for until you realize the closeted racism is in fact not hidden well. ive been degraded talked down to and had racial slurs hurrled my way multiple times and hr has yet to get involved
bad,Typical day is met with constant berating of betterment for even the highest performers. Managers follow guidelines to a tee without any care for the amount of pressure they place on their employees. You are discouraged for using personal time off as it may put you behind an average of the office. There is no commission at the position I was in but you are expected to perform better than your colleagues or risk losing your job. Workplace culture evolved with each person in the office slowly becoming more and more aggressive and irritable about even the slightest issues especially with at least half the office worried for their job at the end of the month. Overall would say working as a temp seemed like a more stable career path if you are interested in Tesla.
bad,If you choose to work at Tesla prepare yourself your long cold night or hot summer days. Prepare yourself for poor management and lack of respect from management. Its a cut-throat job.
bad,Competition to prove yourself is fierce. Every day is so much of a challenge that it is impossible to work on development; yours or your team. They boast about how fast things change but fail to realize the flaws in their obsessive push for more.
bad,"Disorganized company. Who doesnt follow last in last out for lay offs? The product is amazing but poor tech support, unpredictable logistics, lack of organizational structure."
bad,"When you say ""I work for Tesla"" at parties you are instantly 3 points cooler, even if you hit 11. This is a job perk and Tesla knows it, cultivates it, and pays accordingly. There are great people here, but many either have another job or live with their parents. The products are from the future and the company has to force it, priding itself on being ""scrappy"". This means it will chew off a leg in order to survive, and I saw a lot of good-hearted Tesla loyals get dismissed without warning (""But...""). There is a pervasive ""chosen few"" mindset among the remaining employees and you should only apply if you would consider working for Elon Musk to be an exciting privilege and you have a backup plan,"
bad,"Some great people at Tesla, but the overwhelming amount of incompetence supersedes the talented employees. Like others have stated: Nepotism on a level that undermines the quality of the product. Totally unqualified HS dropouts promoted over College grads, and real world military combat veterans with management skills and smarts. The culture is extremely left wing, but there's lots of   ""street culture"" and ""thug culture"" workforce to balance out the Soy-boy's & Feminazi in management. Free cereal, coffee, and drinks, but very little time for breaks. Safety is not a concern at Tesla and there are LOTS of injuries. No one really cares when someone is seriously injured. There is definitely strong DISCRIMINATION against anyone that is old which translates to anyone over the age of 35.  Production Associates are treated like dumb animals (whereas I'm basically saying most of them are) but if you're hired into Material Handler or Production Associate with a College Degree, you're just another number. You'll work next to ex-felons, ex-homeless, low-level educated people. You do not matter. You are a slave. If you try to transfer, HR does nothing to help you. Supervisors are narcissistic and see hundreds of employees come and go on a monthly basis, so why would they care? Most Leads/Supervisors walk around talking on their phones, or stand and talk with other Leads/Supervisors or friends. Some Leads are FANTASTIC. Driving to and from work is a DEATHRACE of road rage, and obscene levels of stupidity...these will be your ""co-workers"". People LITERALLY RUN TO THEIR VEHICLES to escape"
bad,"Unsafe work environments and practices."
bad,"I would have loved to continue to work there, but there is no AC in the factory and the supervisors there don't care about your family issues of emergency and don't care about your health problems. I almost had 2 strokes while working and my supervisor told me oh well. Quit, be fired or deal."
bad,"My supervisor & Management have poor communication therefore its ,ake the work place hostel. i was worked as temp and got hired on. I was used and mis lead and bunch of broken promised. Therefore i had gave up and gotten fired due to being late. i worked for pilot shop make cars from scratch for the model 3. my work performance was always good and plus. Too many promise that was broken"
bad,"Employees are driven by the mission and focus on brute strength to accomplish goals set by leadership. Much reactive, firefighting work. Difficult to get good, supportive processes implemented.  Tesla is feeling all the growing pains of transforming from a small start-up with an awesome mission.  People have a huge sense of pride in the work that they do and the change we are making to the world!"
bad,I liked work at Tesla since it is a fast paced and team work environment.  You are really busy every day and dealing with many unexpected issues.  It makes you to be creative but with logical thinking and quick decision making.
bad,"You're not allowed to sit down, at least that's the usual rule it's moslty dependent on who your supervisor is. Overall, if you're in a desperate situation in which you need a lot of money then it's the perfect job since they hire pretty much everyone. Good luck keeping the job though, it's very easy to lose it."
bad,"At first job was great, massive overtime opportunities, amazing benefits, great experiences traveling around to different locations. As time went on, promised overtime was cut completely, demand dramatically increased, tooling becoming less available, procedures and policies changing on a daily basis, no compensation increases (shop-wide), all while dealing with very difficult management that were too busy on phone calls, in meetings, or on PTO. Very little support from management and H.R. roles."
bad,"Not worth the effort."
bad,"Phenomenal product (for the most part), horrible management. Over 70% of management doesn't have a clue what they are talking about. Compensation is equivalent to slave wage, I am not sure how many of my coworkers were well into their 30s and were able to afford living expenses working here. As a college student, it was great as a resume-builder, but anyone with a brain and proper credentials would never work for a company that expects you to sling their $100,000 product every single quarter, and not even receive a 1% commission on it in return."
bad,"tesla as a company is in a great place but the Pomona location is terrible, there's claims of trying to balance you work and life but as volumes increased that was thrown out the window, theres no hope of moving up unless you are the managements pet, dont buy into the smoke the blow up your ___ unless if your're from the target warehouse that the entire management team is from, everyone who isnt from target gets fired eventually, the only good soul there is Ouie which could be your only hope to keeping the job, don't make any mistakes ever because you put a target on your back, the benefits are good but arent worth the stress of the job and the lack of time you'll have after your workday, if you want money for your family you may find it here but you will not have the time for your family and friends, they dont allow enough time for new hires to actually learn the process before they start criticizing new hires as slow or a reliability or unproductive, management needs work and needs to be diverse instead its just a tyrant group that only looks out for their own, the starting pay is variable every worker there has a different pay even thought they have the same title,the management does not provide the proper tools to ship out items as there are always shortages of boxes and pallets, the management team then blames the rest of the team of being slow at their jobs,  the only thing that keeps you going is your coworkers around you but that can only do so much"
bad,Most Management are trying to pass the blame down to supervisors and hourly workers to avoid getting in trouble.  Management is extremely disconnected from what is going on day to day.
bad,"I worked on the PV Design team, I was hired on right after Tesla accrued Solar City. Everyone there was nose to the grindstone, and the culture in our department was quiet and determined. Peoples salaries depended on how many jobs they could pump out each day, so most people always had their headphones in, took no breaks or lunch, and kept to themselves. I understand this is what some people like, but not me. I would have had to change my whole lifestyle to fit in there and work the hours they work."
bad,"Tesla's vision to change the world with non polluting ""State Of The Art""  luxury electric vehicles that are 2nd to none really is admirable and remarkable but that is all in my opinion."
bad,"Tesla is not the place for the weak. It takes a lot to work at Tesla and many times you will have to sacrifice your home life. You will meet great people, but the demand and expectation is high!!!!"
bad,Someone is always looking to out due you and throw you under the bus with this company. Management needs to get together and work on issues with the employees of the company before bitting off more than they can chew.
bad,"Inventory is a complete nightmare, management is unqualified, Coworkers are all overworked and overstressed. Morale is very low. Production Control is probably the worst department you can work in."
bad,"-fast paced"
bad,"Long hours, Repeat work,very fast work area, and very heavy work."
bad,"Great company and bennies. Forget about pay and home life."
bad,"The company lack organization structure to handle its current size and planned growth. Management is primarily focused on putting out yesterdays' fires instead planning for the long term, including anticipation of the upcoming competition. This lack of planning is also reflected in the way employees are treated, constant drilling and never secure about your position."
bad,"This is a fast paced, nose to the grind stone environment. If you're working in the General Production area, you must be dedicated and willing to give up your weekends and quality time with your family. There is no work life balance."
bad,"People are always backstabbing, here more so as many believe that having 'Tesla' on your resume is better than anything else. It's partially true, but it glamorizes a terrible culture of doing what it takes to be teachers pet, consume the teacher, take their place... rinse, repeat, and pray you're the most cunning."
bad,"Having worked at the energy and motors side, customers are extremely frustrated and always call the company a sham. Poor resolutions and desire to fix things. Severely understaffed."
bad,Excellent benefits. long hours and long commute. Majority of the people that work for Tesla are long distance commuters so alot of them dont have time for family.
bad,"Pros: The job itself was a fast-paced environment. The overall feel was very relaxed and you are left alone to do your work. The pay felt fair for the work that was done."
bad,"I feel some things were not fully disclosed when I was hired. Too much of the micromanagement going on. Everyone tells you something different"
bad,"I discovered that they promote leads and supers based on their ability to spy backstab and brown-nose their way up."
bad,Management went bad. Had favorites and allowed them to take 3hr lunches where if I was over 5min I would get in trouble. Don’t care about safety at all
bad,"Tesla’s lack of organized management and chaotic structure stems from Elon Musk. The environment is cutt-throat as there is the underlying pressure that your employment is not certain or permanent. Departmental focus shifts rapidly and with little warning and the stated goals of the department are often murky, vague, and subject to change suddenly based on Musk’s whims. Rising through the ranks can occur quickly, as others leave after a few years or are fired/ laid-off suddenly."
bad,"They say tesla not just a job, it’s a career right no opportunities for advancing. Also management/supervisor all have favorites. My supervisor was always hard on everyone and preach about showing up to work on time but he would always run late or call in. The reviews were always the same on what you need to work on just to hold you back. So it was a decent paying job if you did ot but depending on your management good luck moving up or getting raises. This company falling apart, and if you got to get a hold of HR it’s like playing phone tag."
bad,"Priorities change constantly. Management does not plan anything they simply afraid to say NO even if scope is unrealistic. Developers do shortcuts constantly. Worst quality of code I've ever seen. Long hours, a lot of stress which doesn't translate into any positive result."
bad,"they screw senior employees - don't get raises because later they will get rid of you to save $$,  Elon changes his mind monthly how to do things - costs company millions - then cut heads to save pennies,."
bad,"Like many other Tesla reviews, my experiences were mixed between positive experiences with benefits and employees and negative experiences within management and parking.  It’s great to have instant health benefits and an employee stock purchase plan when they become available. There are other discounts perks that help out as well. Hours are long but the worst part about the time is that it changes daily. The schedule is rarely set.  Some emergency or no call no show coworker will make you day a 12+ hour one real quick. Management will ask you to work weekends, holidays, and make up for others on your team that lag behind, but will rarely work alongside you to accomplish goals. Forget about being rewarded for hard work. It’s almost frowned upon even though you were just asked to do the impossible and accomplished it. If you stand out, prepared to be knocked down by management and the leads. Most of them were just promoted to fill a seat and when a skilled worker comes around; they fear you want their position instead of just working with them. It would be beneficial for the company to hire educated, qualified management from now on and eliminate those that were there just promoted to fill an open seat…really!! There is an absurd amount of nepotism in the hiring process as well; it’s not what you know, it’s who you know.  Coworkers and generally helpful but there are always those few that will talk negatively behind your back in order to try and move ahead. Back stabbers I believe they are called. Parking is ridiculous at best. Come early so you get a spot or be late to work."
bad,There is absolutely no accountability! Its the sole reason for the failures of the company. HR is horrid on every level. No respect for the people that have truly worked hard to see the company succeed.
bad,"Day to day activities is to support and sustain production equipment."
bad,"I worked with SolarCity originally and then transitioned to Tesla after they purchased SolarCity in 2016. The two companies could not be more different. Tesla continually asked more and more of my team and it required us to consolidate 4 jobs into one. In the end, it was all for naught. they ended up terminating all Solar jobs in my state and gave us no opportunities to transfer prior to letting us go despite their urgent need. I was not put into a position to succeed, you will be placed in high visibility projects with little resources available and no road map. My management in my department level was great, but  a new VP who took over energy was completely ignorant to our business need and tried to convert us into a mimicry of Amazon."
bad,"Very Stressful"
bad,"This company had great potential, it had a great staff that was well connected, however it's been slowly changing and most people have left. Contractors are required to apply for the positions they once held and it's a lengthy process followed by poor execution. There's relatively no benefits worth staying with this company anymore."
bad,High pressure to succeed and produce. Sometimes enjoyable but has a poor work/life balance. Expect a very busy workday should you choose to be employed with Tesla.
bad,"When I first came to Tesla I was excited, proud, and overall humbled that I was now part of the Tesla ""team. HA! There is no such thing as ""team"" at Tesla. Is just like High School all over again! Only if you are well ""liked"" by your peers and managers is the only way you get to move up in that company. Once you're in- you are literally eating, breathing, and sleeping with ""Tesla Motors"". You have no life! You are expected to work 6 sometimes 7 days a week. Anywhere from 8 up to 12 hours. Forget about having a day off unless you have enough ""PTO"" to cover it. Oh, ""PTO"" and ""sick days"" apparently fall under the same category at Tesla. If you start at 6 am you must be there at 5 or earlier to get parking, NO JOKE!! I will never come back here."
bad,The culture within the retail locations creates drama and allows for emotion to be brought into the workplace.  The managers are never right and are treated like puppets. They pay well but expect you to live and breathe Tesla available 24/7.
bad,Start up company when I started. Worked 60 hrs a week and no appreciation from upper management. Too many meetings. Manager favored too many people that really do much work.
bad,"Management bases everything on numbers and not issues relating to the job. I worked there for about two years and The job was so meaningless. Management doesn't know how to get things done well and correct. Stupid people get promoted because they've ""been there"" first."
bad,"Tesla is a fun and exciting company to work for because of the products they have to offer. Aside from that, they tend to hire managers who have no idea what they're doing with little or no experience. Management says that they are always there to help you improve and move up within the company; however, that is not true."
bad,"This is a new department and they are still in the building phase. I guess people are so happy to work for Tesla that they don't realize how ridiculous it can be working there. There is no structure. They fired my trainer along with 700 other people... then they didn't continue training, they just expected us to work without knowing what the heck we were doing. Maybe it's my age, but I need more structure. The employees are rude. Not the best place to work... I am not a fan. "
bad,"Passion for company is critical because you will have a poor work life balance, lots of challenges, little direction from management, and be underpaid"
bad,Management is ridiculous.   I'm speaking only on the Lathrop facility.  The culture sucks and is very demoralizing.  It is currently this way because of the New Director of the Facility.
bad,"lots of politics.  lots of turnaround, I had 6 supervisors in 3 years. the pay is good and hours are plentiful but sometimes mandated. if your a yes man who doesn't mind working 70 plus hours, it's your dream job.  the last jacked up thing I saw is where they pushed production for high numbers then told them there wasn't storage for the parts and gave them time off to which they had to either take it unpaid or use pto."
bad,"Tesla's a tough place to work. Last minute (almost literally) schedule changes, that are made a requirement to work, make your personal life a mess. It can rough having plans on a day off and then having to cancel constantly at the last moment because of these changes. other than that, the work itself can be tough, which is understandable since it's a production factory, but the lack of progression in advancing to be a safer and more ergonomic work environment makes the situation tougher."
bad,the most enjoyable part was the staff. a typical work day consist of maning your post and placing parts on cars specific to the manifest instructions.
bad,horrible management and terrible security im very thankful i will not be going back it is ment for peple who dont have families so that is my review for that horrible place
bad,The company is full of smart employees who are passionate about the mission.  Employees can be over worked with no perks. Free cereal and pretzels but nothing glamarous like other large tech companies in the Silicon Vally or start ups in SF.
bad,Great corporate vision.  Disorganized internally. They want you to get drunk on the KoolAid so you don't realize that you are being unfairly compensated. 
bad,"a typical schedule at tesla is 12 hours 6-7 days a week. Some people have worked months on end without a day off, and when they do ask or take a day off they are harassed and chastised. Poor managment and no communication between departments leads to a lot of bickering and in fighting. People there all hate their jobs and all are looking for employment elsewhere. They treat you as if your a robot and should be happy they picked you to work insane hours. People have been hurt multiple times and do not see their families due to the schedules."
bad,"I really have nothing to say, the type of job was not what was presented to me when I interviewed, it was not what I was led to believe what I would be doing."
bad,Each manager is different and has their own vision of the store and what you should be doing.   Communication was horrible.  Be prepared to read Twitter for company news on critical things like pricing and configuration changes.
bad,"It all depends if you're on the production line or offline. Offline jobs are better because there is no constant demand to be on the production line producing. If you want to come to work, go numb, and not think about anything working on the production line is perfect for you. If you actually like a challenge and want to be satisfied with your job try to find an offline job and never stop learning and switch jobs every few years. Getting dissatisfied with your job at Tesla really makes it hard to want to try to do to all the questionable management decisions on a monthly basis."
bad,"Beautifully modern and we'll lit environment. Geared to younger folks with little personal obligations. Very competitive pay, many accommodations for those workaholics."
bad,Would be a good company to work for if they would hire direct instead of using a temp agency. Just lose the agency and they would be a great company to work for.
bad,"When I joined Tesla it was all about doing what is right for the customer. When I left Tesla, it was all about saving money for the company, regardless of what that meant for the customer or employees. I left because I no longer aligned ethically with how employees and customers are treated. Sales gets all the focus while service suffers the consequences of selling more than you can service."
bad,"A stressful work environment where your employment never feels secure. The asks are numerous and the pay, advancement &, overtime are nonexistent. As for the different sections/department in the company, the right hand doesn't have a good grasp on what the left hand is doing. You might start off the day receiving cars then, switch to taking customers on a test drive or, helping to fix a containment hold. Great if you know how to detail a car but, your pay won't increase because of the ability."
bad,"The building is so large it's like another world. You can get lost and turned around because it is so gigantic. The learning curve is not very flexible. I was thrown in, and was having a rough time. The breaks are timed, and stringent. I had a 20 yr old monitoring me. If the managers had been a little less RUDE, I would've stayed at the job."
bad,"From day 1, we were lied to about how much we would make in bonuses. In fact, there were no bonuses to be made because no cars were in production to sell yet despite what the recruiters boasted. I struggled with my bills for 5 months, some had struggled for a year. Eventually corporate settled by giving us a very generous hourly raise. Around this time they hired and transferred about 200 newbies and made us train them while managing 50-100 clients at a time, only to fire them all about 6 months later. During my time, I survived 3 massive layoffs (including managers). My job description changed 4 times in less than 2 years. Inside Delivery picks up responsibility for every department in the company because nobody else is “customer-facing” (and service centers are too busy to answer the phone). Disputing a charge? Call Inside Delivery. It’s the day before pick-up and the client’s car was damaged during shipping? Inside Delivery will deliver the news. Need roadside assistance?! Call Inside Delivery. So stressful I forgot what it was like to have a normal job. I was lucky to get in when I did because I made really good money but I feared I would lose my job everyday. Don’t fall for the hype."
bad,"muchos layoffs y amplios horarios de trabajo, marca tension en el trabajo"
bad,"Terrible manufacturing processes. I actually left because I couldn't stand being there for 12 hours, and doing next to nothing. Spent most of my time looking for something to do. I worked on the bonding line(AM's, PM's). Work needed would come up on the board. You walk half way across the building, only to find someone else already there. When you finally find something to work on, two or three will walk up to you, to find you already working on it. Much of the work at Tesla is done similar. Worst manufacturing processes I've ever been in(been in manufacturing for 22 yrs.)."
bad,"I would like to use this opportunity to complain about the misconceptions and false pretenses on which I was offered, accepted and relocated for this job to pursue opportunities which have since been proven nonexistent. The complete disconnect between recruiting and the factory floor is a disgrace to the process, to the company and mission statement. Even in orientation I was told things that weren't true and encouraged for a career that doesn't exist. I was hired under false pretenses, that's gotta say something."
bad,"They pay it’s okay, but if you are good at your job they, won’t level you if they can’t  find someone to do your job or keep up,"
bad,"Pros: Mission driven organization. Friendly coworkers. Decent pay. Contribution to limiting impacts of climate change. "
bad,"This company has a constantly changing schedule and expects employees to adapt with only a few days notice from early morning to late night shifts. Most people quit within 2 months. Benefits are good, but you won’t have time to use them. Hours are long and they don’t let you take bathroom and food breaks ever at reasonable times. If customers knew how they treated employees, a lot wouldn’t buy this product."
bad,"I first took the job because I was excited to work for a company that wanted to change the world. Half of the good things you hear about the company are false. The CEO is impulsive, ignorant, and selfish. I witnessed him fire an employee because he wanted to shake his hand. He fired 10,000 salary employees nationwide just to prove a point. He sets unrealistic production goals and when you do not meet them, he will directly threaten your job. I learned alot about manufacturing and production. I also did not get much sleep and could barely afford the rising costs of living in Reno. Many coworkers had multiple sexual harassment complaints on them and somehow still have their jobs. Yet they will fire someone who dozes off during dead production times. "
bad,It's a company worth trying. After so many years however you notice a lot about what they do. Dont really have a life working there. It's not all bad though as it has gotten better. Not a place for you if your expecting an 8 hour day and go home.
bad,"Training was inconsistent if your were not  in a click or a management favorite. You had to be careful what you said or else some employees would ""tattle"" to management and twist what was said. It was made very clear that if you were not a management favorite you did not get full support"
bad,you have to be willing to adjust to quick change and long lifeless hours.Work your way to a level up that includes raise and or bonuses. meet great people.
bad,YOU BETTER BE AT WORK. No Excuses. You can't purchase Tesla stock if you don't make enough MONEY. Continue sending resumes to other companies. No worth the time.
bad,"it was ok. lots of OT but very tiring. very cold warehouse during the time I was employed. Great place to learn. If you need money, this place is great for you."
bad,"at first it was a good place but then you notice that management has poor communication with supervisors and employees"
bad,"No work support or back up, it’s all cover your but it it’s your head. Too many steps to get job done and if you miss a step 3 people let you know. The training is sub par, they tell you that you have all the information to do your job but they don’t tell you where to find it, only that it’s on they’re web site."
bad,The company seems more interested in threatening you than helping you accomplish your job.  The warehousing is a complete disaster due to the above mentioned reasons.
bad,"it is a cut-throat environment.Lots of people are frustrated but keep working there. Training sessions lead to believe workers can get ahead but in reality, nobody does. If you can, work somewhere else. management sucks and nobody listens."
bad,"Occasionally a decent place to work. There's either nothing to do, or too much. Tesla is a young company, and it shows. Nonexistent management, policies/procedures, or accountability. There's rarely promotion from within, including seasoned employees. Production is the main focus of this company, making the service center an afterthought. I can't speak for the factory, but I do not recommend working at a service center."
bad,You are guaranteed to be overworked. This is something you are told about but it gets completely  excessive. The company's success depends on it. Just don't expect any work-life balance. It is an amazing company to work for but it will take everything out of you.
bad,"I didn't really get to experience much of actual tesla. I was a solarcity employee who merged into Tesla. The SolarCity culture in my department was poor, management was scattered and instead of looking for real resolutions they made problems out of nothing so they could pass blame on someone else."
bad,Tesla is a place to work if you take a lot of time off. But if you are looking to improve your skills or even your pay look elsewhere for a job. Thanks for reading
bad,typical day at work was 12 hrs 7 days a week and we unloaded every inbound truck and loaded any that were outbound. was responsible for all truck paper work. co-workers were viewed as teammates in the work place and we worked with a team atmosphere. the hardest part of the job was ensuring all parts that had been recieved that were all put away with forklift in there correct spots.
bad,This was an ok place to work at the beginning its just becomes stressful when you give your very best just to find out that you can get bumped down just because you're not a favorite to higher ups. So your hard work and dedication gets overlooked
bad,Liked my job as as Engineering Technician at Tesla but... Quality Management/Supervisors doesn't take the time to get involved with daily work & processes within Tesla's Gigafactory. It's all about giving orders with no & piling more responsibilities on Quality with minimum involvement from upper Quality/Supervisors management... Really never have Techs back...
bad,"I started in Tesla back in 2011 when they were still a start up. The job was fun, the management and team was fun to work with but the hours were long. We all had the passion to be there so we did not mind at all. As manufacturing began to ramp up, more stressful days and long hours and work weeks started to occur. It wouldn't be surprising to work 6-7 days a week and working for 10-12 hours a day and sometimes 13-14. After some time, communication from upper management really started to fail, it was all about the numbers and that is all that mattered. Ergonomics, injury and fatigue really began to set in, people quit for not having time with their family and seeing your family was rare. The CEO would motivate us with the mission but that began to get weary. New engineers would work on production lines not knowing or understanding manufacturing. Overly engineered equipment, terrible processes were normal. If we couldn't make numbers, they threw hours at it then more manpower rather than trying to figure out the root cause of the problem which was equipment."
bad,Tesla as a company is entering a crossroads as a company. Many people have been laid off in the past year. I would say stay away if you are looking for a job you can grow at.
bad,"very competitive and sometimes fast paced sometimes very slow and boring , need alot of energy and be well trained, great benefits and good money, fast advancement , free shuttle service to work."
bad,"Looking for pay?!!!! Look for another job. The first day you receive benefits and two weeks vacation. Sounds great right?!!! Wrong! How can you schedule for doctor's appointments, when working 12 or more hours? Don't think about calling out, you will be reprimanded, because you let The Team down. Your life revolves around the ""Team."""
bad,"-Influential work environment with opportunity for growth"
bad,"Know what you are getting yourself into, cutthroat, high paced, products sold to individuals with good credit, and believe only in the green revolution, start up environment and may not be for you."
bad,"Was an 8 hour work day with an hour for lunch.  The typical day involved checking and answering emails, managing a pipeline of about 250 accounts and making sure those accounts(customer) are up to date on status of project and timelines.  Had to take inbound calls, the system used for that is not friendly and would give back to back calls which would make it difficult to manage other job responsibilities.  Provided feedback would take a long time to be implemented"
bad,Tesla needs a union in there they do not care about they workers .. they have you over working.  You 12hrs a day with 1 30 min lunch and 3 10min breaks by time you get to the breakroom you have 7 mins. And they do favoritism.
bad,Base salary plus commission on appointments that led to installations. Walked around Home Depot or Best Buy for 8 hours/day going up to strangers asking if they've ever considered going solar. Had to meet monthly quota.
bad,"Completed my internship during a difficult time at Tesla, but worth it for the people and experience. A lot of work involved and high turnover for engineers."
bad,"Poor training, understaffed the pay rate and insurance doesn't make the stress worth it absolutely no work culture what so ever. Managers are nice but you never have a clue if you're coming or going."
bad,"zero HR department, with constant disagreements, bullying, and sexism in work place. Pay was great, but you were expected to have double, sometimes triple work productivity."
bad,"No consistency in wages, or expected pay. The high turnover rate and varying wages is indicative of holes in upper management and annual forecasting. Nepotism is noticeable at all levels or the job and an abundance of affairs and other similar issues."
bad,No real job security and a very cut throat environment to work in.  Managers always have a ulterior motive and aren't up front with there employees.  Work here at your own risk
bad,i did like working there. people and the management were nice. never had any issue. it was was good company to work for. i wanted to continue but the company decided to cut down its work force and got laid off.
bad,"Great place to work, with great leadership and support. Poor upper management support and direction. Constant changes and process roll outs. Decent metric goals."
bad,"The money is good at Tesla and that’s about the only thing. The work is strenuous, causing wear and tear on your body, long 12hour shifts. They only care about productivity how many cars they can get out. If you are going to work there get in and get out,definitely not a long term career unless you aren’t on the production floor!!"
bad,I prefer not to elaborate due to the companies confidentiality policy that all employees are required to sign and would not want to violate this policy.
bad,"Tesla was a great place to work because of the culture and benefits. However, if you do work here you have literally NO job security. They don’t care about their employees at all as people. The most recent time I was laid off (yeah, it was multiple times in the year and a half I was there) they said they had closed my retail location, so we were all losing our jobs. Whatever, can’t control that. A month later I happened to be in the area and saw that the store was open and running with a different staff. The company may be considered “prestigious” but things are constantly changing (not in a good way) and things kind of run like a dumpster fire. I don’t recommend working here."
bad,"Every company is different for everyone. Culture and upper management is a big deal to me and the culture at Tesla is not my style. I thrive in a company where leadership is communicative and clear on objectives, goals and strategy."
bad,"During my employment we were expected to work no less than 60 hours a week and were only given PTO if you worked a full week without missing any time. The amount of PTO was less than 4 hours a week and you were not permitted to schedule time off if you did not have the PTO to cover it. The labor was difficult to the point you would need to take a day off to heal so building up time for vacation was very difficult. When asked if you wanted to pick up additional shifts you would be treated as ""not a team player"" if you were unable to accept."
bad,"I worked for Tesla for a year and a half before being laid off. I enjoyed my position, and knew the ever-changing policies in-and-out. It is true that they change policies more often than it is possible to keep up with. It's also true that if you're a fast-paced, collaborative worker, you probably will anyway. "
bad,"Busy days with lots of overtime"
bad,"I was recruited through Linkedin and was told this would be a day shift position, after I was excepted I was called 2 days before orientation and was told that the shift I was told i was going to be on was changed and I would be working the night shift. After I resigned my last position of night shift."
bad,"With two major layoffs in one year, employees are feeling the pinch at having to do more work with fewer resources and there is a general feeling of fear in when the next round of layoffs in the energy division will occur."
bad,Having been employed for nearly three years it appears that my face no longer fits.  Despite sacrificing home life for the last 3 years.  Relocated to suit the company at the start of my employment as well.  If you don't want a life outside of work then you'll be fine.
bad,"After more than a year working up to my ENG tech position, And half a year in said position, I was informed that 8% of the company was being let go, and that I was effected by the change. I was informed the day prior to going beginning my work week. This company will choose the chance to profit over the well being of its employees."
bad,"Tesla is not a bad company but there are a lot of things I disagree with "
bad,while i believe in the mission behind tesla i was disappointed by the management and the non existent work life balance.  the work environment was VERY fast-paced and stressful
bad,"I thought this would be an opprotunity of a lifetime working for Tesla because when you think of the company, you think sexy luxury vehicles. However working there is conpletely different. The trainning is about a month long but still not enough time to learn and get equipped with the knowledge you need to know for your role. I'm currently working as a service support specialist and even though the pay is amazing, get ready to get thrown into the pool and learn how to swim on your own so to speak once you finish training and hit the call floor. This is my third week on the floor and its been a journey, definitely stressful and you have to be prepared to solve your own questions you might have because there is no real support from the managers who are too busy wrapping their heads around what Tesla is launching in the future. My manager sucks at communicating effectively with me because he is so ""busy"". I feel they should of just made my manager's position his own position to be busy with by himself. My team needs an actual manager to support us, not just be physically there to approve a time card at the end of the pay period. Thats honestly how I feel and WHY I'M BACK ON INDEED LOOKING FOR ANOTHER JOB AS WE SPEAK."
bad,"I am onboard with Tesla's mission, but not being paid a liveable hourly/salary wage makes that goal difficult. If they can figure out how to treat and pay their employees better than I would recommend working for Tesla."
bad,"Leuk groot bedrijf, veel verschillende nationaliteiten"
bad,This company is a great company to work for if you like long hours and good pay. They work you for 14-16 hours sometimes even 18 hours and not only long hours but the traffic just to get to tesla motors is ridiculous. You have to leave work an hour to 2.5 hours early depending on where you live. But overall this company is a fun and good pay company to work for if you are single and choose to be away from family.
bad,I wont learn about the cars.is a big company and more benefits and better life for me and my family
good,Morale has become quite low. The work pace is very intense and the expectations are often unrealistic. The demands never cease and there is no work life balance. But it’s a good place to build a career because I’d you want to work crazy hours you get promoted and can move up through the ranks pretty quickly.
good,"Only 12 hour shifts available. It took it's toll after two years. After 16 months, no performance review or pay increase. Witnessed a lot of favoritism."
good,The management team tries to make it worth to stay by offering education but I was told to invest in myself and go to conferences but they would only cover 400 of it.. Pay was low for where I lived and my education and experience.
good,Tesla was a fast-paced culture which has it's pros and cons. I enjoyed the many bright employees that I worked with and formed some great relationships while I was at Tesla. An area of opportunity would be management.
good,"Tesla does not care about its employees. Favoritism. Short breaks and lunch. Keep changing schedule in the last minutes. Managers, superviors are the worst."
good,Tesla is a fast growing company manufacturing products with already having a number of orders. Management is so poor resulting in bad organization and individual development. No room for accepting people with real skills unless you are close with managers.
good,They needed to fix something to get the bottom line up for quarter end in June.  They just didnt fix what was broken.  Changed commission structure to ensure they do not have to pay the 3000 people they laid off what was due.
good,"If you like hanging out at Home Depot and selling to people that aren't interested while barely getting paid then this job's for you. Hyper-competitive, over-saturated market in SoCal where speaking Spanish will give you the best opportunity for success."
good,"Sales department. I’m a very educated individual that had high hopes for a long career with Tesla, however my background nor my loyalty made any difference. The company is run like Apple with new career builders and who you know will take you somewhere, however is you are traditional and like your work to speak for itself, you will get no where. I recommend this job for young college students only, even college grads will be disappointed once employed. A seasoned worker with life experience, will be very unhappy in this department and at Tesla. I wish I knew all this going into employment, but hopefully someone reads this and will vier away from the dazzling Tesla brand, if they are seeking a true career path and decent salary. Good Luck !"
good,"This is not a good place to work if you enjoy spending quality time with your children / family.  The Job is good for someone with no social life. The hours are long, schedule changes each week. Madatory weekends / holidays."
good,"Management is in competence, they promote only who they like not base on their skills.  They promoted un skill employee and said ""based on business need..."" In order to keep your job is to shut up and leave with it or face termination.  ."
good,it is a fast pace job with little to no supervision no time for a personal life. the culture is your either part of the group or you wont be there long
good,When I first started it Tesla I was fully involved  with the culture of Tesla but as the last couple years went down I noticed that there was no room for advancement nor that the company has Integrity when it comes to their Associates.
good,I worked long hours from 730 am to 6 pm every day.  I traveled to Monterey to work for 5 months to secure a position in the company to have when they opened a location in Fresno.  Once the Fresno location was open I moved back to Fresno and was laid off a month later. I had been with the company for 8 years and my counterpart was with them for 1.  I didn't feel it was fair of them to let me go.
good,"You can learn a lot here, but management is toxic and you will have to sell your life to this company if you want to continue being employed here."
good,"Lack of overall morale.  Lack of communication and teamwork among different groups.  Minimal direction given to new employee. No 401k, no retirement plan"
good,"Good pay and benefits but that’s about it if I’m being honest. Everyone is constantly worried if they’re going to be laid off. If you’re working sales and get assigned a showroom that doesn’t have lots of traffic, start looking for another job. ALSO, you’re required to make a certain number of outbound calls everyday. If you take PTO, you have to make up for the calls that you didn’t make on your PAID DAY OFF. Tread lightly."
good,Processes and job locations often changed without notice. Not much communication between management and working employees lead to confusion and uncertainty.
good,"they don't care about your family or life outside of work. if its not their way its the highway. but as far as pay its a great job to have and thats why i would recommend someone to work there but only if they don't have kids or a spouse, that is unless they work there with you. management was rude and didn't always take care of their employees as they should have. the most enjoyable part of the job for me was making new friends."
good,"I was bullied so needless to say I didn't stay long. When I brought it to my supervisors attention nothing was done about it. So I quit, but I got alit of experience there."
good,Nous travaillions en prospection pour une entreprise de télécommunication.
good,"I worked at Tesla from the beginning when the factory was in San Carlos, CA, Palo Alto, and Fremont.  The company has gone through so many management changes and it is just getting worse and worse as they change.  The department that I was in was actually good until they had decided to relocate."
good,"First joining to this company, I am so excited but I disappointed when joining with Maintenance team. Each member must learn by themselves and confront the machines worth millions of dollars. It was a big challenge for every new member because the company didn't seem to have a clear plan to train and guide the other members in a team. In contrast, the upper manager puts a lot of pressure on the technicians instead of supporting them to get the job done."
good,Well what can I say about this company. Only if you don’t work your supervisor and management team will notice and move up. The more you work the more the expect out of you without compensating it. The less you work the higher you get with the company. Benefits are really really good.
good,"My experience at Tesla has been a mixed bag. "
good,Interesting and challenging job. The daily changes in direction from upper management keep you flexible. Very high turnover rate of employees - especially upper management.
good,Tesla Office is great. I love the office however I'm under the Agency for about a year now and I don't see any future in  here. In Need a full time job.
good,I have worked for Tesla for 5 years I have several shares of stock I have had several raises I have helped make changes to the safety on the model S line
good,"If you work here be willing to sacrifice your personal life and sleep for this company. You could work anywhere between 8-12 hours a day 6 days a week at short notice. Very little communication between associates & management and you earn PTO at a very slow rate (about 8hrs of pto earned every month)."
good,"The workforce is great for many people wanting to get into the automotive industry, however it takes a lot of time away from family and personally your life, due to the inconsistent work hours."
good,Things constantly change and very poor direction. I learned you had to be your own life line and tomorrow was never promised. The uncertainty is ok for people who do not have a family to care for or their only source of income would be this job.
good,"Tesla has no repect for its people or work force,"
good,"I worked as an intern for Teslas Energy, and I was astonished by the lack of communication. They were completely disconnected from the company itself."
good,"Tesla Energy installs solar on residential homes, for the work compensation is very low. This is also considering the area. office out of Stockton starts you off at $14 an hour, take a 45 min drive to Livermore and pay increases to $21. Still very low when other solar companies pay over $21 in the valley area. However they do have great benefits at a low rate, no matching on the 401k though."
good,I did enjoy working for the company. I was hired through a tip  Agency . For the most part they did care about the safety and concerns for their employees. . So many people working there but it always seemed to run pretty smoothly.
good,"they seem to be alright to work for, but you have limited time off work over all the workers are friendly, it fast passed and you the the opportunity to learn different things."
good,"A typical day is longer than 12 hours with no ability to leave earlier. It is very fast paced with not a lot of room for advancement. It is not a fair place to work,"
good,"Tesla is incredibly mission driven and your work at Tesla will be defined by that mission.  Corporate culture derives from that mission - which can be good and bad.  Company values and positive work/life balance often take a backseat to completion of the mission.  That said, the work is incredibly meaningful, and, if you can survive here, you can excel anywhere."
good,Tesla management isn’t very organized and some lack common sense in which trickles down to leave everyone in the factory out of sorts. That leaves a rocky environment for the common employee to do a job especially when the turnover rate at tesla is extremely high.
good,"Hard werken is een typische dag op werk."
good,"Great company that I would recommend to anyone who wants sales experience. You will work with great people and Tesla can be a pretty exciting place to work."
good,"Very faced past work environment. Your responsible for your production, with limited supervision."
good,"Be prepared to perform on a high level of subservience. You don't count, only upper management's stock price counts."
good,"You are consistently given empty promises and told to meet unrealistic expectations all within a 40 hour work week that does not allow any overtime. If you go over 40 hours for the sake of helping the business and doing what is right for the customer, it doesn't matter, you still get in trouble and yelled at. You consistently get told to do more work or take on more responsibility they fail miserably to compensate for the work. My recommendation to anyone that joins Tesla, take anything said in person or over phone calls with a grain of salt. Until it actually happens, don't believe it. Document everything you may need to protect yourself because at the end of the day, they do not seem to care about you as a person, just the business and meeting goals. They do provide great medical benefits and you also get a portion of stock which is a positive thing. Overall, Tesla is a phenomenal product and the mission they are chasing after is truly changing the world but be cautious to work here if you want a good work life balance and care about yourself because they will take advantage of every moment they can get from you."
good,"I was promised a certain job description, pay, and career path which I used to decide to move my family all the way across the country.  Once I was at Tesla, and on the hook for reimbursement of moving expenses, I learned everything I was promised in the recruiting was totally fabricated.  No one at Tesla cared that we ( I wasn't the only one) were duped into uprooting our life for false promises.  After a year and a half, nothing has improved and there is no light at the end of the tunnel."
good,"Management is terrible, leads don't work, they're just good at pointing fingers and telling employees what to do, compensation is OK but they recently let go some people ND now one person does 3 different jobs to compensate so I feel underpaid, they get rid of God employees and leaved the incompetent ones, and management is on the buddy buddy system."
good,The best thing about working for Tesla is the benefits.The worst thing is you have no set breaks or set time when your going to lunch or going home. The hardest part about working at Tesla keeping your cool when they make last minute decisions of you having to work OT or coming in on Saturdays.
good,No guidance or direction. Never knew what was coming next a Tesla. Felt a sense of panic and relief the day I was laid off. Ready to move on to bigger better things.
good,"Uma boa empresa, mas devido ao meu cargo que era de estagiário, acabava fazendo tarefas que não correspondiam de acordo com o meu curso que eu estava estagiando."
good,Very fast paced environment. Good to learn. Stress full work environment. Getting parking is very difficult. They need to focus on this specially. Still building
good,Very high pace and accurate. Meet so many diverse people. They come and go. A lot quit every week because they cannot handle the fast pace. I like it because time went quickly because your always busy.
good,"Tesla is a fast paced company that needs a mindset to match.  Also, things change on a daily basis.  Please be prepared to accept change and work at a fast pace."
good,I was not paid holidays or for time off when the plant closed for upgrades.  Typical work was fast paced.  Poor support for employment opportunity to temp workers.
good,"Fast paced, ever changing, and incredible things happening.  Tesla is a company that doesn't hold itself back, as soon as they have a new way to do something, they implement it sooner than possible. It makes for a stressful work experience, but once you accomplish the impossible, it's very rewarding."
good,Tesla has a great message behind the vehicles...but the company has poor management skills... They have racial individuals whom go for the less fortunate. At certain times they treat their employees like slaves. Not alot of time for ur 👪 or yourself. Causes stress!
good,"Line leads very unprofessional , our production line was always broke down when something went wrong supervisors and mine leads were hard to find  they were standing around talking at their Podium most of the shift stood around most of our shift and did not get our full breaks"
good,"No work life balance. Low some people get paid a lot more for the same position. It’s all but kissing to get ahead. Manager push, push, push and make you believe in Tesla’s mission in order to exploit you and overwork you. People were cool though, young crowd mostly. Large turnover."
good,Heb een vast contract maar wil een nieuw baan met een beter salaris.
good,"Mandatory overtime, poor communication, poor training.  Great product. Incredible benefits.  The culture is myopic on personnel cutthroat performance and lack of teamwork."
good,"My first manager was great but when they took us off his team, the new manager only gave the good leads to his favorites.  He also berated you when you didn't know something even though you were improperly trained.  Attrition is very high as the company continually loses money."
good,"Tesla is an amazing company and has great benefits. Overall, it is a very tough company to work for though, half the time middle-management is not aligned with executive management (Elon Musk) and it creates a hectic atmosphere. Half the time, there is no manager at all and you are left to create a process and hope that everyone sticks to it. There are no set hours and you are told you can have certain holidays off then they change it and make it to where you are open. No set hours, you could work 4 hours some days and 13 hours the next. Overall, a very hectic job but has its benefits such as driving the vehicles, learning how start-up companies run, and how to manage without leadership."
good,"Demanding, fast paced, energetic company. Always looking to push the limit and ask more of employees. Motivating environment to work in as everyone is focused on reaching the objective."
good,middle management is a joke and direct supervisors are week they protect them self's before there people........................................................
good,"Good things to learn technology and work practices wise for a fresher."
good,"Be prepared to work very hard for very little pay. The back end processes are not well refined and change constantly. Bonuses have extreme swings and are often unrealistic. Turn over is very high. Training is great on the products but overall extremely weak on business processes. Low level managers are great, mid and upper level management is completely detached from front lines. Work culture is good, definite sense of working for a higher purpose. The most enjoyable part of working for Tesla is working with customers who are just completely amazed with the technology. The hardest part of the job is in the background business processes are in absolute chaos. "
good,"Tesla is a very unbalance place to work. Hard work doesn't pay off there unless you know someone in a higher position. If you have an opinion that is frowned upon. I had a different manager every 5 to 6 months. Turn over was big there. After 4 years there of hard work and trying to help improve the store I was at, my contract wasn't renewed."
good,"Basically working as a solar city, is not that great. I generated leads at a home depot to turn into solar panel and system sales. Its not fun and its hard to sell solar in general in any market besides california or southwest."
good,"With little to no regard of the personnel making things happen on the line, personnel are passed over for being liked."
good,Tesla was a cool place to work.I was always amazed to see how parts of a car could turn into the final product on the assembly line.Working in the warehouse with some many robots was intriguing.
good,Do not work under only commission. It will mess you up It was a bit stressful working here. It was only commission pay. I would have preferred if they paid you a salary plus commission. Its hard to survive with only commission.
good,"Working for Tesla can be equally rewarding and challenging. Good place to start building a resume or a way to break into the field. Depending on where you work and what your role is, work/life balance."
good,Make alot of money but have no time to spend it. If you are a temp the likely of you getting fired for something petty is high. Not much job security.
good,Working at Tesla is extremely stressful and very high paced. You need to learn quickly. Management is willing to teach you only what you need to do. There are high false promises and additionally they will only allow you to work for their benefit.
good,"repetitious work within 2 hour periods while standing"
good,Tesla is a dynamic place to work but corporate culture and management can make the environment toxic. The Anti-Handbook Handbook that outlines their culture and values is inconsistent with that I experienced during my employment with the company.
good,"Tesla is a fun and upcoming company has great benefits as a single person this would be the job I would love to keep, with a family this is almost impossible to balance both. there is no life / job balance, it is all job and its expected."
good,"That motto is T E S L A, Takes Every Single Love Affair."
good,"Management constantly pushes for more from each individual which affects life balance. Ten-twelve-hour days are not uncommon, as are working weekends and holidays.  Management struggles to set sustainable goals.  Benefit package is somewhat below industry average."
good,"i learned how to interact with various of people in different time frames of the day, from making coffee or stocking up on needed items it was a pleasure working there"
good,"A good place to work, good pay, good benefits. Main downside is the amount of empty promises by management never seem to come to light. Just promises. If your a machinist on night shift, be prepared to run multiple machines by yourself with zero family life"
good,"The first 3 years were some of the toughest years at Tesla. There wasn't much support given to the associates, which made our jobs that much harder.  With that said, it was't all bad. It made us be creative and problem solvers on the go. I was fortunate to witness the impossible became possible many times. "
good,The one thing I can say about Tesla is that if you are persistent and adamant about it then you can gain a lot of knowledge and training through their courses
good,I watched 200 people get fired in one day and then they relocated me to Las Vegas and fired me. I am now living in Las Vegas desperate to get back to the Bay Area and better pay.
good,The management does not communicate with you about anything. They claim to give yearly and even quarterly reviews but they never get around to it. They change your job title and your responsibility without any compensation and like to blame it on the company still being in the start up stage. When other employees quit or get fire they don't hire and replace them they just expect you to take on that work load.
good,"Every day there is no telling what you are going to walk into, Your area might be clean, or it might be filled with random stuff scattered everywhere as well as trash. "
good,"Fun group of supervisors to work with, but there was no work - life balance, and I am not sure if upper management cares about their employees.  Really bad planning and requirements were always changing"
good,very hard to balance work and life style due to different shift schedule. working 3-4 days with 12 hour shift or working every other day is no fun schedule at all. you had to be at work 2 hours before your shift to be able to find a parking.
good,Management continued to decline while I worked there. No sign of getting any better. Opportunity for advancement was continuously dangled in front of associates only to be retracted due to internal politics. Reviews were never done so there was no guidance for how an employee could progress in the company.
good,"Started out seeming like it would be a promising job but after a couple months they started laying off, firing and demoting people due to lack of profit. I was told that i would be hired on almost immediately but there was a hiring freeze for months."
good,"Short cuts , poor culture , demands on employees are tremendously high and sometimes unsustainable. Direction and goals are all that matters, not people."
good,"I dont really want to write anything here . There should be an option to skip this , alas , there isnt so I shall meander on for a few more characters until i reach the minimum."
good,"Okay work environment and friendly co-workers. Repetitious work with no standardization, so injuries are common. Work improvement ideas get shot down and then later implemented later by someone else."
good,"Has a great mission, great products. Terrible job security, no clear communication on anything and it is always changing. "
good,Summary says it all. 2 and a half years of extremely stressful days where the weeks just fly by. Lot of pride in the work they do there but a very strong disconnect from executives to store level. Part of the doomy era of Tesla's promised 35k Model 3.
good,It is a great place to work if management and service had a clear goal and a plan to hit that goal. Managers likes to choose with in there circle of who gets what and who gets the boot from what i have seen.
good,working 6-7 days a week. how the cars are made and seeing the finished vehicles. working the 12 hour shift. the coworkers made it a fun work place. hoping to become a full time employee
good,Senior leadership does not know what true leadership is. Companies rapid growth has forced people into senior roles who have no business being there. People who actually want to be a part of Tesla have their enthusiasm crushed by senior leadership who frankly could care less about the company or the mission.
good,"12 hour shifts or more, 5 days a week are extremely grueling. Even more so when you are not properly compensated for your work performance and being a team player is claimed to be of such high a value to the work culture. Punctuality is key to the production business. However, I feel Tesla cares more for hitting numbers than job performance."
good,"Working at Tesla I learned how to do production control, shipping and receiving on the docks.. I learned how to manage a team who drove the tuggers and fork lifts using my resources to guide them."
good,"Very long hours with mandatory overtime every week, the work isnt hard but the coworkers and some of the Leads and Supervisors can make your job very difficult. There is little to no communication between Supervisors and Leads let alone between different departments and areas. Favortisim is a big thing for Supervisors and Leads as well, people who barely have any experience get promoted before those that have been there longer."
good,"Overall the money at Tesla is good and you work at least 40 hours a week, but things change every day and my supervisors would constantly threaten people with getting fired."
good,"Long hours and therefore had to balance personal life and work. Horrible communication between management and hourly employees. Can afford to be compensated more for the amount of work done however, benefits are great."
good,Rather not say anything against the company. Very fast paced. If you can make it at Tesla you cane make it anywhere. Cost of living is high in the area.
good,"Forced to learn and perform other department's processes, but no increase in salary. No job security. Advancement and promotion is based on who you know within the company. New hires are paid $3-$4 more than tenured employees."
good,A typical day at work could be stressful at times because there was a demand to meet quotas even when the parts needed were sometimes delayed. I learned to work with diverse cultures.The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy equipment. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with an awesome team.
good,"The job was actually very fun to learn and do.  Most of the workers were easy to work with, but the few that had personal issues often forced HR to have to come for visits and talk to the group instead of the people who were at fault for bringing down the team's morale. Management are either completely unaware of managing auto manufacturing or uneducated ladder climbers who drink alcohol and smoke weed together in the south lot parking for bonding purposes.  The hardest part of the job was working 12 hour shifts with 10 minute breaks and a 30 min. lunch to eat and use the rest room."
good,The expectation was to propel a company that preached scientific advancement without the proper information needed to succeed.  I would not recommend working in a sales position
good,"The company monitors quality and production VERY closely. If you are not comfortable keeping your head down and focusing on every detail of your work for your entire shift, you should look elsewhere. Pay can fluctuate wildly and volunteer overtime is usually available. Document Processing currently works on a 4-10 shift schedule. The 3 day weekend is awesome. There is something changing just about everyday which helps keep things fresh."
good,"You walk around a Home Depot for 40 hours a week talking to people about going solar. Most people don't want to be bothered, but sometimes you find someone who's willing to have someone over to their house to have the conversation."
good,"Harassment of all nature."
good,"While the process continued to evolve applying Lean Manufacturing, the safety aspect did little to change and the Management team did not respond to any of the concerns or suggestions to improve safety or process."
good,"lo mas importante es hablar el mismo idioma para comprenden los orden de trabajo...Ingles o Holandés."
good,Managing the movement and training of the production line. The hardest part of the job is the work life balance due to the hours required. This is as far I will openly review..
good,"Your schedule is never set, be prepared for random weekends added. Work hours vary too. Management wasnt that great. Depending on which department you're in, your experience could be different. If you're in production, finding a good supervisor is very hard."
good,"SolarCity/Tesla upper management tries to keep your moral up with the usual Ra-Ra Sessions. Moral is low since you're working in The Home Depot, breathing in dust, hawking customers in the isles, convincing them to sign up for a consultation. Quotas are attainable but you need to achieve 3 x's your quota to make any decent money. Management hovers, even when you're at the top of your group of peers. Your peers are your general support group. Best user-friendly Salesforce/CRM interface/system."
good,"Though a lack of organization, and a ""too big to fail"" culture, this would be a good experience for the entry level engineer.  Production, though un organized, is unique, and a worthwhile experience."
good,"Give your life to the mission and they will drain you clean. 6 day work weeks for 1 year straight up until the very day they decide to let you go. With little training and notice, you are expected to stay agile and represent the company's daily shifts in business strategy."
good,"On sub assembly- they would rather have you behave like a robot- don’t be sick, don’t talk, do everything the exact same way everyday, don’t look for other positions."
good,"Most warehouses elsewhere in the country aren't this bad, but the Pittsburgh warehouse is one of the worst to work at in the country. "
good,"Very poor at management / Supervisors Harassment "
good,Wouldn’t recommend working here. Not balanced whatsoever. It did have good benefits but at the end of the day it’s not somewhere I’d ideally see myself in the future.
good,Make the right friends in the right places otherwise encounter roadblock after roadblock. Reach out and branch out and be careful with whom you befriend due to the cutthroat nature that is Tesla culture.
good,"Great health benefits, no work life balance, tough to take vacation days as needed, lots of transition in the company, but overall great mission and great work."
good,"Tesla is a very chaotic environment. Management is weak and does not support your goals or ambitions with career growth. In this role, you are on call 24/7 and the job is very demanding at 15+ hours per day. Would not recommend if you want a life and growth opportunity."
good,"I've been wth the company for some years now and it's not bad. It's all about how you precieve  things. Basically what you put in, you will get out.  It pays well in the Long run"
good,"very innovative company but there is no job work/ life balance what so ever. Benefits are great, people are intelligent. If you don't mind working long hours, you will be just fine here."
good,"Management here is so unprofessional "
good,"Benefits are really good at tesla, the overall pay could be better based off what they ask of you as you attempt to move up in the company. If you get on managements bad side your chances of advancement are pretty much done. There is a tendency to use workers for multiple jobs to push cost savings regardless of safety. Expect people to cover multiple areas as in supervisors overseeing multiple areas, which then causes leads to have to cover part of the supervisors job if they cannot keep up with all issues occurring. There is no real equal opportunity towards moving up they already know who they want long before they post the position."
good,"on average 10-12 hour days. not allowed to sit except on brakes. management were interested in acheaving their production goals only. the people I worked with were good solid blue collor types.the hardest part of the job was the toll on my back, knees and feet. most enjoyable part of the job was the brotherhood with the other workers."
good,"no respect for employees, no recognition, no work life balance.  Raises are determined unfairly, no standards for giving hard working individuals raises."
good,"- Rapid fast pace environment"
good,"A lot of work, little room for advancement despite everyone saying its easy to move around. The attitude of management is get it done, even when it is not possible. No questions asked."
good,"My daily duties at Tesla Motors involves loading and unloading trucks, customer service , shipping and receiving of Production Automotive Vehicle Parts for building of the Tesla Model S. Inputting of all RMA'S , Bills Of Lading, SLI'S into a Sap Gui Management System. This is for updating of Physical Inventory received and inputted into a physical MES System. Implemented is Quality Control , Inspection information for Production Engineers to view before the actual manufacturing of vehicles takes place."
good,"As one of the most talked about and in focus companies, from the inside it is a very difficult work environment. They expect a tremendous amount of dedication and time, without much in the way of incentives or compensation. There is very little opportunity for internal advancement. Tesla is a small company in a large company's body."
good,The shifts are 12 hours. The parking is terrible. Most people get there hours early just to get a parking spot. It's absolutely ridiculous. The shuttles arrive very early and there is nowhere comfortable for people to wait until their shift begins. I live locally and don't have this problem but I really feel bad for the people that do. It's kind of inhumane.
good,"The stories of the quarter end madness are correct.  Groups of new hires were brought in for the year end rush, and let go after a two week assignment.  The seasonal and permanent employees were great people.  Mostly young, diverse and very friendly.  The management was OK.  They were friendly and positive, but clearly dismissive of most concerns other than volume, and sometimes customer satisfaction.  They would tell you want you wanted to hear in order to push the volume need to meet their sales goals. The attitude is that targets must be hit regardless of sacrificing quality.  "
good,"I worked at Dumbarton Circle right before they closed down the campus. Place was nice, loved the cafeteria.  Good coffee and loved the fruit infused water. And they had a cafe & breakfast bar."
good,"Exciting tech savvy endless possibilities. Great people, good pay benefits decent. OT a must"
good,"Tesla is a great place to work if you are in the ideal role.  The issue is that Tesla has grown so quickly, it's impossible to ensure the culture is upheld, so the things I valued most at hire, became non-existent as my tenure grew along with the company."
good,"Power Train and Module Close was great but outside in the tent wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy Supervisors was awesome upstairs. Outside in the tents the only concerns was producing cars. Lack of computers to do Tesla things, microwave to heat up foods and the most important worker's are not afforded the same knowledge are luxuries as other in the Plant.  Lack of knowledge about levelling up and wage increase was staggering. Employees not even given evaluations for this was just mind boggling"
good,The people that work there are friendly. Micromanagement is huge. We are severely understaffed and work nonstop. The pay is definelty not enough for the amount of work.
good,The pay is good if you live an hour+ away. Commute sucks. Moral sucks. But I don't quit because the pay me more now after 7 years than anyone else would starting somewhere new. My skills are Tesla specific. And now I'm stuck.
good,"Working with Tesla can be like the wild wild west - so much change with management, turnover, makes finding hierarchies and decision making troublesome. Accountability can be lacking at times"
good,"When I joined SolarCity, many of the company’s shortcomings were well known & they were working to change and make improvements.  When Tesla took over management of the solar PV business they quickly began changing the sales business model. Tesla decimated the SC sales staff (laying off 80-90%) & brought all of the solar sales into the auto sales locations. As a result, Tesla quickly dropped to 3rd in residential sales & continues to slide!"
good,"A Garbage supervisor "
good,Enjoyable place to work. The line I worked on still needed automation to help facilitate a more productive output .  The unexpected yet sometimes mandatory overtime would be announced twords the end of a work shift.  Working the 3rd shift at times we would not be able to catch the returning bus from soccer to freemont and would have to wait an additional hour at times in order to catch a bus home from Fremont
good,It's an ok place to work if you're  on in crowd with the right people. Most of management does fairly well at listening to your concerns and attempting to help an employee.  However not all managers act on concerns for their employees.
good,"no es la empresa que esperaba ya que esperaba avanzar de forma profecional. la empresa es muy problematica, el trabajo es facil pero por todo buscan culpables y no soluciones,"
good,"Good place to start your career and learn. Tesla has alot of room for growth, but alot of extreme work conditions and long hours away from home and family. I still currently work there, but i am looking for more opportunties."
good,"A good company to start in specialy if you are young and want to have a good start experience."
good,"fast paced, operating like a start up company"
good,"As the title would suggest, Tesla is a stressful place to work, where you are often putting in 50-60 hours a week in a fast paced environment. The work/life balance is nonexistent, but the people you spend all your time with are good people and I love the ""family"" I made there. I loved the feeling of working in a place where you are helping to change the world, but the grueling demands of quarterly delivery numbers quickly drain your soul."
good,"A typical day often relies on root cause and corrective action to reduce the amount of quality defects that make it downstream. Everyday we learn something new and tackle those issues in intuitive ways, such as completely removing unnecessary process steps to increase yield and push our production goals higher."
good,"inspiring, good for the environment, cutting edge, fast paced, long hours, good pay, lots to learn, very good benefits, innovative, 12 hr shift, many break times,"
good,"Promotions are given constantly maybe because of high turnover rate and constant lay-offs.You work really hard to achieve your promotion so that's good, but that leads to cons as well because new managers and leads come from these fast promotions and don't have a clue how to manage a factory or deal with peoples' concerns. Other than that, the pay was good and the free drinks was good."
good,12 hours doing repetitive motion for no chance to enjoy the pay. it is exhausting and not everyone can handle it.  always felt worn down and exhausted
good,the culture with regular hourly associates was great. Management team was always secretive to minor information. i loved working around the people all over the company
good,"Tesla asks if you're okay with overtime but you don't realize you're giving up all your personal time. As a service advisor, you start your day writing tickets and interacting with customers. Throughout the day, you need to keep up with updating customers three times a day while stuck on the drive. Management sets expectations that aren't feasible and focus on the customer service index that you don't always have control over (the customers not filling out the survey or deleting them). It was difficult to balance the work load and a personal life with the amount of time it takes to keep customers in the loop."
good,"If you're young and have either no experience (production) or little experience (management), then this is the place to be. If you're experienced, however, this is not the place that will further develop and promote you. "
good,"Day by day is a fast-paced work. "
good,"worked 10 to 12 hrs a day, never knew when we were leaving each day. Would hear 5 to 10 min before we were being let go for the day, also safety was not a priority numbers were, many employees complained of pain, but they would make you clock out and go see onsite nurse"
good,"Tesla is always pushing the envelope and ultimately improving the industry, the environment, and the world. Fun to work there as long as you have the willingness to commit your like to it,"
good,"I am the liaison between Tesla Plastics department and its suppliers. Auditing plastic departments injection mold and sub-assembly  process. investigating parts with issues and trending problems with in the department and suppliers parts. Weekly dimensional measurements on parts molded in house. operating measuring tools like Calipers, laser gauge, micrometer, and spc gauge."
good,"I have been here long enough to see a lot of changes. I am currently a lead at Tesla and things at this current moment are horrible. Management knows significantly less than even some associates, people getting tossed into depts without request to total opposite shifts and if you tell them about your personal situation as to why a sudden move wouldn't work...their response is ""it's about the business"". Some depts are actually ""scheduled"" SIX 12 HOUR SHIFTS PER WEEK. That is ridiculous. My current dept had a 5:30am to 3:30pm shift which has now changed to 5:30 am to ""we aren't sure what time we'll be done"". Pay is good, but definitely not good enough for what we do. Tesla might be good in a couple years, but not right now."
good,"Working way out there on weekends, holidays,and for that kind of money,is not worth my time. A lot was promised during orientation, but not much was true. They like to hold back on what shift group you will be assigned, until you are there."
good,Tesla is a no joke company. You earn every dollar you are paid. Very disciplined in quality and production numbers. You need to make daily targets or you get a bad review which means no promotion.
good,A typical day working at Tesla was building cars putting them together with the help of machines. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to put a car together piece by piece from ground up.
good,"Underpaid in one of the most expensive regions in the world."
good,"the role is to educate, inspire and skillfully guide potential customers by  addressing customers’ questions and meeting sales quotas of energy products. it's a fast pace environment which is mainly dependant on how many solded job ultimately getting fully installed."
good,"the money is there especially for younger people just starting to work."
good,Be on time don’t use phone at work always try to be on time and no calling off. Very hard to get leveled up or get advanced. Scheduling is not the best.
good,"Once you start there everything else stops. You will barely have time for yourself anymore let alone anybody else. People get burnt out fast. They refuse to get a 3rd shift and instead have 2- 12 hour shifts. Workers sometimes work 6 days a week for 12 hours a day! Management sucks! Nobody knows what they're doing, you have people telling leads what to do because the leads don't know what to do themselves. Supervisors pointing fingers like its anybodys fault. Most people are really nice though and will actually care for you, people will greet you and stuff so that's cool. Benefits are through the roof, best thing about this company. When they want to take care of you they will. You practically get every benefit imagined. Money was decent as well. Hardest parts are the schedules, the work itself is easy, just the long days get to everyone."
good,"Tesla is an OK place to work. Good part is they make each person responsible which grooms one to prove his/her talent and skills. Bad part is there is no work/life balance and management does not have a certain direction, Decisions keep changing from top management on daily basis,"
good,"When Tesla was getting started the work environment was very team oriented and everyone worked together.  Now that the company has grown tremendously, there are duplicating of responsibilities and less team work.  Every area is out for themselves and do not work well as a whole."
good,"Not there long enough to answer this question.  I was a contract employee for 5-6 weeks.  Therefore, not enough time invested to answer theses questions fairly,"
good,Wish the company had a more supportive work environment and could invest in better resourcing all teams to do their work well and with quality. Management encouraged rushing and low-quality work.
good,"Cut-throat environment, very unsafe factory, no room for advancement, Work you to the bone with no reward only reward friends. horrible hours 430 pm - 430 am, no real breaks, no meetings with management."
good,"Working for Tesla was a great experience. Great ideas for the future world. Work wise, a bit delayed or slow in progression. Departments lacked communication between each other, to best help the customer, but each department did do their best in their abilities. Maybe a training in better communication might help, or would at least put every department on the same level."
good,Telsa is a very fast paced environment where you are constantly working throughout the day. Management is usually never there to help you. I did learn about finances related to the auto-mobile field.
good,"Management could be better and ""Leveling up"" should be mandatory every 6 months. It seems that it is very hard for my co-workers to level up, especially since they have been at Tesla for quite some time (1-4 years and still no raise)."
good,The mission and colleagues make this a great place to work.  The autonomy and opportunity for innovative work is there.  Very little support is given to do your job and tools are sub-par. Environment is chaotic and not efficient - surprising for a company of this caliber. Training is non-existent.  Workload is unrealistic.  Performance is not considered for employment decisions.  High level is out of touch with individuals doing the work.  Pockets of the company need serious help with Diversity - hiring tends to favor white millennials.
good,"Great company, amazing benefits and perks, but deceptive about compensation. Workplace culture is fun and relaxed for a call center vibe. Co-workers are fun and management is made up of great people, but company lacks structure and effective planning, which they like to describe as being ""scrappy"" to appeal to society when they're flat out disorganized."
good,I have been stressing on losing my job due to cuts.  The CEO has changed this company so much and it has been for the worse.  They want you to work harder yet they didn't give any raises this year.
good,It takes extreme dedication and passion to walk through those doors everyday. Working for Tesla for the past 2 years has been the most challenging but rewarding experience of my life. I would recommend interning at Tesla or working part time to gain experience; but not for full time.
good,"People I work with are great, but you work too many hours. If your looking for a 40 hour work week. You will not find it here. But if you want the overtime, this place is the job you'll love."
good,"Working at Tesla means being very flexible and open to having your job change on a daily basis. One thing that needs to change there is having a clear leveling system for employees to reach for. The management is good but do not have a lot of experience I have found. "
good,Very High Paced work environment with lots of different positions available all range from production assembly line to engineering quality control and even great mgmt advancement Opportunities.
good,Tesla is a company with a potentially bright future. However after 3.5 years at the company I have not seen enough opportunity for advancement to better myself or my family.
good,Typical day would be standing at your station and doing assembly line work which repetitive. Long hours with lots of overtime. Work week consist of 6-7 day work week.
good,"- a typical day at work can range from 7 hours up to 12 hours."
good,"Family oriented employees, fun events held occasionally, although they could work alot more on their management and communication."
good,"Empresa boa para aprendizado e ganhar experiência, porém não possui estabilidade, vive muitos altos e baixos."
good,"Things have changed at Tesla over the past few years. Compensation, particularly for sales, has been cut dramatically. I loved the culture. But couldn't really advise someone to work there in a sales role based on my experience prior to leaving. Good news for the company - me saying this doesn't hurt them. They don't need sales people. And this is made obvious by how their roles are treated."
good,"You just be prepared to give up everything else in your life in order to satisfy Tesla - if you don’t, you’ll be consigned to the ‘not working hard enough’ category. Working 70 hours + a week, massive turnover of staff, dictatorship at the top telling you to achieve impossible things to name a few. Don’t even think about leaving on time during quarter end, and don’t mention the poor build quality of the cars, just fix them but you’ll be measured on how many cars come in for fixing. Nothing will be great, and senior management are under pressure to get results so will push you to get them. If you do as you’re told and you suck up, you’ll get a promotion and/or payrise. Disagree and you’ll be out in a matter of months. Sickness and stress is high, standards impossible to reach. The company is aiming way too high and is built on rocky foundations, with huge debts and liabilities meaning recruitment freezes are common whilst money’s wasted elsewhere. Think hard before joining."
good,This company is on the cutting edge with innovation and changing the world but you need to be willing to devote all your time into doing so. Also don't expect any immediate promotions as it's very difficult to climb the latter.
good,Product advancement and the mission statement are the main focus. Work life balance is so so... Coworkers are nice and you will learn a lot working here.
good,"Poor management, discrimination towards older workers, production cost extremely high due to poor work ethics blame us older workers for slowing down production, unfair attendance policy, supervisors pick and chooses who gets points on a point system, company lacks communication, very unorganized, waist more time walking back and forth finding a line or machines that run."
good,"Tesla was very interesting good money, laid back culture, management are dicks they show lots of favoritism if you have a family you will never get to spend time with them anymore especially with kids you will be exhausted all the time, they have good food trucks but the work in some departments are really manual labor, learn as much as you can as fast as you can the more you know the more money you will make, reviews and bonuses are based on this, stay committed in your relationships TESLA break up happy homes everyone have work relationships there! EVERYONE but over all the benefits and pay are worth it, a temporary fix if your in debt, they always offering overtime!"
good,Assisting customers with scheduling appointments and gathering information needed to ensure the correct parts were ordered and available at the time of their appointment. Ordering the needed parts and completing remote diagnoses to ensure the issue was easily resolved at the time of appointment. Completing remote fixes over the air for any firmware related issues that were capable of being fixed without a physical appointment with the vehicle. Followup calls with customers to ensure their concerns were met and they were satisfied with their service visit. Heavy inbound/outbound/walk in conversations with customers. Emphasis on customer education and satisfaction with their overall Tesla experience.
good,promised way to many things that never came true over time. Promising people if they move to their location they would receive great benefits that never came.
good,"They train you properly in the right time ."
good,"The culture at Tesla is one of improvisation at all times. Everyone seems to be improvising and there doesn't seem to be set standard operating procedure to general day to day management. From day one, everyone was confused as to do with the new hires (me). Training was quick and confusing. I don't recall anyone from management taking the time to simply introduce themselves or even say hello. However the company pays very well and provides excellent benefits."
good,"The factory was a really fun place to work at but it’s operating at a really fast pace, not everyone can handle the pressure or have ability to keep up with speed. Management have a lot of room to improve there."
good,"Tesla pays very well, and the hours were great. i however was going to school full-time and had absolutely no time for anything besides work and school. Barely had time for sleep most days, however, overall a decent company."
good,The company has a lot going for it and it has a fantastic product. Common for most newer companies breaking through into an established industry Tesla has a lot of room to grow.
good,At Tesla you might end up moving up into management or you may work the same job for years and years with no raises. Depends on who you are NOT how hard you work. You never know if you're going to get a Holiday off until the day before so good luck planning anything and you may be laid off at a moments notice. It's very unstable and the management is extremely poor due to the fact that you are elevated for who you know and NOT what you can do. It breeds a very poor working environment.
good,It was a good environment good workers but unprofessional. Typical warehouse tho with lots of equipment. To bad they shutdown this location so early..
good,"Not a bad place to be working compared to most, but there were many policy changes, procedure changes, management changes and so on which created complexity and frustration. Then you were expected to always be happy about what changed, even if the outcome was a problem for you. Team morale varied by location, but constant changes didn't leave much room for overall happiness. Career growth is also lacking for the most part, with wage increases being far and few between."
good,"Tesla promises a lot. When you're onboarded they talk about the fast-paced work environment, the scrappy, go-getem attitudes and the meritocracy it hopes to promote."
good,"Very stressful especially working with people that have no sense of urgency, lazy, careless, and bad work ethic. Bad managements, Long hours, short breaks, bad communication from the leads and supervisor, lazy, and lack of knowledge from the leads and the supervisors."
good,"Tesla lacks work-life balance. Any job where you are forced to sit in front of a computer and answer the phone to take on other people's problems is not worth it."
good,"Poor leadership, individuals that are put in place to lead and supervise are not educated enough to be placed in such position(s).  There is NO loyalty....people are thrown under the bus often to get ahead."
good,Job was stressful. Constant change of procedures made it hard to work to get things done. Company over promises what it cannot deliver. Workers are over worked and are expected to work extensive hours.
good,Poor management and lack of planning for end of quarter deadlines to meet sales and delivery quotas. Forced to work seven days a week and Holidays during the last month of each quarter to meet target goals.
good,"They need people who are willing to perform at 110% all the time. Supervisors have no direct control over pay or promotions. Benefits take 4 years to fully vest, so that nice little 16k performance bonus won't matter or get paid to you when they fire you a few months later"
good,"12 plus hours day 3 to 4 days a week"
good,"Tesla is a very stressful place to work. Work life balance is nearly impossible, since workdays can be 10+ hours a day. Job security is nonexistent. Layoffs can be right around the corner and cut your career short. Pay is okay, overtime is what makes your paycheck. Benefits are great, very cheap paycheck to paycheck. I would recommend this job to someone with no commitments (no family, no spouse) because it's so hard to balance everything due to the crazy hours. All the people are pleasant to work with, some managers can be stressed due to the fast paced environment so it can be hard to approach them. Though you have to be on all the managers' good sides because otherwise you will not advance in the company. If you stick with the company, many doors will open for you, if you are lucky."
good,"The mission is great. It is definitely what drives the company. They are pushing so much change to stay profitable. It is management's only focus. With constant layoffs every quarter, there can be a lot of tension in the workplace"
good,"Not Stable company, layoff happen frequently every 5-6 months, so please don't join as FTE or contractor if you are family guy. People are nice here but everyone are overloaded. Join here if you don't have any project."
good,"Working at Tesla involves long hours and high output. At all times. Roles generally take on responsibilities outside the job description for that particular role, so being agile is a must. Change is constant, being adaptable is necessary."
good,Decent starter gig ($15/hr) with no future and lack of job security. My advice? Work hard to market yourself. I am sure you can find better with your Bachelors.
good,"Working hour is too long, lack of sleep, long standing, can't sit down, hot, sweaty, no parking, mass factory, no life, tired and injured, not for older age."
good,"Everything is a rush at Tesla, You will frequently see very high up people running around frantically towards the end of a quarter including the CEO because it is a must we hit the production numbers. They will call on additional production days with only a few days notice cutting in to your weekends... You need to be fast, punctual and precise. If you manage to survive, they will try to take care of you."
good,In the race to get electric vehicles onto the market Tesla has made a major bet in Nevada at the gigafactory employing thousands of people on a 24 /7 basis.Fast paced and exciting but long hours and long commute
good,In the race to get electric vehicles onto the market Tesla has made a major bet in Nevada at the gigafactory employing thousands of people on a 24 /7 basis.Fast paced and exciting but long hours and long commute
good,You work hard for a company you believe in and want to succeed. Long hours goes by quick with the amount of work you have to perform. Turnover rate for managers are high due to layoffs and being terminated. Processes constantly change due to upper management change and whose in charge during that time. Job security is low.
good,"At Tesla, The Mission comes before all: Before personal / Family needs, before future planning needs, and even before fair compensation needs."
good,The Solar City side of Tesla is poorly managed. Sales people have to be available day and night. Lots of promises are made to customers that are not fulfilled.
good,Great pay but no time to your self most people work five 12hr shifts in a row plus and mandatory over time calls. Good benefits better than most places I've worked. But you get worn out easily with thier shcedual.
good,Management culture is so driven with short term results that technical debt incurred is a big burden on senior technical folks here. Management needs to provide the layers and space for addressing these with replacements or improvements.
good,"12 hour days for quality control"
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Tesla was being challenged each day to resolve issues with either new or legacy technology . It pushes one to be resourceful in finding solutions to return a system to normal production, and to minimize potential downtime."
good,"Very demanding work environment. Excellence is a passing grade at Tesla.  Unfortunately I was abruptly laid off along with 12-14 other co-workers. I did everything they ever asked of me and with no warning whatsoever I was let go.  The severance package was ok but I put my heart and soul into doing my job well and was rewarded with an escort out of the building.  I guess that is how it is working for a company that hasn't turned a profit in 15 years.  To sum it up, I felt lied to. "
good,"Productive, fast-paced, and cut-throat. I learned a lot through the business as well as myself because I participated in what helped shape the current platform. I did more than my current role and had worked with so many teams in improving our systems for long hours. What's unfortunate was always the headcount in which the amount of work that was assigned did not compensate for the number of people we had."
good,its not for older adults work environment is more for the younger adults. you have to be certified in all fields which i didn't like i was cool right where i was.
good,Don't work here save your time and effort and use it somewhere that will appreciate it. Unless of course you say yes to everything and cannot deliver on your promises anyways
good,"the job security there not stable. the pay was ok, it could have been more for the type of work we were doing. there wasn't to much advancement with the company. the staff was not polite."
good,Lot of disorder An chaos  to many things not working an no stability  in shift . Shift may  change at any moment An you may never know  when the weekend is required to work until last minute
good,Great place to work if you enjoy a fast paced job. There is rarely a day when you can find parking. Not much of a home work life balance. To much top heavy management. Some depts are allowing people to drive Tesla's home everyday while others have to try for a lottery to be able to get a car for a weekend.
good,"No rhyme not reason, "
good,het is een nieuw bedrijf waar nog veel aan moest gebeuren dat zal in de loop der jaren wel gaan veranden.
good,The work is easy but the balance between work and personal life is tough when you get placed on graveyard shift. They wont always work around your schedule so if you're placed on graveyard you're basically stuck there.
good,management in a facility exceeding 4000+ employees still uses extreme favoritism to promote and raise salaries. No set review process.Rules only apply when supervisors care to act upon
good,"If you like saving the world full time, great company.  If you like no work life balance, great company.  If you like great benefits, sans a 401K that matches, great company. Very on / off company. One minute you are ramping up at lightspeed and literally, the next day everything is on hold including the offers you were just made during your days off."
good,"Esta empresa de venta de celulares fue fundada como empresa virtual, después de varios años se decidió salir de sector, cerrarla y posteriormente buscar un empleo, capitalizarme y posteriormente tener un negocio complementario."
good,"Prefiero no hacer valoraciones en cuanto a la gestión propia de la empresa, me quedo con la experiencia que gane al trabajar en un ambiente muchísimo mas joven que yo, que me aporto dinamismo y otros enfoques de ver todo en genera."
good,"Great place to work. they work you really hard, but overall it pays the bills. So if you ready to work long hours then this is the place for you . and they have free cereal"
good,tesla is a great company if they can treat manufactory workers with more dignity and respect.  they are great because of the overall vision however they could not keep up production therefore they need to force their workers like slaves.
good,"You must believe in the company for what it's doing and where it's going. They will provide you with the skills and training needed to do your job. No job is hard to do, so don't be intimidated. But just be prepared to have the company be your 2nd home and to always be bringing work home with you. You must love what you do in order to survive and stay sane with the company and know your making a difference to Mother Earth."
good,Tesla is a fast paced place. That's what I loved about it.  Always someone running around with something that should have been completed yesterday.  It was an ever-changing environment.  The downside of such a workplace is you are never off the clock and not compensated well for your time...you make these sacrifices to your personal life because 'it's Tesla.'  That mantra gets old after about a year and the time and energy the company expects from you begins to wear you down.
good,"grote diversiteit werkzaamheden, veel mechanische reparaties boeiende omgeving."
good,"•	Prepare samples and reagents for testing according to laboratory policies"
good,"Such a fun place to work while doing our jobs safely and accurately. "
good,"The best work ethics I have ever seen. Most people would push for getting things done and are not very political. Work-life balance is poor (in Body in White at least), management would push for quick return but undermine sustainability of employees. Burned out employees will only stay for a year or two max. Great learning opportunity for employees, but because of the non-sustainable attitude, most employees would not last long."
good,"Great part time job as a Product Specialist. About to be a college grad however, and prospects for mobility within the company are limited and not well articulated."
good,"if you or anyone you know is trying to work for Tesla PLEASE RETHINK but if you still thinking about it just be prepare for long work hours, no work-life balance and no job security but you don't have to take my word for it"
good,what i like about stangenes was i learned alot from engineers especially from my boss learn about components pcba and also became a good leadership.
good,As a Troubleshooter i worked 13 hours a day 7 days a week in temperatures that no one should be working in. I replace Cables and Geo-phones when they are broke and they need to be changed out in a quick period of time cause usually they are waiting on it to continue receiving data. I usually work alone and on my last job i worked the night shift where everything is alot harder to do where u barely have light and getting around on a Quad or Snowmobile is more difficult.
good,"Working for Tesla was okay they offer great medical, dental and vision benefits. I learned a lot about the vehicle and how to work on it and how they operate"
good,Typical day is ok at first then tiring towards the end. Breaks aren’t long enough. Learned how to build piece of a car under two minutes and under pressure. Management is okay. Need to step it up HR. Work culture is very diverse. Hardest part of job is staying up for 12 hr shifts they provide. Most enjoyable part is leaving and having 3-4 days off.
good,"If you are in HR, logistics, engineering, IT, software, or any other tech job on the carpet area, life is not bad. You work mon-fri, 8 ish to 5 ish"
good,"Be ready for the challenge of shifting focus, rapidly changing / evolving process and a dynamic that demands devotion to the mission! Not for everybody but what a ride!!"
good,"Awesome to work at initially but can burn out easily. You’ll never run out of work to do but it can easily get repetitive. You must seek challenges at times, not always room for advancement."
good,"12 hour shifts, the days can by quick or slow depending on where they put you, not a lot of communications between shifts makes mornings kinda hectic."
good,"Good learning experience as an intern"
good,"I would work there again if I ever move back to USA. Great company and great people working their, a healthy culture of futuristic objectives and team work."
good,"Managers can widely depend, I am fortunate with mine.  Culture is working hard, and a lot.  Overtime can be mandatory.  Prepare to work a lot, with random shut downs"
good,don't get too firmly planted - they may just shut your half of the company down. Very pushy sales advice with completely unfair expectations of how to achieve more sales. unwilling to admit that location made a MASSIVE difference in how well we were able to sell tesla solar.
good,"The hours are quite long, they don't really accommodate employee's schedule and can frequently change form one week to the next regardless of employees availability. It can be a great place to advance and learn depending on what department you're located."
good,Its super fast pace work environment. The vehicle is fun to work on.  Working on High Voltage Battery packs on daily. Learned many different aspects of Electric vehicles. Work place culture for the most part was good. Consistent overtime was tough on relationships. I enjoyed the challanges.
good,Great opportunity to learn new skills and refresh your knowledge on company expectations. This company is up and coming with its solar panels in which I had the opportunity to be a part of something great.
good,Well paid but if you live in the central valley its a long commute they do offer transportation but sometimes they are no reliable for example I worked night shift and I would get off from work around three in the morning and the shuttle didn't arrive till 6 in the morning
good,no comment i have nothing to say really i lked the job when i first started but now i need something else. i would recommend the job to others that live close and No kids
good,Tesla has a great AWS schedule where you dont have to work more than 3 days and off every other two days of work. OT is optional and mandatory. Great benefits.
good,Working here at first was great a year ago. You do the same thing over and over and over and over AND OVER! If you don’t mind that then it’s all for you but depending on what you do. As a material handler you generally do a lot of walking. As a production associate you tend to stand in the same area generally speaking. I had a great supervisor at first and then when I switch my position and shift to change it up my supervisor was awful and I felt like they had no experience in the past. It’s really luck of the draw. You get paid pretty well and the benefits are great but other than that the job personally sucks after so long. Also literally ANYONE can work here you can have face tats crazy hair whatever they don’t care you will get hired.
good,I was getting burned out and learned how to work under heavy stress in a fast-paced environment. There was a strange work vibe that encouraged communication gaps.
good,"First position was to sale solar @ Home Depot with Tesla (Field Energy Specialist"
good,"I had amazing leaders and coworkers by my side at this establishment. Although the work life balance is non existent, the benefits and compensation plan were great for the time being."
good,"Good learning experience, met a lot of great and passionate people. They tend to dispose of you as soon as they don't need you anymore because they are still a company looking to cut costs at every corner."
good,The management needs an active positive attitude to help the employees do a better performance. The supervisor must express what is needed to be done to the worker.
good,"Days are busy trying to meet production goals, tough is all the hours, learned a great deal about people management morell is low due to everyone wants more pay."
good,Upper management shows favoritism over hard work for advancement within. All leads do nothing but point fingers and take credit for others' hard work. They constantly cut days off of you shift.
good,No review. If one is interested they need to come and experience Tesla for themselves and draw there own opinion. I am very happy I've been able to enjoy my professional journey with Tesla.
good,"hard work and there is no relevant to your previous job experience, and at my present job there is no proper health protection especially air circulating inside the building work place."
good,My job consist of placing two aluminum car parts to a fixture for a robot to come and weld them together. I have to check all studs and make sure that they are all seated in the the whole. I work about 70 hours a week. Monday-Sunday
good,"No a lot of pressure, space to do your work, but no where to go. Management only concerned with Sales and recruiting staff. Those who whine more get more; those who whine less get less."
good,Young and immature management.  Commission structure always changing.  Management is more concerned about reports than helping employees succeed.  Pretty much all leads are self generated and company will not reimburse for expenses you incur to generate those leads.
good,I am a believer in innovation and vision which Tesla has . The founders are more visionary but not yet the best businessmen but in a culture of making things happen the bottom line is not always the driving force.
good,"The mission is exciting, but the hard work put in to the company was subject to Elon's moods and ego. No room for growth, enhancement. Its about Elon."
good,"For the most part I enjoyed my employment at Tesla.  Most of the people are friendly and it starts to feel like one big family."
good,"Fast paced working environment, set to change the world!! Tesla has a plan to help the environment and we work to being that idea to life by getting solar power to the customers."
good,"Very fun learning the energy industry, overall the company had to much overhead so my position was eliminated in the downsizing. I believe that solar energy is the way of the future but its going to be done by small companies with low overhead; as the cost of the systems continue to decline as the technology gets better."
good,"Typical workday for management is at least 14hrs. You will be pushed mentally to think outside the box to resolve all issues, and several opportunities for working together as a team. The senior management micro-manages far more than they assist in obstacle clearing which leads to confusion and low morale of the workforce. Employees come in ready to work hard, and know that the world is being changed for the better everyday. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the excessive negativity of the senior leadership if numbers aren't made, rather than seeking to fix the problems (too much focus on people, not enough focus on process/equipment). Most enjoyable part of the day is knowing that everyday is another day history is being made!"
good,"Very tight Schedule."
good,"-Poor management"
good,"The manager I had, has never managed any one before and it was obvious. She was very disrespectful and ""playful"" as she thought. Not once was she motivating or even helpful in my role. She was often unavailable and always responded with "" should of learned that in training"" and instead of helping continued to repeat that. Typically a problem that could of been answered in a couple words only taking seconds. Always turned into reaching out to other employees. "
good,"I joined the Tesla work force because I believe in the company mission to move the world to sustainable energy, electric vehicles and the potential of EV cars. It is a young company that does not pay well and believes in working hard and long. Poor work life balance ethics. You are given minimal training and expected to figure out your job quickly and efficiently. Most employees are very smart and skilled at this company and last if they learn to reach out to others outside of their department."
good,"I was hired to work with an experienced manager whom I collaborated well with only to have them transfer out and be replaced with someone with very poor management skills and ZERO industry experience before my first day. Management would pit the CES team against each other in order to gain information about opinion on the management team. Store was constantly under staffed, and the store manager would leave, during the holidays none the less, by 3 p.m. (we were open until 10pm). 2-3 CES team members would have to handle a showroom with 30-50 customers in it at any given time during the bust evening hours. I was also on-boarded with the guise that certain easily accessible promotions would yield $2-$3 per hour raises only to find they yielded zero raise. I wanted to be apart of Tesla and grow with them but the worst management I've seen and being lied to about potential pay means I had to cut my experience with them short."
good,they do not have enough skilled people so work load for the few people is to much and will burn you way out. we only have 1 level 3 tech per shift and the people do not want to level up or learn the minimum to get by and leaves you stretched thin
good,"The experience is great with all the different sub-areas you get to witness. From the wheels to the battery, all have a detailed sub-area that are delegated to a particular group of employees. That was great for me because I moved around."
good,"Didn't know who my manager even was for 2 weeks, Wasn't able to actually speak to my manager for more than a few minutes at a time. when a minor injury occurred it took 2 hours to find a manager that could actually fill out the injury form, the form itself only took around a minute. Managers are overwhelmed, employee issues won't get fixed unless the manager likes you, if not you're screwed. If your commute is any more than 30-45 minutes you might as well resign yourself to work, shower, and food being quite literally the only things you do in a work day. While the days off are nice, they don't really feel like enough to recover and catch up. Oh and three 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute break for a 12h day is pretty brutal."
good,it was good experience i learn a lot of different ways to use power tools and learned how to weld metals together over all i got a lot of new skills working at tesla
good,"it is a new company and have hired many in a short time, many from out of the area and trying to make a name for themselves and do anything it takes to stay ahead of others. can be a great place but also can be a very hard environment to be in. they have wonderful products and I was very proud to be a part of that. but the culture isn't as nice."
good,Thought it was the golden ticket and realized that the new supervisors and leads didn't know anything about production or even machine repair or calibration or anything that was needed for the job.
good,"From working with solar city to transitioning to tesla, everything changed."
good,This job is extremely repetitive. You are prospecting for new leads in a retail store (Home Depot) and will get a lot of rejection. If you are the type of person that can not handle constant rejection then this job is not for you. Having done this job for a few years you learn a lot about how to approach people hands on and get a sale. I decided to leave once the pay structure changed. It didn't seem worth while anymore when we started getting less in return.
good,"Genoeg werk, verschillende buitlenandse collega’s waarmee je op de werkvloer Engels praat."
good,Management really provide training to perform the jobs. Need to be certified. Cross training was being applied and practice. Required 12 hours work and always standing. Supervisor was very strict on the breaks.
good,"Since Tesla purchased Solarcity the quality of management has declined, worked has doubled and pay has shrunk. You do the work of 2-3 people daily and get paid less then one person should make."
good,"Working hours are very high. My skills are also exploited and each day is very stressful. the pay doesn't make it any better as i am not remunerated properly for my skills, hard work and travel. i am sorry to say but i do not work to give my money back to company, rather to enjoy life and feed my family. ( not so that i can go to mars)"
good,productive fun place to work.  Really enjoyed   the people I worked with.  Would recommend to others.  Tesla makes an amazing assortment of products that you can represent proudly
good,"The company offers a lot in terms of benefits. For example, they give you access to Udemy and Rosetta Stone so you can learn new skills and languages if you want. There is also a shuttle that takes you from your home city to Tesla."
good,"It wasn't a right fit for my advancement"
good,"Warehouse was very small and unorganized that it made it impossible to process orders.  The management was nice and the staff is pleasant, but the location makes it hard."
good,Good company to work for if you don't have a family at least from my standpoint. It pays well but demands alot of your time. Good supervisors and AM's
good,You have no life not recommended for parents i was there more then 18 hours a day thats including travel and the free food was nothing they should give us better food being that where there more then anywhere else during the day
good,"Some days would easily fly by, with  the continuous work flow. Other days can be a struggle, due to the amount of work put on the employees and lack of communication from Leads/Managers on site."
good,"A typical day for me here was installing mirrors and the components that open and close the doors on the Model X. Hardest part was when the line is down. Keeping busy is tough. Everyone had great attitudes, but management seemed a little unorganized. The pay was great but not having a guaranteed assignment was a challenge."
good,Highly Demanding and well respected job with little compensation and benefits. Tesla had so many great employees that were simply chased away due to Tesla's negligence.
good,"While a booming company with great benefits and a broad future, the service area of tesla motors is very limited in room for growth and advancement."
good,"ok job. the hours are very sporadic and there's no job stability if you come through and agency.  Managment didn't care about us hardwaroking employees, they just use us and throw us away"
good,"Great Product. State of the art technology, Many talented engineers and interns to work with and many interesting problems to solve."
good,"Everyone in the factory has either morning or night shifts. Many people prefer working morning shifts and those hours are from 6-230 monday through friday. The hours are good but managing is not. Its hard to move up in the company and its even harder getting a raise. They tell you to achieve certain goals throughout the year to get that raise but they fail to make it happen. To me it feels like they come up with excuses so the company can somehow save some money. Its a new company but when you see people working as hard as they could each day and see no results, its frustrating. I would recommend this job to someone who would want just a steady job and to get by. I would not recommend it to someone who's a hard working individual who puts time and work to better themsevles but sees no results for that."
good,"Great technology, great people, great environment. Still a start-up with all good and bad that comes with it. Can be a good place for an internship but not for a long-term career."
good,"As many previous and former employees of Tesla mentioned to me before I took on the role as workplace design coordinator, there is no work/ life balance at Tesla. It is nearly impossible to achieve such harmony if you're truly doing your job. I completely agree with the statement. While it is exciting to be on the leading end of technology, it requires you to sacrifice sleep, mental health, physical health, and emotional health. Additionally, there is no such thing as a true vacation as an employee of Tesla. You are still required to answer emails or join WebEx conference in order to stay onboard with the on-going projects. If you do not ""voluntarily"" participate, you are considered a lazy employee. "
good,Innovative company. International influence of consumers. Long work hours and politics plays a big role in advancement
good,"if there were a free food programs and a better system of communication it would be great, the bad thing about working for a start is that everything ends up being a test and there always lost of hard changes to deal with."
good,Great place to learn customer service skills. Great place to see technology grow. great place for advancement .
good,"Fun Exciting environment lots to do their always teaching you new things, it was deffenitly an amazing experience however jobs at Tesla just aint secure."
good,"1) Utilizing Metrology equipments (Coordinate Measurement Machine, 3D Blue Light Scanner & Faro Arm) to verify dimensions of product."
good,A typical day at work was sometimes slow. We sometimes had lots of free time to kill. I learned how to be creative when helping develop new processes. Management was very easy going but also sometimes were not there to help with task to be given out. co-workers were easy going but sometimes were caught up in their routines and did not help with the way of production. Hardest part of the job was trying to not get caught up in do it all myself way of thinking. Most enjoyable part of the day was building a vehicle that will change the future.
good,"buen horario de trabajo para compaginarlo en casa , buen ambiente y buenos compañeros"
good,It’s a good company to work with. Hiring process is fast and you make good money . All over I have good experiences working with this company . Everyone dress good
good,"Always chasing KPIs."
good,I started as a regular associate then learned by my leads how to lead and train. I felt good about what I was learning at work and looked forward to go
good,"Great job if you don’t have kids because they give you the hours if you want them. They don’t call it Tesla life for no reason, Tesla becomes your whole life. My experience there was good overall. Great diversity of people."
good,Days are very long but you keep busy all day. Pay is decent but holiday pay doesnt really equate considering if you work holidays you only get 8 hours of double time.
good,Got chance to work in one of the  reputed company and feel some proud moment when see the product in road. Made me familiar with the innovative technology and work in a huge mass of people around you.
good,I was initially excited and proud to be working at TESLA but after my first week on the job I was completely disillusioned. I felt let down after experiencing how the actually worked vs what I was sold in the on boarding sessions. The job was absolutely dangerous and there was very little regard for safety.
good,Working within Tesla was very hard an fast pace there can often be no time off or brakes for the low pay that they want to off but on the upside they can be positive by showing your how to work hard
good,CEO- is always right and not the employees making the hard work. True Tesla culture is much more different almost a decade ago. Tesla is hiring employees that doesn't have experience the true knowledge of hard work and a positive mindset. Blaming each other instead taking a full responsibility for any actions on any individual even it's in the management part of the company. I was very very very disappointed of how it became and in the future of Tesla.
good,Was there for 4.5 years.  Job I had was inside sales of solar energy systems and battery storage.  The job I had and compensation program no longer exists.
good,When you are working at tesla you get to see the future in front of you and you get to meet people like elon musk and famous sports figures and you are always busy
good,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar, tem oportunidade de crescimento mais demora essa oportunidade."
good,Upper Management is not well equipped or trained for their position. Often times you will be asked to complete tasks that are outside of your job description or will be asked to complete a task with lack of material or resources
good,"A stressful work environment where your employment never feels secure. The asks are numerous and the pay, advancement &, overtime are nonexistent. As for the different sections/department in the company, the right hand doesn't have a good grasp on what the left hand is doing. You might start off the day receiving cars then, switch to taking customers on a test drive or, helping to fix a containment hold. Great if you know how to detail a car but, your payments won't increase because of the ability."
good,My whole time at tesla I would consistently get moved around to help support other departments and right when you get comfortable you get moved again. New manager every 3-4 months guaranteed.
good,Plenty of opportunities to learn new skills and advancement opportunities. They value hard work and people that show initiative. Although with a mix of challenging and stressful day to day work.
good,"Great to tell people I worked there, but not so great working there. Aside from the stocks, that you get if stay 4 years, benefits aren’t very good. Standing for 12 hours shifts. A lot of no productive days."
good,"I believe there is a lack of resources for improving processes for employees at tesla. Salesfroce could be much better managed overall as a company for pipeline management. And this would further impact the customers in a positive manner. I love being scrappy but when you need to deliver over 100 cars in a day there is no time for innovative thinking. That's why there needs to be an entire processing team as a support for more senior delivery specialists and delivery specialists alike. I think overall this could reduce the turn over rates and impact multiple fascists of the company. In addtion, there needs to be more relevant resources in training for certain roles and less material that is irrelevant to the role at hand. It's great to know a lot about the company but the irrelevant information during some of the training causes confusion. The hardest part of the job is end of the quarter I was up working 7am-2am. I did receive a bonus end of the quarter, however that bonus was divided over the course of 2 years it would have just made sense just to give me a raise. I am kinda upset about never being able to collect that whole bonus that I have earned it was over 4,000 and I was laid off so there was no possible way to collect what I earned."
good,Very hard to maintain a balanced life when you yourself have two kids. Hard to come home after 12 hour shifts and maintain your responsibilities that you need done
good,cool awsome experiance too many people not enough hard workers everywhere i go im the hardest worker anyone has ever seen in there million years off work they neber seen anyone like me
good,"Focus is always on cars, not solar roof, not storage, not residential solar. "
good,I was a consultant for Tesla. I helped integrate a Camera Module Test System using software tools from Mobile Image Parametric Systems. Management gave me freedom to work with their engineer on day to day operations in order to meet schedule.
good,"Work hard, be an agile learner, be open to change and you will enjoy your time as well as make a name for yourself. Be responsive and up to date on changes with product to provide great customer experiences."
good,"Saying you work with Tesla - at any level and location - is a guaranteed conversation-starter. There is no denying that the vision and the culture of novelty throughout the company are infectious."
good,"If you are able to travel to Fremont from Stockton for long hours, then I suggest you apply. It is very fast paced, try your hardest to keep up and be prepared for the long hours."
good,"Deadlines were extremely important, but even though that was the case employees were give freedom to plan their own goals & objectives as long it improved efficiency."
good,"This was just a sales position at a fancy sounding company. The sales part was difficult because nobody just wants to get solar power, but it was cool."
good,"Typical Day: 8hrs, customer service, sales, test drives"
good,"i can't say nothing wrong about Tesla, its a proactive company. its a nonstop working till you reach the goal then you produce more. the reason why i got lay off i did not work overtime its because i got tired from the 12 hours everyday."
good,"Like any job, knowing what responsibilities are assigned to your role as well as how to do them is highly important. Do not wait for local management to assist with matters, always go above and beyond them. Some days are slow, some days are fast so flexibility is key."
good,Work life balance can be difficult. Fast paced. Very high tech facility. There are advancement opportunities. Good company culture. Definitely need to be a team player to thrive.
good,"I love the people I work with, we've been through some intense highs and lows together. It often feels like going to war. You don't fight for the generals or the flag you fight for the soldier next to you. That being said, it is a grind and you will be pushed to the point of exhaustion. Often. You will never truly feel appreciated, only the ""mission"" matters. That being said it's a rewarding job if you have thick skin and enjoy knowing you're a part of something that's truly revolutionary."
good,"I enhanced a lot of my professional background with Tesla. The workplace culture is good and it was an enjoyable job. My typical workday consisted of 10+ meetings whether it was phone interviews, onsite interviews, or meetings with management and higher."
good,The Team i worked with was very diverse. We all came together as a team to get the job done. We were very successful in completing all tasks and expectations over the five years we were together.
good,This job is very busy everyday and unscheduled leave time which makes it hard for you to plan your day out at all and the pay is not the greatest for the amount of money the company is making
good,Tesla had good pay and good hours. It was just too far from my house. I live in Carson and it took alot of time to just get to work and back. The management wasnt good either.
good,"Tesla is a fun place to work especially for young and ambitious young people. I learned brand new things from my co workers and management. The hardest part about the job is the hours, you don't know when you will go home on certain days."
good,"I did love my job, I knew it was not great but loved it. They said look if you work hard we will make it worth it. They did!! For a few months. I got an amazing raise and bounus, but then they needed to make cars cheaper. So all departments cut people who.made the most in them, no matter the work ethic."
good,"challenging place to work at to climb your ladder, but also a job insecure to work at. Offering direct hire to most of their employees and giving bonus as stock every half a year."
good,"Bare in mind this is a ground up growing company achieving greatness. Now this comes with saying that nothing gets better without things seemingly getting worse. The motto and goals that drive the company is incredible and reachable. The management think of the production more then you (which is understandable). They will lack in supervision, employee morale, common sense, and are not diligent to many plans they try to attempt.. They have way over qualified people working at bottom line jobs waiting to be moved up do to time restraints that are ""set in stone"". They bring in new employees, with boosted  initiative and motivation from their pep rally like orientation. Employees then find themselves culture shocked and lied to when they get shut down trying to show the initiative. There are a lot of shady business decisions made there and a lot of sporadic work. They will also seem like they are listening to you but will do nothing about what you have just told them. The communication there is horrendous, along with the computer jockey support staff. They have lost my applications. Lead me on to believe I had a chance to move up regardless of my qualifications. Given infringed feedback on details about my interview. Shut down any kind of determination or motivation I had to excel there. But the pay is at top peak for Northern Nevada production jobs. They make higher than roofers pay in most of Northern Nevada, along with other highly intensive labor jobs. The benefits are glorious. They take care of you on the outside but on the inside prepare for a very turbulent and semi  strict"
good,"Tesla was my first experience after graduate from university & I have learnt alot of thing during working there althout it was small size company."
good,"overall it is not an unpleasant place to work, however the work-life balance is less than ideal for most people who are keen on spending time with their family."
good,"Tesla is a great place for new grads or individuals starting their career. It is extremely busy and because of it anyone who puts the time in will learn a lot. However, it can be so demanding that you cannot expect to work here and have a good work/life balance."
good,I did some contract work here so I don't think I can fairly give a review as I imagine the everyday work of the employees would be different than my typical work.
good,Good job management needs work thep push to get ther products out so be prepared to do the work of muliiple peple not a job to slack off at very big company
good,Comfortable work environment. The people could be a littlle nicer. The hours are great perfect job for someone who has a lot of time on their hands and has no kids.
good,"The harder you work, the more you get back kind of place. Yes there are instances where politics are clearly involved, but Tesla usually has a good system in nipping it in the bud quickly. Others meet their goals quickly, others takes longer. If you can handle certain shift changes once in a while you'll be okay. once you make it out of the associate phase work/life balance gets a while lot better."
good,The training environment has really rushed and I didn’t feel like Specialist were given the proper tools to succeed in their jobs. The benefits are amazing though.
good,Tesla is a good place to work if you live close by and you are able to work different shifts. Depending on what area you work in such as production you may be able to move up into a higher postion.
good,"Working at Tesla had a ton of opportunity and new things to learn. If you wanted to learn something, you were generally given the opportunity to do so. The biggest hurdle that I was aware of was the lack of accountability for employees. Employees were noted for sleeping on the job, slacking off, not staying on task, etc... and their coworkers would have to pick up the slack."
good,"Teslas employees are the backbone of the company.  Everyone from intern to VP are working their a** off to succeed.  Tesla's Mission is only part of what drives this team, this team is full of people who want to be on the forefront and will do anything it takes to get there.  "
good,"very hectic pace and exciting company. I would recommend anyone to spend a couple of years in Tesla because it would be a great learning experience."
good,"Advanced computerized automotive car company, high quality equipment to work on high quality cars.  The benefits package was very good, great company."
good,"Make your own schedule. Pay plan changes about every 2 months. Decent pay structure. Some help from management, little room for advancement. Best part of job is helping the environment, that was more satisfactory then my paycheck."
good,The job can be really boring at times and break-neck at others. The pros are the $15.50/hr pay and long weekends due to 12 hour days. The cons are that you have to get up two hours early to be at work by 06:00 am/pm due to the traffic. It can be also be very irritating when they enact mandatory overtime with little to no notice and you have to find someone to cover your shift if you can't do it. They do not work with you if you absolutely cannot do the overtime day for the week.
good,"I enjoyed working there.Senior lead technician on battery pack line for the Model 3 line. Accomplished goal of 5,000 cars per week. Was part of the Tesla reorganization in June of 2018."
good,"The vision of the organization is what drives people. The hours are long but worth it for the direction the company is going. The pay could be better for the hours worked but again, if you stick it out, it will be worth it. The only reason I left was due to personal relocation."
good,Great environment and awesome place to work at as a technician. You learn  a lot on the latest technologies and stack up a lot of relevant information on what is coming in the future.
good,"Growing pains. A lot of favoritism. Unrealistic expectations. Unpredictable work schedule. Long hours."
good,Lots of work with little recognition and job security isn't great due to instability of company. Expected to work overtime and not conducive to work life balance. Great people motivated around the mission.
good,My time at Tesla was the best but sadly they had to let me go because once my contract was up i had to apply through the actual company itself but i didn't have all my documents at the moment because my car had gotten broken into. I enjoyed working at Tesla because i learned a lot of thing while i was there i wish i could've stayed there longer and took my work to the next level and become a lead and maybe one day a supervisor. I would definitely go back and work at Tesla.
good,The pay is worth the stressful work you do. it is long hours and work weeks. you will literally have no life. Especially if you are driving and live far from Fremont.
good,Your shift starts middle of the afternoon so you have to be aware of school schedules and plan around afternoon traffic.Your typical day is at least 10 hours. Not bad but when you factor in commuting for some and working six days a week you realize you never have time to enjoy your life outside of the factory.
good,"Working at Tesla,  you're guaranteed long hours, Stressful days  and  a lot of time away from your family. Management can be hard to deal at times. Overall, this job is not bad, so as long as your coworkers are great to work with."
good,"it was good money , good people , just the management was horrible . Short breaks , rude managers, just nothing that great about it , but you do make decent money"
good,"Fast paced but not consistent due to maintenance being poorly done on the assembly lines. Overall, a really good work enviornment and lots of of opportunities to grow."
good,tesla was a great and fun environment to work at. great team and overall great experience to have. iv learned a lot from working there and would go back there if given the chance again.
good,"Rewarding work, learned a lot. Also a lot of politics, sweeping things under the rug, job performance seemingly irrelevant to advancement."
good,"Tesla Motors is definitely one of the more interesting places to work at. If long hours and no personal time is your thing, Tesla is the place for you."
good,"Stable Hours, no real formal training, anyone teaches you. Overall it was good. Interesting place to work for. Also room for growth if you seek out for it."
good,Tesla Motors Company is good company to work at for people whos seeking extra hours. Also they give they’re employees a good benefits but the management is poor. Reason I want leave Tesla Motors is because of my academic schedule.
good,"company with a lot of money to spend on day to day operations."
good,Company is highly competitive must work extreme hours daily even on the weekends.  Bottom line is that you never stop working.  People get fired on the spot for any reason so you need to be on your toes at all times.
good,Work is stressful because many areas of the work is time based and customer satisfaction based. You're always trying to please customers who seem to always be not pleased. Management provides no coaching they just want answers which is not helpful.No formal training for new mangers.
good,"I likd it allot , very fast paced environment good team work there , very good pay if you work hard so many opportunity's. Alot of different culture and new technology"
good,"A day would start like any other super fast paced and ready to go. As the day would go on you'd find yourself doing other things then you were when the day started, you would then continue to work until lunch and go eat in the nice cafeteria they have. The hardest part of the job was learning to be super precise with everything but after you got a hang of it the job was super easy. Management was good from the few bosses I met, they were super nice."
good,"Parking is a nightmare and the hours are long but they pay well. they have snacks, coffee, juice, and cereal available for free all day but I'm not sure if they do that anymore."
good,managers are bad but the compensation is fair and the training is adequate.... they hire people that aren't fit for the job ............................
good,"I have been fortunate enough to see many new product be launched and be part of the few to see the changes happen. You can count on managers to accommodate if you have an emergency, but the company still has many changes happening so be prepared to be your own self motivator!"
good,Very big company to work for during rapid growth time. Benefits were great along with pay depending what position. Labor hours were one too many for me but overall good experience.
good,no need to review for question the company about any unnecessary response for or to apply at this current or any time please accept that I choose no to respond
good,Just started here and it has been a little disjointed so far in terms of training.  The managers aren't as interactive as I would've assumed with involvement in the team and the job skills required for this position aren't as challenging as I had initially thought
good,Tesla is still a very young company that is already taking steps in the wrong direction. Their supervisors and managers go thru a one day crash course on managing and it shows. I can only speak for my area but very rarely do they promote or hire the most qualified. They promote/hire friends of coworkers with no skills and promote people based on appearance rather than knowledge. The lack of drug testing is effecting production numbers and is making the work environment uncomfortable. Other than that Tesla has a lot of potential and if you are strong willed and strong voiced you can make a difference here.
good,A typical day at work starts off with a team meeting going over our goals for the day followed by any questions or concerns team members may have. I leaned how to pace yourself but at the same time be efficient. Management clarified our goals step by step to ensure immaculate results. Each co-worker had specific jobs assigned to them what I learned from them was how to be as good as they are at their job. The hardest part of the job is receiving defective parts for a vehicle which slows or even completely stops the pace. The most enjoyable part of the job is the challenge of being as efficient as possible and reaching the goal for the day.
good,"12 hour work days"
good,"Working with TeslaVault has been a very positive experience. They’re a small company, and I found that as a result they were able to give me a great deal of attention and mostly they work on freelancing project."
good,"Out of control they are in purchasing and material  control."
good,"Tesla USED to be an amazing company, I have to this day never worked for a better company. The pay was amazing & 95% of the management & employees were great, like family. As I said, they USED to be amazing, that is until Tesla bought another company called Konquest & merged companies... that's when everything fell apart, EVERYTHING. The Konquest company is now running the United States division & the Denver office ran it right into the ground. Got rid of 98% of Tesla employees in the states & kept the Konquest employees working. So it's hard to ""rate"" this company when I used to actually LOVE going to work & now see the condition it is in."
good,Work is great and there is plenty to do.  Fun place with very smart people.
good,Management are friendly and ok  to talked especially your jobs assigment. The overall rating are good.
good,great new company to work with 10 hour days. great co-workers
good,"It's a great place to work but being a ""stat up"", need to work very long hours (11 to 14). Also 6, sometimes 7 days a week."
good,"Well compensated, room for growth, learn a lot, mostly poor management, poor working conditions, always changing, always changing management. It’s fun, challenging, but can only work here for a while before getting burned out."
good,Hours are horrible so if you like a normal life I don’t suggest working here. They work 12 hour days or nights. The management is horrible and they do a lot of favoritism.
good,"I enjoyed the job itself, but the hours randomly changed and that is not typically ideal for someone with a family. The overtime was also mandatory. I was appreciative of the overtime, but it can wear on your body."
good,"I thought this would be my last job, but it doesn't look like they will be in town much longer.  The company bet on 1 entity and it fell threw, so now its barely hanging on by a thread."
good,You have to be willing to change directions on a drop of a hat. A lot of change is always happening and Tesla is always under pressure with the news and deadlines. Your job is never promised tomorrow. Even as a top performer
good,Tesla is great place to work but they lack standards cause ripples in the work place. Good people but bad ethics. Most employees are worried about making themselves look good opposed to focusing on teamwork. Great company and product too many yes men.
good,"As a production associates for Tesla for over 2 years, I can only say this is a job for those that do not know what they want for their career. Everyday, the work is the same and no different task at all. Moving up or getting promotion is incredibly hard unless you always have to get on the supervisor or manager good side for them to notice you. Some supervisor would also go through the trouble of not letting you move up because they know how useful you are to them. Also working 12 hours a day is extremely difficult. If you have the mindset to withstand the same thing everyday, then this might be the job for you. Otherwise, use the 12 hours you have everyday to think of what you will do for your future career."
good,"Managment is top heavy, too much bureaucracy .  Competent supervisors and technicians are leaving because of micromanagement.  Hiring is based too often on education and not experience"
good,"Although there is room for advancement, no one is safe when it comes to the company needing to cross save. I have seen the best there is laid off because they worked their way up the pay scale. I earned my Lead position and now all the hard work I did, was flushed down the toilet due to the forced transfer the company made. I was transferred to a department that has enough Leads and although I have been in my position for over a year now, I am told I will no longer be a Lead and to expect a pay cut next week."
good,"Tesla is by far one of the most challenging and change driven company in the world. It will push you out of your comfort zone to be open minded, scrappy and yet everyone puts in 110% each day.  We have some of the smartest, most hard working, dedicated employees in the industry. Goals set forth by the CEO seem impossible at times but with collaborative, all hands on deck work culture, we seem to exceed expectations each time."
good,"The organization never stopped evolving. Changes in power structures were a regular occurrence. The job was extremely high-paced which made it enjoyable in that sense. Scope of work was very broad, where it was never the same day twice."
good,Depending if i can relocate due to job restrictions I will write a different review.  Right now i'm just looking for a job i can work at for a long time.
good,Tesla can be a rewarding yet challeging environment to work in. The wages and benefits are great! Unfortunately their plans to retain staff and and succession planning need work. The company has a great product and master plan for the future but it is in risk of failure if some issues aren't addressed.
good,"Overall good company to work at. Workplace culture is okay if coworkers are good "
good,This was easily the best experience I've had working for a company that pushes you to the limit. Lots of training and changes but the company keeps you up dated.
good,"Don’t come into Tesla (Solar Energy) expecting fast-paced. Work was monotonous and slow, expectations were high, job security was lacking, but the people and (most of) the management were great. I’m going to miss my coworkers and my boss, but I won’t miss working from the same Excel spreadsheet day in and day out. Turnover was high, a lot of people were unhappy with the recent restructuring of the company. Overall, not a bad place to work considering who you’re working with and the benefits you receive."
good,Tesla wants you to be able to adapt to change. What they don't tell you is everything changes all the time with no true reason to support it. The company shifts all the time so it makes it difficult to plan a career path.
good,"I enjoyed certain parts of my job (training, onboarding, mentoring), but i dreaded what i had no control over. I don't have any desire to work for them or any of their subsidiary companies ever again."
good,"Was a good place to work until they fired all salesman. Management is ok, there is room for improvement. CEO is only focused on his cars and not the energy side of his company"
good,I felt like I did not get enough support from upper management for the project's I worked on. Outside of a few co-workers it did not seem like my department was taken seriously. This made it extremely difficult to be successful.
good,"The tagline says it all. "
good,"Automotive dealership environment.  Although Tesla tries to be innovative and change the game, this is still an automotive business.  Employees, especially technicians, really enjoy the day to day challenges."
good,"Tesla's mission statement is fantastic. However, working at Tesla is challenging. We were not profitable and because of that people that worked hard and put Tesla first were let go."
good,"Long hours are expected.  You are expected to be very independent and extremely quick to respond, and documentation is messy when it is existent.  Turnover can be very high."
good,Fix cars coming off the general assembly line. Working with a team to complete defects. Sometimes management offers free lunch when production numbers are hit.
good,"As the title says, the company itself is great in what it is trying to achieve. No clear set path however for CES's on how to move up in the company, with possible transitions to other roles outside of sales."
good,"challenged by individual utility markets, unable to adapt or support sales activity during lean times that occur when business partnership with utility became volatile; 7-day work week."
good,Tesla is a great company to work for. I have been there since early 2014  after the model S won car of the year in 2013. It has grown into a great work environment.
good,"I enjoyed working at this company, just wasn't for me & couldn't balance life & family with this company so that made it hard to be happy & wanting to make it my career"
good,Day starts off with meeting up in the break room over a cup of coffee planning out the day with a crew of friendly and knowledgeable installers. Always leave on time.
good,One of the best companies ive worked for considering all the different kind of social connections made inside. They provide shuttle's from different areas to help with the commute and the benefits are wonderful
good,"Great company, but some of the locations are extremely poorly managed, causing good people to leave the company. The company is not supporting its rapid growth properly, while at the same time not controlling quality during the production process, which creates a lot of stress on the service side."
good,Wasn't a good experience at all. The money was cool though but after that it becomes a miserable place to spend 12 hours a day. I hear its 3 shifts now instead of 2.
good,"Very fast paced with continuous changes daily. Long work days with a lot of challenges. I learned a lot from my experience. How to manage people and problems in an ever changing environment. Improved my communication with all from large groups to individuals."
good,Able to use my plethora of skills in the warehouse industry. I have been able to utilize my coaching skills.  I am in charge of stretching the staff..
good,"Great and fun work space, they encourage self-development and always work on yourself, but the management is less organised and less direct, orders can be issued from a lot of directors that aren’t related to the field and that will cause a misunderstanding and a confusion for the employees. The commission and bounce percentage rate is not clear and sometimes isn’t paid for the design engineers there for it issues the problem of the low salary; even though the sales engineers do get commission and high salary; therefore it won’t be fair taking in mind that the design engineer does a lot of the process in getting the project; it goes from design, meetings, to making quotations and presenting the whole contract scope. There is also a problem of sticking to more outdoor projects than indoor and more street than playgrounds; even though it’s not up to the company but sometimes it’s."
good,"Very busy place to work, long works weeks, 12 hours a day 6 days a week for my entire employment there. Took a toll on my home life. Very good benefits. Pay was ok."
good,"Tesla is a good place to work, low on compensation but work is very purpose driven. Management is very focused to drive company to success, its little chaotic but makes working challenging"
good,"Working with several departments throughout the day, engineering, robotics, PLC support, project teams, safety. "
good,"Very dynamic and fast paced environment. This position has allowed me the opportunity to own all facets of the packaging development process from cradle to grave.  A typical day at Tesla is never the same as the previous day. There's a wide range of responsibility from preparing business case analysis for returnable packaging to return of investments to physical packaging audits on the manufacturing floor in the efforts to improve inbound logistics. Tesla still has a start up mentality so all managers are typically working managers and get their hands dirty. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the demand expedited nature of the company. This can make things difficult on the personal front. All and all a great experience, with great co-workers and wonderful benefits and compensation package."
good,"Co-workers on the line are very nice to each other. The management  only care about production number while a lot of people getting hurt or really tired of long hours of working. Everything seems like to grow but in a slow phase. Still a good place to try, and hope it'll become better."
good,"Se debe asignar y supervisar las tareas al personal obrero."
good,"Tesla is a great company, however, working 10-12 hour shifts, including weekends is not what my schedule will allow due to school."
good,I learned a lot at Tesla and was a great experience working with them unfortunately my department was cut back and my position or job no longer existed.
good,If you show up every day they will leave you alone. They don't understand life happens. They want people to show up even if they are sick just so they can send you home.
good,"Manage space optimization within the distribution center, ensure timely receiving, stocking, picking, packing and shipping of inventory to store locations and external customers.  Support production by conveying parts between the distribution center and manufacturing lines.  Communicate with and support management of inventory within the distribution center, including daily control of cycle counts of the distribution center inventor.  Support commercial invoicing, shipping documentation, and country-of-origin info, as needed, to support international shipping.  Optimize packaging for all outbound shipments.  Maintain inventory of shipping materials and supplies."
good,It was great while it lasted.  The down side is that layoffs happened a lot and different management all the time. With that new management came a lot of changes that did not always happen.
good,"If your looking for a job with good pay and benefits this is the place, but if your looking to rise up in the company it’s not the place. The management here care more about themselves than anything else"
good,A typical day trying to make quota. I learned a lot from this company management was great.The culture of my team was amazing.The hardest part was every month hitting our numbers.It was very nice the company would reward us for our hard work.
good,"good work place friendly environment"
good,"Tesla is an amazing company that is changing the world.  The company motto is ""excellence is a passing grade"".  "
good,I loved my job just didnt like how much time i was spending doing the same thing over and over again. There needs to be enforced rotation of jobs becouse i noticed nobody wanted a certain job and come up with excuses like im alergic or its way to irritating for my skin or im not trained on that. I feel like for you area you shoukd be able to perform any task within your area and training should be done properly where actual on the job knowledge is being taught and needs to be supervised so that theres no confusion on how to do something. I would find out i was doing something wrong months into the job . the sops and all the material they had for u to read was never up to date . so if they didnt have time to train they would dirrect you to a binder but some of them were so out of date that the process it was teaching was longer safe or being used at all. Also supervisors i feel like are there to chill till some big boss comes in then suddenly everyones working hard.
good,Very fast paced job and you have to be ready to work hours and do stay up with the workload. If you are efficient you move up the ladder fast otherwise you might be moving up slow.
good,"As an intern in Tesla, used to work for 10 hrs per day and also worked on weekends. There was lot of communication problem within my team due to different shifts."
good,"A typical work day consists of a morning meeting, going over what we have on site to repair. "
good,High school atmosphere  They don't communicate well ..Your lost on how to do benefits and berivement they just leave you on your on trying figure out a lot of stuff.
good,Great company but they don't pay enough. 30 minutes lunches are ridiculous. Good people and they provide excellent benefits. Just wish they would pay more.
good,"The Company as a whole is ambitious, and they should be commended for their goals."
good,good place to work if you want to work for a reliable company and great leaders of the world and the future. The vision to create a world sustained by energy. GREAT Company
good,"Long hours,  lots of overtime parking is impossible. Too many chiefs not enough indians..... Not much flexibility if they receive incorrect information about you."
good,Been here 30+ years.they have kept me busy with work and had regular overtime.it is always expanding the company so that is good.health and safety is high on their list of objectives
good,Most employees work 12 hours shifts and on their feet all day. Not much opportunity for advancement or relocation and pretty much no chance of going to school part time.
good,Tesla was a fun place to work. Very fast paced which makes the day go by fast. I learned how to use gauges for measurement while I was QC and I learned how to use a variety of advanced tooling. The hardest part of the job was working 12 hours a day. the most enjoyable part was knowing that I making the safest car on the planet.
good,"Employee's were very friendly, got along with a lot of employee's. Supervisor should have been more involved in team's work, or lend a helping hand when slammed with work! Supervisor just wasn't good at being a supervisor!"
good,Tesla was very much a start-up company with significant product cost and manufacturing efficiency issues.    My assignment was a four month contract to address electronics component costs.
good,"Tesla is extremely stressful and demanding. You will never be bored and here is always more work to do. However it's one of the most exciting start up companies around and it's completely worth the hours and the lack of process or systems. Its a new company..."
good,"1. Motivation"
good,Nice and friendly place to work with a diverse culture surrounding. 
good,"Travail en région éloigné,7 jours sur 7, 12 a 16 heures par jours,peu importe la température, voir au bon fonctionnement de l'équipement, travail en équipe"
good,"Horrible managers, they don't know what they are talking about when they tell you what to do. Management have never ran the lines therefore doesn't know how anything works or why it might affect production. "
good,"During my first year at Tesla, I was extremely excited and passionate about making a difference and helping the company succeed. The longer I stayed with this company (over 1 year), the passion started to fade. Now I simply don't have the same excitement as I did a year prior."
good,"If you dont mind fast paced and hard work, working with some great people, this is the place for you. The work environment is pretty great. Very Diversified"
good,"It was a great place until certain management had come in. The sales area is stressful (it does not have to be). From one day to the next, you may get fired? I would suggest a different area to work in, not sales."
good,"Most people were nice but clicky , extremely competitive. A mini city in its own. Advancement possible if you can do 6 months of work. Go with an open mind because it’s not what you think."
good,There is not an exact typical day at Tesla. It is a constant changing working environment depending on what position you hold and your requirements in your role.
good,I dont like the adverse health effects working at Tesla comes with. I have heard many stores of people and their situations at Tesla and i myself experienced a bit. the air quality is pretty bad so in my area we are breathing in all that bad chemicals. Other than that the job is decent youre doing whatever youre doing for 12 hours and not much more. the benefits are great but i do not believe it outweighs the cons. overall decent job if you need one.
good,Tesla is a place of advancement but also a stop and go place as well. It’s a forever changing environment. That can be great but it also can be stressful.
good,My manager played favorites and very obviously laid people off based on if she liked you or not. She wasn't considerate of peoples differences in the workplace and was very controlling.
good,"tesla is very good for a career, pay is good, hours are good, but it will tire you out. Make sure to rest your body when needed, some departments only have one day off so use your rest days accordingly. Tesla is also a revolving door, their turn over rate is very high and you are REPLACEABLE!!!!"
good,"Lots of management, very high expectations. Constant changing of SOP. There is a bond among field workers though. Need a lot of restructuring in certain titles."
good,"Full benefits and discounts starting from day 1 are given, and there is a job culture that makes you feel like you are part of this disfunctional company. The work is not hard, but weighs you down mentally as the shifts are 12 hours"
good,"It's a fabulous company to work for, if they don't decide to axe 9% of the company when you've only just started with them. They're an ever-changing corporation; thus, your job position may be ""changing"" as well, at any given time."
good,"A typical day as an Equipment Maintenance Tech at Tesla began with a passdown from the previous shift detailing any issues or situations that may have happened to cause major production down time. These issues would range from mechanical problems to robotic issues that were document and logged on the online database. Management was in charge of ensuring issues were recorded, while also keeping their workers satisfied and productive. The hardest part of the job had to be keeping up with the fast-pace work environment, however it also made the job very rewarding and enjoyable completing difficult task under those circumstances."
good,It’s a good job great benefits the pay is low for the job done and no vacation pay or sick pay the pay is not worth the commute the management is subpar
good,"Not good environment at work , too much hours require and hard to find parking , need to show up one hour before work to find parking , Benefit was okay"
good,"For the most part, we do a lot of machining and assembling parts. Quality inspections are always priority. I learned a lot about how machining works and how parts should be treated. The job is pretty simple but there are many parts to learn."
good,When i first started working at Tesla i loved it but the more time went by the more i didn't want to show up. But i guess most jobs are like that if your not doing what you love
good,Company is new and have accomplished a lot. Tesla is expanding worldwide. Truly one of most innovative companies to work for in Sillicon Valley.
good,a typical day would consist of 12 hours of assembling the model s vehicle. doing the similar task for the whole work day. you get to work close with your team in your department. you get three 15 minute breaks plus 45 minute lunch.
good,"Empresa que trabalha com equipamentos e softwares de ponta."
good,it was a good place to work staff is fare
good,Mon aventure a été très concluante et j'ai appris beaucoup au sein de cet équipe
good,I did not intend to leave but laid off due to mass layoff . Good place to work and my manager was very understanding and cooperative. Excellent health insurance  and also gave good severance package
good,Tesla was a wonderful place to work at. I loved it. It was hectic but nothing we couldn't handle. My only complaint is how disorganized headquarters is. They fired 3000 of us right after our biggest quarter ever with no warning. We all feel used.
good,"A typical day at Tesla begins at 4.30 am, where the team gets the pass down face to face from their counterparts, Learned that it is important to take care of everyone in the company regardless of if they are your direct reports. Hardest part of the job was able to get everything completed that was requested by everyone in the same day, often had to finish it the next day. Enjoyable part of the day was seeing the company continue to grow each year."
good,"Warehouse Associate"
good,"Tesla gave me a lot of valuable experience, and I learned valuable skills. I enjoyed the people I worked with. I appreciate the opportunities I've been given at Tesla."
good,"Job was not challenging, however, employees and supervisors' attitude is very positive and encouraging. Interns need to be give more rewarding and challenging tasks."
good,Adquiri grande experiência na área elétrica industrial trabalhando nesta empresa devido a diversidade de serviços que ela oferece e por ter tido oportunidade de participar de diversos projetos.
good,"I loved working with Tesla. I gained a lot of experiences, got to learn the environment of a warehouse. Was more of warehouse worker type, controlled the amount of parts we receive, also damaged  or pending inspection on a part. I liked the job, but not the people there."
good,el personal es muy calificado para diversas areas de la empresa
good,"As pessoas da gerencia sempre nos passa clareza, os colegas de trabalho sempre foram respeitosos, aprendi como gerenciar basicamente uma empresa de eletricidade. Experiencia memorável."
good,"They don't know whose working hard for the company, people come in and out of the company.  Management resolve the shortage of man power by replacing them with another and at the end they will also quit because of the same reason,, this cause the delay of the work because newly hired needed some time to be trained and to get used of the parts "
good,Good company and environment. Lots of knowledgeable people here i don't regret working here. The travel is always a plus. unfortunate its a far commute.
good,I learned how to work in a fast paced environment. Hardest part of the job was finding a balance between work and personal time because you work 12 hours a day. You have little time to spend with family and friends.
good,"Job was very fast paced, requires someone who can adapt quickly and self teach many of the required skills (at least for the recruiting department).  I enjoyed this environment very much.  Contract was extended twice.  Things ended in a very interesting manner.  The manager who I reported to for 9+ months was positive towards my conversion.  The last two months I was there, another individual took over management and apparently had the last say in not converting me to a permanent employee, despite having little to no involvement or insight into the work I was doing.  I loved being at Tesla and would recommend it to those closest to me, but I just wanted to share that ending experience for anyone who is contracted with them."
good,"Good money no work life balance, management plays favoritism but its overall a good company with great benefits. Also provides transportation to and from BART"
good,"In this career you are part of the big dream of using electric power in place of fossil fuels. The culture is a work hard, and work harder mentality. The management is the only drawback I faced while working here. It was a base of who you know rather than your background and skill ability. The terms ""upper management decision"" was thrown on the line when last minute changes were made. Leaving much to be shared in terms of leadership and accountability,"
good,12 hours 5days a week. busting you're a**. Managers and leads sell you promotion deams that never comes ture. Most associate are hard working people but never appreciate there contributions to work. To all managers we are just bodies can be replaced how ever that want. Yeah if you're a** kisser this is the place  you
good,Working here is nice and the pay is also good but working 12 hrs a day and being 50miles away from the factory isn't worth the pay. There is a huge problem with favoritism as well.
good,I have met some of the most amazing and inspiring people at this job and some of the worst managers of my career. Due to a lack of proper structure in the company there is no uniformity throughout the different teams that causes a lot of needles conflict and busy work. Thanks a a select group of amazing maintenance and engineering technicians the workplace is successful despite a majority of poor management and company communication. For anyone looking at long term career at Tesla I would recommend looking at more established companies instead. If looking for a temporary position instead it can be highly beneficial to become more familiar with more state of the art technologies being used in the automotive industry.
good,"long hours"
good,Working at Tesla was a valuable and rewarding experience with plenty of challenges along the way.  I worked with some of the best minds in the industry.
good,"A typical day was very spread out and chaotic. Sometime it was wait and wait, but other times it was go, go, go. I learned a lot about internal logistics for the automotive world. Co-workers were fun but some were very non-sharing. hardest part of the job was really being able to go full throttle because of part shortage. Most enjoyable part was the free snacks and lunch parties."
good,"Advancement is limited, training is limited , hours of work are too long shift hours is long, pay is not too much for the hours you work."
good,"This was a great experience for me to be a part of history, with one of the greatest advancements in the automotive world since the invention of the automobile. I am one of the key players in the success of the Model S. I built the first Model S test mule. Also managed and executed the Toyota RAV4 EV body modification welding and fabrication of 35 cars, finished ahead of schedule, helping to net Tesla another 60 million from Toyota."
good,I arrive at staging and load my quad or snowmobile with extra gear so when they call me on the radio to head to a location to fix a problem. It either a problem with a cable or battery...or just replace the geo phones that collect the data for locating oil.
good,"The managers are all micromanager with ego trips"
good,If you're not passionate about sustainability or electric vehicles you will hate working at Tesla. It demands the most out of people with very little in return but it will be the most exciting place you've ever worked.
good,"Management lacks and supervisors have too many people for you to even really know your supervisor. At Tesla, its who you know or who you date. Not based on hard work or knowledge or interest in learning more. The harder you work the more likely you will be stuck and type cast there forever, as there is alot of hard jobs no one wants to do. Chauvenist behavior is fairly common.  So beware do a hard job well and its all youll do. As far as concern for your health and safety well toss that out a window. Its all new territory and osha doesn't have set rules for what you do. They even rewrite manufacturer instructions for operations to suit there needs. So good luck. This place is definately for suck ups and brown nosers to suceed. Not those truely dedicated to working hard, staying safe and want to be noticed by their work ethic and achievement. Leads are lazy and alot of them shouldnt be leads they dont lead they relax and have their buddies watch the rest of us do all the work. Now this could be one bad lead and one bad experience within the enormously large company. Im going to go back into production this time and hope as a tesla employee I will have a much better experience. I was there 6 months with my contract being extended 3 times,but had not been interviewed. I was the last girl left on my crew, every other one had quit or been fired. Lots of guys that came after me were already tesla. When I pushed the issue finally because everyones pay was going up except contracted and I needed insurance for my daughter. My supervisors supervisor assured me I would be interviewed by"
good,Your income potential is fairly uncapped but they expect you to give your entire life to the job.  It's a tough balance when you have a family and can create a ton of thrash in your life.
good,"Walking into a day of work not knowing what this day will bring. Challenges are robots performance down, FPY sensitive, making sure all components are within compony spec. Escalate if any components need the supplier/quality inspection. MRB bad components to be scrapped or expedited back to the supplier."
good,I enjoyed my time with Tesla however there are a lot of things the company needs to work on regarding its employees. I think they need to focus on taking time to appreciate their employees and making sure everyone gets a fair chance to advance. I felt like I had no room to grow within the company since they focus on hiring externally.
good,"Highly competitive work environment that allows hands on experience on different levels of production using various skills."
good,5am start time meeting every morning for Electricians and Data team members. we leave about 540am to collect equipment that we will need for the days job. Then take a cart to the level job is and once we would find our pillar and IDF and Jboxes and Racks and servers working with switches labeling correctly and running CAT5 liines from the IDF up 60 feet into the ceiling and along side the beams  using ladders or scissor lifts even booms. We would run between 2 to 14 lines from one point to another before that we were installing and hanging security cameras.
good,"a very long stressful 12 hour shift day, very consistent work. work/life management. free breakfast. no parking, come early"
good,"Long hours, micromanagement by the Associate Managers and Shift Supervisor. Room for improvement depends on how good you look in front of the bosses.  Good benefits including stocks."
good,"Super high-pressure environment. Must be super resourceful. Company hires based on low-wage, not experience. No work-life balance. Mangers expected to be available to executive staff 24/7. Be prepared to work 7 days a week, for months at a time. "
good,"Tesla is such a unique company with a work environment that is constantly changing. In fact, the only consistent thing about Tesla is its inconsistency. The day to day work is great but you would train on one product only to be told it will no longer be sold, then back to selling it again."
good,"There is a minimum of 150 characters. I would prefer not to fill this section out but it seems that's not an option. Instead, I am filling this out with a non-review."
good,My baby was born and I had to take off so I could fly to Sacramento to say her life the he Dept and leave Dept never responded to my emails or hospital notes and fired me.
good,Alot of drama. Favoritism.  Management is a joke.They have no idea how the production line works because they dont take the time to learn. They just want to bark orders.
good,"If you’re unable to stand long amounts of hours or work long amounts of hours don’t apply. You will have to work full time hours be okay with mandatory overtime even on call sometimes, job isn’t that difficult once you get use to it, if you’re going to work here you have to be mature enough to balance work and life !"
good,"Tesla tries to pay you well and treat you well. But like many other things in the company the management is unaware of the actual work environment. Working in the field is different than at corporate. Work life balance is ignored. The number if new years eves I have spent at Tesla are regrettable. I've seen relationships fail from the lack of balance. "
good,"Tesla was an amazing place when I first started working there in 2012. I learned a lot of new things working on the vehicle and the company culture. Through my time there I grew with many new responsibilities to do within the Service Center. Only issue is the company will add those responsibilities, but job title will not change or the review process is not set in stone."
good,"Tesla is a great place to work hard. It is not an easy job. In Maintenance you work weekends and holidays. In four years, I had one, three day weekend."
good,"There are some great people that work for this company but the consistency of management is non-existing.  The department that I worked for went through 6 different supervisors in less than one year.  Each new supervisor had little to no experience working in our department and each supervisor had their own problems they brought with themselves.  The inconsistency is very bad and very demoralizing."
good,Management needs HELP!!!  Bonuses were good. Sucks that layoffs are happening more now. If your able to hold the job with a great team and managers it's the best place you can work for.
good,Very fast-pace working environment but extremely rewarding as you are working for a company that changing the world. Unlimited drinks and cereals. Lunch are reasonably priced.
good,Overall I had a negative experience with Tesla considering that my manager played favorites with other people who did not work as hard some people took advantage of him and in the end I lost my job over people like this
good,"Sad to leave such a growing company but was necessary for my health. demeaned too much out of their employees, no bonus structure for my role and wasn't worth the headaches."
good,Tesla is an amazing company for a driven hard working person that cares about changing the world. I loved my job and the company mission it was a huge disappointment to get laid off.
good,"could be better, they are currently driven and focused on their mission statement, but that could cause some unfavorable decisions that might affect job security"
good,"If you want to get out of your comfort zone, its a great place to work.  The culture they are trying to build is awesome.  The people are great, but the company is still young so there are plenty of growing pains."
good,Was a great place to work (depending on your environment) but also with that said they seem to do alot of major firings/layoffs but also the same with hiring..
good,"Fabulous concept inspired by the brilliant CEO"
good,"If you have ""no life"" (reality of it) then this job will work for you."
good,"The typical day at Tesla will require the employee to creatively problem solve while effectively managing pressures from both customers and management.  Sales quotas will be challenging to the point of occasional impossibility.  Regular staff turnover means that institutional knowledge is spotty among peer workers.  This is the kind of workplace that rewards quick action over caution or certainty, in many cases."
good,Everyday was intense and stressful. You have to be committed in the product and vision of the company since the days are long and the competition is intense.
good,"Obviously, this is one of the most cutting edge companies out there. I love the overall vision of the company. There are a lot of challenges that haven't been ironed out yet as this large company acts like a start up in many surprising ways. Overall the company is great, just be ready to roll with the punches as processes are tweaked and adjusted."
good,"Positive: New and innovative, Great new products, top in the renewable energy indu"
good,"the pay is comparable to other companies in the bay area, the benifits are good it is a good job! the only bad thing i can say is tesla will work you hard 12 hr shifts 6 days a week. little time to have a life"
good,"Tesla has hired an excellent group of engineers - not only highly competent, but also fun and interesting people.  One of the best things is that they are, on average, very young, so there's a happy, vibrant energy in the air.  On the down side, though, these young engineers are very inexperienced, so a lot of effort is wasted doing things inefficiently."
good,"Very fast working place "
good,Machines always going down.  Lots of cleaning and standing around. Promotions depend on favoritism.  Often moved to other areas to work.  Sometimes moved multiple times per day.
good,"I have been at Tesla for 2 years and some days. I  have learned the things I need to know to move to another department. But unlike what I was told during the hiring process, they DO NOT help you get into a position/ department you would be better suited for. Management is dreadful, either they have no idea what is going on because they only care about being present in emails or they just act like they care and then do nothing to help you with any problems you bring to their attention. Skills are not recognized only resume information. "
good,"Morning meeting was held every day informed employees about repairs, parts availability.I learned lot about electric vehicles.Work place culture was confusion at times due to management misdirection."
good,Worked 12hr shifts overtime all the time great place to work at wish management knew what they were doing at times over all had a great experience and knowledge I learned there.
good,"Good performance, great attitude and being at work on time and don't call in is the best advice I could give. For the most part everyone at Tesla is kind and respectful."
good,"Tesla is an amazing place to work, you are part of a team making great products such as the Model 3 and Solar Roof. The opportunities to work on multiple projects were very stimulating and the amount of experience picked up from the different tasks really adds up quickly and at least for controls engineers you get what feels like a couple years of experience packed into a few short months."
good,Getting paid with shares as a big part of your salary is poor when the CEO tanks the share price with a tweet. It's a great company with great people but the rudder is coming off the ship and the vibe in the office is bad at the moment
good,"Everyone at Tesla is a top notch employee willing to dedicate their lives to the brand in order to advocate for saving the planet. "
good,"In my 4.5 Years there, I was able to build up my skill set by learning new areas that allowed me to advance quickly in the company. Starting at 19, I did not have an idea about future careers there, but after seeing where I can go in the company in terms of advancement, my work ethic was recognized by my peers and associate managers that I was fit to take on a managerial role at such an early age with the work ethic and mind set that I possessed."
good,"High pace production setting with a vast amount of people with different backgrounds. Many people at times can sink or swim,but if you are a hard worker and dedicated Tesla can be very amazing with abundant opportunities."
good,"A fun area to be in and co-workers were nice, but managers and higher up staff were strict and did not give room for growth or improvement. Made workers stick to what they were ""good"" at and did not let employees move up."
good,"Management needs a little help , would be nice to have an 1 lunch , They need more parking spaces . They needs to not do favoritism and treat all employees equal . L"
good,I've been with Tesla for a few years. It's good to work with friends and the benefits are good. Working for a company that is changing the world has great advantages. Tesla is changing the world for the better.
good,"With the highs come the lows. "
good,"Excellent training, with clear and concise advice and role play!  The team members I worked with were the BEST!  A great purpose and goal-oriented company, but be prepared for CONSTANT CHANGE!"
good,was ok. I like working here but if feels like a its who you know not what you know kind of place. I would work here again but in other conditions.....
good,"Always plenty of work to do but with Tesla not being able to confirm when customers will get product. Have to deal with a lot of people who would like to get Tesla products but cannot cause Telsa does not know when they will reach new markets areas. "
good,"this is a great place to work if you don't have small kids. cool pay and some good people. but yours hours could always change at the company needs. if they close the plant and your not full time, your out of work with NO PAY....."
good,"Your typical day can vary, between meeting people from many walks of life to having crowds of people all rattling off questions it can be fast paced and at times stressful. "
good,"Some days can be very slow, but it is a very fun place to work. It can at times become  Monotonous. The hardest part of the job for me was getting all the virtual transactions down. But once i did the job became fun for me"
good,"This was a great change from my previous job working in customer service for 5+ years. I have a very high work ethic and thought this would get me somewhere. I have now been there for nearly a year and a half and still have my same job title with next to zero career advancement. I have been very outspoken about my goals and have interviewed and applied for other positions. I have a stellar attendance record and a great attitude. This has been my experience. The company itself seems to have a leg up on most, but I feel burnt out and underappreciated."
good,"it was nice work environment, started at 6am sometimes at 5am once arrived it was straight to work no meeting unless someone made a mistake. Over all a good place to work if u want good benefits."
good,"Long hours and short breaks. Poor management, poor communication and pressure on employees work ethic. prolonging of toxic smells, low safety management."
good,Not the best by far but cant find anything better! Raises are hard to come since its a start up company and there is no set guideline to follow. A lot of overtime is required which can be a problem if one has a family.
good,"Great place to learn, really fun environment. Harsh quarterly demands. Management does not seem to learn from past mistakes."
good,"My job varied from logistics to filling facilities requests. This was a great experience to work with such a historical innovative company. The culture was so diverse, fun, and exciting.The entire day was enjoyable. The building(s) were open and the employees all worked and mingled smoothly."
good,"Great job, not much free time with the long hours & management is sketchy. They definitely show favoritism but that’s just about any job. Show up, do your job correctly & you’ll be good !"
good,"Learned more about Tesla’s equipment, and how to assemble each car correctly, was required to wear steel toe boots and a Tesla work shirt with black pants only."
good,A fun work environment with a team of people who are truly driven by the overall mission of the company. Tesla provides a fast paced work environment where constant change is the norm.
good,"Tesla is pretty amazing company and pushes the boundaries. Work is very fast pace and never boring. There are plenty of challenges internally and externally to solve and if you thrive in such environment, you would love this company."
good,"At Tesla the work life balance isn't apparent, long hours and quarterly based makes is hard to have a life outside of work, however that does make your coworkers like family"
good,"friendly staff good atmosphere. every day is different with a wide variety of electrical work, main roles there are production. i learnt a great deal and they're happy to progress knowledge within the company."
good,its a great place to work but if you not careful you will work till you drop. they wont send you home when sick without threatening your job. the days off arent worth it either. you have to use two of them to stay in your work routine
good,"Pay is great, people are nice, lots of opportunities to advance, shuttle service provided back and forth for work free for Tesla employees. "
good,"I will miss the amazing benefits Tesla had to offer! Unfortunately I need something more part-time at the moment, so I was sad to resign from the company. I would work here again if the right timing allowed."
good,"Be on time and ready for work .This is an ever-changing work environment that requires you to adapt to the demands of the job. You must be able to multitask and think ahead to avoid obstacles in order to complete the work on time."
good,"Ein interessanter Arbeitgeber, der sich selber als ""Scrappy"" bezeichnet. Für junge Menschen die viel in kurzer Zeit lernen möchten ist es eine super Opportunität. Stress in der Form von vielen Tasks und Zeitaufwand ist sehr hoch, sei gewarnt."
good,"its great , just depends on where you work at tesla, try to work for model s/x line, its the best, way more cleaner up stairs than downstairs. hours change all the time, went from 8hrs to 10 hr now were doing 11 hr shifts, works easy but it takes up a lot of your time, but its easy money"
good,"Tesla a great place to work especially if you are passionate about sustainable energy! The team is great and management is awesome. However, because it is a relatively new company, everything changes weekly - so you will be on your toes consistently."
good,It’s cool working at Tesla. I experienced new things with this company. Got to see how the car is built and I think it’s really cool. The company is doing very well.
good,"Good place to work with good employees and Supervisors. Good work ethic throughout the company. Overtime was stopped but has now come back, as we are getting busier in the last quarter. "
good,"This job can be stressful at times, mainly fast pace. But other then that everyone you work with are friendly, always willing to help if you really need it. A good job to have on your resume. Even though the 12 hours(for the Model 3) can be rough at times and exhausting but you will get a lot out of the job."
good,a typical day for me was fist we always had a meeting before the shift and we did stretches then right after id see how many people I had then id set up the drivers and the sorters then id inspect the baler machine before I turned it on and we started production  then  id hop on a forklift and start dumping cardboard into the machine and id also have to make sure every one was doing ok and the areas were getting too-ken care of and if anything happened the the machine id be the first one to fix the problem as soon as possible so we can keep the job in motion
good,Upper managment support new iniciatives. Multiple project to promote employer participation. Freedom to move to other areas to participate with new ideas. All department support each other.
good,"Some supervisors are great, but a few are not, having been promoted too soon. Tesla hires many people, then gets rid of many. Some get promoted then fired a month or two later."
good,"During my years at Tesla, I was able to create very impactful programs/revenue streams and hire dozens of people. Tesla gave me the ability to make my own decisions, build large organizations and travel the world. We were encouraged to do something different that no one else has tried - this allowed me to take the largest risks possible and had the right talent to achieve the results needed that qualified those ""risks"" as successes. My life was Tesla and Tesla was my life. There was no work/life balance. My best friends and people i called family were my co-workers. We worked around the day and night for the mission. Although tiring, it was very rewarding. I was able to grow into a very impactful leader that allowed me to mold other people into their own leadership roles. Seeing the growth of the people I brought under my wing is what I cherish the most. The global role that I held allowed me to challenge my business models/strategy in various countries. After learning various policy, business, and taxation structures in other countries and succeeding in other markets, allowed me to be part of the ""new market entry"" team in order to grow the company into new geographic regions. I could do it all over again, I would."
good,"Overall i would say it was pretty good working at tesla, from the big checks to the free food and transportation. But the only cons that i could say I have are that if you live far you don't really get sleep and you start getting real fatigued after awhile."
good,The work was fulfilling but Tesla is currently shutting down all showrooms and therefore I would not recommend applying there as there is a lot of chaos behind the scenes
good,Typical day is on the production line doing the same monotonous task for 12 hours each day. Haven't learned much besides that people who follow the supervisors around like lost puppies move up fast. The Gigafactory is a pretty cool place to work at first but it gets boring. hardest part of the job is doing the same boring stuff every day. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people who work there are pretty cool for the most part.
good,"Good place to gain basic construction experience. Was able to learn quickly, but advancement in the field was limited due to inability to show specific skills."
good,"Work is work and so if you are willing to put the time in, then you should do well.  The jobs are not the most difficult, but in most cases on the production floor for 8-12 hours at at time.  Schedules are mixed but mostly 5-8 hour days.  Some of us work an alternate schedule."
good,A very fun and fast placed work environment. Working 45-50 hrs minimal weekly. California vibe culture with laid back managers. Work life balance can be a struggle. Offering great products to amazing customers!
good,"The job is pretty demanding, asking you to work six to seven days a week, but the pay can be pretty sustainable. The biggest con I can have on this place the upper level management, as quotas changed hourly on some days."
good,"A typical day at work required myself to coordinate the mobile service teams. I managed a group of 10 technicians, provided their daily schedules, handled their customers, sent them out into the field for repairs and made sure they were set up for success. I worked daily with Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook, Microsoft word and Salesforce. I flexed in my role to ensure operational success by dealing with venders daily in order to ensure smooth delivery of the customers vehicle as well. I managed cross functional team communication as well as facilitated document preparation, reporting and filing, worked with the DMV, HQ, and finance contracts."
good,"I love the solar industry and what it is about. Tesla presents a good name but they have very poor management personal. Not really people oriented, just all about the numbers which does not fit if you are supposed to be about the customer."
good,".. after awhile it becomes tedious. "
good,"Working at Tesla means you have to be fully devoted to the company. From management to entry level roles, everyone is required to multi-task and to be driven by innovation and constant learning."
good,"The company of the Future entails having great drive, innovation, and teamwork.  Dedicating yourself to accelerate the advancement of electric vehicles into the future."
good,"Very fast paced and number driven. Lot of room for growth. Good benefits including dental, medical and vision. Overall good company with great potential."
good,Twelve hour days three to four days a week. 
good,"I can get the work done. I don't have issues with other coworkers. It takes a while getting used to when you are a trainee but if you have enough spirit to try, you can achieve it and it will all be easy. Hours are long but so are the days off. The pay is pretty good."
good,"Tesla had a quick pace and great collaborative work environment, it was a larger company but definitely had a ""Startup"" feel. Many things were done in that vein, with a ""Fail Fast"" move on to the next thing philosophy."
good,You'll break your back working at this place. No such thing as a fix schedule. They'll tell you to come to work extra 1 day prior which is short notice!
good,"The only con I can perceive is that Tesla is a high stress, high pace environment. People here work really hard and get things done. I wouldn’t say it is for everyone, but for a lot of people they would fit right in and feel at home."
good,"An entrepreneurial startup moving at ludicrous speeds resulting in a hyper ""loop"" of spiraling changes of direction held together by teams of hustlers"
good,Tesla is taking on the big guys in the Auto industry which means there is a lot of work to be done.  Many people want Tesla technology and so security is critical.
good,Amazing product with lots of learning opportunities but the management is poor and hiring is biased. The company needs to invest in better architecting its software and introducing better processes to improve management of human and material resources
good,"However I still got laid off in spite of performing at 140%!"
good,"Working as a production associate to construct assemblies or physical systems at the required output and quality, using physical operations which can include repetitive pushing, pulling, gripping, twisting, reaching, etc. Detecting abnormalities in the manufacturing process and use root-cause analysis to identify and resolve issues. Shared ideas on process design and tooling improvements to increase quality, reduce cost, and support the production work environment."
good,"Tesla has a bold vision led by Elon Musk. There are many smart and mission-driven employees dedicated to achieving the goals of ""accelerating the world's transition to a sustainable future"". The execution is challenging and the company has experienced many growing pains in developing new products, retaining talent, and building public confidence."
good,"There are wonderful and friendly people who work at Tesla, each with their own story of where they came from and what they do. Everyone works together to get the job done, but you are responsible for your own workload by the end of the day. I learned a good amount of things from this job, but I wish I was able to learn  a lot more. I liked the freedom to be independent with my work because I was able to set my own pace on how I wanted things done."
good,Work/life balance is terrible and the support structure is limited after the huge amount of growth. I wish they had offered more mentoring. Fantastic product! Amazing staff.
good,"Productive and fast paced. It has ping pong for your breaks and we provided fresh brewed coffee and cereals and milks and orange juice and also teas and hot cocoa. Each person had their own station to replenish, clean microwaves, containers, and tables. The hardest part of the job was when a employee called off. So we had to do their job as well."
good,Performed various tasks from customer service to advanced diagnostics in order to achieve excellent customer satisfaction and timely service and repairs.
good,"A typical day would consist of capturing fresh leads from customers who walk in in the showroom, as well as managing office time which is used to follow up on existing customers. We have to hit certain weekly KPI's. "
good,"Tesla is a great company to work for. They give you most of the skills you need to be successful in this business. It is a strong sales workplace, and if you do not have the aptitude for competitive sales, you may not find this role suitable for you."
good,"Great place for a single person looking to work 24/7. You can learn multiple skills  and move up if you put in the work. Hardest part working for Tesla is just the hours. There were times when over 130hrs in two weeks was the norm. Most enjoyable part are the knowledgeable people working there, you get to pick there brain and learn from them."
good,good pay but long hours and hard work if your old or dont have any real muscle unfortunate but true. good food aswell as food trucks which is nice but the factory is also in the middlke of nowhere so traffic is a huge factor
good,"Great place to work if you're willing to put in the extra time and effort it takes to shine among some of the world's greatest minds. You've got to be passionate about the work you're doing, and you'll be rewarded with lots of opportunities to grow your skillset."
good,"days felt short because of the high paced work environment. the management staff in the power train warehouse needed help back when i was there. "
good,Na kvalitní hodnocení se jedná o příliš vzdálené období.
good,Everything about this company is good besides the fact that there was no room to move up in the company. The pay was good the managers were good as well.
good,If you like working long hours this job would be great for you. Not recommended if you cant handle working 60 hours a week. Overall Tesla is a very easy company to work for.
good,"Fast paced, long hours, but the crew I worked with were awesome got along very well with each other, various cultures but I think that's what made us click. "
good,Stay all the day trying to sign up people for appointments for solar consultations and the problem your commissions are based on FEC who is leading the appointment which he is sometimes not the best caliber for closing sales. and this closing rate effects you.
good,Too much was required of me when I was not clocked in. Hi-stress with quotas and deadlines. Base pay is better than fair (considering similar positions) - with commission bonus the sales/lead generation positions could pay well. If you are a go getter you can advance here but you will need to make good relationships with higher up's 1st.
good,Tesla has a environment that is fast paste you must be driven and eger to fit in at tesla. It can be a hard environment to Handel but it Installs hard work ethic and great team work skills as well as training in proving exceptional products and work!
good,"Must be motivated to work hard, quickly, and efficiently. Look for advancement opportunities frequently to make sure you don't stay in a job for years. It can happen."
good,Working in the health care system of a company which had 3 shifts with lots of working injuries was challenging with paper works and fast pass jobs in Tesla.
good,azienda seria con gente piacevole e preparata affrontare giornata
good,Decent place to work. Face paced work in a friendly environment. long hours with decent  schedule if you enjoy longer days with more time off. they take good care of their employees
good,People are forced to become slaves to a paycheck. Hundreds if not thousands of workers are always yawning/ tired/ sleepy. No wonder two individuals within 6 months lost a leg or limb due to forklift mishaps.
good,"All employees are working as a team"
good,"I learned to be resourceful to my work responsibilities"
good,Tesla is a great place to work if you dont mind dealing with management.  Its has improved over the years but still has a long way to go. Depending where you go you might have a great team or a team that does not feel like a team. Some managers act like dictators & you have to agree with them or it could have negative consequences.
good,It is exciting working at Tesla.  It is fast paced.  Things are constantly changing. There is something different everyday. You have to think outside of the box. You are challenged.
good,"I worked for Tesla/SolarCity for approximately 1 year as a Direct Sales Solar Energy consultant.  Great team.  Good Management.  Unfortunately, the company decided to lay off 3000 direct sales employees in May 2017."
good,"Long Hours.  "
good,"If you want to put in the hours, you will be compensated.  Punctuality is definitely an important topic.  Tardiness will not be tolerated.  Not much room for advancement."
good,"Great staff and direction. Excellent product and work environment.  Great diverse work culture, and motivation for perfection."
good,"Tesla Motors is a good company to work for, you just have to pay attention and listen closely to instructions. The are very strict on cell phones and talking to your coworkers. There isn't really much I learned at tesla. One thing I do like about Tesla, is the breakfast and lunch."
good,"Liked the graveyard shift. Enjoyed the job itself. Never worked in production before but ended up really enjoying it. Long hours, but being busy and coworkers made time go by fast."
good,"12 hour shifts 5-6 shifts a week. Treat you like a soldier, not worth it. It is easy to get injured and replaced in their minds. They do not care for their employees."
good,Good environment but hard work.Co-workers are great also. Good benefits provided by the company as well. Safe place to work. Some of the best new technology used here.
good,"fun place to work but stressful weak managers, long hours"
good,"fast paced environment and hard work ethic, pays very well but you have to be able to meet your weekly and daily quota. Comes with full benefits which is great and you pay very low out of pocket"
good,The only issue is the amount of hours required to work there. There is no way to balance the work life and your personal life.
good,"I learned many valuable skills about working in a production environment by spending three years at the Tesla factory. The most enjoyable part of working there was being part of a growing company, and having a chance to see some cutting edge technology."
good,The management was a bit lazy and unorganized but the people that worked there were very kind. There are a lot of people who took the work for granted and gave up on the quality of work.
good,"Great place to work at for a while with a very fast paced and dynamic environment, good advancement, with lots of learning opportunities if you are willing to jump in and get your hands dirty figuratively and practically speaking. Management although often best in their fields is also often inexperienced managing people, sometimes lacking leadership and good management skills. It is often very demanding and not very forgiving with poor work-life balance and high expectations. Sometimes lacks processes, clear direction and constructive feedback. Resources are sometimes missing or stretched thin. It can however be very rewording and self revealing on a personal level when you do meet expectations and overcome challenges. It has good health insurance, and some small perks."
good,"• Consistent high monthly performer within the top 4% of worldwide influenced orders among Product Specialists. Influenced over $4.6 million of annual revenue. "
good,"Great co-workers that make you stay! Rarely have the same day happen twice. It is not a start-up atmosphere as marketed, which isn't necessarily a bad thing."
good,"I learned a new task everyday that I was able to take home and apply in my day to day life, my co-workers were all very helpful and a pleasure to work with"
good,"There is no difference in the multiple things that customers ask about nor the tasks that are required while not on the showroom floor.  Can become very slow when customer facing, but you are around very interesting products that are American made."
good,Attending meetings and working on daily tasks. I learnt to be proactive and take responsibilities. I had the best co-workers.
good,"Learning new skills was always something I enjoyed and this company was good in training you just that. My co workers was great to work with,and my supervisor was willing to help in any way necessary."
good,My typical day at work was me inspecting parts and sitting on the computer inputting data. The hardest part about my job is having to work till 2 a.m. everyday and working most weekends.
good,"Generally a good company. Co-workers are friendly. "
good,"A typical day for me at Tesla was reporting to the human resources department where my supervisor would have several tasks waiting for me.  Some of the tasks include general office work, such as, filing, copies, etc.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that there was always work to be done therefore, my day went by very quickly.  Also, the people were friendly."
good,"It was rough but fun. Worked with my father, so I enjoyed the work. Got real hot and days were real long, though. Worked next to ovens that would get up to nineteen-hundred degrees Farenheit."
good,"Management was sub-par at best. The higher up's need learn to keep their team's happy and motivated. A happy workplace is a productive and efficient workplace. The tactic of intimidation is very much used here and it was rare for an employee to last more than 6 months."
good,i enjoy working here they have some good people. the most enjoyable part is the relationship with your crew. it doesnt seem like a hard days work when you have a good crew.
good,"a fast paste working environment, everyday was a learning day since revision were changing consistently. Management since is a new company would change protocol on a monthly base which made things more challenging some ideas were great but many were more complicated since there was no work culture stablished. The challenge I dealt with was the miss communication from the assembly line and the inventory discrepancies. atfer all the hard issues I would enjoy them because I felt that these issue I fix accordingly and that every problem solve brouth our department better and better. I enjoy solving problems and finding what could we do better that way the problem doesn't continue."
good,"arrivé sur le lieu de travail ou directement au siège"
good,"i enjoyed my time there, people were nice and work was hard and i enjoy hard work"
good,"Bad management, poor communication. Very clique type environment. You only move up, based upon your knowledge of the right people,  not your skill set or work ethic itself. Raises and bonuses not given to deserving, hard working employees,  due to managers personal opinions of an individual."
good,A typical day at Tesla was 6-6 I was working 12 hour shifts 2 day shifts and 2 night shifts which was very hard to train my body to get enough rest and be full ready for the work day or night. I learned a lot about Tesla I met a lot of people and built some solid relationships my time working there. The mangers were really helpful in trying to maximize productivity in everyone and finding ways to improve our weaknesses. The hardest part for me was definitely the shift change going from day to night because I never got a good sleep schedule. I enjoyed seeing how the seats of the Tesla cars were made because it was extremely fascinating and I took pride in my work knowing I contributed to making the cars in someway.
good,"Office needs more dutch speaking-people and additionally English language of course. "
good,I like my job there but the management are not fare.. always picking on people.. they didn’t give me reviews for a year................................
good,Prima werkgever geweest voor mij maar door omstandigheden niet voortgezet.
good,Good place to work no work life balance lots of over time. Why are you making me write a review I dont care to do this why put a minimum amount of words
good,The thing I liked the most about working at is that I moved up quickly and was paid well.  Tesla is definitly a good compay to work for if you dont mind working long stressful hours.
good,"All money aont good money "
good,"Have to learn quickly, fast paced environment and great people to work with"
good,"My time at Tesla helped me grow personally and professionally. Work at Tesla was very fast-paced and variable, but the people were usually nice and pleasant to work with."
good,"Exciting tech savvy endless possibilities. Great people, good pay benefits decent. OT a must and EQ mind-blowing. Cons Very little work life balance , management alright could be better."
good,"Demanding but rewarding. Expect to work long hours, weekends, holidays, etc. Part of the compensation at Tesla is working on things that you find to be fulfilling. Make sure you know that before accepting a job."
good,"The sales environment is very lax compared to most car dealerships.  For the position I was in I got paid a flat rate of $20.00. I have heard this position has been cut since I left.  Those making the commission for car sales got a better base pay than most car salesmen, but less commision payouts.  The atmosphere is nice and relaxed.  Job security is a bit shakey for sales."
good,"Tesla is a phenomenal company to work for, that is, if your leadership knows how to lead. Tesla brings a great atmosphere with team work. The only issue is management. Associate Managers and above do not know how to talk to people, develop them like humans, or even act like they care about them. It is exactly why I am looking for a new job. Being a supervisor at Tesla means leading a team and taking extreme ownership. This is something upper management needs to work on. "
good,"Prepare to work hard and be flexible to pivot into different roles. Long hours as required by management. Fun, work hard culture and continuous learning and development."
good,"Really cool environment & co-workers."
good,Overall  a good place  to work at quick pace team work good management  hours was hard to maintain  but everything  else was good a new learning experience
good,"Equipment Maintenance Tech"
good,I’ve learned a lot since day one. Management is not the greatest but i tend to deal with it. The hardest thing about working here is not enough man power.
good,As an EOL technician I used to repair and diagnose problems with Model S and X vehicles as they came off the production line. The hardest part was learning all the nuances of the vehicles. The best part was working for an exciting company that was making a difference and changing the automobile industrty.
good,"As an employee you do so much outside of your position to enhance the company motive and the mission yet they do not pay enough for everything you do. Great coworkers, great mission, too many long closing shifts so social life is difficult."
good,"It's been a non stop exciting ride. always driving forward always seeking improvements which has been a great experience.  However the constant pace is so fast, it is exhausting.  "
good,"a lot of opportunities to learn new jobs"
good,Over all a good company to work for. Pay is ok but not up to bay area  way of life. You become dependent on overtime to get ahead that is now gone and its pay check to paycheck. they have cereal bars and fountains of various beverages also coffee for free which is not required but is provided free of cost im thankful i have been there for more than 5 years and have moved up to a level 4 team lead but i think with current situation (company layoffs) to level up any higher is  futile even though your great at your job last 3 reviews all excellent but no raise. Management is good overall but at times out of touch with the crews because they have no idea whats going on at times
good,"It was a good place to work stay busy, keep to yourself learn your process and you will be fine. Go about and beyond to tell others we are all one team with one goal in mind. Keep defects to a minimum be punctual and take pride in your work. Not for everyone but those it's for, it is very rewarding. Bee ready to put in hours"
good,A good job to start off at. No complaints. The hardest part is unsure how long it will last since it is a growing company wanting to make right decisions.
good,"Working at Tesla requires long hours, don't expect to work a 40 hour week there.  You need to preform at the top of your game every day.  Management however was great, they showed concern for their employees and appreciation for good work that was done."
good,I loved working at tesla despite the poor communication from upper management. I've learned a lot of technical/people skills. I enjoyed working at tesla and i highly recommend this company. I'm very competitive person and for me everyday is a learning process I learned something new everyday.
good,"Good people, but expect to be a self-starter who learns on the job and has long hours. Have to meet your goals no matter what, and everyone there on a permanent basis is a crazy hard worker."
good,"Tesla is a great place to work hard! It has opportunities for advancement if you deliver on or above your expectations. It also gives you a lot of autonomy no matter the level of the role. The learning curve is steep, and you always are in a position to sink, burnout, or swim...and a lot of (former) employees do the former two. "
good,"I enjoyed working there but work/life balance wasn't great.  The wages were decent.  Fast paced environment, at the end of the day it is all about the production numbers."
good,"hard to stand 12 hours, very repetitive job, free cereal and drinks, very expensive to buy lunch, arrive early to find parking and a long walk to gate"
good,The facility in Livermore was nice to work at. The people were nice and the supervisor was experienced. There was not enough restrooms for the amount of employees.
good,I like working at Tesla Motors it is a good working environment. The hours can be a bit overwhelming sometimes but I can manage. There are a lot more pros then there are cons at Tesla
good,"Tesla is a great company. I love what they are doing for the world and the planet. If one could sustain a home life working 12 hour days, 5 days a week, the overtime itself is worth it. A typical day starts at 5:30 AM and ends at 7:00 PM when you get home. sometimes the tasks are stressful, sometimes they are mundane. There is room for advancement if you want to go down the supervisor route. People commute from all over the bay area to work there because you cannot get a higher paying job without a degree or work experience in a higher paying field."
good,"Company is new and still trying to find its footing. My typical work day was building automation machine to be use on the assembly lines."
good,"Got a job straight out of college with SolarCity who later became Tesla and really enjoyed trying to change the world, installing solar systems on houses all across my area. Work flow was steady and at one point our warehouse ran 7 days a week, though the crews didn't work every day. If you are willing to work, this is a great company to work for, being outside all the time has perks and you do not need to workout as lifting 45 lbs panels and running them across roofs will work you out enough. Stay hydrated and you will breeze on by, changing the world, one house at a time."
good,"Relaxed atmosphere, great place to work. training is effective and fast.  Employees are great. Great team work with all to accomplish a standard goal company wide."
good,Each day started with a daily call. Received company appointment and self generated from customers and networking.One of the rewarding and easiest sales position. Great training and fun sales staff.
good,Great to get your foot into the work life. They treat you with respect and want to help you succeed in an environment that’s very rapid and quick changing.
good,"I typically do many type of work here , management of 4 person that work with me and programming and PCB and mechanical design , some time I join with marketing team for new targets in company"
good,If you want to move up its really hard its constant change and very stressfull just focus on work and you should be fine other than that everything was finec
good,"Working at TESLA was fast paste and I met a lot of people.The company had all the employees work timed and made sure that everyone was up to speed, which i liked."
good,"Tesla has created a series of products that are redesigning how the people of this world will transition into sustainable living. The CEO and founder, Elon Musk is quirky and brilliant - I believe in Tesla's mission."
good,"Great job if you can move at the assembly lines pace. Great on ergonomics, great open environment with collaborating with engineers. Management is below average. Management is really on you. The culture was so high on ideals and liberalism. As a conservative man, I had my ideals based on extreme quality and not quantity. The line is the line and orders are orders from your lead. Everything is highly updated on an online database especially your work performance and if you don't have the best management I am sorry to say they will mark anything down. You have 6 months to move around and keeping things on a ""good"" basis is key. They are very modern with there slang."
good,its a pleasure working along side the talents ive been around but management is horrible and makes you never want to be in the car business again. Theres a lot of work and you barely have time to live a life but the pay is worth it.
good,Be prepared when you work for tesla... you will not have time to sleep or even function on work days. they give u flip flop days of 3 on 4 off and 4 on 3 off but even with that being said your body will never truly feel energized
good,I enjoy working for the company. There has been obvious high and low points.Hopefully there are brighter days coming for the company and the coworkers that remain there. The main concern most individuals have is that they are not in charge of their own work. The micromanaging along with rigorous quota makes for a highly stressful work environment.
good,"The product is cool, it's good to own one. Innovative company with a sense that you are changing the world for the better."
good,I enjoyed with working with Tesla employees and was given the opportunity to advance raptly in my department and job was to my liking and training from Tesla Supervisor was good as it allowed for advancement.
good,"Tesla is a powerhouse. There is absolutely no doubt that my time with such a forward thinking, fast paced start-up has given me an unparalleled experience. It allowed me to learn about an entirely new field as well as explore my own talents and abilities. Unfortunately, as I would imagine with many start-up, growth ebbs and flows. I was given the opportunity to work in a department that was expecting expansion and then was told that the expansion wouldn't be happening and there was no timeline. I am a hard worker, a fast learner and I love (need) to be busy. I feel that at this time my talents would be better suited towards helping another company grow and prosper."
good,"Must be on time prior to your start time. Meaning that you are attentive to your position 15 minutes before your shift starts. Stretching is mandatory for the first 10 minutes to warm your body up . Regular day on the line positions such as Doors , Back-Lifts , Vendors, Hoods, etc. Communicating with line leaders and others on the line while moving at a steady paste."
good,"The overall atmosphere is one of mutual respect. However, the managers will tell you that you are going to be hired on permanenetly even if you are not being considered. This can lead an employee to false hope. Many who are told that they are going to be hired are not hired. "
good,"Checked my emails, set up equipment and provision that equipment and send out the equipment in a timely manner. "
good,A great place to start a career if  you do t have any exsperience in production . They offer opportunities for advancement. Flexible work schedules and some opportunitys for overtime.
good,"If you believe in the mission and embody it yourself, be here. Otherwise, it's really hard to balance your personal life with work. You come across a lot of brilliant people but culture definitely has room for improvement."
good,Typical workday is 12hr shift with 30min unpaid lunch. No time to conduct normal maintenance on weekends since we run M-F and Sat-Sun we fix equipment that broke during the week. Disconnect with upper management but they are trying to fix this issue but it gets over looked due to not meeting numbers for production. The culture is a mix feeling and disconnect between each shift. Supervisors don't communicate as they should among each other. The best part is we are working towards a future and proving skeptics wrong time and time again.
good,I worked in Quality and the job was overall good.  I was paid well and my working environment was cool.  There is no management structure in between departments.  Its kind of hard to get things done in timely manner when there are issues in between departments.  There is a lot of dust and I think I am getting asthma.  Like we had a 5 days off for memorial weekend.  And I came back and my desk was covered in a thick layer of dust.  I had to wipe it off with a wet towel.  My manager is pretty cool.
good,It's a good place to work for the knowledge you pick up however I lived far away so the 12 hour shift didn't work with my daily life. But if you can handle the 12 hour shift and be ok with little sleep then it's a good place.
good,"Tesla is a fast change place, and we are improving all the time"
good,"Great opportunity learning variety of skills. working here was a great experience and you get to meet different people everyday and the majority of people are all very nice, although you gain many skills and definitely have good income working there, if you want a job as well as a social life and be able to have time for outside of work activities or such especially if you are not a local to the area this would not be able to mix well together since the majority of people working here are required to work a maximum of 70 hours a week, about 12 hours a day."
good,O trabalho e fazer serviço e circuitos inteligentes  em industrias com processos de produção aprende coisas novas da tecnologia
good,Work is inspiring and motivating. You always have this feeling of doing something important in the world. Work-life balance could be better.
good,"Innovative company, team work culture. A typical day started at 7:30 a.m. reviewing the days assignments, followed by meetings with clients from 8 - 11:00 am, then following up with the morning and previous days clients. I have learned the better you treat your clients the more your clients will be your biggest endorser. I have found the joy of teamwork versus a competition. The hardest part of the job is the end of the quarter push that requires extreme hours and a poor work to time off ratio. The best part of the job is working toward a common goal to better the future of our Planet."
good,"Tesla is still a new company and they have a lot to prove. With that being said, workers average 60 hours a week. the money is good but its hard when you're trying to balance your work life with your personal life."
good,Ik had leuk werk en leuke collega's. Je kon niet verder groeien
good,"Sign in. Team meeting for goals, improvement, what to work on, etc. I learned teamwork and how to assemble a front and rear car bumper. My head manager, she awesome, fair and hard working. Didn't just bark orders but pulled her weight. The hardest part was coming in everyday for 7 days with 12 hour shifts. Was build life long friendships with coworkers."
good,"The company itself takes care of their workers and makes sure they are happy throughout the workday.You are given access to free fountain drinks, juices, milk, coffee, and cereal. When I worked there though their were too many times I showed up for work only to be sent home because of a lack of parts to be refinished. Not only would I be sent home but then work would be scheduled that weekend to make up for those missed days. A notice would not be given to the workers to tell them to not to come in. Instead we would waste our time and money on gas going all the way to work only to be sent home."
good,"Management respects hard working individuals, and recognizes that hard work with pay raises and advancement oppurtunities. This job requires the right individual to work 7 days a week 14-16 hours a day. The hardest part of the job is the physical demands that it places on your body."
good,"My 4 years in Tesla Motors can basically be summarized by the review title: No non-sense hard work with no holds barred hard partying. I joined the company at around 2009, when it was only still just making the Lotus Elise-based Roadsters, and facing monumental challenges from both the government, other automotive competitions, and a stigmatized consumer base towards electric cars, and in 4 years watched it grow to what it has become today. Whether making the Roadsters or Model S's, or other top secret electric projects, a typical day at Tesla is basically the same: work hard, work long hours, and work until the job is done, with much trials-and-errors taking place as it goes."
good,"Dia tipoco de trabajo los arreglos y las modificaciones que se hacian para los cliente,aprendi mas sobre electricidaddel automovil,con respecto a la administracion no tengo quejas ,mis colegas excelentes,la parte dificil las modificaciones que aveces eran extrañas,lo que mas me gusto fue el ambiente laboral y el compañerismo que hubo entre todos."
good,"Uma empresa que precisa passar por uma reestruturação gerencial, para que o trabalho possa ocorrer com eficácia."
good,"It is an exciting place to be, every day is different but it is 24-7!"
good,"Working at Tesla was a great experience for me. Its a very fast pace work environment so be ready for that. If you want to move up, be ready to work as hard as possible and learn as much as you can about the process of whatever department that you end up in. Be involved, show interest, and voice your opinion and your ideas. As long as you are there on time and volunteer you will more than likely get noticed and move up. "
good,Good company to work for. Opportunity to develop and revamp lots of projects with non limit on skill set. Very open to different ideas and great vision towards the future.
good,Tesla is a very cool place to work. A lot of great and very smart people with some awesome products. Learned a ton. Be prepared to work your butt off though!
good,Good company to work for as long as you're ready to dedicate majority of your life and time to the company.  Very demanding. But over all a good company to work for.
good,Nice and friendly environment. Clean and safe working place.
good,I love tesla but there is no job security. The people are amazing. They train Us(techs) every quarter. They also take care of their techs by show compassion and rewarding us when we put in extra hours.
good,I enjoyed the experience and the people I worked with.  I was a year-end temp.  Unfortunately the company decline had started and no hope of a permanent position.  Due to consolidation the office was pretty empty by the end of my assignment.
good,Great mission great team! Low job security for any sales roles as they are not deemed necessary. Basically retail car sales. low pressure to customers but you still have goals to hit yourself.
good,Working at Tesla was the best and worst. Long days but at times even longer pay. Things always even out I guess. Sore body everyday. Kiss your personal life goodbye. Get used to 12 hour days 6 days a week and a pile of money used for food trucks and energy drinks.
good,"Poor management, leads can be pests, they make new rules every week !!! Standards constantly change for the better in some areas for the worse mostly..."
good,"Room for improvement everywhere."
good,"Tesla is a great place to work, there are a lot of opportunities at the main factory or any of the other locations. The pay is decent but not what it should be and the schedule changes a lot and with that the hours change so the money changes."
good,"Great place to work.  Loved the diversity of people.  People were from all over the world.  No judgment if u had pink hair, a nose ring,  mohawk, tattoos no one looked at any of it just you a person.  State of the art facility was fast paced managnent let you do job and that helped it be fun."
good,"Long hours and tough work/life balance but great pay and benefits. Can be a bit unorganized at times but in general if you show up on time and work hard while you're there, they are very good to you."
good,"Stock options were life-changing in a good way, but I didn’t get to spend enough time with my family. Travel often, work extended hours, foul-language culture"
good,"It felt cool to be involved in Tesla's endeavor. The company goals are actually motivational unlike most companies. Unfortunately, each department is extremely silo'd. There seemed to be a sense of futility when it came to improving process. They also randomly lay off people."
good,Very cool mission. However the CEO seems to not have very good direction or the ablity to keep a promise. Not very stable...lots of layoffs. Great benefits...great car.
good,The mornings are fast paced loading the crew trucks so they can leave in a timely manner to arrive at customers houses. The rest of the day is spent scrubbing jobs to pull and prep for the next days work load. Often items would have to be ordered and picked up the day before an install. Management would do it's best to insure the customers were taken care of. In the warehouse things were often quite with few interruptions.
good,"Tesla is a growing company and it shows. Every day when you get to work something about the building may be different, an entire production line may have moved or disappeared entirely. As a maintenance technician we were expected to learn very quickly and adapt to changes on a daily basis. There was not a lot of training for my position instead the company relied on our knowledge of the components we worked on to guide us in troubleshooting and repairing the equipment."
good,"extremely fast paced work environment, but felt great to be part of a company looking to change the world.  I have nothing bad to really say about my experience at Tesla, unfortunately I was caught with new management when they went through yet another round of layoffs.  There were two layoffs during my 3 year period."
good,I work 12 hour shifts 3-4 days a week and I prefer to have my longer weekends so it doesn't bother me. Not a terrible place to work but when it comes to advancements it's pretty much about who you know and who you get along with rather than how good you work.
good,"New management, new work culture --not for the better. "
good,"infinite learning possibilities, meet and work with lots of really good people, like most reviews say huge disconnect between upper and middle management which trickles down to hourly employees. Things can change at a moments notice but Tesla did keep it more constant with a work schedule as time went on. To all the unhappy employees, they have always had a opportunity to change employers but they don't because it must be that good of a deal to work at Tesla."
good,"if you like benefits and good pay this is the place for you "
good,"Tesla's workplace is fast pace and challenging. There's a drive to significantly streamline all work processes, including customer's interface with Tesla. New products and workflow technologies are being introduced on a frequent basis to help facilitate continual improvements throughout Tesla."
good,"As a whole, the company is great to work for. Very busy, fast paced and the overall atmosphere is positive. However, there is issues with their time off system, the lack of communication between supervision and line workers."
good,"Fast paced. Every second counts. Prompt communication using IT and verbally. You will get benefits(deductibles though) from the start date if you are hired directly. You will need to be replaced by someone to go to restrooms if you work in line , sometimes you have to wait around 30 min for that. Some leads were biased."
good,in my 5 years working for tesla it was good but management could never really seem to figure out the issues but overall its a pretty good place to work
good,The facility that i am in just started and its running smoothly. Your able to be promoted after six months. great benefits and majority of the accelerations we receive are stock.
good,"Working in the Service department of Tesla is not like working at any other dealership. Mostly in a good way. Gone is the flat rate, 100% commission base salaries. All advisors and technicians are paid hourly. The goal is customer service and not how much money can we squeeze out of each customer. The problem with service is that it has never been the main focus of Tesla, There main focus is to get production and sales big enough to sustain the company. Now, they are running into big problems, service is about 2-3 years behind on where it should be. They will need to expand to take care of service, however, they still have not been able to figure out how to do this and now the customer is suffering, it also creates major stress within the Service Department."
good,I typical day at tesla is a meeting at 5:25 am. Then I prepared to load pars into the work station. Order parts if there are empty. Operated and troubleshoot robots if they stop. Every two hours we rotate from station to station. If we are short on men power we multitask. At the end we count our parts build and leave parts for next shift and clean the area.
good,"Excellent company to work for, Innovative, Collaborative and Challenging work Environment.   Meets Quarterly Goals, "
good,"you go in smiling and you could leave smiling. you work hard with everyone and everyone helps each other. I learned almost everything I needed and wanted to know. my actual shop manager was a great guy, almost too great. but the people above him had no freaking clue what they were doing and they were merciless. the workplace itself has this atmosphere of happiness, struggles, and fun times. the hardest part was when we were over flowed with cars and under staffed. the most enjoyable part was everyone there having a great time."
good,"Like anything else that is amazing, it isn't good for your health. Be ready to outwork every obstacle between current state and targeted condition.  The best idea does tend to win out, but you gotta bleed baby."
good,Working for Tesla was an amazing opportunity. I learned even more about renewable energy .I got to work with all types of people from around the world.
good,"The company is very demanding and requires a high level of autonomy with the ability to work well with ambiguity. Not for everyone, but I really enjoy the demand and stress making!"
good,"Tesla is a great culture for those who are eager to prove themselves and excel at work. You won't last long if you are not able to meet your sales goals and collaborate well as a team player. Have to like to hustle and willing to be flexible about what your job entails. Also need to be a go-getter if you hope to advance. Lack of upper management guidance can make things hectic at times, but you feel you are helping to change the world toward a more sustainable future. Making steady progress toward accomplishing the corporate mission underlines everything they do."
good,Tesla was well stuctured fast paste company all about persision well management and hard workers constantly pushing us to work as hard as we could they only wanted the best of the best
good,The atmosphere at Tesla is unlike any other. Fast change. more often then not you are surprised in one way or the other. Always keeps you on your toes .
good,"Responsible for the day-to-day coverage of production equipment: respond to alarms, breakdowns and production requests promptly and efficiently to minimize downtime. Diagnose equipment failures, find root cause and communicate actions taken to the rest of the team. Install, maintain and repair mechanical and electrical systems, factory automation PLC’s and robotics. The first responding problem solver who manages machine breakdown recoveries to keep production running."
good,"Tesla is a very forward thinking company that is trying in innovate the automotive industry, with heavy emphasis on personal growth.  The company relies heavily on the tenacity and work ethic of its employees.  It is very fast paced company to work for, and the down side is that it is very stressful.  The Mission statement is to move the automotive industry to a sustainable energy.  Is so doing, they are paving the way to do so.  Because they are the first, there is an expectation of the employees, of all levels, to make policy to help them to achieve that goal.  High expectations and problem solving skills are a must.  As well as the ability to adapt to rapid change."
good,fast pace for younger people no union they push you too much to inspect more and more cars. from 100 to 200. the owner expecation are high for him but too high for employees
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is that I can get to meet and talk to people who are sociable and friendly. Environment is the best. Management is okay. I had learned how to rework and assemble the parts.
good,"Overall, Tesla is not a bad place to work. Benefits are very good (with the exception of lack of 401k contribution), pay is decent, and most of the people are great. Problem is, pay raises are very small, advamcement is difficult, and based on my location, management is not very well thought out. Despite numerous complaints to HR about problems with management at my location, nothing has been done. Due to this, we are stuck with management that is defensive to constructive ctiticism and reacts emotionally based on anger instead of thinking things through. Due to this, employees are feeling beat down and the job search has become contagious."
good,"What can I say, Tesla has grown up from its start up roots to a full blown corporation. My time spent there was transformational in learning how to sell a vision to people that haven't even heard of the company to launching 4 different models over a several year span."
good,they were always to busy to help took me 1 month before I was able to start working. working long hours everyday until we met the quota 12 hour day 6 days a week
good,"I like to work in Tesla. I not want to leave, I've been working for Tesla 4 months. But I haven't arranged my job, I need a management position. Because I have the ability to do the job well. But I never got it."
good,"There is a lot of work to get accomplished, with unrealistic goals set by management, which were never met.  They hire a lot of very young, smart talent, with very little to no experience which enables a cut-throat type of environment."
good,"I work in the scheduling department for Tesla Energy (on the solar side of things) and while the company is great, since they acquired SolarCity they took their management with it. Since the acquisiton the people that have been kept and promoted in management are doing a terrible job and the employee morale is way low, to the point where employees are trying to unionize, schedule days where everyone calls out, etc. The same people who have been here for years are making as much as four dollars an hour less than people just starting. As a company Tesla is great, they offer us good benefits at low cost and offer a lot of extra curricular learning activities and sponsor things like employee sports."
good,"Working at tesla was a cool and interesting oppourtunity. I learned to push myself, grow and develop new skills. I recommend this job to anyone mechanically inclined."
good,"Compared to the traditional automotive industry, Tesla prides itself on being different, almost to a fault.  Hours are comparable, and if your goal is to maximize your performance in a service role, you'll be fine. If you approach it as an opportunity for advancement, you're better off if you DON'T have traditional automotive experience."
good,Usually it was 12 hours of fast paced work. I learned about standardized work and 5S work standards. Management can be good or bad depending on your department. great culture and you meet lots or new people. sometimes you have to work weekends too but the money is great. You don't have time to spend it though sometimes..
good,Leuk bedrijf met de toekomst van elctro autos  veel geleerd in de electro storing diagnoise sleutel werksaam heden
good,"If you do not like working then you wouldn't enjoy working for Tesla. Tesla demands a lot from its employees and there is no shortage of overtime. The culture and colleagues are great, you won't find better people, but come end of quarter you will end up knowing them more than you may like! Think 60-80 hour work weeks where your schedule is: wake up -> work -> sleep -> repeat. If you are comfortable with that then you will love working at Tesla! If not, then maybe it isn't the right spot for you."
good,"A wonderful company.  The health, dental and vision benefits are the best I've had so far.  The people I work with are supportive and a team mindset really permeates the company.  Although the work pace can be hectic at times at the end of the day you leave with a feeling of a job well done."
good,nice people and a fun place to work . All the people are nice to me and everyday is a joy to work there. Parking is challenging but you learn to adapt.
good,"Good place to work while looking for a career Job. It's a nice place to work, but you'll never make enough to retire. Our team was an A+ team and I loved working with the individuals that I got to work with."
good,"fast paced, stressful, cut throat. move up, get raises, lots of people to work with, always new things to learn and do. something always going on, a good place."
good,Jobs are easy to learn. There is a lot of room for advancement at tesla. I learned several different jobs in different areas. The culture is fun and enjoyable. Hardest part of the job is hours.
good,Could improve on focusing more on the employee and the needs for a job with proper tools. Couple of people have died in here and I feel like they didn’t care as much.
good,"my area atleast we still working 12 hours a day "
good,"Very different from your typical dealer, but change is always good. Great benefits and amazing opportunities with potential for growth. Fast paced and always on the cutting edge of technology."
good,"We tend to work a lot of hours. But overall its a good company with a good mission.  Being middle aged I feel that the opportunities for advancement are limited. Like tech companies they think that anyone over 40 has no new ideas. We all know that's not true. But that's  is the world today,"
good,"If you want to work at Tesla, be ready for a very demanding and high paced corporation. If you are willing to accept this, you will quickly feel the vibe that ""You are changing the world"" is alive and strong at Tesla. Unfortunately the pay is not where some of the other big name tech companies are, but the stock is always moving and the atmosphere is welcoming and inclusive, even if extremely demanding."
good,"- Busy days"
good,"I really love the direction that the Company is going in and I loved working there, but the management can show favoritism to certain employees at times."
good,Best thing about Tesla is you get to work with very motivated people who are very keen about finding a solution to the problem and it's intellectually stimulating.
good,"Tesla has a good work culture , there are growing pains as they are growing at a rapid pace. However with many changes happening all he times, sometimes things seem to be happening without complete thought."
good,tesla has a wide range of opportunity for  advancement.   The culture is the best part about this company and  the hardest about the job would be the very long long hours that are required.
good,"Meet and greet customers."
good,"Tesla is adapting to the processes of the American workforce, and has room for development. Contractors are not afforded the same level of benefits and privileges, but that will chance once becoming a salaried employee."
good,Very productive and exciting work day. Keep updated with latest trends and product knowledge is a must! A great place to expand your knowledge and grow confidence.
good,"great company with a great ethos, work life balance could be a bit challenging at times, but overall a great place to work and would recommed to anybody"
good,"Work varied on a weekly basis, between  building and testing newly designed test equipment for the Tesla Powers Electric Drive Systems, Installing Test equipment, Building wiring harnesses, trouble shooting and repair of equipment.  Worked with an outstanding manager and several seasoned engineers.  Loved the challenge of developing new equipment.  Hardest part was working with new engineers just out of college with no real life experience in electronic circuitry and wiring."
good,"A typical day at work consists of answering emails, packaging the equipment and calling to schedule orders with freight forwarders, filling out commercial invoices or Bill of Lading, and at the end of the day, 5s and complete an excel spreadsheet containing the amount of  orders that shipped and the total amount shipped that day. "
good,"Tesla is a company with a great direction but is striken by poor managerial decisions.  Most of my coworkers are incredibly passionate about what they do and supporting Tesla's mission.  Tesla pushes all of its employees to strive for greatness and do more than they think they're capable of.  However, the upper-lower level management does not communicate directives well, and does not take feedback from employees."
good,"This company is very promising with a lot of changes that are happening constantly for its improvement and you'll learn a lot as long as you keep up with the rapid changes. There's a lot of talented workers who works at their absolute best but there are times, you can't get away with some challenges that come from different perspective; from design, to material, to equipment, to process and to people which makes this company unique in its own way for making things happen especially under extreme pressure in meeting the daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly targets. The hardest part is when pulling through those challenges with not enough materials, lack of manpower, and with the equipment going down in some cases, but those times were the most rewarding time once you know everyone is working in a team effort and giving their very best."
good,"Ambiente de trabalho receptivo e produtivo. Excelente núcleo de pesquisa nas áreas de Eletrônica de Potência, Máquinas, Acionamentos e Fontes Alternativas de Energia. Ótimo lugar para desenvolver conceitos e habilidades técnicas. Sem dúvida trouxe grande aprendizado nas áreas citadas, no desenvolvimento de projetos e na área de instalações elétricas industriais."
good,We are changing the world and the way people perceive cars. You have to be committed and believe that what we are working on is possible.
good,Fun place to work! and a lot of opportunity to learn and tons of friendly people who are very much treat you like a part of their family
good,Friendly work place and it was a good opportunity to work with this company.
good,"Cordial atmosphere, great/talented people; Amazing platform to learn and simultaneously perform. Must be proactive to work and have fun at the same time!"
good,good place to work really grwat benefits. good management. enjoyed the traveling. alot of overtime and good for a single person. real great co workers
good,I really can't comment on how Tesla is now. I was there from the beginning to before the IPO so things are vastly different now. My experience at Tesla is most likely atypical as I had a difficult time fitting in with their constantly changing management and at the same time was more dedicated to their cause than anyone else in the company. If there was anything that I learned that I will carry with me the rest of my life it's that value and integrity don't always get you higher up the corportate ladder but will get you in a better position in life.
good,"A typical work was not as I expected. At times the self respect was not there. There was more labor work than actual inspection work. The hardest part of the job was to adjust to ever changing small hall ways of the Giga-Factory and its robots.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with many good people, the ones that really work hard for the company and worked with their heart and sole."
good,learned to become specialist in every aspect of the job. multi tasking is very enjoyable and fun. great benefits and workplace is favorable if you assigned in a warehouse aside from the main warehouse
good,"Dynamic, fast pace culture.  Brilliant co-workers."
good,I made a lot of new friends and learn a lot from people there got to meet a lot of new people and learn a lot about the forklift and also learn that sometime it’s the system not you
good,Tesla is a good place to work the management is fair and the people are cool it’s like a family there. My only problem is that the pay isn’t very good.
good,Working at Tesla I made great money and learned a lot. Was trained on many different things but due to it being a car company the solar side of the business had many layoffs and the job security at the time was to up and down.
good,"Constantly pushing at the forefront of automotive technology. Benefits are amazing, like no other company I've ever been with. This company is the company of the future!"
good,"I've been with Tesla for 6 years. Within these 6 years, I worked my way up to an Associate Manager position. This place is what you make of it. "
good,"I enjoyed the work, I personally got along with all my managers. some were more demanding then others , but I never allowed that to get to me like some others in the shop. I got paid fairly, but others did not. They will promote but it is rare. They will have you do crew lead job but continue to pay as an installer 1. which is almost $10 an hour less."
good,"Get 3-4 days off a week while maintaining 40 hours,amazing benefits, great pay. The culture is a little bit like high school. Free shuttles to work. Get paid to carpool. Room for improvement in the management chain. Overall a great place to work."
good,"Work hard, play hard. Fast paced, constantly evolving company with easy potential to move up. Positive culture where you aren't micromanaged and can freely discuss ideas with others."
good,"Overall great place to work, benefits were amazing  and very affordable, typical day was very fast paced, management was more concerned with themselves than the employees though. Immediate shop leaders were more like mediators between shop techs and management."
good,I have to say that when I first began working for Tesla I was almost star struck to be apart of such an amazing breakthrough in the electric car industry.
good,"Advancement in the company is tough but keep in mind that is VERY competitive. You have people around the world who wants to be apart of the revolution with is Tesla. It’s up there with apple and google, so you have many trying to do more and get more of that slice of pie. I have a degree in for business with experience, but they have me as a production associate, which is not bad but if you coming fresh off of college, you need to network like crazy if you really want a chance to move up. Anyways it’s a good company but be prepared to work your til off"
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Tesla for a summer. As an intern, I was shielded from some of the craziness, but it was definitely there for me to see. I had the opportunity to do work that actually mattered; definitely not a place where you can get by for long without adding value. You won't get the same level of cushy benefits as you do at other Bay Area companies, aka free meals, but Tesla will give you the pedal to the metal work experience that will be sought after anywhere else."
good,"Great pay great benefits great place to get hired on permanently fast paced environment absolutely love it."
good,"It's was a great company work for, with new and fresh challenges. However turnover rate was to high. It seemed every month a team would get let go. It was absolutely crazy."
good,Tesla is a fun place where you can get tons of experience and actually learn alot. But only thing is if it had some type of guidelines to let you know what qualifies for a level 4 and 5 Tech
good,"Great place to work. Culture allows you to grow your knowledge, Pays Salary too,I have learned many major ( MES L2L,).work lots of hours or overtime,Work days and night are flexible to allow for family issues. co-workers were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Company was very driven by their mission, to the point where they didn't always care about their people. "
good,Tesla is a very exciting place to work.  Very dynamic and fast paced.  Constantly changing and evolving environment.  You need to be very creative and imaginative when working at Tesla.  Demands a lot of dedication and commitment.
good,"I worked with several great people here, its a new company, there will be changes made as they evolve into a global force. I worked previously with Mercedes Benz in the same fashion, they(TESLA) have a good base but could use stable key players to make a push for excellence, as established auto manufacturers do."
good,"Worked over 80 hours a week many weeks. Upper Management was terrible. I absolutely love the people, and the mission of what we do. Learned how to grind and have the allure of working for Tesla. The company is still young and figuring it out."
good,"Long hours with often necessary overtime"
good,Fast pace. Always work to do. Very intelligent people to work around. I would recommended to friends or anybody hard to get into but worth it if you do. Thw culture very adoptable.
good,Each day can bring new challenges and tests of my creative ability. Work hours and AWS shift rotation allow for a good work/ life balance. Management is a little hands off but sometimes that is good. Fairly good comradery where I work. Coffee and some free food are available.
good,Great place to work out of college if you are looking for some initial big name resume experience. Company is sincere in its desire to change the world through clean energy adoption. Products are also first rate. Management is much improved and career growth is more supported.
good,Tesla is a very fast paced and very competitive environment to work at. The company offers courses and certifications to help production associates advance positions.
good,"You will never be bored, this work place is fast pace and forever changing. You need to be able to adapt quickly and handle stress and pressure to meet deadlines. You will also deal with a great amount of people of all different backgrounds. You will learn a lot in the end."
good,good place to work at and great work atmosphere all employees try to help each other to have a better work day. management is not as supportive of employees.
good,Exciting place to work. Elon Musk is the greatest person for the future of America. Working with a company that trying to change how America and the whole world thinks is fantastic.
good,"Typical day at work was to complete 50 cases a day. These cases were double checked for accuracy before completion. An employee would work from the queue everyday and answer emails as well. I learned a lot about state taxes, financing and overall how to determine customer eligibility for loan approvals. Management was OK. There is a lot of narcissistic behavior but aside from that management was helpful at times too. Workplace culture is pretty liberal. The hardest part of the job was working holidays such as Christmas Eve and New years- sometimes thanksgiving. The most enjoyable part was having happy hours and mingling with other co workers from different departments."
good,The culture is good but it can get draining to do sales at Tesla due to the tough obstacles to reaching objectives. Great product and evolution but hard to move forward from role
good,"Excellent in training, and understanding of work life balance.  Environment fostered injuries to advance work performance.  Very open to new ideas and processes."
good,We are hardworking and polite we satisfy our customers we dont own any our staff money we have good manager and good staff they all doing their work and we dont i learn vision assurance
good,"Working with technology fascinated my mind from the moment I was introduced to programming. The ability to control and create something from nothing has always been extremely satisfying. As my interest in technology grows so does my desire to increase my contact to developing technologies through my career. However, closer contact alone does not correlate to a successful career. This is done through a desire to learn and a dedicated work ethic to not only increase myself but also the world around me."
good,Tesla has a great work environment. They are very specific on what they expect to produce and how. Overall great experience but the hours could have been better.
good,It has been great place for me overall to polish my skills and learn some new skills as well. A fast paced environment and surrounded by really intellectual people.
good,Perfect for the person that likes to multi-task in a fast paced environment.  Remain flexible with every new task assigned.  Employee stock purchase program.
good,"Working at Tesla requires a lot of time and dedication, however, knowing that you're working on an exciting product is rewarding and motivating. There is a lot to be done, and a lot of autonomy is required. Workplace culture is very positive and most people are happy to be there."
good,The overall mission of TESLA is very important. Accelerating the world to clean and sustainable energies is very important. There will be many areas that TESLA will impact the globe for a positive experience.
good,A typical day at work starts at 5;55 where we begin stretching to benefit us during the work day. We jump on the line and start work and its fast and productive and we try to reach our goal. The people you work with and the environment was in my opinion great. We got along and worked fast.
good,The culture here at Tesla is beyond awesome. There can be a few changes with the parking lot because if you get to work on time then it will be hard to find parking. There are a lot of commuters that have to take a shuttle that travels more than an hour. The department i work in (Metrology) is a great place to work. You are consistently working with engineers in a lab for the most part or sometimes you go on the floor to take measurements. There are all kinds of different measuring equipment as well. We have a data analysis team the we consistently communicate with in order to make engineers job easy enough to go through data. I would say the hardest part of the job is making sure we are giving out correct and consistent data so correct adjustments can be made if needed. The most enjoyable part of the job would be communicating with engineers and be able to build reports that they can make sense of. Its a great feeling of accomplishment.
good,"If you can hang with the crazy company direction changes and like a challenge this is a good fit.  Tesla is not only making cars, but supporting hundreds of thousands of PV and Powerwall energy customers."
good,The variety of responsibility within the role is both challenging and exciting. Company goals and products are great. Management is great but gets changes too frequently.
good,"Smart, hard-working, enthusiastic, and overall great people who work for the company. The mission is clear and the excitement for the future is real at Tesla. I spent my time at the Gigafactory as an intern and would love to return to Tesla again in the future. However some hours can be very long and work can be demanding. But the drive for a more sustainable future makes the long hours worth it!"
good,"I would love to work for Elon Musk again in the future whether it be at Tesla, The Boring Company, Space X, Etc..."
good,"tesla pay was good, however you lose your social life. they require long extensive hours that caused you to forget about your social life. good for single people who just want to work"
good,"Work pace was always very fast and dynamic. Employees must be prepared to take on multiple tasks. Management is always a bit in disarray, but that's understandable considering how busy everyone is."
good,"Tesla is a quick paced and stressful work place. It has amazing benefits and good pay, but you will find yourself easily working at least 60 hours per week. If you love your job at Tesla and Tesla's mission, this will not be a problem. Due to the fast pace at Tesla, you will be constantly learning new skills and will have opportunities to grow if you are a driven, quick learning individual. Aside from the stressful, long hours, Tesla is definitely one of the best tech companies to work at. There is an abundance of opportunity and growth."
good,"Lots of opportunity to advance for those willing to work and seek it. Company is growing and positions need to be filled. Great work environment. For my position I feel like the salary could improve, but not super bad."
good,"Tesla provide alot of free things over there. free sodas and cereals."
good,Challenging work atmosphere with scope for career advancement and personality development. A very good place to start your career in the field of manufacturing.
good,Tesla is a good company to work for with but the attendance policy makes the company have tremendous turnover.  The pay is above average and the benefits are top of the line.  It is a company I would recommend.
good,"Tesla is a great place to build your skills and to learn how to manage people. However there is very little room for advancement, and they definitely focus on new employees instead of the employees who have been there for a while. Because it's not a cash-positive company pay is done more through stocks over the course of 4 years instead of immediately. In order to keep up with the competitive market they are constantly adding new responsibilities to your plate without compensating for them."
good,Good point to start for a new graduate. Fast paced company with lots of expectations. Require employees to work 60-70 hours per week to keep up with the pace. Excellent learning experience.
good,Tesla is by far the best company I or my co-workers have ever worked at.  The work is fast paced and never dull.  The pace creates opportunity for growth as high as you'd like to go.  They certainly reward you for good work but can cut you for extended poor performance.  This is actually a benefit because you're always surrounded by top tier team members making you better in the process.
good,Long hours but well worth it. Tesla is a company of the future and an industry icon. A beacon of technology. A good place to be. I am ready to help Tesla move forward in their quest to better life as we know it.
good,"a nice youngster environment. A lots of young workers, and I liked the fact that has a lot's of Caucasian workers, it was a nice mix of cultures. Prior this mainly I worked in IT companies, where barely see Caucasians, dominated by Indians and Asians. I prefer when is a good mix of all cultures, and not dominated by 1."
good,"you need to be an expert at your job from day 1, 90 days later you need to be a professional. Great minds to work alongside, the most technologically advanced company that will be written about as the turning point in human history as the start of the self-sustainable energy revolution."
good,If you like working around cars and clean energy then that is the right place for you. Tesla offers great salary and benefits. Work/life balance can be overwhelming.
good,I have many stories and memories of working at Tesla. Many are that of meeting incredible people and working with incredible individuals. There is a lot of talent and energy at the company that makes it feel alive when you are working there. Some office politics do get annoying after awhile but I can't honestly compare Tesla's to that of another company.
good,When i was working at tesla it was a great job experience for me. I was with a temp agency so the contract was 6 months. In those 6 months i met a lot of friendly people and learned alot about the tesla car itself. Tesla is a great company with excellent benefits and pay.
good,"First off , it is not Tesla Motors, It's Tesla Electric : "
good,"Several individuals including myself are founding this company to help promote and introduce the next generation oilfield stimulation and completion equipment.  Growing environmental and safety concerns with diesel powered equipment used during cementing and stimulation has created a need for a paradigm shift in the way stimulation fleets are constructed and utilized.  Historically a large fleet of tractors and diesel powered high pressure pumps would arrive on location early in the morning, rig up and stimulate one zone returning to their base that evening.  Todays unconventional and conventional reservoirs are stimulated on multiple well pads, each well having with multiple frac treatments.  This process takes several days or weeks.  This change makes the use of electric generators powered by clean burning natural gas or propane, combined with skid mounted electric motors driving high pressure pumps practical."
good,I really enjoyed my time at tesla. on a typical day for me I would start at 4:30pm and work til 1-2am. for a limited time we were working 12 hour days because the demand for the tesla was so high and the company was just starting out so we had to produce. the management that I worked for was the best ive ever worked for. they really listened to the employees input so we had a real chance to make a difference here and change things for the better. all my co workers were good guys and we all worked well together. the hardest part of my job there was handleing some of the heavier material that was big and ackward like job 6 for instrance. but the most enjoyable part for me was driving the fork lift and unloading trucks with new material on them. I also would organize all the material onto shelves throughout the warehouse.
good,Typical work day is to come in and start assembling the battery module. I learned the importance of each battery cell and cations of overheating. The management was fair and willing to cross-train employees. My co-wokers were a pleasure to work with. I would say the hardest part of this job would have been inserting the cooling tube just because it was very sensible and rips easily. I really enjoyed testing the module and getting it ready for shipping.
good,Tesla is a newer company and the requirements for everyday work are fairly intense and is not something i would reccommend to anyone who is not completely on board with Tesla's mission.
good,Good experience and good management . The coworkers was great to work with. Learned a lot there. Enjoyed the time I worked there. My manager was great and taught me a lot.
good,"During the on-boarding process and any interactions with management they will tout the opportunity for advancement that the company has. However, this opportunity is not merit based, and simply isn't available until you've hit certain seniority benchmarks. Overall though, if you're looking for a job to just sit on and earn benefits with minimal personal or professional development, you can't do any better."
good,"I worked at Tesla for a little over two years. In that time, I had received four pay raises as your standard, run-of-the-mill warehouse worker. I worked harder than everyone else, and I was compensated properly for that. People that were lazy did not get raises, and were always eventually fired. If you're willing to work hard while you're on the clock, and you want to earn alot of money due to overtime, Tesla is the place for you. "
good,"Great work culture and the ability to communicate directly with other departments without all the manager interference (found in other companies) really helps expedite solutions."
good,"Great place to work, but it is very hard work. Must be able to work in extreme weather conditions. Physically demanding and must be able to lift heavy weight."
good,Everyone worked hard work together we laugh we joke we have potlucks carpool shadows overall fun place to where good environment east end up a lotto on your feet a lot
good,The Reman team that I worked for was an extremely collaborative team. They were welcoming to interns and cared about what we gained out of our internship.
good,"I gained a lot of experience working here. On the surface it might seem like we're just working on cars, but it's much more than that. There's a lot of nuance that goes with everything from the quality of the vehicle, to the people that you're working with. "
good,If you like being able to pick up hours this is the place. You can really save some money if your bills are in order. A lot of room for advancement within the GA lines. Hard work can go unnoticed sometimes when your working in areas where supervisors are not often present because leads can overshadow your credit.
good,Good benefits and a wonderful place to work if you forget your lunch regularly. They have a cereal bar and soda machines for free to employees. Good company to work for and so care.
good,It was a great place to work but be prepared to be on your feet. You meet many different types people. Be ready for early mornings and a lot of multitasking.
good,overall a good job some of the things they teach you give you real world experience. It teaches you about tech as well as cars and lets you get some insight into the car industry.
good,"Workng in the parts dept processing every par that comes into the building. Also process ups, fedex, and old dominion shipments. Take orders from local body and glass shops as well"
good,"General fast environment operations."
good,"I loved working for Tesla. Talking to a ray of different clients about why and what Tesla does. On the job you have opportunities to learn sales, marketing, operations, management. They really partner with you for your success. The workplace culture makes you feel apart of something bigger than sales or yourself, as if your small act of conversation can help change the world to a cleaner place. It was extremely difficult to have the fear of possibly being put on the chopping block as the company did lay offs very frequently. I will greatly miss working and collaborating with other Tesla employees."
good,A very fun fast paste work environment with motivated people with lots of team work and the desire to build the best possible product we can for the customer and the environment
good,"5 1/2 years, I loved it there. Great people, a shared interest and passion. Teams willing to collaborate. Great medical benefits! There's a constant buzz working there. Everyone is fully engaged with their jobs."
good,Tesla offer many opportunities  to advance your career. But you have to be willing to sacrifice many things and take chances. Tesla is a great company to work for.
good,"There were multiple people inspecting different products daily because management didn't want us to get bored of inspecting the same products everyday, all day. There were 3 shift options, which made it easy for many people because people have different schedules."
good,Energy is the main area that is developed in here. People that work here are young in average which create a nice environment. There is not much opportunity to grow.
good,"Tesla offered lots of opportunities and pays well. "
good,I have learned a lot from great people. Learned very effective time management skills. Management was very flexible and understanding. The most difficult part of being in the company is the amount of time I spent in the facility. Was away 12-16 hours at work at times.
good,"Communication is scarce, but always work to do.  Training is always available, competitive, lack of good leads.  Informational and long term security."
good,"Company has great benefits and pays well enough to survive off of. Tesla is growing very fast and they try to appreciate all of the hard workers, but many get looked over and aren't noticed soon enough. They work everyone a lot and your main priority has to be Tesla 100%. They can make you work overtime without you having any say and this agitates a lot of workers. Overall though it is a great place with a great impact on our society."
good,The position requires very proactive communication via phone and email. There isn't much micromanagement as they provide the tools for you to work at your own pace with a clear set of goals. I learned tons regarding the solar industry as well as the environment. The culture is mildly professional with the most difficult part of the job being the inexperience of management. The people and competitive pay made it an amazing place to grow in my career.
good,"Working for Tesla was awesome. I plan on going back. The atmosphere makes up for the lack in salary, and the management for direct hire employees is excellent."
good,"At a service center, it is fairly rough most days. There often is not enough coverage so I work long hours. Pay could be more for my position and all that I do for the service center. If I did about 1/2 of what I am doing now, I would be more than willing to keep my current pay."
good,"Good talents, not so good management. OK compensation. OK work/life balance. There are really talented people working there but also some average people as well."
good,"At Tesla you were expected to arrive at least 5 minutes before the morning meeting. At 8 o' clock you were supposed to be on the floor ready to start your shift."
good,Tesla is a great place to work just very fast paced and long hour and very unstable with the hours and pay. They however they advance so fast if management isn’t in your favor your could go stagnant
good,The service and sales departments are owned and operated by te factory. In many ways it was very easy to get things done that may not be so easily done at a traditional service provider.
good,"Exciting place to work. Never a dull moment. Production trumps all."
good,"good benefits, fast paced, new factory with growing pains. "
good,"I was given the opportunity to work part-time for Tesla and love it! However, I know that those who work full-time have next to no work life balance. The company is taking on a lot right now. If you choose to work for this company you need to understand that you are expected to give a lot because so much is at stake. That being said, I've really enjoyed Tesla management and am honored to work for a company working to change the market so dramatically."
good,The work is intellectually stimulating.. Great benefits. Great culture and community. Talented leadership with years of experience. challenging work that requires you to always be on your A-game.
good,My typical day at work consisted of talking to every single person in the home depot and help them find what they are looking for and pitch the customers about solar and see they qualify to see if they can have an advisor out to their home to see how much they will save on electricity bill. I learned how to communicate more efficiently with customers and differentiate costumers that want to get to the point and those who like to be explained in detail of what we do. The hardest part of the job is definitely meeting daily quota on a slow day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the Friday meetings we had where we all talked about how we can better our sales.
good,Lots of things to learn in a fast-paced environment. Great career growth opportunities.  Culturally diverse. Decent pay. Pride in the product is evident in everyone who works there. Nice place to work.
good,I enjoy working for Tesla. My day to day is challenging and exciting. There is never shortage of things to do or learn. Workplace culture has morphed with the acquisition of SolarCity. Feels more start-up like with a younger crowd but still has the competitive Silicon Valley edge. The hardest part of my job is supporting sales. The most enjoyable part of my job is supporting sales.
good,"Overall enjoyed working at Tesla.  Good Benefits and insurance. Provides snacks, coffee, water, vender café and machines. long hrs. 12 hr. shifts. but, a lot of time off. great schedule."
good,"I currently work at Tesla and love it here!"
good,"I loved working here it was fast paced, lots of information and new information continuously so it never got boring on the job. and the co workers were very nice and helpful."
good,Tesla is really exciting to start working for but once you star the grind it can get repetive and you can start to feel under utilized especially in my position. I took this technician job in hopes of being able to move up the ranks to engineer (I have my degree in mechanical engineering) but it looks to me as if that might be as simple as I thought. The probationary period is one year in order to even be considered for moving positions within the company. EOL Tech hours are long and can get monotonous with spots of utilization when working with engineers. Its just not where I want to be right now.
good,I love to work in Tesla - Looking for the change to just work in different environment and to learn new things
good,Be extremely good at what you do and be passionate about their mission if you want to be successful. A great place to continuously learn and grow for early stage career.
good,I enjoyed my experience at Tesla it was fun and ended too soon and without warning I had an interview and then my contract ended without any reason if I can change anything there one thing I would change is letting people go without warning or Reason
good,great place to work with lots of hours good place to advance your career to take it to the next level if your work with the right manangement people you can go really far working with this company it also is located in a amazing location.
good,"Tesla is a great place to work if your passionate about sustainability, perform well in ambigous environments and are willing to work hard."
good,im not going to lie I learned a lot from tesla they taught me a lot about paying attention to detail. Anyone can work for tesla its just are you going to be committed and are you going to want to learn because when I was their I wanted to learn everything I didn't want to just sit their stacking material at the end of the conveyor I wanted to run a machine and get my hand dirty and really learn how the vehicles are made.
good,"Good compensation , good travel opportunities, good management, "
good,It's a great job with great benefits and a lot of mobility for moving up in the company the people that your work with very knowledgeable and gear to help.
good,Fun things to see like how a car is put together along with feeling how they care about the employee along with gaining experience in a new line of work
good,"Its a very good place to work , very good benefits  and pay. The only down side is that they have really long hours and hardly higher girls. My experience here was incredible"
good,Learned a lot about auto industry but theres no room for advancement here. Transfers are hard to get and pay could be better. No raises. only bonus are the stocks and 401k
good,"A typical day is doing audit, inspection and engineering trials. Learned different hand tools and mechanical tools as well.Learning the processes of building a car. Learning different parts of the car and it's function. "
good,"The people and technology make this a great place to work. There is always work to do, many challenges present if willing to take them on."
good,"L'aspetto interessante è che non ci si ferma mai nell'ampliare le proprie competenze, gli aspetti tecnici sono affrontati secondo un fondato criterio scientifico seguito da un aspetto pragmatico."
good,"Every day I had to inspect cars, which was fun. I am a huge car enthusiast, so taking pride in how the cars were engineered and how important it was to not miss any mistakes.  Co-workers made it fun, everyone would help each other out which was amazing."
good,exciting place to work with new technologies being developed. Huge facitlity need a good pair of walking shoes. Worked with some very talented engineers.
good,"Love the overtime, sure it is true sometimes you work 10-16 hours a day up to 7 days a week but if you're saving for something like a house and are single than enjoy it. Recently with cost cutting measures the OT IS GONE but never the less it is still a fun job. I have learned much about the engineering of the car and have refined my knowledge of electrical theory since. Co-workers are great and I have friends from various departments which makes it a very friendly and team oriented environment. My superiors are willing to teach me but they will put pressure on you to preform. The employee stock purchase plan is a great incentive, you make quite a nice payout when the term is over. Job security is my only gripe, it is scary to see someone monday and find out they were laid off or fired by wednesday. All in all a great place to work and build a career."
good,I am capable of doing everything and i feel this is a great job for me
good,Tesla is changing the industry to make sure the world's transition to sustainable energy happens as soon as possible by introducing new products and much more accessible prices.
good,"Working at this job was one of the easiest job I had EVER had in my life! "
good,"love area where im at for models s/x enjoy working with fellow co-workers."
good,"Was fast paced, and competitive, great team work. Lots of room for growth and promotions. Need for attention to detail and ability to work well in a team and thoroughly"
good,"growth too fast and too chaotic to have a structural base"
good,good company to work for the boss was a nice person and great people to get along with overall its a good company with good benefits and good hours even though sometime there is alot of employees but the environment was a good place to work at and good break
good,Give us your opinion about a typical day at work what  yo learned management workplac euture the hardest part of the job the most enjoyable part of the job
good,"Tesla is a great company if your looking for growth, a very diverse group, and gives   a lot of hours if you have a goal to reach. Fast paced company that keeps you on your toes."
good,"You really need to be ready to put in the hours and have a strong work ethic. Tesla is a growing company that also allows you to grow."
good,"Always loved working for Tesla! In the beginning it was excellent. As the cost cutting started it got worse. We never knew if we were going to be the next to lose our job. Then it happened. I made it through 6 cuts with SolarCity/Tesla. The last one got me. I have absolutely no regrets for the time I spent with Tesla, and would definitely still be there if they hadn't closed my office."
good,"working at tesla was a great experience everyone was really competitive, work was getting done and management was on top of the game which helped work flow really smooth."
good,"all that hard work just to be laid off. the pay and benefits were killer but the stress of the ork kinda got to everyone. Then, as soon as we all start to feel comfy, they laid off the whole office."
good,"公司产品和业务模式领先"
good,"many intelligent and motivated employees whom are passionate about their work"
good,"Great environment, management its always there for you, everything its super easy its only up to you if you want to go above and beyond the expectations, you can learn inbound and outbound in 1 moth."
good,I have no complaints regarding Tesla. I will thank them everyday for opportunity they have given me. I'm grateful for the steady paycheck and enjoyed working along side many terrific people.
good,When I first came to Tesla it was great for a yr. then they started laying people off.  After the first layoffs they would change the rules hrs. jobs almost ever 3 mos.  It made it very uncomfortable you never know what's next or who's next.
good,"People there are super friendly. Loved working outside everyday. Would check in transported cars, inspect them and drive them to different locations. I learned how to properly do inspections on vehicles and to manage off site lots of cars. Management was awesome, they always listen to what you have to say. In fact I you have a better/efficient way of doing something, speak up, they encourage that. I worked with alot of characters, all my coworkers made my time there fun. The hardest part was end of quarter where the work load sometimes triples or quadruples. Pay was awesome."
good,Working at Tesla was a great job I would have stayed if I did not have to relocate back to Houston the people there were friendly a family atmosphere and a great place to work
good,"TESLA is a great company to work for - their initiatives are all in the right place, compensation is reasonable, and management as a whole is really empowering. I would say that because right now is a volatile time that you should expect to consistently face changing  goals."
good,"Working at the Tesla Gigafactory 1 was an amazing experience; albeit high stress at times. The benefits start immediately which was nice and the reason I went to work for them. You do run on 12 hour shifts which can be long at times. When I worked there, there was no cap on overtime so you could work as long as you want. If you wanted to get into Management, you really had to pull strings hard as everyone was bringing their friends along. That meant sometimes not very good leaders where brought in. Overall, management is nice and accommodating. One of the great downfalls of Tesla is not rewarding great talent when due. I was a great employee (according to my lead and my supervisor) but AM's and M's (associate managers and managers) had no idea what some of the things from supervisors down did on the daily. I worked with AM's and others across departments to solve the many issues plaguing Model 3 production in regards to getting parts from the factory to service side of Tesla. Not including my regular dangerous goods processing and assisting with Model 3 production. I wont go into detail, but to me, management had NO idea what was going on and the leg work and I did and many others to make a clear processes for fulfilling parts requests for service.. That was very frustrating as I wanted to be compensated (pay raise) working overtime a lot and working off hours at times as well. I was never NOT on my email. "
good,The managers are supportive with the day to day task we're given. We recently had group meetings to discuss what's new that's been released for our team. The only thing that can be less assuring is job security. You would need to move different departments if you would want to advance.
good,tesla is a good career lots of good benefits and the work is really easy long hour even over time lots of discounts and nice size bonuses good raises thumbs up
good,its a  good job just the right hours for me. its a really physical job but it the days go by fast. great benefits. coworkers are great i really like working with and for them
good,"Loved it, except for the long working hours and many changes that happens all the times within the company. Every now and then they do a purge and get rid off personnel that are not producing. You worked with the fear you might get fired at any time just for no reason."
good,"I had a great time there, it’s a positive work environment. My supervisors were very helpful and understanding. The hours and the pay were fair. It was very close to my residence"
good,"If you can keep up with the pace, there is ample room for moving up in the company as long as your numbers are good. I was in sales, so it was a very numbers oriented position. Management got better as I was leaving but some did not look out for the little guy."

good,"Seal all open cervixes on about 200 vehicles daily"

good,Best part of the job is learning how Tesla vehicles are built and assembled. It’s a fast pace job but it’s all muscle memory after a while and the position becomes so easy
good,While working for tesla things were everchanging. The job i had trained for and done for months could be eliminated leaving me to start training again in another area. There was never any warning that my job would change. Also once you choose a shift you are more than likely stuck in said shift so make sure you can handle it.
good,"the position was to create your own business within Tesla and generate premium leads based on the trust you earned from customers. "
good,"Currently, I am an intern with the Production Control team in the Fremont factory since January 2018."

good,Tesla is a great place to work! The compensation is great with great benefits. Its a fast pace company with a high turn around. The hours are good and the people are smart.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is having excellent rapport with my team. The least appealing part is navigating around a high volume of other employees. It is not a relaxing or restful place to eat lunch and unwind, have personal calls while on break or decompress in between job duties. There is a clear separation with the production floor and the office side, although open door approach is stated."
good,Tesla has a great benefits package and the plant almost has a Campus feel.  The parking situation is horrible but there are other options Tesla provides its employees regarding transportation to and from work in the form of shuttle to public transportation hubs and others.  The pay isnt the greatest.
good,"Easy work that is fast paced. Lots of overtime when working out of town. Schedule gets tough around summer, job security is not an issue unless you don't follow safety procedures. Lots of opportunity to advance in field knowledge."
good,Responding to problems on the production line.  I enjoyed trouble shooting the robots the most. i had a good team of experienced professionals that trained me.
good,"Great place to work at, co workers are awesome.  Working at tesla does not feel like a job, everyone is friendly management is awesome and the pay is great."

good,"People are willing to help. it is a good working environment. very dynamic. Work life balance can be a little challenging. However, If you plan to work for a company that can change the future. Be prepare to work your  butt off."
good,Nice place to work with.You get to experience nice environment and co employees are really helpful and supportive.manager and supervisor are nice.:)))
good,I learned vast amount of things that will benefit my future and keeps me seeking more. Had to train myself in most things but that was the fun part and why I take so much pride in my work.
good,You will experience long hours on your feet. You will learn what hard work is all about but it is an amazing experience. Boys will turn into men at this job.
good,"Great working environment, stressful at times. Great benefits offered by Tesla. Opportunities endless for advancement. Great management and upper management"
good,I was a temporary worker but i enjoyed working for Tesla and i would not mind working for Tesla again. If given chance i love to work for a company like that.
good,Working 12 hours a day mostly 5 days a week but sometimes 6 days a week depending on the need and production. Very fun to work and also very competitive and masculine. Working continuously at least 2 hours repeatative jobs and get 15 minutes break plus 45 minutes lunch break.
good,Got to work on interesting projects even as an intern. It varies by team but mine was a great place for learning new skills and was open to constant improvements in software development practices and methods.
good,The company serve a nice breakfast for there employees but the work load is to much and you need to drink energy drinks all the time to do your fast pace job.
good,my experience has been fantastic I can honestly that i love going to work. also i enjoy the work schedule very much on the count that with all my days added up i only work half of the year
good,"Good place to work at good wages and good benefits, management is good, but could still be improved, work environment is clean and prides on safety, overall good place to work"

good,the job that i did was really fun. i worked really long hours and i spent most of my time in that factory. the managers there are really cool and i enjoyed working with the other employees.
good,"Tesla is a great place to work to get experience in a fast paced start up that blew up into a huge entity that receives a lot of global media attention. With a CEO as a celebrity who also works on multiple other projects/companies, it is interesting to be a part of something great!"
good,"It was a passion for me to work in Safety. I enjoyed my job and learned something new everyday. Everyone was fair and open to feedback that I had. I would love the opportunity to someday return to work at the Gigafactory for another company,"

good,"Great Company to work for. They take good care of their employees. Everyday seems to go buy very fast, it's a fast paced work place. Many of people enjoy the atmosphere."
good,"Great place to work with a nice balance of work and home. I worked four twelve hour shifts with three days off a week. Starting pay was $17.00 an hour with a raise every six months of about a dollar. However you are on your feet for just about your whole shift and some of the management can be hard to work with at times, but definitely a great job to be at."
good,Tesla is fast paced and dynamic.  Everyone is driven by the Mission which makes the work day easier to focus on the overall goal.  Brilliant people working towards a better future.
good,"learned about different machines"
good,i had a great work experience working for Tesla it kept me busy and intrigue to learn more about the company thank you for the work.
good,I love working at Tesla. I have learned so much in the pas year and a half. I feel like I have grew as an employee and I would love to have some experience in a different position withing the company.
good,"A great place to work. Work hard, earn your place. Must be able to be flexible towards work hours. Free snacks and drinks. Co-workers make work enjoyable. Hardest part of the job is working lots of OT. Most enjoyable part is being able to work in an environment that is like a start up."
good,"A typical day in Tesla is like a any company, maximize the productivity as much as we can, the hardest part is work 12 hours six days at week ."
good,"Fast paced environment. Fun place to work for. Always busy. There is always room for growth. Tesla is growing, and is such a good company to work for."

good,"Tesla has endless opportunities.  Plenty of room to move up the ladder and learn many skills.  Tesla offers multiple schedules, job duties, and projects."
good,place was good to work at but depending on the department and paint was by far the worst got injured their 3 times working their and when talked about transfer cant do it.
good,This was a learning experience that I will use in my future.  Great moral and very understanding and helpful management.  The culture of the workplace was very considerate and open.
good,Only advice I can give is learn as much as you can as quickly as possible  you will be moved around on the line to fill in fir someone or when u rotate  training is hands on and not very long
good,I loved the management and culture. There is no room for slackers. This company has goals and you are expected to have laser focus to help achieve them.
good,Great place to work and great employees ... perfect work environment and work loads not to much and not to little which left time for a family life.  A over all excellent place to work
good,Excellent mindset with employees towards work and life. Driven people. Very caring towards life situations.They want to help in anyway in your progress but the company is constantly changing so movement gets put on hold at times preventing promotions.
good,"After cutting our commission I am being forced to leave the company that I have come to love after just over a year of working for them.  The compensation is less than fair, but the benefits are unmatched."
good,"It was an amazing place to work. The CEOs really value the employees, from front office managers to the newest of operators. The benefits they offer are absolutely amazing, and most of it is covered by the company."
good,"-drive to customer's home to conduct site survey"
good,"Working at a service center is faced paced but a lot more rewarding  than any ""big-oil"" dealer. Back in ""the old days"" the perks for new hires were more than gracious. I've read you no longer get the stock options that would literally buy you a modest house later in life if you weren't blowing it on new iPhones and Chinese made designer- consumer goods."
good,The management team is a huge plus and the people are amazing. The work life balance is not there and the target goals can be a bit unrealistic. I miss the people not the company.
good,"I worked at Tesla as a contractor for few months, the manager was placed at the Las Vegas location from Draper Utah he was awesome, I recommend Tesla."
good,the work place was fun and outgoing. coworker were easy to get along with and always worked as a team. made sure we achieved our goal at the end of each day
good,"I believe Tesla is the precursor for major technological advancement in this century."
good,Tesla is a demanding company but very rewarding. You work with the best of the best every day and upper management was always very supportive. Great team environment!
good,"Good company to start a career with. Fast pace environment that needs self motivated employees. be prepared to work 12 hour shifts. Definitely have to be a solution orientated tech willing to think outside the box, and learn at a fast pace."
good,"The products are cutting edge.  The mission is inspirational.  The resources seem limitless."
good,"Tesla has a highly innovative, employee-driven environment that empowers you to be the best you can be while thinking outside the box. They are constantly striving for process improvement and believe that company success comes from hard work and collaboration. Heavy team emphasis while also having individual opportunity for autonomy. Their mission drives everything they do, so you must be on board to help change the world and have a passion for the transition to sustainable energy."
good,"By far the best place I've worked for, it does has it's flaws a new start up but I believe it'll get better. Aside from some poor managments in some departments, the recruiting team could be better. They need alot of help, they wiffed on alot of associates. other than that its a really good company."
good,"Easy going, good people, fun and exciting. They listen to ideas and if you’re a good working advancement comes to you. Very positive atmosphere and high quality equipment to work with."
good,This was my favorite job they shuttled us to work so we didn't have to drive we got free breakfast and lunch and the work was fast paced so the days were fast
good,"Great place to work! You must believe in the mission and give in 100% to enjoy it.   Give it a shot, you might find happiness in the workplace after all."
good,"Company is a great place to work but sometimes lacks appreciation. First month or two, you are being looked at as if you are doing right and following Standard Operating Procedures. After a while, things tend to change. When you ask questions, some associates are willing help and some are not. Overall, if are willing to deal with hard work, it is a good company."
good,"An amazing company to work for. I have realized customers continue to choose Tesla not only for its amazing vehicles, innovative technology but because Tesla's motto to go far and beyond for its customers. This has also helped revolutionize the automotive industry."
good,"If you don't mind working in retail it is a fun place, your coworkers are what make the job fun with the exception of an occasional event, benefits are amazing they actually paid me to have benefits, stock options and good 401k, employee discount is there but not the best, at my location there was difficult management because they were from retail stores not the automotive industry, this made moving up in the company a little more difficult but not impossible, work hard at this company and you will be rewarded."
good,Tesla has a wonderful outlook for our future of electric vehicles. They are a fast growing company and experiencing the challenges of growing so quickly. They have many innovative advances with their and their future is very bright.
good,Regular 8 hour shifts with optional overtime. Management not the brightest but also not the worst. Overall you are given the tasks and are expected to complete them before the days end.
good,"Love this company, supportive team, good management. I learned a lot when I was here and feel that my experience here carries a lot of weight to many other companies."
good,"As the company is starting up, the tasks are usrally flexable and sometimes requires some creativity. A lot of great opportunities for employee to learn different skills."
good,Each shift have a goal target of amount of car chassis to produced for that day and each day we start team leader inform the group what to start on and what the amount we need to assemble.
good,Stor trivsel i en spennende bransje med høy lærekurve
good,"The hard work and dedication pays off. As long as you are devote and honest about coming to work, and producing perfection. Work is challenging and never boring, Until there is production stump or alternative schedule. Tesla shows a great deal of it's appreciation to it's customers, but still has more work to do with it's employees. i missed the times when Tesla's employees, where valued and respected by other peers.And Not mentally abused by those, that should have never have been hired to begin with."
good,Typical day at Tesla was working on amazing electric vehicles and got to diagnose different concerns on a day to day basis. Fun work place environment and the most enjoyable part of the days working were that there was no sense of stress while working
good,Learned a lot while working at Tesla. Everyone strived for the same goal which made for a good environment to work in. Almost everyday was a new learning experience that kept me on my toes.
good,"Tesla is a fantastic company with strong culture. "
good,Everyine is very understanding. There's a huge thing with communication and that really makes the place thrive. Managers are very understanding with any life changes or emergencies. They even offer perental leave for both parents.
good,"It was a great environment, that encouraged personal and prifessional growth. With that being said, Tesla hires a lot of people very quickly which creates an extremely competative environment. In order to advance one must be head over every other employee with in your area of work; Wether it be exceeding expectations and taking on roles above your job description or gaining education to move within the company to a better role. You can not just do your job and expect to be a manager by your first performance evaluation, it takes time. Tesla offers many free and viable ways to advance personally and encourages its employees to take advantage of those programs, but one must seek their own path, they won't hold your hand through it. Understand that the conoensation and benefits are given because of the fast paced ""stressful"" and extremely competative work environment. If you thrive from moving and being pushed this would be an extraordinary career opportunity."
good,Tesla is very challenging but very rewarding in the end. The company treats everyone with the upmost respect and consider everyone opinion valuable to the company success.
good,I started on production line and move to different department fast to inventory then soon after became an analyst. They work with on your hours management is very professional
good,Tesla is a place where we all are passionate about what we do and it is intense but we love the mission. The team was genuine and the culture was great!
good,"Productive and fun workplace with pool table and ping pong table."
good,Working at Tesla is competative and is just a commute. They provide every essential to be able to work and show up. Work seems to repetitious for my life style. Need more tech ician role. H&R seems confused.
good,"At Tesla, we worked as a team. We wanted customers to have a one of a kind experience which catered to their needs. The objective was to educate customers on Tesla's mission and get them behind the wheel of a new Tesla feeling excited, and satisfied. Even though it was a fun environment, it was very professional as well. We pushed each other to succeed and made each other excited to work everyday."
good,"The people who you work with, the benefits and the company's mission is fantastic, but the work/life balance is hard and your days can get really repetitive."
good,It's up to you how many jobs on the line you want to learn. You just have to take the initiative. From there you can move onto better opportunities. (minimum 6 months on the line) You just have to put the work in.
good,"Tesla is a good place to work if you're willing to work hard and show up everyday. When people don't show up on time or for their shift at all, it makes it hard to run a production line. As long as you show perseverance and keep communicating with management on goals you want to achieve, you will be successful here. Management will listen to the associates when you talk to them. They are always open to new ideas."
good,"Overall provided plenty of opportunity for work, management allowed for a positive work environment, staff provided adequate training to effectively perform work requirements "
good,"great place to work, free breakfast every day unlimited to make sure the employees can function for the average 12 hour shift 6 days a week. is the S5 method maximizes the company and employees potential"
good,"Working as a production associate may seem a bit dull and redundant initially, but Tesla is a fast growing company that is always looking to be more efficient and to produce more product in a shorter time.Because of how fast the company moves and grows, this allows the opportunity for production associates to step up into lead and supervisor roles since it's always expanding and constantly hiring new people."
good,"This job is very awarding and it facilitates a great work environment based on teamwork and hard work. Conversely there isn't much say in terms of stability on hours. Whether you have kids at home or even in the event of a tragic event such as a death in family, medical issues, etc they expect you to work and to work when they say. If numbers are low then expect to work the entire month or even two months without a day off. They also schedule mandatory days of on key days to avoid paying double time for all your work. You can only monitor your pay in house and if they feel like telling you to work 12-16hrs you are expected to work without question. Most of this is known and expected but to the degree the will utilize this is unprecedented. I had gotten sick a month after the final quarter of my last year and was released shortly after my release from the hospital. Lack of human understanding when addressing personal issues. Numbers rule and are more important despite their claims."
good,"I learned about how to fix problems in a timely manner. Very good co-workers, love the environment that tesla represents."
good,The compensation for the work we do should be more than what we are currently getting. Other than that I love working for Tesla! The horus are long but the the days off are worth it
good,By modern I mean very business like and you are your best asset. Great teamwork by always helping one another excel past their goals. Great leadership in all roles. Everyone that works with Tesla believes in the mission and their services/products. I'd would have worked for the company as long as I could. Layoffs unfortunately. Hopefully no more..
good,"This is a great opportunity to join a rapidly growing technology company and have a direct impact on our customers as they take ownership of their new vehicles. Bring your passion for Tesla and a sense of adventure to help change the world, one vehicle at a time."
good,"I was at Tesla for about 3 months and it was a great experience! Once you get used to adjusting to the 12 hour shifts it’s a great place to work. There is a huge amount of people working there so you may come across employees you don’t life, but overall the good people outweigh the bad. I was sad to leave, but I only left because I moved out of the city otherwise I would have definitely stayed."
good,"Very fast paced environment that demands much from employees, but provides every opportunity for personal and professional growth. Management is extremely flat and response times and implementation are exceedingly quick because of it."
good,"The mission is embedded into every coworkers/management team. The company has weekly meetings to create a more proactive team and mindset, everyone is very open to new ideas and the ability to move up is solely on you. Met people who were promoted quickly because of dedication and ideas while others there for just money. Great company, great benefits, great mission."
good,"A typical work day at work is either very intense, or very relaxing, depending on what part of the factory (Gigafactory 1) you're placed. I've learned that you must ALWAYS be accountable for your contributions in your shifts, meaning it's imperative that you do your part during your shift; otherwise, shifts after yours will struggle in meeting production goals. Management/higher-ups are always very respectful and helpful in satisfying your needs as a worker. Orders are always given directly and clearly, and management are always very encouraging. The workplace culture includes high energy, positive vibes, and strong work ethic. The hardest part of the job would most definitely be getting around the factory... it's HUGE! The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to meet new people in various areas of the factory. My position entails that I'm flexible in my skill-set, meaning that I was able to work in multiple departments. Meeting very intriguing, cultured people everyday is great!"
good,The company isn’t bad at all the only thing I didn’t like is how they fired my entire team and then tried to relocate me to a new state other than that it is a great company to work for.
good,"Despite given stressers that come with the duties of any customer service position, Tesla Motors does all that it can to provide a comfortable and friendly work environment. "
good,"Most of the day was spent brewing coffe and cleaning cafe. "
good,"Loved it and would go back in a heartbeat."
good,My Review about Tesla is that it is a place where you have the potential to grow more and more also there would be a lot of hours being worked but they are enjoyed with the people you're around.
good,"gute Ausstattung des Arbeitsplatzes"
good,A competitive environment but not cut-throat. Supportive manager and flexible. People are friendly and commission and bonuses were very helpful. The days can seem long sometimes.
good,"Great atmosphere to work in. Not much physical labor. Clean and very well-kept work conditions. Amazing work schedule. Relaxed work. Able to climb the ladder to take your career to new heights."
good,It was a great job I had to leave because I got a head injury or concussion that kept me from working.  I was working for Volt as a contractor and was just getting hired on as a full tesla employee with all the benefits.
good,"his is best place to work, fun, educated, help each other, and well management. pay medial, dental, vision, providing school training, provide free lunch some time, shop party,...."
good,"Ótima empresa para se trabalhar, proporcionou novos conhecimentos."
good,"Very long hours and no job security after you give 100% every day . Management ran by un loyal  people in some departments "
good,"It is a known fact that Tesla employees work long hours, and don't get paid as well as other tech companies, but they aren't taken advantage of because they know very well what they are in for before signing the dotted lines. "
good,"Great company, Loved the work the only reason I stopped working for them is because they went out of business. I learnd a lot jumping around from ob to job in the company 10/10 would work again"
good,"Supply chain could use help developing, Pay is ok, but work life balance is very difficult unless youre single and dont mind working weekends and very long hours."
good,"Balance was very off, needed more pay for workers the benefits were bad but i needed the money, working here was fun to work, but i had no time to relax"
good,"Highly stressful, double work environment, Hurry up and wait mentality. Be prepared to be treated like the step child of the industry. Overall a decent place of employnent"
good,"Very fast paced, constantly challenging, high burn out rate. While I do feel like I am learning a lot, the constant need for emergency knee jerk reaction solutions is exhausting."
good,Good company people were great. I do think they could work on their internal career development as I left due to the lack of visibility in upward movement within the company.
good,It was ok to work at but no work life balance and as a worker felt exploited at times.. but overall it was a great start to my career and was a great foot in the door
good,"Good work place for the most part."
good,It’s not that hard of s job but it will keep you busy and there is plenty of work to do. The job can be tough at times especially if you’re not used to working Long hours and such.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Tesla"
good,Great place to work. Interesting new things to learn everyday. Great coworkers there. Sometimes you need to put in a lot of hours but it had improved later after I started working there in 2012.
good,"Definitely should not work at Tesla if you have a family. If job security is your thing, then probably not the best place. If you're aching for the mission, then by all means, but be flexible in your personal life."
good,"This company is great to work for, however like any new company there are constant changes to the operating procedures and often downtime for the production area. Beyond that the people you work with are great and the benefits are unmatched."
good,"Very Stressful work environment, But you learn A LOT. Co-workers are great and management is also very good. A lot of potential to grow within the company. Very long work days, but you gain a ton of experience."
good,"Tesla motors is a good company. if you don't mind working 12 hour days 6 days a week. keep in mind you will have no time to do anything else, friends,family,wife,husband you will have to sacrifice a lot. if your a single person and have no significant other then this is perfect job. they pay very well and have lots of benefits.you even get stocks if you stay the full 4 years. management is good."
good,"Fun but exhausting. Daily Production is a challenge but if you can survive, everything else is a breeze, good people, great working relationships. Blessed to have started with this Company and helped it be successful Just ready for a change."
good,Going to work the most times used to be fun when you have a great workers with you but management would be on your butt. And or try to stab you in the back my last manager completely didn’t like that I did not like what he would say to me and when I spoke up for myself. I was let go with no warning. Before Christmas
good,"Tesla is and is still probably the most hardcore company I had ever worked for.  During my almost 4 year tenure at Tesla, I saw many management changes, and company directional changes.  I learned that the company was a young startup and saw that it found it challenging to manage its ever growing work force.  We all know the mission, which is ""to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.""  The sheer scale of what that mission statement means is unfathomable for most until one is actually working in the company for so long.  Tesla tested my limits on many occasions.  I remember Elon Musk once saying that Tesla is like, ""the Marine corps of the auto industry.""  He wasn't kidding.  Tesla is famous for their end of financial quarter rushes in which they attempt to push out as many vehicle deliveries as humanly possible."
good,"When you work at Tesla, you are working to help make the world a better place. There is a lot of overtime worked, but it does not feel too bad because you enjoy what you are doing."
good,It was a good job. Can't complain about the work. The working all night. That's the hardest part. Becoming a vampire. Sleeping all day to work all night. Adjusting to that schedule and then having the high demand for work and having management who gets it but don't care. That's what was frustrating. The culture there is hit and miss. Some people are cool others arent. Enjoyed the free cereal and coffee. Helped me out.
good,"Muy buena empresa, con buena gente y buenos compañeros."
good,"Tesla has amassed a team of amazing people to work for them. They are out to change the world, in a very fast paced and dedicated work environment. Unfortunately there is little live-work balance."
good,i worked here temporarily and it was a great place to work. i met great people and i had a ton of fun interacting with everyone. the pay is good. the management was great and very friendly.
good,Long shifts that can separate your personal life. Can be called for 12 hour shifts or more. If you can withstand long amount of hours of standing and repetition
good,"Be yourself and open, don’t be afraid to speak up to the customers. They are there for you to sell them, work on presentation if you’re struggling with that, they are gonna want to speak with someone who knows what they are talking about."
good,"Great job, I had a lot of fun. It was amazing. Not much to complain about. My co-workers and higher ups were very understanding and helped me succeed."
good,sometimes i think the company need to understand we have a life beside working or 12hrs 6 days shift. we also come on our days off to help support or in need of more hours. we might run into a situation in life one day and we might need some time off. some people dont always have PTO. from my experience i been there for 4yrs and i cut off real easy. i feel like the job isnt secure alot people get cut off no matter how good of a worker you are.
good,"Every day is different. Employees banner together under communal motivation to deliver the best performance/product possible. Diverse groups of people bringing lots of different ideas to the table. Work schedule is dependent on getting your work done, which is easy when the work is often fun and interesting."
good,The benefits that Tesla provides are very good and not much out of pocket. You have to make sure you show up on time and you will be fine. I feel its a good place for someone with zero experience and can grow.
good,"I view Tesla as time well spent, but not an option for longevity. A lot of the experience depends on the specific area/group in Tesla, but most everywhere is pushed hard."
good,Be at tesla I learn the assembly line and putting a car together never really had experience before joining Tesla but glad I had the opportunity to learn.
good,The days are long but worth it because the people there are cool and the work isn't hard. I like that you learn new things every day.  It's cool that they really are hands on and teach you very thoroughly
good,"Me passaram tudo que puderam, assim vi que sempre posso contar com eles, pois a primeira coisa que aprendemos é que jamais poderemos trabalhar sozinhos."
good,i was assigned at battery assembly for Tesla Model 3 and it’s was so great full to me because it’s knowledgable and interesting that gave an opportunity  for me to enhance and exercise my skill as a production associate.
good,Great staff that were all very knowledgeable in their fields. Tesla had very extensive safety policies which was beneficial for the staff. Overall a very great place to work.
good,"Tesla, Inc. engages in the design, development, manufacture, and sale of fully electric vehicles, energy generation and storage systems. It also provides vehicle service centers, supercharger station, and self-driving capability. The company operates through Automotive, and Energy Generation and Storage segments."
good,"Everyday a new challenge is faced and accomplished. "
good,"I loved working for Tesla, as a company. My coworkers were amazing and I felt as if we were all a family. My coworkers and I always worked together as a team."
good,Learned a lot more skills when working with a team. Motivated to finish daily tasks so customers would be satisfied. We would travel out of town sometimes for different projects. Every day was different.
good,Very well diversed .  Everyone is on board to do their part to change the world to sustainable energy.  Overall great place to work.  Very Inclusive.  Management is involved with the associates
good,In my experiences in working at Tesla GF1 i have had a fairly positive experiences. The company really goes out of the way to make sure the people that work here are taken care of and getting help when they need it.
good,"people here are great."
good,High intense work environment with exposure to the most current technologies. Creative people working to solve new problems everyday. Work life balance is not priority for management.
good,Great compensation and benefits. Very volatile working environment and unstable. They truly care about employees and promoting within. Great talented employees
good,Awesome place to build. Nice fast paced work life. And free cereal and coffee. The commute however is very long and with so many people working at tesla the shift start times need changing.
good,"Love the different cultures, nationality from different countries.  Learn to work in a group and teams.  People are friendly and very positive. Learn to communicate with different dept."
good,fun place to work with great incentives . Team members really care about each other and the communication is great not to mention benefits . I def would recommend employer.
good,enjoyed the sense of purpose and mission we were involved in at tesla. strong sense of team there and there  was a lot of variety in the job. plenty of room to advance if you can shine
good,"My Experience with Tesla has been good. The training  can be difficult because most of it is hands on. Escalated calls everyday. People are great to work with. the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing my customers are happy and when escalated I am able to solve all of their problems. what I like the least about this job is how unhappy the customers are and how they treat us on the phone. Sometimes we cannot solve their problem and they are just not happy,"
good,"Challenging but a rewarding place to work. As long as you have the passion to complete the mission of the company, this is a wonderful place. Competitive culture"
good,Fast-paced and energetic environment full of people with a passion to better the world by providing an affordable car that substantially helps preserve our environment.
good,"Located in Fremont, CA, fast-paced, supportive work culture with helpful co-workers happy to provide information on maintenance procedures needed to keep robotic assembly machinery in optimal working condition."
good,I loved working at Tesla. It's a great environment and my coworkers were fantastic. The hardest part for me was that I was a young woman working in a male-dominated field and I frequently had customers ask me for a male associate.
good,"Tesla encourages positive work relationships. It is a big family. Great place to work. Management is great but it is more of a parent-child relationship than an adult-adult relationship. "
good,Tesla has been a very easy job. It is very organized and well done. We all work together and get the job done. The hardest part of the job would be not having work to do. I like to stay busy. H&T is very productive.
good,I have worked for this company now for a little over two years and I absolutely love working here! The environment is extremely welcoming and culture is amazing.
good,"I loved it, I loved the job and I loved the atmosphere. It was like getting to go to college... It had its challenges as far as the work because sometimes it wasnt easy to navigate different situations that would come up. So basically, like any job, it had its ups and downs."
good,Great place to work if your looking to work 6 days week. The pay is nice. You just never have time off to enjoy family & friends. Alot of overtime giving.
good,coleagues and managers are supportive. Hardest part .....nothing like that shares the work and gives time to relax.. stress less. and the most enjoyable part is about the team work.
good,"very to good to work there."
good,"Busy and hardworking environment."
good,This company is great and has a lot of potential in growing bigger and better. I would recommend someone to work for this company.
good,"best professional experience of my career. Tremendous amount of challenges, extremely high expectations, top performers in every area of the business."
good,"best co workers and environment to work , we have coffee, cereal, drinks and food sometimes for free. I enjoy what I do everyday. "
good,Beautiful warehouse; I was able to learn everything in a short amount of time. The people were great and Management; Not so well. Magnificent benefits. But I have to say 100 % no room for advancements.
good,"ENERGY CONSERVATION AND EMISSION FREE FORWARD COMPANY..."
good,I was an intern there and got to learn a lot from the best in the industry. Very smart people using the best processes in the world.
good,The typical day consists of interacting with curious customers regarding the products of Tesla Motors. Also to further assist customers that express interest in considering purchasing any of the products available.
good,Working at Tesla is always fun and challenging. There is a lot more scope to learn new things and gain experience. Friendly work environment.
good,"•	Working with all the clients who purchased an EV Tesla was great experience.  They were always on top of all details of their vehicle.  "
good,Tesla provides you with top of the line training and brings an outstanding atmosphere with your co workers. Amazing pay and amazing benefits..
good,"The greatest company to work for period. I enjoyed every single day on the job. Sometimes work was demanding; however, overall it was a rewarding experience."
good,"Learned a lot about duct work, ventilation, and clean air intakes and exhausts. Learned about instillation of very large industrial equipment through hands on experience with industry leaders."
good,"The most enjoyable part of a job is working with your co workers as a team, so that you can accomplish goals and meet the companies expectations. That way the company can continue thriving towards success."
good,"espaço ótimo para aprendizado, trabalho em grupo e realizações."
good,"not a bad place to work, 6am-230pm there benefits are good, nvery easy job,"
good,• Educate the public about the electric car industry through enthusiastic conversations.
good,"Tesla is a great company to work for if you are willing to put in the work.  The main drawbacks are the frequent layoffs, and the inability to move up in the ranks without having to resort to brown-nosing the middle-managers."
good,Working at Tesla was one of the best experiences of my life. Unfortunately I was laid off (reasons unknown). But the shop environment was amazing working as a group to accomplish one goal was great. Also working on the future of transportation was amazing. The downfall was the management did not seem to understand the industry very well. They were so willing to compromise shop performance for a process in which is not in use anymore. They had people whispering in their ear saying we need this and we need that. I believe that why many people were either fired or laid off.
good,"Great place to work with tons of opportunity and challenges to take on. There are definitely easier places to work, but you can't change the world in 40 hours a week."
good,Would love to share my reviews during interview only or upon asked . TESLA is a brand to work for . But as an individual we have our own strengths and weakness .
good,"Wasn't a bad place to work. A bit repetitive for me. Doing the same thing all day in an assembly line is not for everyone., Some like it. I however prefer to move around and do more things.  But, as for a job, good company, good pay. the drive gets annoying in winter with all the crashes. leave early be prepared for traffic"
good,Engineers are too young and inexperienced. Communication is fair but more towards the poor side. Everyone (management and engineers) are out for them selves
good,I really enjoying the mission of working for Tesla. Everyone is very passionate about the work they do. I wish there was more security for your job because it does have a high turn around rate but it makes you work harder.
good,"I loved working with other employees and the pay is great. Its a fast paced environment so even thought there are 12 hour shifts, the  time goes by pretty fast."
good,"Id commute to work everyday, 2 hours one way to go or come from work, 10-11 hour shifts going on 6 days a week. For me trying to go to school Tesla made it impossible. So id be away from home about 15-16 hours a day. I've had a few different managers and most were great, some were unprofessional and immature and its baffling how on earth they ever got that type of promotion..."
good,Okay company to work for. Very fast pace. Need to be on top of things. Very challenging you need to be on your A game for quality. Alot of poor management from production but you work with them.
good,you come across a lot of great people working with the right mind set this company can be great to work at. benefits are good the pay is ok just wish the would go giving u a raise based on how good one works and hard not based who knows more you or your fellow co worker
good,Everyday most likely different. I'm working in production as quality control so sometime I can see things that is not in my checklist. Working at my previous company help me grow as a person and intellectually we had monthly training and reviews on our job description. For me its not hard but challenging we have to talk to Production Eng. regarding our concern and help or talk to production people their lapses in quality. I enjoy working with my previous job in because I like to be with people and challenge myself that I can also do what production line is doing and exchange ideas and opinions.
good,"Tesla was fun, we were breaking the rules doing things that were only dreamed of!"
good,"could be great, needs to advance more technologies and hide more innovative people. This review requires ano overly extensive number of chars so I am doing that."
good,"With management really not knowing much about what's going on on the actual production floor, lots of miscommunication & lack of acknowledgement for ones skills & work ethic"
good,This was one of the most amazing experiences of my life the people were fantastic finally fresh positive the work we were doing was the new industry known as Alternative Energy so we were the tip of the spear the customers were beautiful people happy to have us at their home the stories that I heard from them we're amazing they shared their souls with us and brought us into their family when we got back to the shop after the work day we had food snacks and drinks a basketball court ping pong tables and friendly face is waiting for us to support us and tell us what a great job we have done as far as the pay goes let's just say it was six figures unmatchable to any other working experience I have had this far I would never have left if it weren't 4 poor decisions on the Management's side not putting so blame on them although I do believe they made mistakes frequently do to their inexperience in the field having no electrical experience whatsoever they did the best they could with what they were given I don't fault anyone I only wish I could have stayed to have moved on to work at SpaceX another division a sister company to Tesla energy
good,"Tesla is an amazing company. They created thousands of jobs in Nevada and needed a bunch of people for the Model 3 ramp in 2018. Alot of people couldn't handle it, but for me, their mission helped me get through the toughest parts of the ramp up. Now, new and more efficient auto lines are being built, and they don't need as many people. Work/life balance is almost non existent, though, with the 12 hour shifts. Being on your feet for 12 hours is not fun. They do alternate weekly schedules (3 days on, 3 days off, 4 days on, 4 days off) through 4 shifts (A/C shift, B/D shift), so having the 3 and 4 day weekends were nice, but they were absolutely necessary to recover from the work week. Company is amazing, but I am working towards a better career opportunity within Tesla in a few years, after I get my degree. "
good,Really depends on your supervisor and leads some are amazing and some should not be working in supervisory roles. I have been fortunate and have had a great experience here
good,Great company to work with very good benefits. HR people are amazing. But the supervisors do micromanagement. the alternate work schedule is annoying they need to do three shifts 8 hours shift. That will be more productive.
good,"Having worked at Tesla is one of the best decisions I have ever made. The company culture, the other employees, and even the customers all share one vision - To accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We live and breathe that mission and it shows. I have never been in a room with more dedicated and driven coworkers and I hope to see this mission driven work culture replicated in all the places that matter."
good,I highly recommend trying this job out as you learn a lot from your position. I was trained properly on forklift and a tugger on conveying materials. Long hours and great pay is a plus that i can not complain about. Some management is all about favoritism and i have seen this first hand unfortunately. There are other leaders that are good and try their best to help. Similar to any job really. Great job i would recommend to anyone that would like to be in a ever so changing environment.
good,"It's very obvious to me that not everybody would enjoy working for a company like Tesla. But for all of us that meet certain characteristics, Tesla is definitely a dream job. You're never bored at the company, your contributions are really important and high impact, and you can see the results of your work immediately."
good,"Stated work  around 6:30 Am finishing up at around 5 PM, five days a week. Worked numerous weekends to install equipment on production lines and to make deadlines. Used my design skills without interference for mechanical design work. Data was provided for envisaged requirements to created viable solutions, some straight forward and others challenging my skills to the maximum  ,timelines were very tight due to the nature of business. With regards to hardware and software to perform duties and safety equipment, only the best supplied."
good,"The pace of growth in the company was not matched with the growth in talent acquisition. Long hours and required additional work on off day of shift. "
good,"Rapidly growing electric vehicle company with a start-up mentality, even when the company size exceeded 5,000 employees.  Encourage innovations and creative thinking."
good,"I loved working there, it was fast paced and challenging but always busy and learning something new. management was always changing and sometimes there were gaps in communication. you really feel like you earn your paycheck, but the commute and parking crazy hours can sometimes be hard to deal with."
good,Great place to work for sustainable energy career.  You have a purpose to help the planet transition to sustainable energy in vehicles and solar power with battery backup.
good,"Had a great time working for Tesla and i respect the product. The people are great, leadership leaves something to be desired, promotions for management do not scrutinize leadership traits, but go off of performance in a particular role. Pay is good, hours are intense, very demanding, but overall fast paced and great energy."
good,Tesla was probobly one of the biggest buildings ive ever worked in. its amazing how they get so much done but time management is insane their. Work life with social life is crazy.
good,"Energy revolution technology is great."
good,Being a production associate for Tesla is a good job for people who prefer a fast-paced environment and don't mind working under pressure the benefits you receive are great however the job is very time consuming and you should be at least slightly Physically Active to keep up with required duties
good,"I enjoyed working there. The management was okay and i had alot of fun. I learned alot while working their. I worked multiple different jobs while working their such as production, quality inspector,etc."
good,"I loved everyone I worked with and the company, I just didn't like the job. I didn't enjoy being located at a Home Depot and I didn't like being on my feet all day on the hard concrete floors. I was able to make commission which increased my pay a little bit but it wasn't enough to make me want to stay."
good,"I had a nice experience working with Tesla. The hours were nice, the people were nice they made sure that we were all ready and prepared to work and the have really large cafe's"
good,"Working there was fun because I was surrounded by outgoing people i got along with. We could goof around, but when it was time to work, we knocked it out."
good,"One of the only companies I believe to have truly exciting work and projects."
good,"Overall Tesla is a great company to work for in my eyes. As far as taking care of their associates, i Believe they do just that at the factory. From free food , drinks and consulting ."
good,"At Tesla you will have a chance to change the future of the automotive industry. However, do not expect to be paid handsomely to do so. Initially, the company had a flat management structure and rewarded seniority. Now is hiring outside managers to run the new generation of employees. As a entrepreneurial self starter I miss the old wild west days when the company felt more like a start up and less like a traditional car dealer."
good,"Fast pace company that is always changing, everyday is a busy day, always finding problems, trying to always fix problems and looking for process improvement. New company so basically what they assigned your for a job, you could be end up doing something else."
good,"I work for Futristic company/Tesla. I was putting glue on the seat of the car. It's a challenges.But fun.Management is good. They tell what specific thing to do. My co-worker is nice,were like teamwork. The hardest is putting glue on car seat with a glue gun. The enjoyable part of my job, is being to work with people that help one another. That's make the job go smooth."
good,"Mi trabajo como becaria en la empresa está siendo genial."
good,Ambiente agradavel de trabalhar . Com boas condiçoes de trabalho .
good,"A very good place to work although the money definitely don't match the work. It's a 24 hour production line, very fast paced building MRI scanners for cancer research and sending them to hospitals and abroad."
good,"Gets 3-6 cars done at a fast pace. Alot of collaborative effort. Lots of continual learning. Lots of benefits. Stock options 401k, bragging rights and a hat."
good,"I am proud to work at Tesla.  Whenever people would ask me where I  work, and i would  say in Tesla, they get impressed.  The management and the leaders are very supportive in its workers development. If you work hard, you will receive a Performace Award every six months."
good,The job was okay it just was long I felt like I was there more than home and when I was home barely had energy because I was so tired but the pay was great and the benefit was great
good,Great company to work for if you have a good work ethic. It is a fast paced warehouse environment. The pay was fair and the benefits were great. I have not complainants worth mentioning while working for Tesla.
good,TESLA overall isn’t a bad place. Always room for advancement. Extremely fast paced. Needs a parking garage badly. I would recommend more PTO for 12hour workers rather than the same for 8hour workers.
good,"It was a great place to work. Made lots of friends, met all different kind and respectable co-workers who made the times of stress bearable and the fun time worth while."
good,"Clean environment, productive and relaxed. It was fun because you get to sit in nice cars and break time was also relaxed. Supervisor was very helpful"
good,"Solar Sales is a constantly changing environment, couple that with Tesla's drive to change the world by "" accelerating the worlds transition to sustainable energy"", and you've pretty much described the average day... GO, GO, GO!"
good,"The employees there, for the most part, are fun, helpful and open to guiding you in the right direction. The manager for us was really clueless on what he was doing and did not do well with managing the employees who oversaw us. Nonetheless, the employees were pretty awesome and are truly hardworking individuals. I am grateful to have been a part of Tesla, even for a small amount of time."
good,"Having the opportunity to work for a company that is changing the world is exhilarating and rewarding. The projects I get to work on are right up my alley, challenging, and stretch my ability to allow me to learn on the job. The compensation is adequate for the work put in, and I feel valued every day at work. Team around me is encouraging and kind which creates a pleasant place to go into work each day."
good,"always opportunities for you to learn. only reason i left is they were paying incoming techs more than me and did not want to match me. other than that you can really learn alot (robotics, plc)."
good,"Loved working here"
good,"I learn a lot in this company systems are more familiar for me also Microsoft programs, I'd love to work here, but unfortunately I need to develop, that's why i decided to change company"
good,"Working at Tesla was life changing for me the culture kept everyone pushing for a safe and fast production. The jobs that i was entitled too was fun for me lifting, fast pace, building. over all a life changing experience. Never will i ever forget any of the employees that made work more enjoyable."
good,"Tesla is a mission driven company, taking the lead in accelerating the world's transition to a sustainable energy future."
good,Tesla is a very nice place to work. You learn alot and have alot of opportunities to move up..management was great engineers were happy to help you with any problem you had.
good,Energy side of the company seems rudderless and trying to find their way.  All company attention is focused on cars until max production is reached.  New leadership could bring new direction.
good,I enjoyed my time at Tesla motors and the work was easy to adapt to. However my time at Tesla motors was thru a contracting agency so it was a month to month basis. I was in the process of being hired as a permanent associate when the company decided to terminate my contract. Many believe this is based off the fact that they rather hire new waves of temps then hire on the old ones and give them benefits. Tesla is good to their full time employees but treat their contractors as very disposable. I would recommend going thru the permanent hiring process as opposed to working thru a staffing agency.
good,Unbearable place to work In always in pain and almost always feels exhausting because sometimes it's really slow and sometimes it's very fast. Overall its always competitive at work and after work.
good,"this job is pretty good and have a pretty good balance life at home to. "
good,everything is made easy as what you need is made available for the job to get done easily. Friendly people around. You are timed on your station and have to get your work done in 90 sec
good,CNC operator- cut metal parts for vehicles. I learned how to properly load/unload machines. Identified and separated damaged parts. Removed all sharp metals with shaving/ sanding tools.
good,"It was a great job that paid very, very well.  They gave lots of required overtime. The only issue I had personally, was that I gained employment with Tesla at their new location for seat production at a time that I became a brand new parent.  They had promised that they would switch me from day shift to night shift after I had been working with them for over 3 months, but they did not switch me.  I take promises and deals with any employer very seriously and it really did bother me that they did not keep their promise.  I was forced to quit my job with Tesla because I could no longer work over night with a new born baby.  It was too hard for my family to deal with.  If it wasn't for this one issue, I would have stayed with Tesla."
good,"It is a fun and interesting place to work when you have an opportunity to see the whole process of the most modern and fastest EV made. To someone who loves working extra hours, this is a place that offers you much over time. I was on the production line and all I did was to put different parts on vehicle. To someone who does not have much knowledge about cars, here you can learn names of different parts and somehow have a little idea of how things work. But since the factory is still young, I do not think the factory has been managed well enough. The most challenging part for the production line position is that you have to stand all day and work in a fast pace in order to keep the line moving. The good part on this job is that you have full benefits and you will have a chance to get promotion if you prove that you are a hard worker."
good,"World changing company, growing exponentially and will continue to be successful. As the company produces additional products it will continue to accomplish it's mission."
good,"Great location, great work environment, management is on point, open to new ideas, benefits are amazing, next generation machinery, and advancement is with in reach."
good,"a typical day at work would come in early so i can hang out with my crew and go over the plans for the day. car count and approaches etc. i been in the car industry since i was fifteen and i learned new things everyday. always a endless possibility for learning new techniques. management was ok. there a few things that could be adjusted due to the fact that production never really ran smooth at a pace it should have been. overall i would say closer attention to detail could possibly be the right adjustment. my co workers were always awesome and made it a healthy and fun place to work. everyone always was a team player and made the new members feel right at home. hardest part about the job is trying to deal with the slow pace and wish it would have been faster. but i guess when you deal with that kind of production, everyday will never be the same. most enjoyable thing about the job is having good team players surrounding ready to lend a helping hand if you find yourself in a pickle."
good,"Working at Tesla Motors was great, while the hours were long and you seemed to work everyday. Most people wouldn't mind only because what Tesla was achieving on a daily basis. Tesla is a young company and they have a long way to go but with the right work ethic and a lot of hard work they will get to the top along with its employees."
good,"I like what the company stands for renewable energy is where we should be going. Not a big fan of the work life balance, it's not really my filed of expertise."
good,"There was never a dull moment working for this young exciting company. Technology is cutting edge, and there also plenty of cool perks for working with Tesla."
good,Just wish they were more serious about making us permanent hires. They constantly told us how please they were with our performances and that we’d possibly find employment other than temp but have not contacted since. Other than that it was the greates work experience I’ve had. It taught me a lot of useful driving mechanics & Improved my skills everyday. Plus was a great workout.
good,"Great company benefits and a lot of learning experiences in electrical and roofing and utility groundwork. There were a few rude dudes at the Austin, TX shop, but nothing out of the ordinary for construction or skilled tradesmen. The training was great once I changed crews. The first crew didn’t start teaching me much until I basically had enough of the silent treatment. Lots of conflicting egos while quality training should have been conducted. Looking back, I should have stayed and overcame the learning curve and tolerated the egos."
good,i enjoy my time at Tesla motor's for the 6 months that i was working there if it was up to me i would be still working .i get along with my managers and lenders and i do my job to the best of my ability
good,"Most people at Tesla work there because they believe in the vision of the company, and this results in a forward thinking environment. I would be happy to work for Tesla again in the future."
good,"10 hour days scheduing consultation (in home or in office), promote and educate on products while also educating clients on the benefits of our products. Meeting sales goals and converting existing clients to new products as well."
good,Working at Tesla was defiantly a great experience where all the coworkers there all want to help each other out to get the job done. The hours are long but with the amount of work done the time goes by fast.
good,"An aspirational brand with an enigmatic leader and great products."
good,"Had a constant ""start up"" feeling to it. The pay is less than other profit driven companies, but benefits were amazing. Managers rarely knew or understood changes coming, I never wanted to move up because I saw upper managers carrying nasty ""salesy"" attitudes."
good,Growing company lets you see what it takes to make a company prevail. A lot of room for learning experience. Chances to make a difference in departments.
good,Working at Tesla was an amazing experience but it is not for everyone. As one of the most innovative companies out there Tesla is for individuals who enjoy fast paced dynamic environments where you must be able to quickly adapt to changes in order to succeed.
good,"Of course the downside is the long 12hr shifts of standing and when you do get off and get home you’re so exhausted that you sleep through 10 out of those 12hrs you have left until your next shift. The different people are great if you can handle many personalities, food that they offered was amazing. Breakfast was free such bagels, cereals, coffee, vending machines etc. I highly recommend it"
good,"I love Tesla and I would work here forever, however the company directives continuously change and it's very hard to predict if your job is safe or if you will join the unfortunate people that got laid off."
good,"Great people to work around with so many diverse cultures, but Many cars including my own were broken in to under the watch of Tesla security, it’s a great place to work but there’s no real job security."
good,"Great work environment and much company drive towards the ""mission""."
good,Tesla gave me great benefits and help me support my family and gave me enough pay to provide what I need on a day to day basis. They provided almost all kinds of help to be able to get to the job safely and ready
good,"Fast paced, dog eat dog work environment.  Better be on your game.....meaning your A game. Be prepared for lots of changes on the fly. All types of interaction....from dealing directly with Elon to locally hired contractors."
good,"Typical day ,  check out previously  running  test. Look for discrepancy or changes or stable. Record the early morning result. Discuss with engineer , need to do any changes or modification."
good,Overall I love the job but the people need a bit of work. It is still a growing company so it has room for certain mistakes still. But overall it's amazing except the people need a little work.
good,"Great place to work, not a lot of opportunity for advancement, the pay could be better. Management is fair and professional, most people are decent. i would recommend"
good,"It was good to work at Tesla because it is a fast paced environment.  It help you keep busy and focus in work.  Also, if you want to work stable for your whole life, this is a good company to work as.  I quit there its not because Tesla is bad.  it was because i had emergency family that i need resolve.  if I can come back Tesla, I will do because it is the best work place that i had."
good,"Everything revolves around production. There are strict deadlines and quotas that need to be met with the consistent change when new information is available."
good,"I am new, and this position is SO out of my element, but so far it’s fun, and a great little work out. The hours are awesome! 3 12 hours one week, 4 12 the next. I hear they have the best health insurance once hired on. This schedule is what caught my eye at Tesla. I’m looking forward to advance and grow with Tesla."
good,"Working in Tesla was very fun, but very hardworking. They did provide food for us and that was very king. The pool table was very fun to use on break. Managers were very polite and helpful."
good,"A typical day at Tesla is anything but typical. You have to be ready to go at all times and help out anyone who needs a hand, in any department. A regular sales day involves talking to customers who walk in, capturing information, booking test drives, and following up with clients. Everyone is passionately motivated and loves what they do so it makes it easier."
good,"One of the few companies that requires a huge time and mental ability commitment... and yet, it is fun, fast paced, lively, exciting work. I may have been hard working and scrappy but I was also appreciated and included in every project and team."
good,Teala was a good place to learn alot and build a bright future for your family and build a solid foundation to become  bigger then youve eber dreamed.
good,"Working for Tesla Motors is an amazing company to work for! Overall, the atmosphere is great and fast-paced. I would only have to admit that the company itself has a higher work life standard then a life balance. At this time, it would not be the best fit for me for the long hours that I can see myself working now and furthermore."
good,Tesla is a great place to work. The environment is laid back even though standard expectations are to be met. Management is helpful but the company is undergoing many changes and this can leave an unsettling feeling at times. Management is doing well to calm those feelings and negative rumors/talk.
good,"Tesla is the most competitive, high energy, diverse job that I ever experienced. Positive vibes and competitive roles. Cutthroat is all I got to say, I'm all about cutthroat. The only thing negative about the job was there wasn't any leadership committed to the whole team. Better leaders make better followers. On the positive end I still would recommend some good workers to this site. Not people who want to complain all night while working with somebody who is there to work not listen to people's insight on others in the work place, Not cool."
good,"Consider a good team and th job is pretty fun. Learn a lot every, but only few people can advance on this team. A lot of privilege like free theater show, music show, artist show"
good,"Great start up feel and atmosphere, with a lot of opportunity for growth. Expect to work hard but to play hard as well while working towards a world that solely uses renewable energy."
good,"Good place to move up in the company, pay is low.  Tesla just purchased Solar City.  Just learning about Tesla culture.  Solar City culture is good, but management is still learning."
good,Buena empresa dan muchos servicios y prestaciones.
good,"a typical day starts at 6:00 Am and will run till 4:00 pm. the place is filled with energy and my team is always ready to get going and have some fun try to better our previous day's assemblies. "
good,"very fast past working job with a lot of over time. Employees were very respectful, the management was excellent and everyone worked as a team."
good,I really enjoyed working for Tesla especially working on the cooling tube line. I learned a lot of things at that company especially was using hand tools and the way my co-worker worked quickly and accurately. Everything when I was working for TL I felt comfortable and was very good at my job.
good,Really very pleasant environment and they will treat us in a proper way and trained well. I really enjoyed the environment.
good,Our company working culture is very good. daily to daily work allotment and no target. all department working with together and internal y connected
good,"Great place to work if you want to be on the cutting edge of the EV wave!"
good,". Controle de material que sai para o campo de serviço."
good,"start the work on time"
good,"I love working for Tesla Motors. It is one of the fastest growing companies in the US today. I have never felt more passionate about a job until I started to work for Tesla. The atmosphere is highly energetic, fun, and sophisticated when the time calls for it. I have wonderful co-workers and managers who make going to work truly a pleasure. The best part of my job is that I get to teach people about a revolutionary all electric car with better specs and performance than any other electric car. Not to mention, Tesla just won Motor Trend's Car of the Year."
good,Het bedrijfscultuur is super! einde kwartaal even doorbikkelen maar de samenwerking tussen collega's en management is goed. Het leukste bedrijf ooit.
good,So much growth. Modern day gold rush. Explosive potential . Always learning. Always improving. State of the art automation. Robotics and programming all day.
good,"Every day with the best opportunity to learn. Pleasant work environment making it feel like family and comprehensive support to the employee."
good,Once you get in this is a great place to work I would highly recommend this job to anyone despite the number of people Tesla really does care about their staff.
good,I think some of the management  need to be reevaluated but other than that the place is a great job Great pay good people and. You get to save the planet
good,"Fun place"
good,Great dedicated people. Work and train on cutting edge renewable power equipment. Feel good about helping transition the world to clean renewable energy and get paid well doing it.
good,"This is a great place to work! You are off half the week! Many opportunities for growth. Management may not be perfect, but the majority wants to see you grow within the company."
good,"I have loved the people I have worked with for the past 3 years, however it feels very limited to advancing career wise. Always nervous about layoffs and getting recognition for your hard work is hard. No extra pay for speaking another language either."
good,"Enjoyed my brief time there before the layoffs.  Challenged in a good way, while being excited of where the company is going."
good,"Everyone is trained, while working with a team of knowledgeable individuals ,associates all treated fairly, evaluated periodically for advancement with challenges to be promoted for positions of leadership."
good,It's a fast-paced environment. I learned how to do 5'S during downtimes. I'm stocking parts needed in the line. The job is challenging because you need to complete the process within the takt time.
good,Was a cool place to work just the commute and hours dragged. I moved from Stockton further away causing the commute to take away from my home life but the company is great benefits and pay are top notch would like to go back.
good,"Following mission is important, the Drive towards the goal of sustainability, strong workplace culture, love driving a Tesla. Longer hours but fun company, changes directions a lot"
good,"It is by far the best job that I have ever had.  They give health, dental, vision and paid time off.  Have never had an issue with any of the managers."
good,"Great company, very productive job, fast paced, great benefits and the hours are good. "
good,Working on rooftops and attics in Arizona during summer make for a very challenging work environment. Good family health benefits. Great people to work with.
good,Work is pretty hard if you are not used to long hours and labor work but other than that I can say this job give limitless opportunities and if you manage your money right you can live pretty decently.  Job security and management are about the only two things that you have to worry about here.
good,"Tesla equips you with the tools you need to get the projects completed. Everyone is willing to help and there are always exciting projects to go around. Being around the best and brightest, as well as motivated people really helps you develop a rewarding experience as an engineer at Tesla. As an intern, you are respected and treated like a full time. As a full time, you're given autonomy and even more responsibilities. My internship was incredible, and I'd love to go back. Don't bother with the naysayers, they're just lazy engineers who want to 'be a part of something', but when it comes down to the grunt work, they flake. Come to Tesla if you want to learn, engineer, and change the world, no matter what it takes. It's a very rewarding experience!"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is you get to work with brilliant minds and also they help you with your career goals. Culturally diverse population.
good,"This is a very cult-ish company and easy to enjoy being apart of. At times the cult can forget that in the end, we're all expendable to the C-Level executives and massive layoffs hit hard. A great company, but not something I would plan my future with."
good,Was a great environment of people to work for and under.  Magazine subscription to a few day conferences out of state.  Friendly and nice people.  Answering phones and emails.
good,"Excellent company to work for, I've been lucky to have some of the hardest working associates on my team, with a very diverse group, from all walks of life and education. Great managers and supervisors."
good,"2 hours of commuting plus 12 hour shifts can take a toll on those who aren't prepared for it. Work/Life balance is terrible, but if you live close and need the money its ok."
good,Great company to work for I believe in what they are doing but its still a volatile start up. I was laid off when they consolidated my department but still would love to work for them.
good,"The environment at Tesla is awesome. The techs around me are humorous making the day go by quicker and always ready to help you with most things if they are knowledgeable on it. Diagnosing these vehicle's are actually kinda fun, besides being a technician I'm part of a virtual service team that allows me to diagnose vehicles and find problems before it even makes it to the service center which is a great head start on getting the car in and out of the shop. Working here has allowed me as well gain customer service experience because we were allowed to directly talk to customers about the issues they were experiencing making it easier to understand concerns. The benefits here are great cant explain them, just have to experience them. Working here just gives you a sense of purpose knowing you are helping the environment by helping fix the car keeping on the road instead of a gas powered vehicle."
good,"Always be on time mind your business,do your work, come prepared, volunteer when you can and you will be alright.learn to do different stations and rotate."
good,Hard to find work/life balance when employeed. Management changes all the time. Had to relocate to a farther facility while in the company. Had to get called in after a 12 hour shift at times.
good,"I love this place! I hope to get back in some day either as a customer or as an employee. "
good,"Tesla was a great company to work for and I am thankful for the opportunity that was provided to me to work for them.  The benefits package provided to the employees was excellent and the compensation was more than fair.  I was unfortunately in a position that was determined to not be essential during a time that cash flow was highly needed, however, if given the opportunity I would work for them again as I highly believe in their mission as well as the fair treatment of their employees."
good,The position requires a huge drive and discipline to stay positive and stay focused. It consists of overcoming  A LOT of constant rejection but you get to say you are changing the world because it is true and you can see your actual impact.
good,I had the opportunity to learn alot about accounting and coding. Management was amazing and very friendly environment. When the department moved I was very sad to leave.
good,"A typical day at work would be working on damaged vehicles or broken head frames for the cars , i learned how to fix a lot of vehicle parts and learned how the Tesla model cars operated from the Model S to the model X . The hardest part of the job would probaly just be to stay awake lol everything else there is so easy to do literally . I loved how they offered a gym , a basketball court and food trucks every weekend !"
good,Great place to work. Team meeting before every shift all easy work just have to stay on top of out and get your job done and no one wool have to worry about you.
good,"The quick is really quick paced. Had a chance to work on latest cutting-edge technologies. Coworkers were nice. Has benefits like 401k, free cereals etc."
good,If you aren't worried about spending too much time outside of work this is a great place to make a lot of money really fast. I messed this job up because I was too busy getting high but if I wasn't going to school to be a counselor I would apply at Tesla again for sure. Not hard work at all. Its the easiest 20 dollars a hour you will ever make you just have to get used to the hours.
good,"Great Place to work, fun place to work, Great benefits package, medical, vision, life insurance, growth opportunity, advanced career development and advance"
good,Tesla has been a great opportunity and I wish I could have stayed longer. The teams are excellent and management is very supportive. Overall outstanding company.
good,it was a good job i report in at 5 pm i worked in the plastic department  i cut and trim front and rear bumpers then weld the light brackets on it was a break every 2 hrs and i got an 1 hr lunch an i was off at 2am it was a nice friendly work environment
good,"I worked the morning shift here. Very nice and private Main Office to work at that consisted of my Boss the Owner,the lead Booking and Sales Representative, and myself. "
good,I would recommend working at Tesla to anyone who is interested with technology and cars. They offer a uniqe experience and the company is growing at a very fast pace!
good,"Every day I would  label book covers. I have learned to organize books using the dewy decimal system, There was one main person over me who told what to do. I had very little co workers."
good,"Working here was great, the people I met were awesome. We had a great production line and worked pretty fast. Manager was very cool, we got free things sometimes and potlucks. The only thing was bad was commuting and traffic. It was very cold in the winter and really hot in the summer but I'm sure it's different now."
good,"Tesla is a great company to work for. The company is really big on Attendance. If you wanna last at Tesla make sure you show up to work on time or they will boot you out of here. If you want to move up in the company be flexible and willing to go where the business is needed. The less you complain the more opportunities you have to learn and move up quickly. Stay away from negative people and follow your own lead. The hours are long, But the paycheck is good. The management is cool depending on what department you're working in. You tend to hear negative things from the people who have worked here a long time let it go in one ear and out the other. Those are the people who are mad and bitter for whatever reason. If you love to work hard and have a long paycheck come to Tesla you won't regret it. We need people who want to work and stay long term. The company is very fast-paced and we work very hard. The company has good company perks such as bonuses, raises, free-breakfast, soda, coffee etc."
good,The company it's ok but the supervisor and the representatives iit's a lot descrumination and don't care about the employees I have accident and I he Supervisor let me go.
good,"TESLA is a great place for young people to begin their career.  Elon Musk loves to support young talented staff solving problems and giving new ideas, as long as you are willing to sacrifice your own time. This is a high paced working environment if you want to learn high cutting edge technology. I highly recommend people to apply.  The company provides great benefits which start on day one. on day one.  I really enjoy working at TESLA, SpaceX will be my next stop."
good,This was a great job to work for part was great job security the only down fall was lack of day’s off to spend time with my family but other than that it was a great job to work for
good,"Good envronment , different tools to motivate employees,good mangement.very inovative company due to Elon Musk, every time we expect new things coming up so this makes the company dynamic, of course job security is always under question."
good,Perfect place if you want to grow from associate to management or lead positions. Very clean organized and the teams are great. I’ve enjoyed working for the company.
good,Loved every minute of my short time at Tesla Dania Beach. Everyday it was a joy to go to work. My co workers were the best ever and everyone cared about each other. My managers were just part of the team and treated everyone equally. They never micro managed. Unfortunately I was laid off and I understand Elons decision. But I would give anything to work there again. I miss my extended Family!
good,"The drive is not bad, leaving at the end of the day so terrible, parking is good just get there early, Supervisors had there favorites, makes it hard to move up."
good,"Great job Great Environment. Sometimes its a lot of demanding work with in a time limit. When the machines are oiled up and ready, the day seems like it flys by."
good,"It can get stressful with the constant changes but with a good team and an even better Manager, you can definitely get through it. Everyone is always hands on with helping and you are never fully alone.....BUT YOU MUST BE READY TO WORK!!!! You are on that Sales floor like Soldiers on the front lines! Sometimes its even hard to take a break. Make sure if you apply that you have a sales mentality, ""Go hard or go home"" attitude and most importantly.....YOU BELIEVE IN THE VISION!!! If you have these things, you may even enjoy the work."
good,Engaged with prospective clients daily. Learned valuable skills in sales. Wonderful team. Hardest part of job was breaking through to people in a cold environment.
good,Tesla was a good place to work for the short time I was there as a temp worker through a temp service. If one was blessed enough to be directly hired through Tesla that would be a good sent.
good,"12 hour days very intense, but large financial reward. good medial benefits. The bosses are tough and demand perfection.  The locations are far and commuting in california is always daunting"
good,Work at Tesla is very fast paced and very production oriented. This is not a job where you will be sitting around twiddling your thumbs. You will be working and you will be earning your paycheck.
good,Great supervisors who support your career. Great team with the members who work hard despite constantly changing schedule. The company provided good benefit overall.
good,"Good benefits, supervisor and crew leads are great to work with.  Its a fast pace environment.  You learn a new trade and you become familiar with that trade.  Only bad thing is that they took our job bonus away.  Overall its a good company to work for."
good,Enjoy the people I work with. Had fun educating every person who walked in through our doors. Very fast paced environment and many areas to learn and grow in.
good,"I work as an operations coordinator. I pretty much follow up with different companies on title & lien information. I had a little experience but I’m learning new things everyday. There was no formal training , pretty much quick session of basics then learning as I go. My supervisor is great. They fill us with snacks & the cafeteria has a big selection. Schedule so flexible & your offered overtime everyday if you would like it. This is definitely a great job & I’m more than sure you will have room for advancement."
good,Enjoyed working with people and customers like a family and I made my own job description upon arrival which showed the creativity and freedom to open something new that was missing and needed.
good,"The typical day went by with a breeze with the different task that were assigned to me the day went by pretty quick."
good,Tesla is a excellent company with the best benefits I have ever received anywhere. The pay is about standard for the industry and i would highly recommend working for Tesla
good,"My 8 years at Tesla was the pinnacle of my professional career. I've met some of the most brilliant, passionate people, presented products and innovations that were revolutionary, and literally changed the global dynamic of the automobile. I had an incredible Regional Manager. Elon is a God among men. And I left with memories that will last a lifetime. 2 years later, and I regret whole-heartedly walking away..."
good,"My schedule was more or less under my control, which I found extremely beneficial to work a family/work life balance. Along with schedule freedom, Tesla provided extensive sales training that increased my compensation finances exponentially. Their customer-solution based approach upgraded my sales skills beyond what I had envisioned, and will serve me well with my next position. "
good,Great place to come to work for it was the people that made it great! the mission was just a plus. It was a good time in working and learning from logistics to cost analyst
good,"For the most part working here has been GREAT. The long working hours and Graveyard shift can be hard but the opportunities for on the job advancements are great. they also offer many ways you can do self improvement training and you may even qualify for a special scholarship to TMCC. "
good,"•	Configured IP RIP, PPP, BGP and OSPF routing."
good,"You start on contract with a 3mo grace period to prove yourself. The only down side is the being let go after that 3mo. But if your a good worker with strong work ethic. You got this. Great energy, great pay, after contract the benefits you receive are unbeatable. Lots of room for variety of job positions is what I like best. Plenty of positions if you're like me and get bored with a consistency of missionary alone (:"
good,"Great work days i learned new technology,management was very great on making sure contractor had everything also diversity plus hardest part of the job was the 12 hour shifts the most enjoyable part of the job was the great team work with other co workers and management."
good,"long hours, constant work and tons of people. you have an opportunity to learn a lot about Tesla and experience how it works  first hand. great pay. commuting can be hard though."
good,"Busy place, great team work. We all helped each other and worked together to solve problems. Increased my computer skills, and learned a lot. Enjoyed working there. Flexible work schedule. Their benefits are great."
good,Awesome company! Great Opportunities! I would love to come back one day if possible. Great career chances and so many different ways to further your education and improve!
good,"Tesla is more than just a company or a job, it offers the opportunity to be a part of the mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.  The supportive team environment has reinforced lessons that I will carry forward to my next career."
good,"My opinions mattered more to SolarCity than Tesla, the companies desire to grow the retail store side of the energy business is hurting the field which brings in all the volume.  In my opinion the stores should be giving leads to the field team, and be aligned with us more.   The reason for this is because they change who is over all of sales about every year, every time there is a change we have to deal with their new way of thinking.  Put somebody in charge of sales who has actually sold solar, and the energy side of the business would flourish."
good,Best Incorporation that i have came across with. I want to eventually come back to work for Tesla. It is actually my favorite company in the world and i love to work at their locations.
good,Tesla is a very great place to work at. The company is extremely friendly and family oriented. The fact that you can travel to different  countries with the company is amazing. Also being able to go to the factory and see how the car is built is mind blowing.
good,"Finally a meaningful career that treats you like a meaningful employee. I can not remember when was the last time I worked for a company who is supportive and actually wants to see you the employee win. If everything I have been through in my life was supposed to happen so that I could end up here, I would do it all over again."
good,I love to work at Tesla for its fast paced environment where my communication skills are utilized and my work ethic appreciated. managers were amazing
good,Loved working for Tesla Motors! One of the few places I was excited to come to work. I was given every opportunity by management to fully utilized my skills and even enhance them in the process. For being a manufacturing work place I never felt bored as my superiors always raised the bar. Not every day was the same as my superiors continued to challenged me to making things better. Learning from one another was such a key to my success to becoming a Production Lead in  such a short period of time after being hired in. Tesla Motors is the company to work for if you wish to make a difference in the car industry. Thinking out side the box is what I can honestly describe why I love working for Tesla Motors. I moved to TN and worked for Nissan and it did not take me long to regret leaving my Tesla job.
good,"Working @ TESLA has been nothing short of a great opportunity. Due to the nature of the company, being one of the largest and greatest in the sustainable energy field (which is actually the primary basis of the company with automobiles being a secondary component), its a great place to work if you like to be on the cutting edge. The company offers a lot to its employees, which is amazing, including paid time off, flexible hours and locations, and great management (depending upon timing and location) but it does have some things to learn. For example, management is there for when you need them, but sometimes its hard for them to get back to you when you directly need them. You have more than enough training, and people who are willing to help you with any of the company's products, but to get a decision from direct management can be difficult. But communication is good between branches, and employees, and the lifestyle is great to sell as it sells itself. For a car guy like me, working with the greatest automotive product since the Model T is simply the coolest idea, and beats any of the negatives about this job, which are few, but there are some. Overall, a wonderful experience, just not for people who want to move up fast and get paid that imaginary $1 Million salary immediately. There is possibility for growth, but it takes time."
good,Tesla fue una muy buena experiencia para mi en producción
good,"I worked as a Delivery Orientation Specialist at Tesla prior to departing for Marine Corps training. My job there was to facilitate a smooth delivery and orientation process for new Tesla owners. I instructed them on the vehicles various operating systems, ensured all financial obligations were met, and answered questions to put to bed any concerns the customer might have. It was a rewarding and fun job where I got to work with some of the most cutting edge automotive transportation on the planet. Calling Tesla progressive does not do the companies mission and accomplishments justice. It was a phenomenal company to work for. The hardest part of the job was exceeding the demands of very high profile customers. Knowing that I had made a difference for the planet and improved the quality of life for a happy new customer made the job very enjoyable."
good,"it was nice learning experience."
good,I like the environment it is one of the biggest factories on the cost it was a comparative atmosphere but if u can get a spot for cheap it is a good job to have...
good,"Everyone works hard, there is stress, and sometimes you have to work long hours. However, it was a great experience working there. There is palpable excitement throughout the workplace. People really enjoy what they do."
good,"the day at Tesla is very fast pace. Its either keep up or get lost, there is no time for games. It's all about creating these cars. the hours you r work will make your check fat."
good,"Working at Tesla was definitely one of the best experiences ive had at a workplace. People treat one another as a little family. And everyone seems to work in a groove to make sure we work well together and get the job done. No one is higher than another, we are all equal. And also there is always opportunities to move up in the company."
good,"Tesla Motors, Inc. is a great company for interns to learn and contribute. There's always something happening at Tesla. Interns get to work on real projects and that too closely with the best car in the world!"
good,"Even as an intern, you really get to do stuff that affects the end customer. A good culture to work in and be proctive with support from any funtion."
good,"Great place to work for, a lot of room for growth, Management and the co-workers are awesome and a lot of good perks + Generous Pay."
good,"Nice company, good place to work, to implement your creativity and experience. You have nice support from HR department in all social terms, regarding, relocation, health care, etc."
good,"Company is supportive towards employs for innovation, change and improvement."
good,"Epresa enfocada apoyar las ideas de mejora en todos los niveles, estabilidad en los procesos, buena administración, buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,O meu trabalho na Tesla era de muita responsabilidade.
good,"Tesla es una empresa que ofrece el mejor servicio a sus clientes, siempre cuidando la excelencia y porsupuesto la calidad en todos los servicios que ofrece a sus clientes."
good,"Working as a Production associate in General Assembly line with challenge fast environment.    "
good,"Work hard and once goals are achieved you play hard. A highly energetic, dynamic work environment that exuded enthusiasm, cheerfulness, and an indefatigable work ethic."
good,"I had a rough time dealing with management as I felt the structure I was under let friends hire friends and with this, skill went missing and or wasn't acknowledged/"
good,Una empresa abierta al cambio y la actualización continúa. A favor de home Office y manejo de horarios y una comodidad para trabajar adecuada.
good,"With Tesla, I was able to help transition many from using most of their energy from the energy grid, to allowing customers to a renewable resource that helps promote removing their carbon footprint in the world. Performed in-home consultations with qualified leads from partners, and delivered high level sales presentations to provide customers with a comfortable decision making process. Frequently managed sales pipeline in order to keep all clients informed, optimize reasonable opportunities, and to allow for a reliable forecast while still receiving new business.  Developed proposals tailored for each customer home through the use of project managerial design"
good,Overall working at Tesla was a great atmosphere despite all the lack of communication and management issues with holding down the financial system it was a great opportunity for me but I only hope for the better for this company to rise and become the only sustainable energy electric car for the future.
good,"Tesla’s is the best company in the California special in the Fremont Salaries estimated if unavailable. When a job posting doesn't include a salary, we estimate it by looking at similar jobs. Estimated salaries are not endorsed by the companies offering those positions and may vary from actual salaries."
good,"I was an intern here so I can only really speak about their intern program, which I will say has been spectacular. The employees treat you like a full-time engineer, you are given a lot of responsibility, and you learn a ton in a small amount of time. They limit overtime and are very flexible to ensure you get a proper work like balance, and they pay pretty well as well. Couldn't have had a better 8 months."
good,love tesla if could only stay i would. its just that the management was change so everything is not so great. i wish could go back to tesla in a different manager.
good,"A typical day at work would be stress level high."
good,Working for Tesla there is a lot of opportunity for growth and learning. It's very fast paced and things are changing all the time. If you can work well under this kind of condition then you'll be ok.
good,Fast paced working environment. The nreaksflyby super fast. Be prepared to Stay busy. The wasn't any down time. However its a small price to pay. The people were honest and positive in general. And a free snack bar comes in handy
good,Het is een groot bedrijf en de door groei mogelijkheid is er ook en ieder maakt daar kans op.
good,"Tesla is an incredible opportunity, not only to receive a good pay and great benefits, but also to help impact the world. Leading the way to the gradual perfection of the EV, Tesla is the pioneer of innovative technology, and its culture reflects this. Expect things to change month to month, managers that expect independence and excellence, and bragging rights to tell your kids' kids"
good,"A typical day at Tesla usually consists of chatting with customers, contacting new and older clients regarding upcoming product or current available products and collaborating with colleagues on how to continue powering through the Mission. I've learned just exactly how to better my time management skills, as this job definitely presses you on just that. As of my current manager, they are absolutely amazing. Understanding, strong, motivational and highly capable of driving results. The hardest part of the job has to be asking for someone's information, as it isn't always easy to gauge someones engagement in the brand and mission. However, I absolutely love where this company wants to go, and is on its way of going. It's always changing, and it's something you have to prepare for when stepping in those showroom, delivery bay or service center doors."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Tesla Motors. The lunch rooms are nice and cleaned daily.There are bathrooms and water machines near every work station. It was a nice place to work.
good,I very much enjoyed my time working at Tesla. We are all one huge team working to change the world and it has been a very rewarding feeling. The hours are long but the work pays off!
good,The work environment and company culture is great. People you are working with are always willing to help out and you have quite a lot of freedom in pacing your own work progress and making decisions.
good,"Tesla was a very relaxed cool environment for me. If it wasnt fkr the location of tesla I would Probably Still be Working There Full time. Other than the location, it was a great experience."
good,"I love it here and would want to make a caarer here. The atmosphere and work ethic that is shown here is a big motivator to keep pushing forward no matter what, can’t wait to see what the future holds!"
good,"Great place to work, especially the mission of Tesla drives each of the employees to work hard and work culture is highly competitive which encourage you to give your best."
good,"In my view Tesla is one of the most advanced company of the USA. Very high level experience and knowledge of the most coworker. Management is only 3 level to CEO and keep open discussion to any level without permit for it. The company ask for doing your best, making innovation and pay correct salary with stock bonus. Hiring process use online test filtering high quality candidates. Yearly knowledge review test the employee quality. The company size contentious grow and currently 30000 employee allow to hide some of the back holders. Management could keep the high quality for longer focusing more of the individual performance."
good,"I don't want to say that Tesla is the best place to work. All jobs out there has ups and downs. If you are lazy then you don't fit to work anywhere."
good,State of the art facility and equipment. The facility is the old NUMI plant and a lot of effort went into making the fremont production plant high tech. It's clean and laid out well for the associates.
good,I enjoyed working at Tesla. Tesla has a unique flat organization structure with a great job culture. I worked with amazing engineers. They are all innovative and open-minded people and I enjoyed working with them.
good,"I love this job, easy and pays well but not for the surrounding areas. Task are hard at first but will get easier and simpler to do once you get the hang of it."
good,"Recommends"

good,"Great summer internship. Great experience, great people, great compensation. The bay area is a little expensive and the work is very fast paced. The less you need to rely on others, the better."
good,"Theirs a lot of pros and cons about this job. It's easy, but if you don't like to work DO NOT commit yourself to this job. They expect you to be there, be on time and if you can't do that then you will be held accountable if you don't have any PTO. The benefits are great and the environment is awesome. Their management is fresh and new so they're still learning and paving their way. If you don't have patience I wouldn't suggest applying."
good,"Tesla is one of my favorite overall brands, and to work for them was a fantastic adventure, though one that at times left a bit to be desired. The best employees tended to be over-utilized due a moral code imposed by management. ""The buck stops here"" was a slogan that made the rounds, but tended to mean that the buck stopped with whichever employee actually cared enough to take ownership. This led the most gifted and capable employees working themselves to the bone to turn around bad customer experiences, while simultaneously providing world-class customer experience for their own personally owned accounts. There was a bonus in place, but it tended to be counter-intuitive to the ""buck stops here"" mindset. Taking over for an escalated customer and allowing your time to be spent fixing someone else's mess led to situations where the hardest working employees were often making the lowest bonus. "
good,"Long hours, morning and night shifts. Two 5 star cafeterias with free beverages and snacks. Tesla offers great, low-costing benefits for workers and entire family."
good,"Tesla is an cutting edge, ever advancing company with infinite room for growth and self improvement. Teams are highly skilled, work well together and strive to make a difference for the customer and economy. I would recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a new start in one of the most innovative companies around."
good,"A typical day would contain multi-tasking several tasks, often with two or three projects. daily meetings. Communicating with other teams to complete task efficiently. I learned a lot about automated assembly lines as well as introducing quality of product."
good,"Great atmosphere, great environment. Love working for this company. They take great care of you and offer the best of evérything! Have not 1 complaint so far."
good,"Automotive industry coupled with tech, is a very challenging combination and requires fast paced execution."
good,"Tesla, offers a great benefits package, This is probably one of the reasons people want to work there . The pay could be better. They reay underpay for the amount of work that is required. Great PTO, Great medica, Great Vision , Great Dental  and a wonderful stock option . Very busy , high paced work flow. They do have alot  of different activities for there employees . Great to employees but not great with pay rate ."
good,Coworkers are just like classmates back in High School. They find ways to make working fun during the process although the environment is very high stress.
good,"This company is one of the BEST companies I have ever worked for."
good,"very great career opportunity for and up and coming company that is changing the world! great management team, learned alot and can take my knowledge to multiple jobs and different career path. hardest part of the job is long work weeks( average 60hrs a week/ 120 hrs every 2 weeks). the most enjoyable is knowing im apart of a company that is changing the automotive industry"
good,"There's always something happening at Tesla that you can learn from and contribute to! Most managers are young and energetic, and work very hard - inspiring. The workplace is a nice open layout without cubicles. And you might run into Elon once in a while."
good,Probably the most dynamic 10'000+ employee company in the world. I came in without any experience in the automotive industry but quickly learned the ropes and became a key figure in the companies European growth
good,"Tesla Tech is medium size manufacturing organization. It provides a good platform for experience, for students a good facility to test their knowledge and skills specially fresh graduates. Fully believe in innovation and management appreciate workers and employs to participate in system development and improvement."
good,They are more then willing to accommodate your schedule need. You get a lot of free training. The work environment is always enthusiastic because everyone is excited to be working for an awesome company. By far one of the best places I have ever worked!
good,Tesla Motor factory is the most interesting place i have worked at by far. My interest in robotics and science had me feeling like a child at a Toy Store. Work was fast paced and strenuous at times but the pay and benefits are phenomenal. Quiet but expensive vehicles:)
good,- Installed outlets and lighting in new construction and updated older homes
good,I was very happy while working with Tesla. It is unfortunate that my time was cut short due to the temp agency I was going through. Management and staff are incredible here. Haven’t worked a better job in my life
good,I am very happy to work for tesla and the people there help me a lot on my first day but there were a lot of work and standing for 12 hour was not use too. But after all I got use too it
good,It's a very good place to get great experience. You learn alot about hoe to grow inside a company and have great professionalism. I started out as a temp to hire and became a technician in 1 year tops.
good,"One of the best jobs I ever had. Challenging at times and busy, but also fun. Great benefits and good pay. A lot of walking but worth it. I always felt like I was contributing something. Would work there again."
good,"I enjoyed working for Tesla for a year and 4 months. They’ve got great benefits, discounts, a lot of working hours, and so many opportunities to advance within the company. The only con about working there was work life balance...though you do earn a fair amount of time off, it’s still pretty hard on a person to work all the time, especially if you have kids or a lot of family responsibility. But overall, the experience is amazing and you definitely learn a lot"
good,"I personally love my job at Tesla. The only reason I would ever consider leaving is the long commute hours from Modesto to Fremont is okay but at 6pm from Fremont to Modesto is horrible.  All my superiors work with you, every department is different but then again it depends on your work ethic. We have a lot of associates that hate the long hours and they hate to work. Personally I love to work so no complaints there."
good,"The best place I have ever worked. Plain and simple, Tesla is a place where you will have all the work you’ll ever need  they promote from within and the culture is amazing."
good,I would work for them again no problem professional nice working inviroment good training overtime pension holidays very fair and understanding interesting work great variety
good,LIfe time opportunity to have been a part of history changes in the automotive industry.   Work place culture is your and energetic.   The hardest part of this job was leaving the company to tackle other challenges and goals.
good,It has been a great experience and I’m looking forward to many more years. The company is very diverse and offers many growth opportunities. Great balance for work and personal life due to a great schedule.
good,"Tesla a very fast evolving tech company and is willing to give those with the skills a chance to make a change for the world and your own life. Outside of my military service, Tesla is the best company i have ever worked for."
good,"Every project we get is new, no repetitive work. always learning new technology as company progresses. team I work is small but we support world wide. most enjoyable part is traveling for free."
good,Great place to work. Management in La Jolla was amazing. It was like a family atmosphere. As long as you do your job you will do great here.  Only set back was that at the end of every quarter they laid people off. So job security was stressful.
good,"The only thing about Tesla I would say is even remotely bad, is the politics and the drive some people have. Other then that it's been a blessing to me and my family and has provided me with opportunities that I would never have had. Tesla will be more forever home. Come and join our family."
good,Willing to put in 200% every day. You're there to work and that's what you'll be doing. Lots of overtime so you'll always get your hours. There were times where the machines were down or the station I was working at overloaded our work and backed up the next station to where we only worked 4 hours and called it a day.
good,The mission to drive the world towards sustainable technology motivated the people at Tesla. They work really hard to accomplish their goals. Brilliant minds around you means lot of opportunity to lean and develop your skills.
good,"It was a great interning experience to work at especially as an intern you have the chance to meet engineers, scientist, and have the chance to lead your own projects."
good,Cool Environment  nice people to work for and we get overtime so I like it just need more money for the things we have to do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,Tesla is one of the most competitive place I have work so far but don’t be scare everyone is really nice an we do everything to get your goals. It feels like if you going back school.
good,Tesla is  great place to work. Benefits start day one and you get stock options as well. There is room for advancement so long as there are no more lay offs.
good,"Tesla is not for everyone, and that much is truer than many want to admit. The hours are long, and while there are many positions that people would consider ""easy,"" there are also many high-stress positions which require attention to detail and high vigilance for your area and its machines."
good,Working with 1500 people at once was different but exciting. To say the least very big and organized work environment managers were extremely helpful.
good,Have opportunity to learning a lot of new things and have a lot of hurdles and challenge to solve; Work with excellent engineer and solve world class problem; Really good experience
good,Working at tesla was awesome it has a very supportive culture and a strong driven core to the workers which is motivating. I learned alot working at tesla and would definitely work for the company again unfortunately it was a seasonal gig but everybody is treated equal and strive for excellence in their respective roles

good,Fast moving paste if you do your job work hard put in OT you move up quick people are great jobs fun if you like automotive industry wish they had better supervisors
good,"The products you represent are top-notch."
good,"A typical day started with 3 hours of IT Walkup then for the remainder of the day you were responding to tickets or completing projects."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the enthusiasm of the customers and workers. "
good,I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this job. I enjoyed the team I was working with and I enjoyed the management. Recent layoffs have affected workers at Tesla. Sadly I was the most recently hired so I was like go.
good,Alot of work. not a good work life balance. You have to be on top of your feet which is good. Very fast paced so you will learn very quickly. There is free cereal

good,"I really love this job, its so easy to grow with the company... this is a good job for someone who is really trying to build with there life... overall the money is good to"
good,It is a fast paced environment where you get to learn a lot and try your hand at a variety of stuff. The management and work culture are great but the working hours are longer than an average company. The most enjoyable part would be that an average job at Tesla will not be monotonous
good,My first factory job ever! I love it! I don't like being off work to tell the truth! I love d shift crew and don't plan on leaving anytime soon! I have no experience doing what I'm doing but they have people to show you how and have m.I per station to also show you how to complete a station. I have to drive a hour to get there and back but its well worth it! Its not a hard place to work at all if you are reliable and reasonable just follow the rules and work and you will be fine! I love it ❤ and ❤ Tesla
good,It is a great place to work not only is the environment nice the people you work with also makes the day go by and they are verry understanding with everthing and always help

good,"I love Working for Tesla and would recomend it t anyone. I do work a lot which at times is hard for my family, but love every minute of working their!"
good,"The hardest part of the job was dealing with constant changes, in the designs mostly from designers."
good,"Very Good company, nobody do hordwrk, but all are do smart work, thats the major reason for our company profits,"
good,Tesla is really going places and if you want to work at a progressive and forward thinking company this is the place. But be prepared to work hard and things change every day.
good,"Please remember Tesla is direct sales, not a dealership, all their galleries are in malls or store fronts. This is a retail position, lots of standing,educating the public on all Tesla products and services."
good,Everyone contributes. Employees help each other. Equal opportunity on management and employees. Support is structured inside the team because of a strong management.
good,"The management needs a little better communication but overall a wonderful employment opportunity. Hours are good, overtime is really nice to get, and the environment is very welcoming. Maybe just work on every other Saturday instead of Every Saturday."
good,"The work is straight forward, manual labor. Working for Tesla taught me to communicate well and be fast and efficient. Management is easily accessable and address issues quickly. The environment at Tesla is frendly and everyone helps eachother execute tasks.The long hours and long weeks made the job difficult, but the pay is great. Best part of working for tesla was knowing that I was helping make history."
good,I enjoyed my time at Tesla it was always consistent with many more activities to do around the shop. My only downfall is that is was quite unorganized and very hard to move up. Even with my certifications they would not allow me to move up the ladder to Technician. Otherwise it was a fun place to work.
good,"I did not work for Tesla Motors, I worked for Tesla Exploration Ltd. Great employees, fun atmosphere, company is loyal to employees. Can wear blue jeans everyday, not that we did."
good,"	Worked as teams to create the best environment possible, while making sure all departments assigned to the project were well assisted in all aspects. In addition to verifying applications, administrating oral drug test, imputing payroll manually and translating for non-English speakers."
good,"Overall a great company, competitive salary, and excellent benefits. This is a fast growing company, so there's opportunity to move up. As a technician, it's a dream company to work for, as the manufacturing equipment is state-or-the-art. The cost of living in the Bay Area and Central Valley is expensive, and not my favorite area to live. Otherwise this would be a very hard job to consider leaving."
good,A typical day at work consist of taking and following orders of recycling debris and compost around the facility of Tesla. I have learned how to work safely and how important PPE is to my everyday procedures at work. I learned how to operate a forklift and become skillful at it. I've learned how to take orders and set goal for myself each day and try my best to accomplish those goals. Team-management and being cooperative with one another is important for productivity and safety.
good,Forward thinking company. Great environment in every service center I visited in the mid-west. I worked in the Columbus Oh location and visited Cincinatti and newer ones in indiana and cleveland. Great people and not anything like the typical car dealership. I quit to relocate and I regret it everyday.
good,Given the opportunity I would like the chance to show the abilities I have to offer and any experience that I may have the chance to learn here at Tesla Motors
good,This company is a developing company.Great experience with people they are well knowledged.
good,"Tesla is a very demanding job. You must always be prepared for the unexpected. You learn how to adapt to changes every day, and managing my  work throughout the entire process of building an electric car. We at Tesla work together as one, ONE SHOT! because that is all we have. Most enjoyable part the the intense fast paced work environment that keeps us busy even throughout the day. As being promoted to quality inspector, I had to create an entire work instruction with the director of quality and approval of quality engineers."
good,"I started at 18 and now I am 21. There is never a dull moment as it is very fast paced, very competitive and very easy to get the feeling that a year or 2 have just happened. Great teams with plenty of room for advancement. I’m currently a trainer for multiple lines and have seen people being rewarded raises for the work being put in. It’s all about personal growth and not comparing yourself like I see in other reviews."
good,Tesla was a fast paced working company. You are always moving and on the go. Working staff not to nice or easy to work with but I made the best of it and made it through
good,I recommend working there to everyone that can get in.  It will show you who you are and what you are made of.  The most professional company I have ever worked for.
good,"This job requires a lot of hours out of your home, but it also gives you many days off. They are very flexible with your schedule and try to accomodate you with what best fits you. They have plenty of job opportunities and accomodations. It was a great place to work for."
good,If you’re looking to work in a fast paced environment this is the place for you. Promotions do occur from within but you have to be diligent in wanting to move up. Not all management is bad as everyone says on the reviews. You just follow the rules and behave and you’ll do great.
good,Very busy environment to work and excellent manager. Good place to commute if trying to become full time employee. Transportation is provided to get to and from work cant ask for anything more.
good,"Worked for the company through an agency and it was the best job I have ever had. Great environment, amazing people and awesome pay. Can't wait to have an opportunity to work with them again!"
good,Tesla is a wonderful place to work. Of course there are cons to the job as there is in any job. But the pros out shine the cons by far. Tesla offers many educational opportunities for employees to improve they're value. Knowledge that stays with you...
good,Can be a stressful environment but I learned a lot here. The food is not really great and parking sometimes is a pain but that is not too big of a deal.
good,"Nice people to work with"
good,The job was in a very dynamic environment with moving performance targets and required a lot of team work and coordination. The Supervisors got their hands dirty with the team to achieve targets at all costs.
good,"At the end of each quarter, the volume of customers go up and the day is much busier, but it makes the day go by quickly. The clients are cool. It's all about making their experience unique. When theyre happy, we're happy."
good,This company focuses a lot on growth and constant learning to help all employees be their best & grow within the company. Only bad thing is the constant lay offs so you might not have a job the next day and you’ll never know.
good,I loved helping customers and learning about Tesla's ever evolving products and culture! Coworkers and management are close knit and it always feels like a family no matter where you may be transferred to.
good,"I valued working at Tesla, The people were experienced and created an comfortable working environment, Always offered a variety of different challenges"
good,"Tesla was by far my most favored job that I have had so far in my young life. Unfortunately, I was let go, and wished to stay. Hard to feel secure when a company can spend a lot of time and money to train you and then let you go out of the blue."
good,"No complaints great company, great place to get experience as well as find what you like to do in this field of work. Benefits are amazing and schedule is great."

good,It was one of the best jobs I ever had! I enjoyed going to work everyday and really loved the community! Great job to get money and skills out of school.
good,"Tesla took over for Solar City in January of 2017.  Since I was already an employee at Solar City, I was not required to go through another interview, background check or drug testing process.  So I'm not 100% sure how Tesla goes about those processes personally.  As Tesla took over Solar City, our goal and objective were focused on the Solar Roof project.  Because of the difference working with solar as opposed to working on the motor side of the company, I believe that I had a much different experience than most Tesla employees have to endure.  Working for the Tesla Energy division was a joy to work for everyday.  Our shift manager, whom was my same manager with Solar City, was always extremely helpful and supportive of everyone on our team and was always on the floor contributing to ensure our teams work stood out above the rest!  We looked forward to coming into work every day, seeing each other, and were excited to contribute to what we believe one day will be an incredible product once fully developed.  Unfortunately, the project has been put on hold and will be moved to the East Coast in the new factory in Buffalo, NY; As a result the company made the decision to layoff our division.  "

good,"Very productive and engaging place to work with plenty of opportunities to learn. They provide multiple ways to improve yourself and your job opportunities."
good,"Management does a monthly one on one review to see where you are, how you're feeling and to talk about your short term and long term goals. There is also a monthly store meeting to get everyone pumped up and keep everyone up to date. They very much care for you as their employee and coworker and it feels great to be apart of such a team."
good,"Culture is nice and people treat you very well."
good,"Culture was definitely a top tier, 'places to work.'  This was also paired with a team of positive group of individuals who enjoyed coming to work as much as you do.g"
good,"A typical day would start of with a meeting in the break room and seeing what bays we would be placed in for the day and do safety checks on the equipment and surrounding areas. The most important thing they teach you is safety you only get a few mistakes or they will pull you off the line or by your working in. Managing the work week would inquire 6 days of 12 hour work it was hard at first but easy as time went on, there wasn't any major hard things on the job other than being aware of your surroundings and not making any mistakes other than that they had the best food and employees you can ask for, everyone is super respectful and really was a nice job."
good,"Duties include: Metal finishing, operate 2D & 3D laser equipment, operate forklift, maintain inventory, stock"

I hated nights and always thought ""the night people slack off and are less talented"" however, while working at Tesla I have absolutely changed my mind. My shift is the hardest working shift of the 4 we have. I enjoy management 100%. I myself used to work in management and can confidently say management at Tesla know how to manage well and receive amazing results! I can't speak for all areas of the factory but I can for my shift. The hardest part of the job I would say is during certain times it can get super stressful when we have to break numbers but I can say that in the right mindset, the stress is completely eliminated and the impossible is done. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people all the time and being a part of history that hasn't happened before."

Beside this internship at Tesla, I also enjoyed working in the dining hall on campus. I took every opportunity to learn different skills outside of my major during my four years at college. My experiences on various projects gave me the opportunity to work independently and collaboratively within groups to generate new solutions to solve problems."
