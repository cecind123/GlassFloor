I took great joy in assisting each customer knowing that I was making a difference in their life by utilizing my skills and abilities to positively impact them.

good,"When a company says ""We have an open-door policy"", this company really means it:  the top-managers of the store, and any visiting management, while walking on the sales floor will assist any customer, not dodge questions or lob onto an associate.  If we need to see the manager, he is either in his office WITH THE DOOR OPEN and we do get to interrupt him, or he is actually on the sales floor helping customers.  It can get frantic with customers sometimes, but that is a good sign that people want to shop here because we do answer questions, even unrelated questions about future projects the customers may have in mind.  Its a thinking job, and that makes the day go by faster and keeps me from getting bored.  You don't have to know everything to work for Home Depot, you just have to want to learn, and then pass that on to customers and co-workers."

In some cases the vendor may require for credit policies to have a vendor inspection and RGA (returns good authorization) which the vendor can choose to deny. The partial vendor credit policies aim to reduce the number of policies requiring a RGA/Inspection by allowing THD to negotiate a reduced value that should be charged to the vendor for each return. When agreeing to the reduced charge the vendor is also agreeing to wave requirements for RGAs and Inspections on their product and further agreeing that they will not dispute this particular return policy.

They were vegetarians.  I have learnt so much from them,  Cause they shared their information and experiences with me.  I didn't think I could learn so much information at once, they made their work and knowledge seem so easy and that they were their forever.  Thank you Guys at the Home Depot at 7011 Pro Desk Guys/Sharks, but nice."

good,"A typical day at work will be walking the department, getting my numbers ready for a business walk. Get with my team to see whats on the agenda and what we need to focus on for the day. Then do some team building scenarios if needed. ( sometimes that would include foosball or pingpong in the break room ) The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be the family that I am blessed to work with. With out my team and their commitments, I would not be where I'm at today."
good,I loved working there. There was always something to do. Seeing new people every day was exciting. Loved helping customers.
good,THD allows vendors to select from different types of return policies; for credit or no credit. In some cases the vendor may require for credit policies to have a vendor inspection and RGA (returns good authorization) which the vendor can choose to deny. The partial vendor credit policies aim to reduce the number of policies requiring a RGA/Inspection by allowing THD to negotiate a reduced value that should be charged to the vendor for each return. When agreeing to the reduced charge the vendor is also agreeing to wave requirements for RGAs and Inspections on their product and further agreeing that they will not dispute this particular return policy.

good,"Not every day was fast-paced but most were. I loved it even more on the fast-paced days because time seemed to fly. On any given day though I can say that I enjoyed my job: Working with many people (co-workers and customers). Like just about any job there were those managers that I absolutely loved & a few that weren't missed on their off days. For the most part though, I approved of the management team and I think most, if not all, could say the same for me. Of course the busiest times were around the holidays which could get a little hectic, but we did well as a team to get the job done. This particular store is in an urban community and a few customers told me personally that they hadn't seen customer service as good as mine in that store ever before. It is a fact that that store's customer service ratings improved within my time of employment with them. I loved most of my co-workers, as I'm a very easy person to get along with and to work with. I take constructive criticism well and like to learn, especially when it comes to my job duties; Most of my co-workers were reliable and dependable when I needed assistance or knowledge of any tasks. I'd say the hardest part of the job was when we would get secretly shopped, where there would be items hidden in very tricky places and we weren't aware that we were being tested. The most enjoyable part would be as I stated before: The people! I learned more of what I've learned at any other job prior = patience!"

Drive down to the warehouse to verify all products are available for job. Early in the morning, supervise loading of supplies for job, further check inventory and send crew on their way. Sometimes assist crew on the job by working with the customer. What I learned on the job was that not all customers are the same but when you are able to communicate well with them, they will feel confident that they will receive a good job. After the crew loaded up and left for the job, there was filing to do, ordering and inventory. Management was easy to work with and provided free lunch. The co-workers were happy because all they had to do was show up to load the day’s work needed to be done and do it. The hardest part of the job was when I had to physically help out on the job because an employee was unable to show up but I had experience to perform such duties.

Co workers and I were always on top of things and helping and communicating with one another. Hardest part of the job would be helping to many customers at once with a ringing phone in your hand.

good,"My typical day working for The Home Depot was always challenging and high pace yet productive. You interact with customers who can be demanding,impatience and rude. I have met various contractors who have increased my knowledge in the construction trade by simply asking for certain construction materials. I've learned to hone my communication skills. Management is great because they understood that my job can be a high stress environment. I understand the importance of communication, patience and tolerance on the job with all the pressures of helping customers. I found that those attributes have helped me become a better worker. I've learn how to work in a high pace environment where things are constantly changing. Being that this job can be stressful coworkers are understanding and helpful.The hardest part of the job is not being able to help a customers the required construction materials needed to complete  a home improvement project. It makes me feel bad for the customer because i know when taking on a home improvement project that time is money and any delay in getting materials can hurt a customer's finances. The best part of the job is when I have helped a customer in acquiring the materials for their home project."

Working at home depot I learned that I need to develop patience and that accuracy is important in a company. The management at home depot was very organized and precise which I believe to be a exceptional trait for a company. When we reach a certain goal at a certain time we were always rewarded for our hard work and effort. My co-workers always look out for each other, they always try to stay on the same page and if they were to see myself or a fellow co-worker struggling they would always step in by giving them a helping hand or by giving them knowledge of a certain product or change to a new system. I would say the hardest part of the job was being the only one on the register at times especially when the lines got extremely long and the store got extremely busy. The most enjoyable part about my job was the consist changing because I love to learn new things and my interactions with the customers.

good,Productive and great place to work. Offers flexibility and growth within the company.
good,"When I first started, everyone was so friendly and very helpful. Since this is my first job, I felt like I would transition into the work place with ease. A typical day at work is helping customers with their final purchases and always using F.I.R.S.T. “Find the customer—inquire about the customer’s needs—respect the customer—solve the problem—thank the customer.” The hardest part of my job would have to be the fact that sometimes, you will encounter a very rude customer. I've learned not to let that affect me because the moment I do, I begin to perform my job poorly."

good,Customer service skills became highly developed. Enjoyed promoting products I believed in.
good,"I was in charge of a department, I was responsible for ordering stock, helping customers. I was responsible for communicating with supervisors everyday regarding the summary and stock status."
good,"Customer service"
good,"On a typical day of work, I would clock in and go to my desk to update and read any important information. Because we are a retail giant, I would need to read through the company's info base to ramp my focus for the week, and make sure I had taken all the classes necessary to ensure information for my customers. The focus at The Home Depot is the customer. Their need is paramont, and we cater. Listening to them express their dreams, desires or problems. We do everything we can to meet that need. All Home Depot co-workers work in tatum with one another. If I were to need plumbing advice for a toilet leak, I would go to a computer and learn how to fix it, but if a Plumbing Associate was availablel l- I would ask, and we would all learn! The hardest part of any job is rejection by a customer, or not being able to max out the customer service we have because a customer has had a bad experience elsewhere. I loved all of my job areas. Since I am a neat freak (and you will learn to be one of you aren't), skill level is a matter of taste and learning curve."

good,You would punch in and go to your respectful department. You then get with your manager on duty to find out what needs to be done for the department. During the time you are getting things done you have to be able to stop what you are doing at any giving time and help customers. I learned you have to be multifunctional because you have no idea what is coming next. Co-workers are fun to be around. Really there wasn't to much about the job that was hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with interesting product.
good,The Home Depot is a very welcoming environment to people of all ages. All employees are hard working and provide the best customer service.

good,"The Home Depot for me was a big learning experience. The people who worked there was friendly and kind, we where a big family working together so we where a team that could provide good customer service. Being a part of that family made it easy for me to train for different departments. I was told in orientation that if I wanted to advance in the company I would be responsible for my own training. I wanted to advance in the store so from the first day on the door making sure all merchandise leaving the store was paid for I began my training for different departments. I assisted loss prevention and lumber. Three months after I was hired, I volunteered to do over time assisting with the inventory. While helping with inventory I learned so much about Home Depot products and services that I was transferred from the door to building materials and lumber. I maintained the isles and I assisted customers. Several months later I was transferred to mill work where I maintained the isles and assisted customers I also assisted the paint department maintain the isles, mixed paint and assisted customers. I also assisted with kitchen and bath bringing down merchandise from the over head. Since I was very helpful to a lot of departments and one of the few people trained well enough to operate a lift machine during store hour safely the store Manager moved me into receiving. In receiving I would punch the clock at 6am first make room for new shipments of lumber, sheet rock, fencing, doors, etc then unload the shipments and place them in the proper place before or around the stores opening.

good,"Great company, I enjoyed the clients as well as management it was a family atmosphere all around"
good,"Great for a hardware store. The dirt kind of got to me after a while but they kept things as clean as they could - it's just what it's like in a home improvement store. I thought the break-room could have been kept a lot cleaner but I am a neat freak. As far as the actual work, I worked during the fall and winter which is a slower time for THD. It seemed like it was either tons of customers or none. Because we were so slow at times often I was the only cashier to run both my own register and four self-check-out machines. If I had a lot of customers this got VERY hectic. However they wouldn't schedule more people because often they would just end up being sent home early. What bothered me the most was working the out-side garden during the late fall and winter. It was a company policy that the garden gate had to have a cashier through Christmas but there were hardly ANY customers. It was VERY cold and usually I just sat there for hours reading a book because there was nothing to do. Finally they set up a little shed with a space-heater but it was very frigid. I didn't think it was worth it to have a cashier out there (and neither did my immediate management) but it was company policy."
good,Ringing out customers and mixing paint. Worked well with everyone. Loved the job and the customers and co-workers
good,"The day started with preparation for customers, sales and information of the preceding day. I learned the need for keeping turnover items in stock in timely action. As a member of management I was concerned with the overall view of the store, and as department supervisor, with the attraction and order of my shelves. I got along well with everyone, and as far as I can tell, not disliked by anyone. I hated to have to ""write up"" employees, and did so only when there were no other options. I enjoyed at looking at a shelf or area or display with pride on how it looked. I included the overhead also and its order."
good,"The Home Depot is an absolute amazing company. Although it is a large corporation, it still has that family feel to it. If you are given the opportunity to work at THD (store, regional office and store support center alike!), I would highly recommend it."
good,They are willing to work with your schedule. It was great for me while I was attending school.
good,"A typical day at Home Depot, is associates interacting with customers, inquiring about their needs in order to complete a project. Lots of happy customers, associates and believe it or not even the kids that come in with their parents,even if just getting mickey stickers to the color swatches we would always find a way to make them smile. What I've learned from my management team is the true vaule of teamwork and being loyal to each other no matter what if one didn't quite live up to expectations set forth by the company standards, they showed me how they were able to humble themselves in order for them to succeed as a team. My co-workers were awesome they too were the type of people that I could still rely on today. They didn't mind helping each other no matter what the cost. The hardest part of my job was knowing that a customer was disappointed with us for not having certain merchandise in stock. And the most enjoyable part was knowing when we did satisfy them in every way possible."

My supervisor ended up coming in on her day off just to lend a little hand which was needed cause all 3 co-workers were getting off early, but one chose to stay overtime and help out. The hardest part about the job was we had to keep everything neat till the DM's came to the store but the Guest(Customers) sort of made that a complication but we managed, I received a Homers Badge that day for Hard/Team Work, and I learned that if you work together anything can get done."

I also have learned from the company to be able to deal with stress but never allowe anything to get in my way. If I want something go out and get it.

good,I've just pretty much see that you don't go anywhere in life if you don't set goals or try your hardest in what you do.
good,"Being that I am currently part-time my hours are generally unpredictable but my schedule is very flexible. Usually after you have clocked in and is ready to start your day you have to check in with the head cashier to see what will be your position for that day. At the register you are the last person the customer sees before they leave the store so your jobs is to give the best customer service to ensure that the customer leaves with a positive view of the store. Even though you are assigned to a register the majority of the day, the atmosphere with your coworkers and customers can really make your day go by quickly."
good,"I come and I type in my ID number to begin logging hours. Then I go to my assigned register and log in there. I learned how to use the cash register systems at The Home Depot. It is a very simple job and the managers are friendly towards everyone, especially new hires. My co-workers love joke around and have fun during the slow periods where there is not much work to be done. The hardest part of this job is keeping up with all the customers during the busy periods and keeping the customers satisfied. The most enjoyable part of this job is the work environment. Everybody here is very nice and patient with new hires."

good,Great place to work and learn about things that can help you get license and a solid background in the electrical field. To know that you're helping people find the things they need to work on household projects. It's an honor to know that when management calls upon you that they're confident in your skills and production that they know that you'll get the job done. Knowledgable workers in every department who can teach you the basics and to help you grow in the company. To not be able to help each and every person who needs help in every department at the same time. To be around people who you can depend on and to be put in a fun place that teach family values amongst associates.

The most enjoyable part is working beside a great group of individuals."
good,"I truly enjoyed working at The Home Depot. Everyone from management to fellow employees, treated me with respect and appreciation. One can shine with personal knowledge, if you are willing to share with others. I started out in Lumber assisting customers with choices in materials and dimensions for their projects. Then moved to Interior Designs, helping in blind selections. But I really enjoyed working at Customer Service (Special Services), where I could assist even more.
