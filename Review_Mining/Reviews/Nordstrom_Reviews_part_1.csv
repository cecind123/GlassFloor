rating,review
bad,"worst job I have ever had. company promotes ""healthy competition"" between employees but this actually translates to ""horrible, toxic, dog eat dog work environment"". Managers just get shuffled around between departments and sales associates rarely last longer than six months."
bad,"No vacation time, no real good benefits, always busy store, short staffed always so nothing can ever get done, the department floors were always a mess, the store manager doesn’t care about their employees only their customers, there are no flexible hours , and you punch out for lunch which makes no sense since they don’t pay enough"
bad,"Management steal PeP from you, they're uneducated robots that can't even perform the job you perform. A manager should know how to do my job better than I do. Not this Company!! Clueless!! Incompetent lazy people who can't find their way out of a paper sack!! When you explain something to a manager or assistant manager that something isn't correct they feel intimidated because they don't know what they are doing so you get reprimanded and labeled as unprofessional. Be Aware Of Nordstom!!"
bad,Management cannot be trusted. Will fire you for any mistakes. Training is extremely poor and short. Expect you to get on the phones after one week of insufficient training.
bad,Very discriminatory towards blacks will lie to you about hrs cuts your hrs without notice looks out for White people...Management is horrible there...don’t go there if you  want to do your job
bad,"No work/life balance."
bad,"At the beginning I thought it was going to be a great experience in gaining more customer service experience and it’s now a nightmare. Management does not care about nothing but making the day, and accounts and If you don’t get accounts You’re pretty much useless."
bad,It all depends on the manager that you have. I had a manager that did not support work life/balance. She made it difficult to take time off and provided no support developmentally to me. The compensation was poor
bad,This is the worst company I've worked for nothing but butt kissing individuals. They don't hire from within they bring outsiders from other stores to work
bad,"They make a ton of empty promises that they don't keep. The management is okay but the store manager dictates the tone of the experience and our store manager only cared for money and did whatever to increase profit, even if it cost the employee's their happiness."
bad,Loss prevention makes you feel you should hold doors open for shoplifters as they leave with merchandise. Defeated sensors and tags are the norm. Counterfeit currency accepted. Internal theft astronomical. 5 months never saw a shoplifting arrest. Shoplifting extremely visible.
bad,"There is no chance of advancement and you don't get to keep your full time hours, even after working their for a year and a half. Management is a joke."
bad,"Only job you will work for free. NORDSTROM POLICY is to take back ANYTHING bought in the store. if you make a 300 dollar sale the person you sold to can return the clothing anytime even if it is worn. Nordstrom tracks these returns and takes your commission back from your check. this could happen 6 months after sale. I've had several paychecks where I actually owed Nordstrom money due to returns. If their return policy wasn't so ridiculously easy the sales people would make more. I worked in dresses. It was basically a dress rental dept. People would come in and buy very expensive dresses, wear them and then return them. If you denied a return to a customer then you could be fired.  My boss would spray the dresses with Febreze after they were returned and rehang them for sale at full price!! I wouldn't EVER shop there for my clothes after seeing what gets put back out on the shelf. Their return policy is so lax that people go to goodwill and look for any label sold at NORDSTROM and go to Nordstrom for a refund. I once was forced to take a dress back that was 8 years old! Had to give her 30 dollars for it. Obviously it came from goodwill. There are plenty of places to work where you actually get paid for your efforts."
bad,Do not work for this company. The return rates are horrendous after one year. You need to work full time to make $14 an hour to fight your return commission rates. Managers play favorites based on sales numbers. The merchandise is sub par and over priced.
bad,I did not enjoy my employment with Nordstrom because of poor company culture in the store I was located in. Management was not fair. HR didn't support employees.
bad,"Lack of leadership, lack of control, picking favourite staff to do less work than others, working overnight shifts, I had explained to them where I lived and since I did not have a car, doing O/N shifts that started at 2:30AM, I could not get to because transit wasn't available and they were not happy !"
bad,"Do not work for Nordstrom. Everything was fine in the beginning, but it got worse over time. The managers will find something to have against you and bully you. Going there everyday was horrible my life was miserable. Everyone who works here is fake and stuck up it’s gross."
bad,The hardest part of the job is working with managers who are new to their position and then following instructions when it really isn't the most efficient way of doing things.
bad,"Work is steady and available hours at from Monday to Sunday. Its an ok place to work and benefits and pay are ok. Work culture is ok, nothing special."
bad,"Able to complete task without/or no distractions. Work was work, and everyone supported the company's procedurs. The engery was always calm and fast pace."
bad,"If you are a catty individual who doesn't care  about anything but yourself and a sell, then this job might be for you! If you are a normal human who doesn't care about fashion then don't work here."
bad,Discrimination amoung Management to their employees. Favoritism and no care for work life balance or families/mothers. Management needs training in culture and fairness.
bad,"Started when opened , left cause worst management team ever. Favortism, lack of training ,lack of product knowledge , turned toxic . not open for ideas, I was well trained by corporate. They did not care . two faced in front of district manager ,spoke bad about employees behind but got caught by employees. Talked down to employees. Disrespectful. All they want iiiiiomakeethldayday"
bad,Great career path if you’re new to the retail industry and have the desire to hustle hard. Commission structure is very competitive— it’s all about upselling and making/keeping your customers happy.
bad,They do not treat their employees well. The office manager gossips about employees to other employees. She is extremely temperamental with frequent mood swings. It is like walking on eggshells around her. You are forced to work long hours with no breaks. You are not paid time and a half on holidays. Self-care is not prioritized or encouraged. My self-esteem and mental health were seriously degraded by the end of my employment there.
bad,"Uptight and snooty. Overall people were arrogant, entitled and judgmental. It was a Nordstrom RACK not even a normal Nordstrom and yet the employees there acted like it was a Gucci store."
bad,"Leaders shows favoritism to long term employees, double standards, no leadership on the sales floor. management are not professional with their staff. "
bad,"Favoritism seems to get you promoted here. It doesn’t matter if they are qualified or not. Pay is awful, benefits are not good either.,..............."
bad,"Awful company to work for. No flexibility in schedule (unless your manager likes you). Below the cost of living, extremely low and unfair because it is based on comission. Nordstrom has a very open return policy which affects your paycheck. If your sale from months ago gets returned today, it will be deducted from your paycheck and they take anything and everything back. "
bad,"This is probably the worst retail job that I have worked for. The management is in disarray and the current employees have no skills and are inner city Ratchet types with no sense of customer service. The pay period is another huge factor in working at Nordstrom. The pay is Semi-Monthly meaning you get paid on the 4th or 19th of each month. If these dates fall on a weekend, you're screwed. AVOID at all Costs."
bad,"Daily tasks were a struggle at best. Managers work alongside you, intimidate and bully you. There were hazards of every kind and management went unbothered by them."
bad,"Horrible management, horrible culture. More like a cult than a store. Hours aren't set, the goals are either unrealistically high or extremely low. They'll cut hours without warning and basically say too bad when you tell them you need more. You get yelled at for not making sale goals even if there's 0 customers in the store. This Nordstrom location isn't the nicest either and the clientele isn't the brightest. All the managers ban together and don't care about what their employees have to say. Understaffed and over worked for little pay."
bad,You can't be sick even with Dr. Excuse saying you couldn't work they'll give you the boot. No communication!!! POOR MANAGEMENT actually HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT!!!! you have to be one of their favorites or brown nose alot. Use and abuse you and you get the boot alot of unnecessary overtime. Except you to go above and beyond for the company but are not willing to work with you when you need them.
bad,"I work 3 times for Nordstrom and 3 times I had to live"
bad,"Not family oriented, pay is okay but benefits are not, sometimes if slow you will be flexed off for days or weeks at a time and that don't pay the bills, they are a VERY dishonest company to work for, they tell you last minute you are expected to work overtime. Management is terrible, they don't interact with you and are not trustworthy. Make your own choice if the money is worth it to work for this company."
bad,"I did not enjoy working here whatsoever. I worked as a salesperson and the goals they would set for us to reach was very unrealistic. My management team barely even took the time to get to know me or have 1:1 meetings with me. I literally felt like I was working by myself and had no managers because they would barely offer a helping hand or even check in with me (especially when I had just gotten hired) to see how I was doing or if I was struggling with anything. I honestly can say I did not learn anything new from this job and it was a complete waste of time. Since it's commission based everyone was always a shark and there was rarely ever any team work present. I always felt like I had no one to ask questions or to trust when working there. I didn't even feel comfortable with the management or trust them because I felt they did not care about me as an employee. I do not recommend working here, its a joke."
bad,"I worked for Nordstrom since store open (2016) when I was hired they sell you a dream, you are promised advancement and everything under the sun. No matter what you do, how hard you work or how much you sell (commission based) it is never enough. There is NO work life balance, find a better place to work."
bad,Management wasn’t consistent. Not much team building. Was not a very friendly place to work. I only worked there for one season. I wouldn’t want to be rehired for any position.
bad,"You will be doing returns constantly. Hours are irregular. When not doing returns, you will be running packages to customers from the backroom. The pay is low. The job description is ever changing. The turnover rate in this department is very high."
bad,I worked at the Nordstrom at dadeland mall and it was terrible. I reported my manager to he and they teamed up and fired me. He sent my manager an email of everything we discussed which was suppose to be private. I was targeted from that point and got treated very badly.
bad,Over staffed . Poor management. Cannot make money here anymore . They will hire anyone . Customers are not happy . People are shopping online and the store makes it easier for customers to shop online . Not good merchandise on the store .
bad,They work you way too hard for a pay the is capped! You get no respect even when you try your best and work your butt off!!!! HR and Management does nothing to help.
bad,"very stressful environment, with no room for growth. The company cared more about making money than they cared about their employees. Long hours and very underpaid."
bad,"Bad pay, unskilled workers, no stock, favoritism, theft, clueless managers. No training, hostile work environment. "
bad,"Nordstrom is definitely not what it used to be. Working there used to be enjoyable everyone was nice, but now everyone stabs each other in the back! The management is terrible managers just want to look nice no one really cares about the customers"
bad,No future. To slow of a pace. Low crime area made an LP's job really boring. No promotion opportunity. Dead end job. Store got revamped and managers were laid or transferred.
bad,"Pay isn't good, customers treat you like you are the help, you are demeaned and demoralized on a daily basis in an environment that treats you as expendable. Just don't."
bad,"I was one of the top sellers at that particular Nordstrom. Management failed to be flexible with me regarding my schedule as a single mom of 2 small kids, having me stay until close quite often. There were employees that were constantly late, and doing drugs on the job, but I got let go because I had to call out if something happened regarding one of my children being home sick, needing to be picked up from school, etc."
bad,"You really expect these companies be as professional as they say but that was not the case in my experience. Management was trash , commission was trash."
bad,"The management is a terrible representation of the image and customer service that the company intends to present. Within the team, the management will ensure you feel as inferior as possible compared to them."
bad,"Don’t waste your time the pay is not enough for the amount of stress you get working in here, you either get $12 per hour or commission not both like most high end places."
bad,"Management needs improvement "
bad,Nothing good to say. High turnover. No consistency and a manager see's the I in team the manager doesnt stand for what the company does and rest of employees better just nod to everything they say cause our word doesn't matter and the manager think she's better than the ones wearing green.
bad,A lot expectations and no pay no balance of work and personal depressing job. I would recommend a more creative work place. And stronger management and not treated like non humans
bad,Not enough money  commission only but then the customers return everything. So it gets zapped from the next paycheck only good is discount n that there was little supervision
bad,work you like a slave and then when you need rest they threaten to fire you. Dont work here if you have young children very unaccommodating and rude as if once you start work here nothing else matters.
bad,Log into computer and get on the phone the entire day while being micromanaged by your supervisor. Supervisor constantly changed her answers made it hard to believe what was right. Horrible experience!
bad,Work was pretty good for the most part. The would offer overtime. But the manager there did not care about his employees. Its was all about work. Which I dont mind. People dont want to work for someone that doesnt care about them
bad,Boring. Sometimes on mobile pay and sometimes on floor picking up stuff off floor which was not fun. Did not learn anything. Managrment had favorite employees and disliked most. It wasn't hard. Nothing.
bad,"Feelings of no appreciation for sales people and stressful environment. With the recent growth of e-commerce shopping, Nordstrom is quickly adapting by pushing fulfillment centers and orders rather than satisfying the needs of the brick and mortar stores. Slowly pushing most retail roles to obsolete and not afraid to tell you ""you are replaceable"""
bad,Nordstrom rack in Novi was a horrible job to work at. I worked in the store for a couple of years and watched it do nothing but go down hill. Management was horrible and if you are anything besides Caucasian you get treated unfairly. The fairly new manager doesn’t know how to run the store.
bad,Nordstrom has poor Management which leads to a poor work environment. Human resources are a complete joke do not even waste your time working for them.
bad,"Literally trash. Supervisors don't EVER want to help, never at their desk. You will stay a temp unless you start dating a manager."
bad,It is a toxic environment overall. Management is extremely unprofessional and really does not care about the employees. Pay is an absolute joke as well.
bad,"Nordstrom is a great company for the CONSUMER because of their values and customer service. However, if you’re an employee, you will be treated poorly, harassed, lied to, and discriminated. I have never encounter a more hostile working environment in my 14+ years of retail. Management plays favorites, and will make it known. They think they are invincible and HR will never touch them. "
bad,"I actually hated working here almost every day that I went in to work. On paper, the company sounds good. Commission! Product knowledge classes! Formal training! Organized events! Staff functions!"
bad,This job is pure garbage unless you might being overlooked and I'm to work! unless you want to sleep with manager just to advance don't ever come here it's a stressful horrible job the pay is not worth it just a plain riding company go elsewhere!
bad,"The every day work environment is unprofessional, unethical where all of the employees are basically walking on eggshells throughout the day due to micromanagement. Pay is good. But the favoritism is real and obvious, sadly."
bad,"Aventura Cosmetics Nordstrom has a huge turnover"
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend Nordstrom to anyone that values their sanity. I worked at Nordstrom for a year and some change and the whole time I felt out of place because of my skin color. My counter manager talked down to me and always made me feel stupid. I was so uncomfortable to the point where I wouldn’t even ask questions. Don’t get me started on the favoritism! If you were good with the managers you could literally do whatever you wanted. You could leave early, take extended breaks and vacations. But if you weren’t on the managers good side they would allow other colleagues to disrespect you, hours would be cut extremely cut and you were scolded for things those privileged employees were also doing. All around working for Nordstrom is stressful. They set high goals ( knowing they’re impossible to reach). There’s absolutely no job stability."
bad,Management has no sense of knowing how to do their job to the point where even the store manager gets fired. No clear policies or expectations. Zero chance of growth. Absolutely no privacy in employee pay sales or life.
bad,"Working here was absolutely horrible. During the interview process I was informed I could get up to 2 hours of paid parking(which was not true) or that I could get a bus pass (which you don’t qualify for until after 6+ months of being with the company.) I had worked in beauty, was informed I was going to be working full time, however they started me off at part time. They provided very minimal training with their Point of sales system system, Nordstrom policies, etc. You basically were thrown out onto the floor as quick as possible and had to figure majority of everything out on your own. I had a second job, which they were very well aware of , and I needed a structured and specific schedule so I could work around both schedules , however that was apparently not understood nor respected/acknowledged much by upper management. The management is horrible, very stuck up and ego-tistic team and unpleasant feeling working there. Was lucky enough if I was able to receive my breaks/ lunch, I literally felt like a slave just being there. Not much of any opportunity to grow and advance. The commission is a joke , 3%. I did not work long enough to receive benefits so I cannot really speak much on that aspect. Definetly would never work here again nor recommend anyone to be part of such an awful company"
bad,"Awful place to work. Some people are ok but management is so terrible. Picks favorites, disrespectful to people they dont like. Does not care about employees well being. Will definitely be filing a report against management and HR."
bad,"I don't want to talk about my experiences with Nordstrom. Not a great company to work for and needless to say, I will never be going back to work for them"
bad,"Managers complain about every little thing and when you're working extremely hard, it's still not enough for them. Trying to do your job is more of a hassle."
bad,"I have worked for Nordstrom for 5 years, every year there is a period of time where the work load slows down. During this time, to save the company money, they “flex” off their employees, cutting their hours down in fractions and as a result these employees end up losing their benefits and are basically forced out of the company. Their system is flawed."
bad,"This is not the best work environment, if you are not into sales or competition this might not be the best job for you. Maybe this job is suitable to pick up some extra cash around the holidays."
bad,"Very ""high school"" atmosphere. Gossip, cliques, hook ups. High turnover. Unorganized."
bad,"Everything was set up to hurt the commission based employee, from having to wait for my turn to sell until a fellow co worker either scored or struck out, returns from a year prior could hurt your current paycheck, you could work your butt off and not make commission, then do nothing and get insane commission, the pay was unreliable and the flow of customers in store was abysmal, it was always dead, and the managers were not promoted on qualifications but on seniority, and trust me the people who stay are bitter, jaded, aggressive, competitive, and back stabbing. Do NOT WORK HERE. You will not be happy. While I was there the store literally experienced like a 50% turn over, people left everyday, and there was a new workforce every month."
bad,"Going down the toilet fast! Management doesn't care about the employees."
bad,"I hated working here. If they gave you a raise it was usually about 10cents once a year. If you had any marks on your record, even doing things you didn’t know were wrong they would penalize you in your review. They were overly smiley in your face so you couldn’t complain about mistreatment."
bad,Horrible just plain ole horrible horrible horrible horrible just didnt like don't do it staty away messy atmosphere payment sucks so does management never again!
bad,They hire alot of immature people who don't take their job serious and are there just playing and make it hard for us who are there to work. The managers dont do their job
bad,"Horrible place to work, cut throat fellow employees, no help from upper management. Employees are not loyal to each other. The rules apply to some not to all. Hours and scheduling always change without proper notice. Managers deceive and mislead employees saying they will be promoted which never come to fruition.You are never recognized for for being a team player. I had worked their when the store first opened in 2002, not the the same morale, ethics or decency. I was highly disappointed as well as many other employees."
bad,"terrible managers gossip like high school . they didn't care about how i felt regardless if i was sick or had an emergency. treated workers like they were nothing, and gossiped about all staff and were fake to them. wouldn't ever want to work here"
bad,A company focused on the image of the sales associates not on their net output. Run by a non qualified group of managers. Culture is not great and everyone looks to get out asap. Don't drink the Kool-Aid.
bad,Let go because of disability issues. Management seems to have no formal training in humanities or ethics. They ask for medical proof after almost 2 years although they failed to provide a signed HIPAA form to request the information.
bad,Some mangers are nice and some are rude they sometimes pick favorites and it’s like there in high school still...very unprofessional and that’s childish for them
bad,The management team is the worst and most unprofessional I’ve ever seen. All they do is gossip about employees and look out for themselves. If you try and address an issue with them they just twist your words around and make you seem like the bad guy. Maybe if management wasn’t so horrid the job would be halfway decent.
bad,"do not work here. apply somewhere else. Managers are horrible, and not fair. Need better organization and training for managers. I hated working there."
bad,managers are horrible. They were not flexible with the employees schedule request. They did not like to approve time off. The managers and head store manager are horrible.
bad,They have very poor management who talk about each other.  The management team does not know how to communicate.  They treat there good employees like dirt.  There is a lot of favoritism.  They say they hire family members but they do not. They lie to you.
bad,This is the worst place ever! Luckily I lost weight because of the stress and the fact that returns are taken out of your paycheck. The customer service comes at a cost.
bad,store management was terrible. Literally hiring people with no credentials to be leaders. poor management. religious favoritism. leadership was just awful
bad,"If you want to be enslaved this is the place to be !! "
bad,"Nordstrom is not a good company to work for because the pay is terrible, its only commission, no room for career advancement, they don't treat their employees with respect."
bad,"very political, treated like bottom of the barrel employees, toxic environment caused by gossip and retaliation, low pay, concerns are overlooked, high turnover rate"
bad,The people I dealt with in my short time with them were not people who showed any professional communication skills it was only a seasonal wah so it wasn’t a big deal but I will never apply or attempt to apply to work here in the future. If you just want a job and good money it’s fine but be very careful their trainers are not real trainers they pull them from other departments they have 0 training skills and they are constantly sending new hirers to help support for issues that could be resolved by them assisting. They need to train employees to train new hires from the training department and not put employees who may work in returns in a position to train new hires so the company can save money. I worked at home for years so I could resolve my own issues but for people who haven’t they were lost and the trainer was a idiot
bad,"The pay at this job is great, holidays are mandatory Overtime.  The customers are great, the management is horrible.  This is not a Monday To Friday 8-5 job."
bad,If you do not fit the characteristics of what Nordstrom wants then they will slim down your hours till you have to quit because you don't make enough. They also told me several times they would give me more hours one week and less some weeks so they didnt have to pay me medical insurance! HORRIBLE
bad,"Managers here(especially ones brought from the US) bully you out if they don't like the way you look/talk/work. Instead of coaching you like a good manager, they make your life horrible until you quit. The turnover is very high because of this, and most of the time now, they just fire you. Lots of backstabbing and drama as well. Stay away."
bad,"I dont recommend to work here because it is a very dishonest, clicky, unfair and just terrible place to work. The managers need the most work on there attitudes and performance and this goes all the way to the CEO's being blind to what is going on, it is all about the speed and the money not the customer. Someday the dishonesty will catch up to them and business may deflate. They need to to treat the employees as heroes, and they are the reason the company has success not the managers or trainers. The wages should be better for years of service not how dishonest you can be on your PEP sheet. Lots of gossip issues also  obviouslynothing better to do like work and mind your own business."
bad,worst job ever... I don't recommend working here as they bully you. The manager of the store was terrible and hated everyone and thats it. None of my co workers lasted
bad,sets high goals not possible to reach then put you out as if your fault. nothing more to say. I would not recommend this job to anyone in hopes of job security.
bad,Management is not so good has favorites! They are a awful company to work in! I did not like it at all and the work environment not so good I do not recommend this job
bad,"I worked shoe department, wasn't too bad... "
bad,"Terrible leadership in the Centennial Credit Office, specifically PMO.  I was let go when I was 28 weeks pregnant and lost all benefits.  I think the experience is very different in Seattle and in the retail stores, however the culture within Centennial is one in which everyone is miserable and out for themselves."
bad,Nordstrom tries to kill you. they pretty much will mess with you if you don't bow down to them. poor management skills. they make their goals so high that youre practically killing yourself to please them.
bad,"Very messy atmosphere, I experienced a great deal of racism from my manager and other employees. The workplace culture is very intense and competitive."
bad,"Retail is not what it use to be. Either you make 20 dollars an hour because you steal all the sales but dont cleanup or help at all, or you clean all day and help with go backs and other departments and you only make 10 an hr. Nordstrom isnt based on work its based on who can push the best and the most."
bad,"The Woodlands, TX location is awful. They don't care how much you work or how many hours you spend working hard to improve the store experience, it all goes un noticed , if you don't suck up to management or friends you go no where ."
bad,beware of bad managers and assistant managers. most department managers do not have retail management experience and I saw a lot of bad management styles. very sad to see.
bad,"Wouldnt advise anyone to work here unless management has changed. Entire management is very immature and can’t cope under pressure. No sensitivity when it comes to employees families. Care waaaayyy too much about getting customers to open up credit cards than the actual “pushy employee” you literally have to make a customer sign up, which made the cashier look very patheic! FAVORTISM !! Promotes based upon friendships not work ethic. The entire store needs a “Do - Over “"
bad,They have idiots working at the corporate restaurant level who expect a kitchen to be run the same way as a cosmetics counter- I spent more time in HR for trying to run a kitchen than I did running the kitchen
bad,a typicalday at work was usually very busy most days stressful. i learned a lot about brand names how the company worked. learned a lot more about customer service and how to handle situations at work.
bad,"Their employee manual is ""Use your best judgement in all situations"" and the company will support you.  This is not the case!  They are a cut throat company that they encourage and pay terrible, shifts are terrible and communication is terrible."
bad,"Nordstrom was good for anyone that could work without a thought, an opinion or any previous experience. They had a credit union, I was a member and had a debit card.  Now, you would think you could use that card to buy merchandise during the half yearly sale. NOPE"
bad,"Bad and very poor  management,  manager are to make sure that their manager are happy because they keep stressing them out about sales, bad company to work with  good company for customers."
bad,"the management could be better to the employees, also alot has changed since i've been working thre such as they took away our sick time and our pto so we can barely use our pto"
bad,Blah Blah it is not good. They do not treat everyone fairly and they lay off alot. They have no idea how to run a company and they act like they are high schoolers.
bad,"They will tell you that you are full time, except they will give you 40 hours 3 weeks in a row, and on the 4th week give you 25 hours to make sure you don't qualify for benefits. The business itself is dying as retail has been lost to online sales."
bad,I worked there for two years and I hated it. The customers there felt so privileged that they left the store a mess every night. On top of that management did nothing but sit in the back and be messy and talk about the employees that they liked and didn’t like. The company as a whole was a mess I’m sure they’ll be doing just like Toys “R”Us  so I’m sure there going bankrupt soon.
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work here if it’s through a service company, I’ll just say you get your hours last, they’ll wait for you to get to work to tell you they don’t need you, your literally on your feet from 6am to 3pm with a 30 minute break 🙅🏾‍♀️ not worth it at all."
bad,"Nordstrom used to be a place that i enjoyed to work at, but do to poor leadership (Nordstrom Brothers) and store management. The management has favorites but never recognize the people who work hard. I know many employees besides myself that would work 60+ hours and don't get even a thank you. Their department managers only work 30 and get paid to do nothing all day except sit on their cell phones and try on dresses."
bad,"Worked as receptionist, with a pen, notebook and phone. There was only one paralegal working all the time, the lawyers were always off unless they had court, very angry clients all the times (they never get answers from lawyers). Very dirty and old building."
bad,"The overall environment at Nordstrom is pretty negative, from the management to the employees and even the customers. The management and employees are very manipulative and played mind games with me the entire time I worked there. Very gossipy and ignorant."
bad,"The place is shutting down and laying off all employees, no need to apply for a place that won’t be there in a couple months. Unless you hope to get unemployment"
bad,Very poor management and unhelpful place to work supervisors were not helpful and very judgemental and unsupportive to the workers employees were constantly threatened with being fired!
bad,"My manager was terrible. I suffered a miscarriage while employed at Nordstroms and my manager was so rude and unkind about it. She even asked ""so does that mean you aren't coming in today?"". When I mentioned how I was looking at a job closer to home (I was commuting 45 minutes), they cut my hours almost in half.  Coworkers were great, they made it bareable"
bad,"I am a processor at the etown pa fulfillment center. This company acts like they are family oriented but that is not the case. I have been working 6 mandatory days for 4 months. They don't pay you enough to be at their beck and call. They don't care if your exhausted,sick or have a life outside of work. They just keep pushing and pushing with no end in sight. There were 2 accident s that affected employees being on time November 18th. The ""corporate"" decision was to give all employees 1/4 of a point. An employee in the stock department was involved in the accident and they could have cared less. All this company cares about in money not their employees!!!!"
bad,Managers were all incompetent and there was a lack of growth in the company. 
bad,The managers are only focused on themselves and advancing their own careers. The training is barely there. Coworkers are extremely competitive and unwilling to help each other because of pay method. The customers are rude and hard to work with. You are constantly having to push sales on customers to get paid enough to get by. Basically impossible to advance in the company or make more money if you are in a bad department or location.
bad,The management was young and didn't no how to manage things correctly and the employees hated their jobs which made it worst for people who wanted to work like myself.
bad,working at Nordstrom Rack I learned a lot.. But the work setting is very IMMATURE & I felt like I was in high school. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone over the age of 25 !
bad,"My mother said if you have nothing nice to say don't say it. So the best part of working for this company and it's people is when I left. It was like a huge weight taken off my shoulder. "
bad,"Nordstrom used to be known as a top notch, luxury environment.  Not so anymore.  The inventory is low and it is not a pleasant place to work.  I would not recommend Nordstrom to friends or family."
bad,"Not the great place to work it used to be."
bad,not aloud to disclose this information unfortunately. I am not supposed to say anything negative about my time at nordstrom. Can not share about my time at nordstrom
bad,"Lack of communication, poor management, unfair ""rules"" and regulations, not enough pay for the work load. ALWAYS SHORT STAFFED high turn over. Not fun"
bad,"It's a horrible place to work.  It doesn't matter how hared you work they treat you like........ I worked there for 4 years,   I will never go back and want any of my friends to work there."
bad,"Do not waste you time working at Nordstrom, It is not worth you time or health, the stress level is very high and if you don't achieve you goals with very little pay you are let go for no reason, some supervisors if they don't like you will go to all levels to get you terminated, and they don't have to give someone a verbal or written warning. Be Careful if you are hired and cover your back with plenty of documentation. This all comes with a 68-75% turn over in the credit office and more than 100% in the stores."
bad,When they first opened up they promised everyone full time and 12 dollars an hour. They lay people off and the people that stayed we're treated like dogs and felt unappreciated and lied to.
bad,"hard to get more clients that aren't already taken, selling is very competitive and you will constantly get accused of stealing a sale because sales are so scarce around certain times of the year"
bad,They will provide you with a job description but will never stick to it. They will give numerous job responsibilities to you that are not in your job description and then write you up for not completing them.They also loved changing employee schedules without any notification.
bad,You get your schedule two weeks prior to the working date and most days are blackouts so don't expect time off when you need/want it. You are a number
bad,"only worked during the holidays , too many bosses and not enough workers things was just too complicated unorganized hard to work under the conditions of the plant."
bad,The turn around rate in the department was huge. Employees would quit a month after hired. Management created a very stressful and hostile work environment. No appreciation for work well done but instead you get pressured for more. Management has favoritism with certain employees. Not a fair environment.
bad,"At Nordstrom Rack the management is really poor. The store manager is very rude, whenever she talks to her employees she talks to them with attitude and always raise her voice. I witnessed her raise her voice at numerous department managers and walk always rolling her eyes. The hardest part of the job would be getting called to customer service and having to leave the department by yourself as well as having to open by yourself during the weekend and not get any support from any manager or store manager. The communication within the team is very bad, you hear the attitude in their voices as they spoke through the walkie. The employees talk down on each other in the break room and at the registers."
bad,this job sucked the managers were the worst and they would try to talk to you any kind of way they cut your hours after holidays and they just don't care worst place to work don't like black people at all this is in beachwood ohio.
bad,"this is a job where you work with a bunch of teens. yeah pay is good. but the work that they have you do is not bad. pay is good, but when the season is over and they dont need you they let you go"
bad,I worked for Nordstrom for 4 yrs or more and received coffee cards from great customer service on the way out.. believe rewards were withheld as to not promote or champion
bad,"Excellent Customer service, associate help, and customer satisfation. flexable hours, friendly employees. Manager not as friendly as employees, can be very dissmissive and aggressive"
bad,The store is over priced.  The employees are mean and nasty.  The HR manager is absolutely horrid.  Everyone there is fake.  I would rather slam my head constantly in a car door than spend one more second there.
bad,Company and Partnership clash. Often feels like you're working for two different companies. Company only hires you for selling so anything you need to do to cultivate your business is often sacrificed if you are not selling. Nordstrom does not gureentee hours. Depending on your productivity you may be cut from the floor and eventually laid off. Know your business and constantly try to evolve otherwise you may be in the chopping block no matter your clientele or talents or potential.
bad,Only company I've ever heard of with a 1 year probation period managers are horrible treat everyone different play favorites definitely would not recommend to anyone
bad,"No"
bad,"Fast paced and the natural selection of the weak are quickly removed. Fabrics are centrally sourced and your taste level is not necessarily reached as you depend on the fabric department. If you are good in a corporate environment then Nordstrom will be good to you. Management and HR are definitely on the side of the company and not with the employee. Design Directors, Brand Managers, Designers, etc ... are always ""watching their backs"". "
bad,Be prepared for politics to be the most important aspect of this company. I was greatly disappointed to have loved a job as much as i loved this one but not be accepted in tje culture as most managers here are under 25 years old and lack experience.
bad,I didn't work hear as long but the short term I did get to work here it as okay very fast paced which I like. The people there were so generous and I would love to work for another place like this again.
bad,Company was not kind to their employee's.  Micro Managed and QA was way overboard and always looking to find excuses for findings. Training was done poorly waste of 10 weeks and you learn on the job and expected to know everything minute you hit the phones.  Comp plan very unfair and QA is 65% of it and they favor reps over ones who speak up that they were not informed. Very in mature group of management people and staff quits all the time.
bad,Management is rude and their training is not great. they promised 40 hours a week but once i started i barely saw 20 hours a week and within 4 months they dropped the hours to about 10 a week. Management is not helpful at all but  the employees were cool
bad,"Nothing good to say, this place (Nordstrom Calgary) is run by children, the only way to possible be hired as a manager or to move up in the company is if you are a child and willing to be involved with childish behaviour.  No place for an adult with valuable experience and adult opinions."
bad,Very physical job. You will run 3-7 miles a day and carry and climb stairs. The customers are the best of this job. Goals always increase and nothing is ever enough for management.
bad,This location is very unorganized and the managers shows favoritism . The pay is good but they do not give enough hours . If you love helping customers this is the perfect job .
bad,"You go above and beyond for the company and they just try to get rid of anyone with time in who is getting paid well , they do this every year , management is worst and they violate osha regulations daily"
bad,"terrible job experience, no one really cares we are trained to just push the sales , i didn't really learn much and the coworkers were all just trying to push sales regardless"
bad,"long days over worked minimum pay, disappointing management team. always in constant confusion and work environment is very very very fake. pick something else"
bad,"Not a nice place to work. The pay ( draw/ commission) is very, very low. Impossible to do a living. The work/life balance is impossible to reach. Work environment is not fun at all ( competition, no seat, music....)The moto is "" profit""  at any costs. The General Manager  seems efficient and close to the employees, not the case of the department managers. She is the only one having  a style that Nordstrom tries to reflect and showing comprehensive attitude in the store."
bad,Most stressful job ever. They don't really care about the employees even though they are the ones who make the company. Overall I felt pressured and forced to seek other employment.
bad,Typical day at work would be myself coming in making sure the store is ready for opening. Throughout the day I walk the floor undercover and apprehend shop lifters. I have learned a lot with this company from the monthly trainings that we have to complete some of the trainings consist of code Adam code red or others such as active shooter. The people that I work with are friendly yet the store is ran by favoritism. The most enjoyable part of my job is actually apprehending shop lifters the rush you get doesn't compare to anything.
bad,"When you start working  from training they do tell you  it is great company, we care about our people, it is open door policy, "
bad,Received commendations for being dependable and hardworking. Prepared ingredients before lunch and dinner services.
bad,"this was the most boring, unproductive job ever. very unprofessional  I was embarrassed because of how my manager spoke to customers."
bad,"Terrible place to work! I was given 2 departments to sell in which were on opposite sides of the store! I'm in the middle of a sale , then asked to cover lunch for an associate on the opposite side of the store!! Constantly nagged about making figures when 1 of my departments had Next to no 1 shopping there! I had 20+ years of sales experience and was paid $9 hr. Just like a college kid coming in with no experience! I was the oldest salesperson there, they hire college kids who keep quitting!  My manager was a pain in the butt, very strict, unable to bend a rule the slightest! The manager across the way I would have loved to work for but I could never ask for a transfer! I quit, couldn't wait to get out of there! The store is constantly replacing employees! After I left I found out that my assistant manager left akso"
bad,Managers are base plus commission and sales are base or commission only. Management will steal your sales. Stressful environment.
bad,I wasn't treated the best. I wouldn't refer anyone to work at Nordstrom. The co workers were great and the best part of the job.
bad,"i loved working there at first but business has declined. i started off as full time getting paid on an hourly + commission sallary, they then made me part time and too away my hourly pay without notice and made me strictly commission and when they made that change they told me the day before now my checks are cut in half. they have held my check three times in the past three years i have worked there. All of our managers quit, not one can last! they charge us 50 cents to drink tap water and also charge us 50 cents for a a plastic fork when in all honesty tap water should be free and so should a fork.We  get paid commission and they take us away from our selling time to do stock work and web orders when we used to have a stock team and used to have a web team to fulfill our online orders so its extremely hard to make sales when your taken off the floor to do jobs that we are not getting paid for, sounds horrible but on days we do not sell enough to make our commission we say we worked for free for nordstrom and the worst part is they have such a liberal return policy that allows the customer to return things without tags that have been worn over and over things with stains and rips and they even let the customer return something they bought on a credit card they will refund them cash, the horrible part is we can spend an hour helping a customer and if the customer comes back at any point within a year of purchase we get deducted the commision for what the customer returns so another reason why we say the phrase we work for free."
bad,"You are trained to sell anything in the store. Too many team meetings, required inventory overnights on a weekly basis, extremely competitive work environment. The discount isn't too bad, but not worth the stress of dealing with the other ""sales associates."""
bad,"Long hours, not paid well. I love Nordstrom as a whole but working there left something to be desired.  Christmas is the worst season in retail.  Wear comfortable shoes."
bad,"Not one shift does anything like the other, hire people and don't train them the same, complete chaos.Communication does not happen, favoritism, a lot of complaining."
bad,"Terrible management."
bad,"The job is fine if you want to work hard and get nothing in return. The pay is REALLY LOW. How is management...there is no management. The management was poorly executed. The management there is also very rude. I worked there for over a year, busted my back and got NOTHING in return. Hours? Hours are great if you want to work 42 hours a week because the boss does not want to be there. Any problem that you have is not handled by HR, HR is  very friendly to the management. The district manager is very rude and does not care about employees. The district manager has threatened my wellbeing and there has been no help from human resources on this matter."
bad,"Would rather be in more stable place, commision is slow during some months, and job security is rocky. Wish they had better work/life balance and advancement."
bad,"I was employed by Nordstrom at the age of 19 to the age of 32."
bad,"Terrible working environment in Chicago market. ONLY focus of the store was Nordstrom accounts, NOT customer service. No company procedures or policies were enforced, rules were frequently bent or ignored, and management was laughable."
bad,Great for experience out of high school experience. Builds character and responsibly. Does not really help or encourage you to attend school and better yourself in its entirety.
bad,I think they are racist at least security they are always whatching and firing colored people in particular
bad,"The best part of this job is connecting with customers and helping them find what they need"
bad,Lack of training in roseville location. horrible commission structure
bad,"Terrible management. Horrible hours. Employees are treated poorly. Managers are power hungry, and concerned about making their bonus checks and not about the employees."
bad,Poor work/life balance.  Pretty much a slave for them during the holidays and sale time.  Compensation does not match their expectations.
bad,Too many hobos come in everyday and steal things from downtown store
bad,this w[lace was to pushy and rude. the people are all so high an mighty because they work at Nordstrom. I liked the girls I worked with when I was there.
bad,"Whereas Nordstrom presents a high-end luxury face to the world, it's inner workings are manipulative."
bad,"Is and un-fair place of employment. They do not treat everyone equally and they don't care about their employees on a personal level. If it was an option of no stars I would put it,"
bad,"wasnt there long enough to review this place. all i know is that sales jobs sucks. dealing with customers suck, and selling womans shoes and being a man doing it sucks even worse."
bad,"For a retail store they sell you dreams and lie about advancement. It is not based on the qualities that make you a potential prospective it is based on politics and who knows who. One person if they make friends or ""Brown nose"" the right person despite all unethical behaviors will advance numerous times in a short period, if you are not this kind of candidate you will be left in the dust. If you speak out about unethical behavior you are enduring or notice, the HR will find a way to somehow terminate your employment. HR especially in Garden State is not as open door as the entire company policy would like to obtain. For a recent college graduate this is not an ideal entry level position because people ahead of you have no idea about management skills and half did not even attend or complete school. It makes you question the need and work youve put into obtaining the specific degree."
bad,Horrible management cut throat company. Nothing good to say.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of selling clothing items to customers and giving them the best shopping experience as possible. I learned how to multi task and communicate with all types of people. The management was not the best, due to too much pressure when it came to selling a certain amount of items a day. My co workers were doing whatever it took to meet their goals and it made the woring environment very hard and stressful. The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity to sell as much as possible and increase your paycheck because it was a commision based job. "
bad,"This job was the most miserable and stressful job I've ever had. HR and management gossip, so when my manager was abusing me physically, emotionally, and mentally, I had literally no one to turn to. All that I learned was how to cope in a place where you feel completely insecure and unwanted. I was on track for management, until my manager decided she didn't like me and made it impossible for me to continue my path. "
bad,most unorganized place i have ever worked and you get no pay raises
bad,"Management has no compassion. Its all about making a buck and no recognition or appreciation. They belittle the hard workers and award the ""smart"" worker. Looks are important to management. The employees are sociable and well dressed. Its definitely a short term job."
bad,"Apparently, on top of this company being a revolving door, I also did not get lucky with the store I was in. Things may or may not vary from store to store. Let me begin by saying, I was very excited to be a part of this company as I had seen good reviews and it is rated in the top 100 places to work. My excitement quickly faded to disgust."
bad,"For loss prevention agent you will waste your gas and time , they are to picky and racist and you will be asked questions that are just plain weird,almost as if your being punked......"
bad,you give them your all they stab you in the back when you need them the most
bad,The full line store as well as the Rack is absolutely the worst place in retail long stressful hours average pay no life balance the management is horrible in almost every department. Not professional at all
bad,Not a good company to work for. The individuals who have had continous employment with a company like this are just as worse as this company.
bad,"Hr people are not professional hr people,just sales people who got transferred.Don't bother going to them for help, you are wasting your time and energy. Working hours you don't get paid for, having to go"
bad,I worked in loss prevention if your looking for a company that will take advantage of you then this is the place for you
bad,"Bad management , inflexible shifts, gossips.store manager is the worst person, green flag made customers laugh at employees ..... unhealthy environment"
bad,It is apparent that Nordstrom as a company does not take discrimination or harassment in the workplace seriously. The way they handle things as a company is honestly disappointing and at times disgusting. People from marginalized groups-- please take a second to rethink working for this company.
bad,"It sucked there after a while. Didnt like working there after things change.  There was discrimination happening. They took the phrase the customer is always right too far. Customers allowed to verbally abuse workers, as long as they spending money they could do no wrong."
bad,"Nordstrom is a company who advances people based on favoritism. They turn their heads to abusive work place situations. They allow retaliation to happen in all of their stores. Horrible company to work for, only good for the customer. There is zero work life balance when you work for Nordstrom. Do yourself a favor and do not consider working here unless it is for a short term period."
bad,"Out of all the jobs I have worked, this has to be one of the worst. Store manager clearly had favorites, and if you weren't one of them she made it known. I was constantly harassed by one manager, and when I would stand up for myself it was always a problem and she was constantly trying to get me in trouble. I was promoted to assistant manager at one point, but was set up for failure because they didn't train me in anything. I stepped down from my position and following that I quit this job. One of the best decisions I ever made. No wonder this store has such a high turn around rate"
bad,"This used to be a great company to work for but in recent years and the way retail shopping tends are going, that's no longer the case.   There is high turnover in every roll except where there should be: management.   The technology is dated which makes simple tasks much more difficult."
bad,I got hired was so excited and no one ever calls for start date now I’m searching for new job so disappointing. Manager seem so kind I just don’t know how come no one not 1 pick up dial the phone what is going on here
bad,If you do or say something people will tell management on you and they write you up for no good reason .They treat you like a Kidd there and watch you like a hawk I would never tell anybody to work there .
bad,Very stressful too much stock work changes of rules employees and mgmt leaving. No support in compensation mistakes. Sales did not add up with commissions on check. Always too busy for investigation.
bad,Left because the company is downsizing every few years to the point where you’d have to be a store manager or a regular employee. The culture is very toxic and will make you wonder how did upper management get their jobs and keep them. It’s not about what you know but rather who you know. Nordstrom loses great talent everyday due to this “friends over talent” culture. My store manager was a racist bigot. She put all of her friends who happened to be of her race in management positions while demoting any of us ‘brown people’.
bad,"The managers are unprofessional and bias to who the like. It can be a slightly racist and hostile to work.The pay is good if you work in a Full Line Store, but beware its not a friendly place."
bad,"Terrible management. They hire their friends then play favorites. They only let a couple people work full time so everyone else cant qualify for benefits. Working there for years does not matter they will still cut your hours, and blame lack of sales."
bad,"They only offer you benefits if you make it to full time, however they will do the most to keep your hours as low as possible. I could hardly afford my rent with their hourly pay on top of that."
bad,Management and company policies has changed to make employees feel like they are not cared about. Commission goals are not always realistic and no salary is paid. This makes the work life balance even harder on top of long tiring hours.
bad,"Horrible place to work. The new general manager treats everybody like servants, not like people. She screams the orders. She even puts the department managers on the spot infront of the other employees. Everyone walks with their heads down when around her. Coworkers, department managers, office staff and customers are outstanding. The new manager needs to go."
bad,Making large sales and making very little money with hourly wage and commissions. No way could you work here without support from family or significant other.
bad,"new workers get limited training compared to when we opened. most management has no real warehouse knowledge.they only need a collage education. We have two ten minute breaks for eight hours, No raise for two and a half years."
bad,I can imagine at a time it was a great company to work for but it has completely gone downhill. You’re just a number. Absolutely no recognition for hard work. Micro managing galore
bad,Co workers were for sure the best part of working at Nordstrom. The management is unproductive and very unprofessional they tend to leave all their work to their employees but rip the benefits of the higher pay. A lot of managers you could find during the day on multiple breaks and chatting with friends about their employees. The hours were never consistent especially if you aren't one of managements favorites. This company promises chances of advancing your career but people who do less work then you are always chosen over you. I wish this company would also work on be more ethnically diverse and inclusive.
bad,"Managers are rude, entitled  and racist. They want you to do everything in a very short time and when you ask for your break they get upset. They’re nice when their bosses are in but once they leave they’re rude and unprofessional."
bad,Would not recommend. It was exhausting coming into a job every day where it felt my presence didn't matter. Management was poor and there was too much competitiveness amongst fellow coworkers. Overall my experience at Nordstrom was negative.
bad,"If you like a job that gives random hours, makes you feel worthless, a company that has no concern for you personal time, or you just like being belittled... this company is great."
bad,the clientele wants more than NordJax has to offer. hence no customers. no sales. impossible to make money on commission. get an hourly position or don’t work there.
bad,"I worked here almost a year in Logistics and couldn't figure out why people were leaving when I just started. If you work for a department and learn your job but want to transfer to another department after mastering your duties, you are not allowed to change departments or even new assignments without the permission of your department manager. This is why so many Nordstrom employees have to resign from their jobs even though they may enjoy the actual work they are performing. Nordstrom boasts an open door policy where you can go to the store manager or human resources manager when you feel you are not being treated fairly by your department manager but those managers just send you back to the department manager to try to resolve the issue. If you are stuck in a department which doesn't have the technology to successful complete your job and can't move to another area, you are basically stuck in a job that you can't be your best at because the equipment doesn't work properly. Many of the responsibilities of the job depend on other departments having their part together. If you went to pull product for an online order, even though your equipment said the item was available, it would not be found due to theft, hiding somewhere in another department or no longer available(inaccurate inventory counts). These factors affect your productivity because you have spent time looking for something that isn't there. Culture: Watch what you say to your fellow employees because this may be told in a different form to your manager and you may be called in on what you say. Result in being reprimanded"
bad,At Nordstrom rules and polices only apply to some employees based on the relationship with Managment ........................:................ I do not recommend
bad,"you are on the sales floor alone pretty much all day, I have learned how important it is to work as a team . management at the Nordstrom rack I worked at wasn't the best . the hardest part about my job was just"
bad,"Management plays favorites and recognizes those individuals for work.  Upper management/ store manager cares more about their numbers than protecting the sales associates.  It is great to be a customer at Nordstrom but the company treats the employees completely differently.  Promotions are determined more based on ""it's time"" rather than hard work.  100% commission based.  When customer returns items, it comes out of your paycheck.  Employees have no team mentality and take sales for themselves instead of looking out for one another."
bad,"Some of the managers here have their pet employees. If you aren't one of them, your stay here will be extremely stressful. It doesn't matter how well you do your job, if they decide they don't like you, they'll find a way to get rid of you. They especially don't like older employees. The company has no respect for its employees, and will back up the customer no matter what. If you are an honest, hard working person, this is not the place for you. They do not value honesty or hard work. There are more cashiers than registers, so there are no assigned registers. If you step away from the register for a second, someone else will take it. You are required to get a certain percentage of email receipts and a certain number of members. If you aren't on a register, you won't be able to meet your quota, therefore, there is some fighting over the registers. You don't always get the hours for which you are scheduled. If you are scheduled to close at 10pm, they may be finished by 9:30, so you don't get that extra half hour. And if it happens every single night you are supposed to close, that half hour can add up to a good number of lost hours over time. If you have any kind of idea or opinion, do not give it. Ideas are not appreciated. The store is rearranged pretty much on a daily basis. You can never keep track of where anything is. It's very hard to help a customer locate something when you can't find it yourself. One shouldn't have to ask every day where an item has been moved. Also, one of the managers constantly changes the work schedule, so you have to check it every day to see whether"
bad,"I will say that the trainer was new and inexperienced, the supervisor was 6 months in and never worked for a call center  and was looking for people to let go in training by abusing the position of authority. I would not recommend working for this company whatever you do think twice and weigh out your pros and cons there I am not writing to steer anyone wrong. there are way better jobs  out there.The parking is also terrible  , the location is isolated in that back we're it's in a residential area. RECOMMEND TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Your choice and good luck."
bad,Instead of elevating their employees in cosmetics they pick and choose who their favorites are regardless if you do good or not. They have their favorites and it's very sad to go to work and feel like you are never good enough and you dont belong. New management in cosmetics is horrible. They have fired sooo many great workers over the years. Good luck with them making events and numbers. Im surprised I'm still here even though I always make my events they treat me like a child and I'm too scared to go to HR because they are bullies and will make my work atmosphere even worse if they found out I complained. Also since they have taken away the privilege of making own schedule they make it impossible to make any requests even if it is according to business needs. I'm hoping I ride the rollercoaster and someone gets rid of them or they leave soon so I can be happy again like once upon a time.
bad,"You are on commission only. When a customer returns an item, your commission is removed from your paycheck. Nordstrom allows anyone to return anything for any reason and in any condition. Most of their customers know this and buy things for special occasions and then return them. Therefore you work very hard for very little money. You are required to attend meetings without pay and often times you have to close and then open, leaving very little time for sleep in between shifts. Other sales people can steal your customers and nothing is usually done about it. You are required to constantly clean the department in between customers and you can get pulled off the sales floor to straighten the back room, which makes it an hour or so of your time which you cannot get any sales, so you are working for free again. You may get free merch once in a while depending on the department you work in.They used to provide food and beverages during the required unpaid meetings, but they stopped doing that. They also stopped yearly bonuses. You are required to ask every customer to open a nordstrom credit card and are paid $5.00 cash for each account you open. Doing inventory after hours is mandatory, but you do get paid $10 an hour for this."
bad,"The managers are not smart people, or good leaders. No-one supervises their work. It's a jungle. Very bad place to work. I injured myself and they still wanted to push me working even harder. It's unhealthy working for this company. They exploit their employees.  The HR are rude and don't even care what is going on in the company and with the employees."
bad,They accept returns on used product and employees lose their commission even if the product was clearly worn. There should be a base pay plus commisssion
bad,"My typical day or night starts out with me trying to get things back in too working order. Some of the managers aren't worth bothering because they would rather ""pretend"" to be working on the computer. The placement of items are always changing that you can't keep track of where things are that you need. The stress that is put on the Leads is way over the top, because the managers just push everything on them.The only thing i did like about Nordstrom was the free food, and even then it was just handed out to most people who it shouldn't be given to."
bad,the day would seem really slow and the community there is disoriented. the co-workers and management are rude. everyone act snotty. you just would feel like your skills are being put to the test if you're looking for a career with an advancement.
bad,"they dont give many hours to work with and the pay is not livable.  i have to drive an hour to get to work and an hour back but the pay itself is not worth the gas prices.  livable wages should be 12 an hour to compensate for commute and healthy living, such as food. after bills and paying for gas, i am only left over with 7$ in my bank account."
bad,I was very disappointed with the culture of Nordstrom especially because if it's reputation with customer service. I expected an environment that would previde opportunity for growth and a community of employee appreciation. They provided none of that. I wish they would have the same respect and loyalty for their employees that they do for the customers.
bad,"Don’t work here at all, it was the worst experience ever. Their inconsiderate they don’t care about their employees at all.  Out of all the jobs I’ve worked this is the worse."
bad,This company would not be a company that I would tell someone in my life to apply for. These reasons are many that I do not wish to discuss at this time.
bad,"Worst turnover I have ever see in a retail store.  My manager in Womens Collectors was bi-polar.  One minute your best friend, another minute you would be yelled at."
bad,"The co-workers always a delight, with the occasional snubbing, management the worst, no sense of appreciation, always looking down at you and inconsiderate towards employees feeling. Long hours with nothing much to do but you have to look busy or be tagged as someone who is casual."
bad,"Poor management from top down, a lot of favoritism among the management team. Little or no support for Assistant managers. Department managers get paid to sit around and delegate all the work to their Assistant managers. No follow up or feedback just throwing others under the bus during meeting."
bad,"Go to HR when you are treated unfairly. I made the mistake of not saying anything when I was told that I had to step down from a third key position because they ""didn't see it from me"" without any prior conversation, write-up, or meeting what so ever. I moved across the country for this position and was caught so off guard I had no idea what to do."
bad,"Sub par and lazy management, huge lack of hours, lots of poorly thought out decisions by management, company doesn't have a Student, Military, or Senior Discount of any kind. Stressful and sometimes excruciatingly boring moments."
bad,"Treated like an idiot, not paid fairly, ridiculously competitive, catty environment. It's mostly women which can be horrible. It's like the world's most random sorority."
bad,"Managers don't care whether you're dying or not, they always want you to come in or you'll be fired or hours cut severely. I have tried to call out sick and they say either I find somebody to cover my shift or I must come in or face the consequences. I have even thrown up while on my shift and they still will not let me go home regardless of how I feel. The managers do not care about their employees and will do everything in their power to get them to come in or have them fired."
bad,"Bad management, i often got reprimanded for things that I didn't even know were against company guidelines such as putting the napkin the wrong way. Even though customers liked me I was given less shifts because the bar lead thought I didn't have a strong enough knowledge of whiskey.."
bad,I really love the company but the store i worked at was poorly managed. When service experience would need help no one was willing to help and a lot of the workers would doze off doing other things and leave all of the stressful jobs to others.
bad,"Pay is based on commission, and the company (which does not have a return ""policy"") takes your commission away when a customer returns the item purchased.  "
bad,"Our days at work consist of selling, stocking new merchandise, pulling mark downs to go to the rack, taking in online returns, reticketing, picking up after the lazy sales staff that don't put away their own clothes they pulled or returns they took in for customers and dealing with managers that really only care about them selves and the numbers their departments make that day. This is all done for a very low commission rate and 8.15/hr if you don't make your commissions for that shift. The return policy is that of a policy that if the returns is damaged or defective, it gets taken out of your commission sales.  "
bad,"The customers and employees of this job were extremely rude for the most part, the compensation SUCKED, coworkers called in atleast twice a week. Employees of the company that worked either in other stores or in other departments would almost demand free items and call the store for special favors constantly then give us more attitude when we refused. The store would be slammed with customers on weekends and we would experience the most call outs then making the job even more dreadful. Tips were split by everyone on shift, allowing us to leave with atleast one whole dollar at times."
bad,The culture they once had of being customer focused and great to their employees has passed. The Racks are the worse they are short staffed and cannot retain people. They make it incredibly hard for rack associates to make a living. They cut hours and then try to add them just as fast. Full line is going down the tubes and now they are model them after the Racks. Poor sales people get commission taken from them because of there awful return everything policy. Minimum staffing yet the employees are expected to prevent loss and make sales goals. Store managers are jokes and are quick to get rid of department managers if they aren't properly sucking up. I've seen so many qualified managers get asked to step down or have to re prove themselves because they don't know how to structure their oragazintion. It's based on the way you look and who you know. If you lack integrity and have no soul this is the place for you.
bad,"NORDSTROM RACK CASCADE PLAZA BEAVERTON--I was sat in a dark room in front of a tv to watch a video on my first day, had minimal training after that.  Was ignored by other obviously,unhappy staff, had no guidance, basically felt like I was wandering the store at times. The General Manager at the time was lovely and very good to me, but the management under her in various departments were just plain terrible.  The worst, most depressing job experience I have ever had! So thankful when the Christmas Season ended and I was excused. They do have great discounts, but I refuse to even shop there!"
bad,"It was a great place to work at one Time years ago however the dynamics changed . Low pay , work overload , goals are set to high , turnover is high !"
bad,"This is an absolutely horrible place to work.  Unless you are just a natural seller, in which case you would be much better served in insurance or cars, you won't last.  The turnover rate at the store in Nashville is 76%  Think about the absurdity of that!  3 out of every 4 employees will quit within their first year.  If you aren't selling, you will be treated like dirt and far inferior to the rest of the staff by management and salesmen.  If you ever wondered where all those stuck up, rich but good for nothing high school kids went when they could't get through college?  Well they all went to sale at Nordstrom in Nashville!  Stay away!!!!!"
bad,"I had worked at a full-line store for 3 years and moved to Rack for more flexibility to go to school.  Worst mistake of my life.  The stores look unprofessional, the clothes they make you wear are unprofessional and the management is the most unprofessional.  Young people who don't have retail experience and make the Nordstrom brand look bad. Not one of the management personnel in my department had ever worked at a full line store.  Because my immediate manager didn't like me personally, I felt I was singled out and made an example of to make her feel like she had control.  Open Door policy is a bunch of hooey.  Called HR 3 times to discuss my work and not one call back.  So glad I don't work there anymore.  Good luck working at the Rack.  Full-line is good but Rack sucks."
bad,The chef was disrespectful and wasnt really pleasant to work with. The place was to unorganized and the workers weren't even pleasant to enjoy on a daily basis.
bad,I worked at the Nordstrom Rack at the Belle Isle Station and honestly it was my worst job experience. I helped open this store and was told that I was hired on as a full time employee with the MWK (Men Women and Kids) department. Later I found out that I was not hired on full time which should have been my first red flag. I continued to work because I was mainly working in the department I was allegedly hired into so I had no complaints until I was occasionally thrown into other departments. The management was by far the worst I have ever dealt with. Of the entire management team there were three who were actually really great however the store manager made sure he ran those great department managers away. Several of my coworkers including myself started leaving when they left. I no longer work for the company and I do not discredit the full line Nordstrom brand but this particular Nordstrom Rack has nothing to offer its employees as long as this store manager is still involved.
bad,"A typical day at work is either extremely slow, or very fast paced. I work on commission and that takes a toll on your body after 9 hours of standing.  There is no place for advancement unless you know the right people.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with the changes made every single day.  My most enjoyable part of the job is communicating with my customers and establishing relationships."
bad,I worked in the cafe' for 1 1/2 years and I hed to leave. Me and four other left within a 3 week period. Speaks for itself!
bad,"Nordstrom wants you to believe in their ""feel good"" environment and ideal culture of a long term career with the company. Unfortunately, the store manager and the manager in the women's dept in Southlake, TX do not share this philsophy. The management style is not warm and encouraging, it is dictatorship and abusive. In order to succeed at Nordstrom Southlake, you must tolerate and accept this environment."
bad,Constant harrasment that left customers feeling tension. Supevisors would threten you with not being able to leave until extream goals met. Had heard how wonderful Nordstrom was and turned out to be such as disappointment
bad,"Nordstrom , The return policy works in the customers favor but takes away commission for us , they also lack management skills throughout the whole store"
bad,This was not advertised as a less-than part time job. At first the hours were good but now I cannot live on what hours we are given.  They do not give full time employees the same rate of pay. It is stupid to think you can make enough to live working here. Unless you live in a one bedroom apartment with 5 other people.
bad,Management and HR do not do a proper job of following up on complaints. All situations are not handled fairly or equally. I would not recommended working for this employer to anyone. Terrible communication across management.
bad,Wages and benefits were good. Poor management. Culture of favoritism and unprofessional managers. Acknowledgment is rare which diminishes motivation to go above and beyond.
bad,"I have never had an experience as I had here. Managers forcing employees to charge their credit card so counters can make their goals, illegal tactics to fire people they don't like ( telling someone they're not needed for their shift and to not come in, and then taking to them to HR for doing ""no call no show""). Fear mongering everyday with unrealistic sale goals - everyone feels as though they are about to be fired if they don't sell 10k on slow days in return season. You can find employees secretly crying in the stockroom on a daily basis. Managers are inappropriate and cruel. You do not last here unless you are cruel and ruthless as they are. An employee notified management that she was starting chemo but would be at work as normal and the managers reaction was ""ANNIVERSARY SALE IS MOST IMPORTANT"". Lots of childish drama among employees as if they're in middle school. I noticed before I quit they were setting very unrealistic sales goals for counter managers so they could fire them and replace them with younger, cheaper employees to save money. And demoting employees who have been there for 10+ years while having a 17 year old take their job. The Department manager hires her friends and family and very obviously plays favorites, and is also never on the floor. Avoid this department."
bad,All job functions were not fully explained at interview. Managers lie. You live at work and if you put in for time off it won’t be approved eve if the manager even takes the time to look at it. Trainers are inconsistent. One will tell you to do things one way and the next day tell you something totally different. The turnover rate is unbelievable
bad,The location i was at the management was bad. They would only promote people that they personally liked instead of the people that actually deserved it.
bad,"I have found that in retail, Management have no people skills, lazy. If you are their friend you get promoted, not because you are qualified. Lazy workers get away with being lazy and management does not make them accountable."
bad,"Nordstrom is not a great company to work for, management is horrible. Too much pressure and cattiness. Management breathing down your back, horrible hours."
bad,"Poor company culture & office layout. Details TBD. And to fulfill the 150 characters min, I kept typing until the character count reached one - five - zero."
bad,"your put under a miro scope. your time when doing mark downs. The printers keep breaking down.they train you on a certain procedger than ask you do .it again a month later and get mad when you don't remember. equipment doens,t work properly. It took 3 months to get a regular paycheck deposited into my account .Department manager blame an employee for doing a mark down done wrong when she was the one who enter the info."
bad,The place isn't good they change things all the time and the managers dont have the employees best interests in mind. They haven't given a raise to the toped out people in at least 3 years. HR is a joke and they dont help employees ever.
bad,They will blatantly ignore going issues until it is too late to do anything to fix the problem. Managers refuse to keep accountability. Equipment is regularly left filthy and is full of health code violations
bad,"In my experience, working at Nordstrom is very stressful. My location is often understaffed and overworked. We were hanging by a thread when the company decided to downsize and condense positions. Corporate cut hours and forced people to quit. They didn't consider the fact that people had families to support or were counting on the company's health insurance. They also reduced our pay raises. We needed that. It's hard to move up in the company and it will be harder since they condensed positions. I was working toward a raise and just as I was getting close they reduced our pay. People quit in droves and have found better employment elsewhere. To add salt managers take advantage of their position to break the rules and are very strict with us. The overall ""Nordstrom Culture"" encourages customers to be rude and extremely entitled. I am most humble and appreciative to have a job. There are some customers who are nice and all of the co workers are like family. I enjoy our family dynamic at the store. Unfortunately for me there is very little I can positively say about working there."
bad,Management is trash they don't respect their employees and if you try to get H.R involved with any issues they usually don't do anything or side with managers.
bad,"Sf Powell street nordstorm rack has a horrible job culture . Mangers are rude, sexiest and shifty .the managers are clicked up. If your not talking about fashion, or juicing,  or your boy friend or sports. Talking is frowned on.  They single people out . While other people watch cell phone videos or make calls on the clock while processing. Nordstorms will tell you there flexible,  with your schedule they are not. There all take no Give. I have seen people never missed a day fired because they asked for a sceudle change so they could go to school. The stock manager is the worst. Shes , Rude, she is thoughtless, manipulative, and ignorant at times . The turn over rate is Reddick  . In a year 6 to 9 people would join stay for a day or a week. And just leave on there lunch break a d never come back. Because of the stock managers additude. Employees where always fighting, threatening one another. Everyone telling one one another. Everyone wanting to be the boss . Questioning how people worked , or when they where not at work employees complaining about the person.  This was in all departments but stock especially. I started making 13hr  with 3 years of retail.  When my coworkers most of them started making 15hr. Or more. I was the only one who stared off so low."
bad,"I think it says something when Finance departments have as much turnover as the Call Center. They have a cliquish culture and have taken being passive/aggressive to a new level. One higher up had 7 separate complaints to HR I know of, and their response was that his staff needed to make him do better."
bad,"young manager showed favoritism not professionalism by allowing some employees to participate in selling events. Therefore, I limited my client base. HR was even worse. some co-workers were vicious due to commission based company and it was sad. the faces of the same vicious individuals when the high ticket items were retured was priceless. that money comes out of your very next check. one would need to sell a couple thousands to have breathing room. when the manager books you for the same slow closing nights, you resign."
bad,Don't work here unless you're a shark for sales. Everyone basically hounds customers regardless if you're already working with them. The departments that aren't busy are screwed because of the commission. I would avoid it at all costs.
bad,the belmar rack has a store manager that no one carees and she is horrible and rude and only cares about her. she always bullies her employees and talks about them behind their back.
bad,It could have been a great place to work but the stress level is awful and I've worked in the car business! Management is horrible petty and dishonest. They don't treat employees well unless you party with them.
bad,"Poor management, bad attitudes from management, Cliquey and narcissistic, worst experience in retail career.  ————————————————————————————————————————"
bad,"The company sucks to work for because un any Nordstrom they have those employees that are so fake to you it makes you at yourself, and the working environment is like a jungle. I hate retail and fake people."
bad,Very disorganized at senior levels. Turf wars and friendships are viewed as the most important goals - what is good for the company and stockholders is not in the interest of the senior managers; power and control are.
bad,"I received grate training on clothing, suits, shoes, accessories, and how to help various customers.  What I didn't appreciate, wast the way the management allowed employees from other departments to come to my department and try to sell.  The employee was to hand the customer over to the department expert, but didn't.  The employees were supposed to be trained on the make up of the garments before sell, and would ask me how to fit the customer rather than hand the customer over.  The management didn't support the trained employees and went along with the untrained employees. This made for a very stressful work environment."
bad,"Nordstrom has a major problem with communication."
bad,"I will not recommend this store for people who get big experience, because no body give you credit.Very  poor management. No free lunches once in a while. HR people will not working as well they not helpful at all, they ignore complained."
bad,Overall we need better security here and better pay. The mangers seem like they don’t care about the our safety. The managers are not here 90% of the time I wish they understood what the employees and the customers go through everyday.
bad,"Managers were fully aware I, and many others, were students and made zero effort to work around our schedule when they said they would. They also made zero effort to train me when they promised they would, since I was unable to come to the training day."
bad,"In the beggining working for NORDSTROM seemed like a fairytale, everyone is so friendly and welcoming, The trainings are very informative and helpful YES! But they always try to beat around the bush when it comes to commission and wages. Management is constantly being replaced and there is never any kind of consistency not even with pay, the work and amount of effort you have to put into this job isn’t compensated nearly enough — the pay here at NORDSTROM is horrible, especially when management does NOTHING to keep consumers, it has nothing to do with sales associates if customers aren’t shopping there is no way we can make commission or a steady income, management is very poor at this location and is unbothered at the fact that there is absolutely no traffic, the store is constantly dead and management thinks that retails Associates are suppose to fix that problem.  It’s a sales associates job to sell product but not get people in the door to shop, not to mention the constant returns as to how they accept nearly anything which in the long run effects associates pays but they are completely unbothered by it . NORDSTROM is heading downhill and I would definitely stay away from this job there is no job security especially with the economy being so bad I’d recommend joining a company that is growing and thriving in this economy. this company is not how it use to be, however this was a good learning experience but if you have a family to feed this isn’t the job for you!"
bad,Just ok. Use to be a great place to work. Use to have fun there while completing task but now it’s only extreme pressure to sell on 100% permission pay so if your not a strong seller then this is not the place for you
bad,"If you like working hard for less hours and being watched like a vulture then this is the place for you. They are always cutting hours especially when it is time for bonuses are coming around. From working 5 days a week to cutting my work days to 2 days when you know you have the rest of the week to finish the truck they are not willing to give you the hours. When trying to get more hours the Assistant Manager would point the finger at the Team Leader for making the schedule and the Team Leader would point the finger at the Assistant Manager both of them would not take the responsibility. The Assistant Manager hired a Team Leader that are friends from High School so if you have a complaint it wouldn't do any good. Working in the that environment was getting to be to uncomfortable when the Team Leader is constantly watching you like a vulture watching everything you did and everywhere you go. From getting sensors for merchandise, throwing away trash, moving a rack, opening a box, taking plastic off of garment, getting a label off the label machine and talking to fellow employees. When sorting the merchandise off the pallet I had bent down to pick up a box, when I turned around the Team Leader was standing behind me watching me. If they see you talking to other fellow employees they would ask you what you and the other employee were talking about. After being there a few years then only scheduled 2days and constantly being watched it was starting to be stressful work place and not wanting to be there and not being able to enjoy your job anymore. "
bad,This position was basically a call center job. I did not enjoy working here and it was not a good work environment.  It was very difficult to get a schedule change.  The compensation was decent if a degree has not been attained and you are required to work a certain number of hours to qualify for paid time off.  Expect to work six months straight before time off is allow and if scheduling approves it.  It wasn't  much of a culture since the only interaction you will have is with customers over the phone unless there's a team meeting.  Usually the team meetings were about products and services.
bad,The managers at Greenville location suck. They do not commuicate well. They change your schedule without notice and blaim you for not knowing. The managers Gossip about employees and the turn over rate is ridiculous. You will do your job and others and still not know if you will have your job the next day. The main manager is very disrespectful and expects you to not say anything back. Its horrible
bad,Very disappointed.  Horrible culture. I would never tell anyone to work there. No support.  Young people in leadership roles that were on a power trip.  Not a professional place to work.
bad,"If you like low wages, high turnover & the worst trainers in the world-  the Fulfillment Center in the middle of a cornfield is for YOU!  Left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.  You will have several people telling you to do things different until you pull your hair out and walk off the job.   Half of their work force does NOT even speak ENGLISH.  They throw you into the fire (work pace goes from cruising to 150 mph) then when you need help, you will have to hunt them down and they will be short and hostile with you for asking."
bad,"Inadequate management, employees do not matter, HR unresponsive, high stress, nearly zero commission in new pay structure, zero work/life balance, surprise work shifts, unclear expectations, no mentoring"
bad,The company culture has changed drastically over the years and not for the better. Management will meet and listen but nothing changes. Incompetent leadership. No work life balance. Horrible experience.
bad,"If you are not part of the ""click"" your work time means ""nothing"" at this company. Salespersons are negatively affected by this company allowing customers to return ""used"" and often times ""nasty"" items. If a customer decides to return a purchase after six months, the salesperson paycheck is less. Customers used and return items to receive a full credit. Of course with this option you will keep loyal customers, but it is ""bad"" for the salesperson. In some cases, and the ""BIG"" joke is, salespersons work at Nordstrom for ""free""..."
bad,"Very competitive, fast paced. Poor management, poor communication . Customers are the rudest and difficult to deal with. Upper management come and go whenever for long periods of times. Very pushy when it comes to getting customers to sign up for credit cards. Poorly scheduled shifts, time of under staffed happened often."
bad,"At this company they work you extremely hard with not much pay, and have no sympathy for your personal situations. Its all about money, the laws prevention cover up theft on favorite employees, and falsely accuse innocent works causing them to lose their jobs."
bad,"Interesting Company, Comical Employees, "
bad,"The company had its roots in customer service this included both internal and external customers.  There was a management change in 2015 and many upper and mid-level managers were axed.  That's when the culture shifted out of customer service and the IT department's total focus was project delivery and deadlines, at any cost and the internal customer no longer mattered."
bad,"Competitive and a hostile environment. This job is usually busy during seasonal holidays as there are sales and more opportunities to earn more commission. Other than that, it is usually slow."
bad,"management not so great, no work life balance, makes everyone stay until the last client leaves the entire store and then allows you to shut down register after, causing major closing delays and longer shifts. I feel like retail companies should be built on reverse pyramids where the sales staff are treated great for making the company a success... this would lead to a more significant increase in morale, lower turnover, and the staff would have more integrity in their work, which would lead to better moral and interactions with clients = more sales = more revenue."
bad,There were no such thing as full-time positions at Nordstrom. I was told I was being hired for a full-time position and found out once hired that you were not guaranteed a position unless you were management. That shows how well they treat their employees.
bad,"I started working at Nordstrom with these high expectations! Great company, benefits so on! Not true!! You start off receiving benefits then wham Jan and Feb comes along and your hours are decreased and bye bye benefits! It’s a conspiracy! The managers literally throw you out the door if you work a minute late! You constantly have to call customers because Nordstrom is too cheap to advertise! The managers are on your tail and threatens you if you do not meet your goals. The store is soooo slow what do u expect? Please try another retailer. This place is not all the bells and whistles!"
bad,Horrible pay structure. They work you just enough hours to not make commission. They will give you days off around the end of the pay period to insure you can’t hit your commission. The discount isn’t great.
bad,"I had high expectations of working at Nordstrom, given the overall customer service experience in stores.  However, same can not be said for an employee - specifically to Technology dept.  High turnover of staff at all levels.  Back stabbing experiences and bad mouthing from day one."
bad,"non commisioned pay, cut throat co-workers hustling to get commissioned pay.  management poorly not too interested in resolving problems.  the hardest part of the of the job was their is not a lot of training"
bad,"my typical day was prep and cooking"
bad,"This company will not respect you as a person or your time. "
bad,"It sounds like a really great place to work during the interview and training. I was beyond excited to work for a company that I loved. But I can honestly say management is a deal breaker when it comes to a job. Management at Nordstrom will totally undermine your experience and hard-work. If you're a pushover who will gladly be walked all over, maybe you'll enjoy this job."
bad,This company is not for those who wish to befriend their employees. It is a cut throat dog eat dog culture and those who work there should be prepared to act in such a manner.
bad,"It is not an ideal job a career. If you are more successful than manager forget it! The envy and high school mentality lives at Nordstrom. There isn't room for advancement, you stand on your feet all day and returns unfairly hurt your paycheck."
bad,"Bad scheduling "
bad,"The good thing about Nordstrom is that you get along with your co-workers and you establish a good relationship. A typical day at Nordstrom, is to clock in when you arrive at work, and clock out when you're having lunch and also clock in when you're back from lunch etc. To clock in means that you're ggetting paid hourly. "
bad,"A typical day at Nordstrom is horrible. The managers that they hire for the position are not manger material. They do not listen to their employees unless you are friend , or if they like you.The mangers work you like crazy. My manger will give me eight tasks to do and it has to be completed by the end of my shift. My manger is not well organize and she does not know how to manage at all. T"
bad,I worked for last chance for almost three years.  The manager didn't care about employees.  From department mangers all the way to store manger would treat you like you were garbage.  Lies all the time about showing you how to do new things in your position.  Set up for failure.  The gossip and rumors alone would make employees be dysfunctional.   Worst job I've ever had.
bad,"The software development department of Nordstrom has been, and continues to be, an absolute disaster. Management is completely aloof to how to run anything, and it has allowed a variety of horrible managers to get into positions of power and destroy things for its employees, causing several on the team I was on to outright quit. The slogan of Nordstrom, Nice is at most a farce, as the reality is that most people there are incredibly vain and skin deep. They're the kind of preppy people everyone hated in high school - nice to your face but then go behind your back and say all sorts of nasty things about you. They try to say they are all about diversity, but they haven't a clue on how to even handle diversity - the number of times I've heard other employees make sexist, racist, homophobic, and transphobic statements is insane, and turning to HR for help made it apparent that they would be shielded from criticism. In fact, turning to HR actually made matters worse, because the people doing these nasty things were only emboldened in their animosity to anyone who stood up to their problematic opinions and behaviors - the managers especially. Their policy of Use Good Judgment is a catch-all phrase that means nothing more than whatever your manager thinks it means, and is only ever used to tear people down for doing something someone above didn't like. The same can be said about their policy of empathy - it really only goes one way, to the people running the show. But if that wasn't the worse, on top of it you have developers coming from three month coding schools, like CodeFellows,"
bad,Bad upper management. Theres too much politics and hard work don't really pay off. Work long hours during holidays and sales.
bad,"I really enjoyed working for Nordstrom.  I am an energetic person and the job required that so it was perfect.  Our goal was selling.  With my out going personality and my energy, I went far beyond my selling goals and loved every minute of it!"
bad,"A typical day at work involves way more work than you have time for and probably some sort of a conversation about whatever work you couldn't get done because of a lack of time combined with a ton of micro managed delegation coming from managers that couldn't even do your job if they had to. "
bad,I have worked for (Florida) Nordstrom in the past and that store was professionally run.
bad,Store management was extremely biased and prejudiced towards anyone who disagreed with their point of view.  It was quite obvious that they had their favorites among the employees.  This made for a difficult work envirornment.
bad,"the only good thing abuot LP work here is that they have a great training program. Pay is okay....I can only judge by my experiance, and I am sad to say that the managment was aweful."
bad,yucky company to work for. everything sucks I haven't learned anything and there is nothing enjoyable about working for this place
bad,"I handled investigations of retail crime through the use of Closed-Circuit Television, as well as undercover shopping."
bad,"co worker are great, management could care less about worker, don't trust any manager with any problems you may have."
bad,"The photo department in the Seattle area Nordstrom’s seems to be full of horribly lazy and talentless people who claim to be professional photographers or image specialists. They are just check collectors who are intimidated by anyone with obvious talent who may show just how inept and noncreative they really are. The attitude of self-importance is pervasive along inflated egos based on nothing more than having a job, but no talent to back it up. They are a group of worthless wannabee’ who are supported by management who of course do not know the difference between talent and hack."
bad,"The company is full of politics. If you are great at your job don't expect to move up with the company unless you know how to be fake and backstabbing. Plus, assistant managers do not get paid well."
bad,"In my current role and location I have no support, made to feel unimportant, ostracized. No one cares about developing you, only putting you down. It's like they want you to fail."
bad,"From my experience working at Nordstrom, the company as a whole does care a lot about their customers. On the other hand they do not care about their employees what so ever, There were employees who were assaulted by other employees and no actions were taken towards the situation. The managers bullied their employees and the gossip was over the top. If employees are pregnant it doesn't matter, they still have to come to work, there's ""no such thing"" as maternity leave there. I was very upset while I was working their because of how poorly the company treated their employees."
bad,"NORDSTROM DC in GAINESVILLE,FL is HORRIBLE. Management has no integrity, no sense of morality! Hired a bunch of us and treated us horribly! talked to us like we were idiots. The manager( who's over the whole building) is VERY RUDE!  She would say slick things and be sarcastic towards our culture. She was never at work. She stayed on vacation. There was no money contributed to showing appreciation to all employees.  As long as i was there, there were no bonuses. management would have secret drawings for winners but i believe they would choose who they wanted to win things. Management was very picky with who they liked. NO CHANCE OF ADVANCEMENT. TWO 10 minute breaks is all you get in an 8 or 9 hour shift. And they expect you to be back on the floor ON TIME. how? when you have just choked on your food because of the 5 minutes you have to eat. They encourage you to apply to different positions at work just so they can tell you NO and reject your application when the time comes. The pay was good but its not worth the headache. and the cameras being zoomed in on your station because they assume you may be stealing. holidays are coming up and you wont receive anything! not even a turkey. HOWEVER you will receive a birthday card in the mail signed by the most disliked person in the building. This company opened my eyes and showed me that they dont really care about you and your well being. I hope management gets EXPOSED!"
bad,"My experience working in the cafe is just for this particular location in Indiana; maybe yours will be better. I really hope so."
bad,The job wasn’t for me. They sucked at training & judged you very harshly-even when you first start! You are treated no differently as a rookie vs a veteran. You are expected to know and work as fast as everyone else. Which is hard to do when your trainer sucks.
bad,You can make decent money if you are in the right department but the politics are terrible and management is the worst...  There in no work/life balance and the manager I worked for did not seem to care. It is a very competitive environment and you have to have tought skin to survive
bad,"Management act childish at best. They sell you a line of BS, then throw you under the bus if it protects them. Only friends and family get promoted. Best of luck if you work for them."
bad,"Great health care and retirement plan, but management may drain you mental over achieving prep for there benefit. Overall it is strenuous labor that will take a toll on body and mind."
bad,I’ve been with the company for 10 years. And unfortunately we can see the downfall coming. First of all their Pay is not true as advertised. Sales people in shoes. Don’t make a base we are 100% commission based employees. Due to a lawsuit in California a few years back. They were forced to change the verbiage in their pay agreements with all employees. We were forced to sign the new pay agreement or force separation from the company. In recent years they’ve started hiring younger managers who lack the ability to make appropriate business calls. They over staff sales floors and have this new “List” rule. What that means is you can only help one customer at a time. And even if they don’t buy you’re forced to go to the stock room and do stock work. (For free) and wait till you’re called out again.  This is the equivalent of being a server and only being able to help one table at a time.  This micromanaging has caused a lot of really amazing sales people to leave the company. We are down in in-store sales every year and they continue to drive people away and over staff. I can go on regarding the recent changes but they pay is the biggest issue. Teens in high school get paid more to start ($15/hr) than what we pay our employees.
bad,"Nordstrom is struggling to find its place in the digital age of shopping. I put in 13 years of service with the company, 10 of those in management. I became mobile and moved away from my family to advance my career, only to be let go after less than a year in my new role in the companies latest “restructure.” Trust me, it won’t be the last so beware if you’re in the market for a position with job security. The values have changed. The company is less customer obsessed and more focused on saving a dime and promoting the popular choice. It is a shame."
bad,"They hired several of us as seasonal employees in June, worked us overtime when necessary, Sent us home early whenever they felt like it.  Searched your bags every time you left the building.  Very little communication or encouragement or training from management.  Laid most of us off in August."
bad,No work/life balance. Worked for the company for 5+ years. Very cult like environment and if you do not drink the kool-aid you will be a target for upper management.
bad,"Nordstrom is known for having top customer service and they do. Unfortunately they have terrible employee service. The managers are the opposite of supportive, in fact they are outwardly mean. Talking about other employees on the sales floor is just one instance of many. Nordstrom as a company finds legal ways to usurp the California state healthcare laws and uses an hourly model to implement health insurance, instead of the by law three months that California requires. They will then cut your hours during slow season to make it nearly impossible to obtain and let alone keep health insurance. I worked there for 11 months full time and was offered health insurance right before I left. Overall I would say they were one of the worst companies I have ever worked for."
bad,"The customers were privileged and demanded special treatment over other customers just because they didn't have self control when it came to shopping or just because they were making returns. They have no problem putting you down when they've had a bad day, same with the managers. Always short staffed on the busiest days and managers hide in their offices for hours playing on their phones pretending to send emails. They will do just about anything to get out of ringing at the registers. A manager threatened me just for saying what a customer specifically told me to say, and they don't tell you if you got any strikes until you are on your last and at risk. Like you won't even know you did something wrong until its too late. Also they had ridiculous goals that the would shame you if you didnt meet, but if you dis meet them they would double them the next week, basically assuring your failure just so they can shame you. As long as you can trick a boatload people a week into opening credit cards you can pretty much get away with murder. Too bad most regulars already have one and hate it because they have another bill to pay because they discontinued the debit card. This job gave me grey hair and I'm in my mid 20s."
bad,"I dreaded coming to work at this Nordstrom. First of all, they hire you as a full time employee but did not tell me until after I had started that I would never get 40 hours. It would be more like 30-32 if I am lucky. I worked in the Beauty Dept and the price points I sell are relatively low so making much in commission is not going to happen.  As a new person, I was not prepared for how snotty and ugly the majority of the women that work their are. They stand around in groups gossiping all day. Some of the things I have overheard, disgust me. I don't want to work around people like that or even be around people like that. Granted, it is a slow store with not much to do but still.. no thanks. "
bad,I felt discriminated against because  of my age and color of my skin. The two HR people in the store were African American and the store manager was Asian.
bad,You'll always be asked to push customers for their e-mail and to get them to sign up for a debit or credit card. Also be prepared to take on an entire line of people by yourself because the other two that are working with you are probably bust signing people up for the card which means you're doing all the work.
bad,"Management sets the tone for environment. Yelling and insulting subordinates should not be tolerated. Bring back what was a nice family environment and get rid of all the ego. I worked with many previous Nordstrom store and department managers and loved it. Unfortunately now this markets environment is too unstable and hostile to work at, or even shop."
bad,"Nice environment, love helping customers with any questions they usually have , love waking the floors helping everyone with the questions , Amazing coworkers"
bad,"I was bought in to work and given no opportunity to do so. I ascribe this to an overly flattened management structure. The  person who managed my day to day activity was not on board with my being hired, and gave me no opportunity to prove myself. It was a waste of time."
bad,"The job itself is not hard anyone can do it. Nordstroms open door policy means,You can tell them any issues you have and you can’t get in trouble but at this location they twist your words and  write you up. Management does not want you to make friends with coworkers due to gossip,  when managers do nothing but gossip and talk bad about their employees. Naydi (store 715 SE Manager)   In particular,  made me hate my job and she is the most unprofessional manager I have ever worked with.  Management in general here is a joke and they are always understaffed and Blame you if any work was not done the night before.  The company was great to work for, great benefits but I could not stand to be at this location any longer."
bad,I felt like I was being judged all the time and they have favorites. If your not a favorite then they feed you to the wolves. I wasn't happy there but there was a few selected good coworkers.
bad,"Management and human resources do not care about their hard working, dedicated employees. They are expendable to the organization. They tolerate negative treatment, lying and cheating as long as Nordstrom makes their numbers. It is unfortunate because they have some talented employees that give 100% and any company would be lucky to have them."
bad,"If management doesn't like you, your done, they'll change rules just to railroad you !! And trainers in some depts. just plain SUCK!!!! some ""groups"" et special treatment...………..."
bad,"Even if it was a short term job, it was horrible working there. Hours were questionable at best, I really believe half the employees were sleeping with each other, and they would fire you for the strangest of reasons to the point you could sue them for wrongful termination."
bad,"Nordstrom may be a wonderful company.  However, the store department where I worked needs a management overhaul! Favoritism was rampant! Favorite employees went out to lunch for hours, shopped most of the day, and acted as though they were also management."
bad,"If you want to work for uneducated children in a workplace with a horrible turnover rate this is the place for you! I worked there 3 years before a 20 year old manager got hired and fired the older team members, awful. Company is a joke."
bad,"Starting at Nordstrom I was excited to work for ""One of the best companies"".  Soon after I started I realized that if you are a hard-worker or in my case an ""over achiever"" your direct upper management would completely pretend to not see your hard work and your obvious deserving for promotion, recognition, etc. If you are not in the inner circle of management favorites ( who are typically gossipers, lazy and abuse the system) You aren't anything. They have no interest in helping people move up, especially if you aren't a ""FAVORITE"" .  They say they have an inverted pyramid where they have an open door policy and the sales people are the ones on top, LIE. You cant go to your upper management in confidence. "
bad,If you drink the Kool-Aid and become a Nordie all is fine.  The moment you have a different opinion you will find yourself on the outside.  The culture is homophobic and has a glass ceiling for women.
bad,"Its not a job i would want again, i did not get the hours i wanted. i was hired full time and they overstaffed so i got my hours cut. It was really hard on my back and feet."
bad,"While this company has a good reputation overall, the Santa Barbara store has problems with terrible management; long-term employees who are unfit to work with and mange human beings, but are kept around. This low-volume store does not pay living wages, which only attracts temporary college students as sales associates. Typical horrible retail schedule and hours. Difficult to get vacation time approved."
bad,"Nordstrom hasn't been the most horrible work environment I have been in but its close. "
bad,Typical corporate politics with manic cut throat floor managers and a desperate Store Manager. Someone make her take a nap or have a valium. Its unbecoming my dear. Catty coworkers and if you're not pretty forget about it.
bad,"Typical retail.  If you still have faith in humanity - avoid"
bad,Management ruined this place. When I first started it was an easy going place everyone was relaxed. One upper manager left and this new one came in and had supervisors working too hard for little pay. The leads get no acknowledgement of the work they do for the teams and training.
bad,They canned me because I got into an accident in the snow after endless 60 hour work weeks. Management is uncaring. The pay is decent though for not needing experience.
bad,I wouldn’t recommend working here to my worse enemy. The managers act like kids in high school and they’re hard to work with. Human Resources never knows the answers to your very important questions and the environment just seems so conniving and cut throat.
bad,Although the job itself is alright the management style is lacking. all of the departments have micromanagement. Management doesn't really seem to know the processes of the departments and changes key points that have made the processes harder or even impossible to perform.
bad,"sucky management, sucky co-workers, sucky schedule"
bad,"Micromanaging so much that nobody will stay around there too long."
bad,Very controlling place to work at. You are considered a number. Not a person. You work their schedule and they do not respect your home or family life. Attendance point schedule is used to control your days off. But you get points if you go to the hospital or a family member dies.
bad,Managers micromanage at Bazille's. They don't help when it busy they just stand around and judge you. They tell you when your first start that you can ask them any questions or ask for help but that not the case. Expect you to know everything after 2 weeks.
bad,"Little traffic throughout the day, which makes for very slow paced days. Typically the department misses their daily sales goals due to a lack of customers. A lot of conflict with management. Work environment is positive for the most part, with the exception of management. Most days are dull and are not challenging whatsoever."
bad,management structure is completely ridiculous on the higher levels of things in the restaurant side of things.  People combining jobs and job titles and not upping the pay scale.  Also misleading as far as future promotions.  Only so guy you can go before they fill slots with friends that they know from elsewhere. Joke of a  company to work for.
bad,"This is partly due to the particular store I was in and the dreadful environment born due to the worst store manager I've ever experienced in my life. Favourtism, sexism, lack of support and a lack of positive acknowledgement were all prevalent on a day to day basic. Money isn't that great. They think bc they start you more than minimum wage they are better than other companies."
bad,"Terrible place to work, too many clicks and many of the female managers only look out for their best interests. Back stabbing employees who only cover themselves. Racist/discrimination/environment."
bad,No work/life balance. Nordstrom does not care about their employees. The best part of the job was working with the people. The hardest part of the job was working long hours and not getting paid for them.
bad,it consumes you and its not a great atmosphere they tell you its a family but lots of gossip and health benefits suck overall don't work there not a good place.
bad,"Trained to sell anything in the store.  Team meetings, required inventory overnight, extremely competitive.  Okay discount but not worth the stress of dealing with  ""sales associates."""
bad,"So lets start in the interview. Brand new store, brand new staff, everyone is excited..."
bad,"Some people love this company, others hate it.  I find the general culture of the company obnoxious, combative, condescending, and the people least capable of leading or managing are promoted based on their inability to ascertain that they are being taken advantage of.  A pretty foolish company to work for."
bad,Everything is based on favoritism. If you are there favorite or there friend then they will promote you. Otherwise you will be in the same position and get treated unfairly. My first lead was a drug addict and came to work on shrooms he did not get fired. But other people that speak up because they are getting unfairly mistreated speak up and lose their jobs.
bad,No work/life balance.  Long work hours and little recognition or rewards.
bad,"I work as a customer service representative at Nordstrom rack. A typical day for me entails ringing out customers, answering their questions, and troubleshooting their problems. Being a customer service rep has me dealing exclusively with customers day in and day out, which comes with its own set of challenges. The most important lessons that I have learned is how to not only have thick skin which is imperative in this field, but to supply your own inner happiness and not to let the sometimes negative energy of others  effect your energy, but to let your positive energy permeate through your actions and interactions with others. The retail environment is very fast paced, and it is very easy to get overwhelmed. The key is taking everything one customer at a time and knowing that its better to give great customer service and giving each customer a special and unique experience, as oppose to fretting and allowing yourself to be and feel rushed. For the most part I feel it is the job of the management to not only help ensure that things run smoothly and to assist their staff in providing the best possible customer service to the customers, but to also be an asset to their respective team by providing sound advice, appropriate coaching when necessary, demonstrating unquestioned fairness, and solving team related issues without bias. At my time at Nordstrom I have encountered many different managers with different managerial styles, and as with life I agreed more with some than with others. The same holds true for my co-workers. I have met some truly great and fascinating people in"
bad,"Upper Management is the worst if your not considered a favorite your treated poorly and unfair. They do not recognize employees for their hard work, instead they favor certain employees who are lazy, complain and basically do nothing. Worked for the company for many years and I would not recommend any of my clients to shop there nor would I refer any potential employees to apply."
bad,"I learned a LOT in my job including extensive use of Microsoft Office, accounting, Customer Service, and sales. I, unfortunately, lost my respect for the company working there as I can see the ""honeymoon is over"" for them, their façade as a customer service-based company is simply untrue as seen from the front lines. The most enjoyable art of the job was the customer interaction I had on a daily basis, I thrived and excelled in recognizing and satisfying customer needs efficiently."
bad,"Answered phones, helped customer with their accounts, and provided support to the Stores. I worked with great people, and have many friends from working there. Hardest part of the job is the diffcult customers. The best part of the job was my co-workers and the great customers that I helped."
bad,"I would never work here again in my life. The pay is great and the Co-workers are usually okay to work with as well, but management sucks here big time don't expect to get anywhere unless you kiss a lot of but to get there."
bad,"I once thought Nordstrom was the place to work. Not anymore. With more cuts to an obviously necessary program, Nordstrom has proved that they don't care about or value success, dedication, and loyalty. Award winning managers are simply being cut. Hard to believe but it is one hundred percent true."
bad,"After three years at Yorkdale location, I can tell you it has not been a positive experience.  Extremely high turnover for a reason.  Cannot speak for Eaton Centre.  Sherway Gardens is destined to close.  Beware."
bad,"Poor work/life balance. High compatible motivation. Make incentive goals based on highest performing employees that are know to game the system by cutting corners and not doing the job in its entirety. Incentive goals should be based on averages to make work achievement fair and obtainable, otherwise this poor behavior promotes negative self-worth because almost all fail every day."
bad,"They want you to work quickly, give you very little training, the departments don’t communicate to each other heck the department managers don’t communicate to each other either... half the time you are standing around for hours waiting for work to be sent down the lines & then a manager comes yelling everyone needs to work faster cuz our #’s are low! They tell you mandatory 6 day work week but send you home 4 hours early every day!!! Money is great if you caget the hours..."
bad,My supervisor made me feel as if I did noy belong there and she was very disrespectful and so is most of the staff considering my husband also worked there and they underestimated his experience and made him feel the exact same they made me feel.
bad,"Subjective performance reviews, no work life balance, low and inconsistent salary for managers, unrealistic expectations, inconsistent communication, integrity of company declined over the years"
bad,Draw is hard to work under. Security thinks your guilty the day you walk in. The had a low opinion for everyone. In all my time there I saw just a couple employees get arrested. Not much. And they parade them through the store for all to see. Human Resources (woman with high voice) was so unprofessional. I hope I never ever see her again. She was not helpful.
bad,There was no kitchen culture/etiquette to speak of. Especially towards the Sous Chef or Chef. You had to be cognizant and caring of 'feelings' when instructing/correcting a cook.  Management undermined authority of chefs constantly.
bad,"Very bad experience. "
bad,i always got told on for cussing but all my other co workers cussed on a daily basis so they pin pointed me and had my butt fired on christmas night the management sucks
bad,"Very little guidance from managers, very cut-throat. The work itself was easy, but the management made it very difficult to complete tasks. If you enjoy retail, and are able to sell, and thrive in competition, I say go for it. If not, don't waste your time."
bad,"The worst part of working at NPG is the hypocrisy and lack of action.  The pace of change and innovation is near zero.  This is a company and department that supposedly champions ""continuous improvement"" and a set of ideals and beliefs that all should live by.  The reality is that true improvement rarely happens, but consultants and leadership are constantly parading around the offices celebrating ""quick wins"" while real problems continue to fester and teams fall apart.  The core beliefs are rarely put into practice and frequently ignored or violated.  "
bad,management is very unfair to people if they don't like you. they hardly every follow the code and make decisions based on there like. from the department managers to store manager and hr very unprofessional and catty like mean high school girls.
bad,"I had a horrible manager. You are not a person at Nordstrom, you are a number. You are treated based on how you sell. While I received many letters from customers on how great I was, and great reviews with great sales, what hurt my performance were my rate of returns. My manager did not care that I was great with customers, she just saw my returns as high and wanted me out. She favored people who sold well and when there is conflict, because there will be in a commission based environment, she sides with WHO SELLS THE MOST, not who is right. So if your numbers are low, the ones who sell well will start nonsense with you and know they will get away with it because they sell well and the manager will side with them. They will steal your sales and get away with it because the manager will let them because if your numbers are consistently low, they can write you up and make you feel inadequate so you will leave. Horrible and political tactics. While it might just be my manager that was unethical and not the company, this was my experience working for Nordstrom."
bad,a typical day at work is answering the phones. I improved on my customer service skills. the culter is youre stuck to your desk. the hours and schedule are terrible.
bad,"very typical day"
bad,"unless your personality fits in with the Nordstrom culture, your life at Nordstrom will be very difficult. I was ostracized to the fullest extent when the new manager took over. And speaking of him, what a joke! The guy lets a stop walk out the door because his uber was there. He constantly left his team hanging and threw us all under the bus when he needed to. The original manager will be missed at that store massively forever. The sales employees are beyond rude, its a commission culture and I swear it as if you are taking their sales away. The store manager is awful to the LP team as well. Decent pay, but almost not even worth it"
bad,"I have been told Nordstrom is a good company to work for but this location is terrible! The store manager and dept managers are very hard to work for and do a lot of micromanaging. Atmosphere is that of a high school with constant drama, being treated as teenagers even though we were all adults, and lots of untruths. Employees are not appreciated and expected to work as puppets.Lots of favoritism. No professionalism what so ever. Sales have declined due to employee lack of enthusiasm and customers feeling tension when they walk in the door. Always dreaded going work. Not at all a fun place to work!"
bad,"Nordstrom is a horrible place to work at. First of all, my sister was denied maternity leave and she's been working there over a year. Secondly, my manager was very unsupportive, and didn't give me any tools to succeed. They claim to be a family but everyone only cares about themselves. Customers are always returning everything making it hard foe you to make commission. No real way to get ahead with this company."
bad,"There is a glossy surface to the company that makes it seem like the ideal place to work, however that only disguises a terrible underbelly that's built in the backs of some of the hardest working people in customer service that are punished regularly for being good at their jobs thanks to the companies outlandish return policy."
bad,"poor management, unfair pay, unfair hours i learned a lot about cash wrap, unfair judgement, only cares about making the day not customer service, no financial security"
bad,One of the worst paid retail department stores.  Commission was extremely low and they had this “arrangement” that your commission was very low in the first year and then it would go up when you started selling more.  My checks were a joke and everyone was trying to leave.  Nobody cared.  I sold more than the rest yet my paychecks were horrible.
bad,"Nordstrom Direct: Hours are very irregular. Can work 30 hours 1 week, 60 hours the next. Management has no idea what they're doing. They will promise seasonal employees ft work and then lay them off when the season is done. They will tell you that you can make an unlimited amount of money if you work hard enough, but they will throw everything in your way to ensure you don't get that production bonus. I feel I was overpaid for the job I was doing but I was so unhappy (as most of the staff is) that it wasn't worth it."
bad,"their managment ou sucksthey hire how ever apply no trainning through them o the floor "
bad,I thought this job was going to be amazing because in training they brainwash you to make you think that. once i was here a month and a half i saw its not. the managment is very unfair. its very political. and no one cares if they steal a sale or not. just a horrible enviorment all around.
bad,"I was very excited when i started with this company i felt supported and was encouraged to cross train. then i moved stores and the upper management no longer followed company and district guidelines making it impossible to preform daily tasks. the new store had no hr to report management behavior to and that was widely abused and taken advantage of. I learned so much about tailoring and mens' clothes and i loved my first store it was a hard working, productive and creative environment. the lack of standards in the second store and micro management made working there unbearable. the best jobs are where everyone is motivated to do their best for the betterment of the company. sloth can be very demoralizing in a work place when a worker is used to putting all their effort in."
bad,They are really not considerate & the pay is ok but hours are not set like other jobs. I wish they cared more cnbsdjfdj;ncdkvmbdsnvh'dsvbdnsvdmsnvdsvndsmvn svjdsvndsvdsvmndsvdsmvndsvdsvdsvDv
bad,"Most enjoyable was 95% of my coworkers, customers, ease of being your own boss to an extent, empowerment. Worst: corrupt management/ conflict with management, resulting in termination/very toxic work environment"
bad,Politics required to advance. Hours and culture are terrible. Shark environment with very little positive to report.
bad,Out of most products advertised.  No one wanted to train new employees. Dirty & disorganized.  Rude & unfriendly co-workers.  Hardest part was telling people who found their way in that we didn't have what we were advertising.  Paycheck was the best I've made.
bad,I would never recommend working here. Management is horrible busy gossiping instead of actually helping representatives. It's always busy doesn't seem to be enough help. People are always looking for other job opportunities for a reason. It's hard to get any time off even if your sick.
bad,"Many hours available frequently; "
bad,it was all about who you work with that made the job rewarding
bad,"This job sucks.  A typical day you attempt to sell items to customers- along with 12 of your other co workers who are all competiting for the same customer.  They schedule way to many people in my department, constantly cut hours and hire new people.  The remodel at this store was awful and drove away a ton of customers who now shop online.  Goals are completely unrealistic and not adjusted accordingly.  No one is really hired as full time.  You have to make sure you are scheduled enough hours to earn benefits since they don't guarantee benefits."
bad,"When I first think of Nordstrom, I think of a world class customer service oriented company and a team of folks interested in finding solutions to problems to get the organization to a better state. Instead, the IT world of Nordstrom is absolutely dysfunctional, at least when it comes to the analyst/product management/delivery team world."
bad,Not a fun place to work for a lot of returns and it comes out of your pay. Management favoritism to the max.
bad,"A typical day a work, is answering phones basically making customer happy by any means necessary."
bad,"the management is TERRIBLE. they don't really care about employees. no longer a fun place to be. a lot harder to move up than told, prepare to kiss lots of you know what to get anywhere..."
bad,"Inconsistent hours, feeling left out constantly, stressful extremely high expectations, a lot of information left out of new hire courses. Managers can sometimes be kind but talk about you behind your back as if we are still in high school."
bad,Terrible place to work. Underpaid. Bad management. Too much management and not enough support across the board. Corporate nightmare. Too many hours. No incentives. No soul. Constant knit picking.
bad,The responsibilities of a Loss Prevention Officer at Nordstrom Rack was not stressful but the lack of direction from the Loss Prevention Manager was very stressful.
bad,"Really awful retail experience...."
bad,"The Elizabethtown warehouse is the worst place to work. I was fired ""by mistake"" never could they truly fix it! They hired me back but took forever to give me all my benefits back.  A manger that wasnt even my manger tried to act all high and might and try to get people fired when she doesnt even care about the job herself.  Look else where do not work for a company that is willing to drag you down and make it impossible for possible advancements..  you are truly better off else where even if it pays less the pay isnt worth it since they enjoy flexing people off alot due to ""lack of work""."
bad,Horrible management..lack of work ethics within the whole store... Alot of favoritism.I enjoyed coming to work just for the customers....too much drama at one place.
bad,"You know how some people just don't know how to talk to others? That's how the management is here. Really mean and rude early in the morning. Promised career advancement based off of the amount of work you put in/turn in each day but that was just to get you to overwork yourself..it actually takes much more than the amount of time they say (3 months). You're very replaceable...so if someone who's been there longer doesn't like you, they can and will make up anything to get you out of there. No investigations, no questions asked. Plus the pay is h o r r i b l e for the amount of work you put in AND there are no steady hours."
bad,"I can't complain too much about the time I've spent working here. The only silver lining of my time here was that they were really understanding about when life happened. The were very forgiving if you had some kind of emergency and were late or needed to call out. However, it sometimes felt like managers were scared of managing their employees. I worked with people who were extremely disrespectful to their coworkers and sometimes customers, and  it seems like nothing was ever done about it. I worked with someone who sent a customer to the Service Bar crying because of the way he spoke to her, yet he somehow kept his job. This same employee was borderline verbally abusive to me and other coworkers, and no one seemed to care enough to do anything about it. The turnover in my department and location was RIDICULOUS; in less than a year of working there over half my team was different."
bad,there is alot of special treatment to certain employees and if you get hurt or injury there its only matter of time before negative things happen and your being watched to quickly ridicule your work. money is there number one not employees.
bad,A typical day of work is working non-stop on your feet while being told that almost everything you are doing is wrong. You are constantly getting reprimanded for things you didn't do. You have 10 minute breaks twice a shift which they watch closely for being late on. They make you work lots of over-time which is almost never needed. Lack of work when over-time is required. When put on over-time it tend to be 6 days a week 10 hour shifts. The management of the build is over all bad. People who are promoted to be managers are build who are kiss-ups. Over all I would not recommend this job to anyone who has a family. They do pay good and offer good benefits but takes you away from you family. If you do apply I recommend first shift.
bad,Overall the management at Nordstrom does not care about the employees and what is going on in their outside lives and will absolutely get rid of you for no real reason and without notice.
bad,"you will be judged on your performance the problem with this is that the manger give the best work to their favorite people so there isnt a true fair way to evaluate that.  You push work out, lifting up to 4o pounds each time you ship a box in my dept,  The job is very physical and when your body no longer keeps up they kick you to the curb.  and my manager has mentioned about an aging work force and to rethink working here if you are older."
bad,Didn’t feel like you were appreciated for the work you did. Never positive never enough. Long hours and there were a lot of cliques like high school..
bad,"The Arborland store is poorly run. There is no consistency is regulations and standards. All the managers are rude and unprofessional. Hours are changed on a whim of a  manager.  The head merchandising manager engages in bullying behavior targeting specific employees and threatens them with dismissal for not working faster, or not putting things the way she likes them that day. There is favoritism shown in how many hours you get and what shifts you get. The managers aren't very good at making sure things get done and hinder the execution of most tasks on a daily basis. The culture of the store is to deny problems instead of fixing them and to keep everything  mediocre.  Employees are not trained fully and mangers are slow to help when called for. Managers will cut your shift short if to fit their plans."
bad,"It was a good learning experience. The turnover rate was extremely high in my opinion, because of management. It is a good job to get experience from."
bad,"If you are looking for gestapo tactics, manipulation, vindictive leaders and back-stabbing management, then, this is the place for you. Mismanagement during busiest seasons."
bad,"upon employment i was told there was room for advancment, although i was only here because retail hours were the only thing that worked with my full time school schedule. As time went on, i waited my 6 months to be moved to another department because there was no movement in my current one to make money. I was told i wasnt allowed to move. I work off commission at nordstrom and they have no been helpful one bit."
bad,This job can be very stressful if you are the only employee trying to keep the store together so you can leave when the store closes. They make sure that employees don't get full time hours and want you to harress customers to get a credit card
bad,"The hardest part of the job is if they don't have enough work for the next day, then you might be off work for some days that is not guaranteed you 40 hrs."
bad,"As a counter manager, Nordstrom was a great place to work at first. However, I never received adequate training for my position. As counter manager, it’s important to know your business like the back of your hand however the managers never gave me that option. The women are very catty and mostly gossip. If you’re into gossip, it’s the place for you. If not, don’t bother because you will not fit in."
bad,"Management changes greatly affected the quality of life here. They refused to promote from within the store, and were incredibly lackadaisical as far as consequences went. There seemed to be a fear of firing people who simply weren’t putting in the work. I ultimately quit because I was doing the work of the entire women’s team and was receiving no recognition or insentive for doing so."
bad,"The management is poor, and protocol is rarely followed which allows for very rude and entitled customers. "
bad,"Typical Day: "
bad,"They are not professional and not fare, customer gives you hard time. You have to make sales even if you are they for 3 hours they expect you to make a profit."
bad,"i clean from the time I come in till the store opens at 10am the I find things to do whether its help the sales staff or back stock."
bad,"Will sell out even their best employees to save their a**, image, or a dollar. After 5.5 years of blood sweat and tears I was thrown under the bus to cover up a liability & publicity nightmare that I was the victim of and didn't give a second thought to my life being endangered for doing my job and protecting the company."
bad,"Cannot make enough money on 10$/hour OR commissioned hourly rate. (Pay was not explained as it is NOT 10$/hour plus commission)"
bad,"A typical work day at Nordstrom is coming in, immediately communicating with management to see if there is anything new going on in the department like shipment, promotions, remerch of sales floor and then receive a ""opener"" (a quick task to do before your shift) After that is completed you call any of your customers and update them on there orders, alterations, or anything that you may need to do for your customers period. After that you begin to hit the floor and assist any customers on the floor. That's a quick summary on the day. I love working at Nordstrom for the awesome customer service we provide I greatly enjoy helping others and making there day go smoothly. Although management is very poor now a days and the store manager is not nice or respectful I learned tons working here. Got much better at selling and product knowledge. As well as computer knowledge. I don't believe in a hardest part of a job, I believe there are some challenging things but I enjoy overcoming so would not consider it hard. Just a learning opportunity."
bad,"I was interviewed by three managers and hired on the spot. Two weeks later, on my first day, I was assigned a chair in a sardine-like cubicle. The project manager had no idea I was arriving on the project, and had no input on interviewing me. This led to a cat-like fight among management as they pointed fingers at each other starting on day-1 of my employment. "
bad,don't waste your time management at nordstrom don't play fair there no growth it's almost like a high school everybody gossip mainly management  there no confidentiality. managers or allowed to hire the friends so there no room for growth
bad,Management within Nordstrom is all about sucking up not about experience. Managers disappear while the sales associates work while being understaffed.
bad,Nordstrom is a high pace job environment with a lot of stress involved.  But has excellent health benefits. You also received paid holidays and smiles
bad,"They treat employees bad. I worked so hard to make it to the top to only be terminated for falling in love with my counterpart. I was loyal, efficient and dedicated and it got me nowhere."
bad,"Management has favorites and the job culture is slightly outdated. Nordstrom pays 100% commission. The rack employees get better treatment than commission sales associate. Overall, Nordstrom is one of the better department stores to work at."
bad,"Pockets of management are still adhering to the inverted pyramid but most are not.  If you like working at Amazon and/or Microsoft, this may be an ok place for you to work.  For most, however, I'd suggest you keep looking."
bad,What kind of a company only relies on you being available all weekend. I put that I could not work Saturday nights after being there a while. They legitimately told me that I cant work there unless I have my ENTIRE weekend available from morning to night. Also wouldnt hire my friend when she literally had EVERY SHIFT OPEN except Saturday night. Not the greatest company. Not fair to run a business like this. Wont even shop here anymore. BYE
bad,This job was ok. The money was pretty decent but ther managers were not personable or friendly. They also expect a lot for little to nothing. The money was too up and down for me.
bad,"poor management corrupt company, all about  management, didn't really care about employees or schedules, time off not guaranteed, awful raises, can be demoted"
bad,"I was happy with working for Nordstrom until realizing that they were trying to find every reason possible to terminate my employment, even though i never had any issues with anyone in the workplace. They utilized a reason that had nothing to do with my performance to terminate my employment. As a result, I am pursing further action against Nordstrom"
bad,pay is good but the management is absolutely horrible. worth the money for a temporary position but in order to succeed you have to kiss a lot of a** and rat out your peers. nothing is done about anything if youre a teachers pet very poor management
bad,"I have worked for the company multiple times. Last time was for almost three years. It is a great company, but I personally hated working there in the end. There is plenty of room for growth if you are a favorite and look the part. I tried multiple times and came very close to advancement, but then my manager would quit and not tell the new manager so I had to start over. Nordstrom recently did a bunch of lay offs which Included all of my department managers which left me (Administrator) basically in charge of a $14million department with no raise and no support. I inquired Multiple times wit no help. Many people encouraged me to leave (as they were as well) so I did. Could not be happier. If you have the money and can afford to look expensive and ‘act’ expensive, this place is for you. Watch your back. Commission sales there are TOUGH and they could care less if you sink because many people would kill to work at the company. This is all my personal experience, it’s different for everyone, but I was very much taken advantage of and walked all over so it was time to quit. Never looking back and will not recommend to a friend. I know plenty of people that love it there, I know more that hate it."
bad,"In all of my work experience, my time at Nordstrom was plagued by poor managers who expected you to perform at a high level, but never gave you the tool or knowledge of how to accomplish that goal. Most of the managers are focused only on getting their next promotion, so they would sooner clean house and fire an entire department which is underperforming than focus on improving the skills of their employees. Granted, certain employees will never learn and will need to go. However, I saw repeated terminations from multiple departments which were questionable, and hidden under the guys of ""under-performance."" It says a lot about a manager when they will simply cut off their problems rather than fix them."
bad,I got to meet new amazing customers daily.  I got stock in that I organized and put away.  I checked my daily sales to know what to d for the day.  I provided amazing customer service and product knowledge/
bad,I loved working for this company but saw that internal career advancement was the rarity. College interns and external hires were the preferred candidates for managerial promotions.
bad,"Fast paced environment with little to no work life balance. Culture of the company is beneficial to employees, but very demanding job with very little work life balance."
bad,Store manager sucked. She would talk too much in the radio and distract the rest of us working. She was racist towards anyone who wasn't white. They cut hours down way too much. Customer service people were lazy and called up sales floor people to check out even if it was just one person in line.
bad,"Great food. 5 star dining service. Excellent front of house service. Beautiful location. Talented bartenders. Commuter friendly, valet parking and uber pick up. "
bad,Nordstrom was an amazing learning experience. My co-workers were amazing.  My experience was great but it was very hectic because I came onto the team as my counter manager left so my training was a bit difficult but that just made my learning experience all that much better
bad,Cattiness in the makeup department.   Very immature.  Managers weren't intelligent. Say one thing and do another.  Very dissapointing company.
bad,i have worked at 3 other nordstrom locations and I have never experienced such a poorly managed store.So called managers ranging from ages 21 to 30 have very poor managerial skills they can not even run their own lives yet alone try to manage others.In my opinion the Nordstrom family should look very closely into this matter on who they upgrade to a managerial position.This also includes the store mgr who has a tremendous insecurity complex!
bad,"I will never work for another retail company just because I can't deal with all of the SNOBS and rude people that work for Nordstrom. I worked harder than anyone there and did everything I could to help, but I never saw any recognition. If you need your schedule moved around for some reason they wouldn't help, but if MANAGEMENT needed you a day that you were scheduled off or needed a ""personal"" day to themselves,  of course they could change their schedules. You do not get treated fairly, and the only way you will is if you advance into a management role. I do not recommend working here if you want to keep your sanity."
bad,"You work with really nice people, but never less you are program to battle against each other to make a living. The floors are overstaff. They promote people based on numbers but that are unqualified to be managers. Yes you get promoted quickly but get demoted as well. I saw managers in my store get fired left and right by any little thing, step down because the pressure was too much, and demoted. Customers that abuse the return policy. The product that was on my floor was overpriced and some of horrible quality. Nordstrom is going to become the next Macy's."
bad,I have worked for many different retailers and I had experienced Nordstrom stores in other cities. I was part of the opening team for the Cincinnati store. To say the store is dysfunctional is an understatement.
bad,"I worked for almost a year at a new Nordstrom that opened in my area, and perhaps the issues at my store were related to the fact that the store was new. I am older and was a down-sized mid-level corporate manager. Retail is not the setting or culture for anyone over the age of 30 or so (eg, going to morning ""rallies""). I should also add that we are set up as a ""neighborhood"" store, meaning that any sales associate can sell in any department in the store and there are few distinct departments. As a result sales associates are even more competitive, petty, and back stabbing than in a traditional Nordstrom. This set-up brings out the worse in sales people, as well as the commission system in general. I don't understand comments that working at Nordstrom is fun. What is ""fun"" about the pressure of soliciting new retail accounts and calling customers to set up appointments and sell more merchandise? Management, including HR, was unprofessional, did not communicate or return calls, and was immature. I think your experience working at Nordstrom depends on your age, work background, and store. I'm sure Nordstrom is a good company, but it was an awful work experience for me. If you are young, love fashion, and think making $10 or $12 /hr is good money, you will love the place. If you have ever held a real job with real responsibility and been in a professional capacity, you will hate it. I was a long-time Nordstrom customer and was looking forward to working there. Now since I left I don't want to ever shop there again."
bad,Good people great staff terrible managers no experience in managing people need to go to school and learn People skills as they all lacked these and much more
bad,"1. Fun job if you love retail"
bad,"I worked for over a year, loved my job but manager hated me, their return policy hurts the employees and makes it impossible to make a living.  I loved my coworkers and I learned a lot of technical skills but every day was terrible trying to make enough commission to pay even rent."
bad,Learned the process of how online orders take place and the work that gets put into it. Made sure to always have high fulfillment rates within our store and also help guide new hires.
bad,"The management is awful. I'm not sure if it's specifically Colorado, but it was horrible in two different stores. In order to have anything solved, you had to contact HR and have an investigative meeting. Any conflicts were left unresolved. The gossip was out of control. Management allowed gossip to affect the work performance of employees. Management was rude to customers if they were dissatisfied with service. Management fought with other management. Management called you at home after hours numerous times a day for work related things. Hours were incredibly long. Breaks were given hours after state laws. Passive aggressive environment. You were scheduled to close at 10pm and be required back to work at 7 am. Again, the back stabbing, talking behind backs and gossip was unbearable. They do not value their employees, and they certainly do not value customer service."
bad,"Specially if you work in the downtown fig at 7th location , If you want to be depressed , talked down on, this job is for you .Managers are grown but extremely childish and always talking about eachother & always contradicting eachother. These people are on some kind of power rush lol Nordstrom takes everything back so people would literally bring stained body suits & you bet ya, we had to take it back , glad i quit ."
bad,I did not like working here.. it’s a lot of favoritism and the managers don’t do anything . They work you like a dog and you can’t even not be doing something for 1 minute
bad,"If all you care about is climbing the ladder than this job is for you. If you care about where your clothing comes from and about more than just making commission, than dont work here"
bad,very competitive environment through promotions with favoritism shown for certain employees from managers. Issues concerning communication from employees to managers were present and caused unnecessary stress and feelings of unfairness. Felt unvalued for the time spent working at the location and felt that working there any more would be unhealthy for me.
bad,This place really sucks to work at. You can bust your butt all you want but you have to kiss butt to get anywhere in that place. I would never recommend anyone to work in that mess of a mess!!
bad,I overall was not a fan of my experience at nordstrom's here in indianapolis. For starters management was a hot mess. Security was terrible and my coworkers were to boujie to function. They did not h=care about the needs of workers and were very racists and highly unprofessional going about the issues.
bad,Extremely long work hours their so customer oriented that they forget about the people that makes the company who it is today. They really don’t care about the employees.
bad,"The reviews are smh. I've worked at Nordy twice in two different states and its all the same. Managers are terrible and they expect so much. If you pride yourself dont work here. You cant work overtime and if you are employed as anything less than a manager you get blamed for dumb stuff all the time even if it wasn't your fault. I wouldn't offer this job to a homeless person. It's that bad, believe me when I say you will be miserable. I had to go."
bad,Working at Nordstoms gave me a great deal of customer service training and goal setting. The management is very understanding. The Company over all has great policy and work ethics.
bad,In the short time I have worked there I have seen many of my coworkers strive for greatness and be unrewarded for it. As well as Managers lacking many basic skills.
bad,"Managers are bad in  shops at merrick  park miami fl, managers are hypocrites and if they dont like the best person for a promotion they will choose a less deserving candidate."
bad,Good company to work for. The staff and bosses are great. I have no compliant about the company. Everyone you work with is super nice and helpful to you.
bad,"I did not know what to expect from the new store opening of Toronto, It was a really great experience and very fun but at the end it just was not for me."
bad,I was apart of the loss prevention team. loved my core role but the management was not fair to everyone. hopefully its better now then when I was there.
bad,The management does not know what they are doing as to why it's always changing. They wanna act like they are your friend and care about you but don't give out hours but expect you to jump when they need you. And furthermore it's like high school the management is more messy than the staff.
bad,Nordstrom is a place that is good to work at for the bbenefits. I like the discounts but the time restraints can be heavy also the compensation could be a little more.
bad,i would recommend only to one's not looking for a career but instead a job. its proper pay for anyone with minimal requirements.
bad,"I have been with the company for over 10 years, from a sale person to the assistant department. I have learned and observed how human being is treating human. 😔It's culture and philosophy do not match what it said. Work schedule and life are not balance. There are so much of favoritism and too much of politic. If you know how to kiss ...., you will get promote or get away with what you do/did wrong.  When you speak up, there will be retaliation. All sales people step on each other to make their goals, otherwise you will be getting a written up. It's lot of threatening. Then management will find all the ways to get rid of you. Store managers, regional managers, HR, and department managers talked among each other, instead they all should do their own works. Very unfair, very disappointed. Of course, customers get the priority because they are bringing in revenue and benefits for the company. But it's sad that they are not who/what they are as they advertised."
bad,"i worked for so many departments for this company, shoe dept, loss prevention, mens dept, children dept, and cashiers."
bad,i worked at Nordstrom Fine Jewelry in Bellevue Square for 8 years. I learned so much about jewelry and selling. A great first retail job and a great company.
bad,Really nice company to work for.Enjoyed the over all professional atmosphere.Good place to work.The training team was superb.Looked forward to going to work each and every morning/ day.Felt as if I was a part of something big and special way of.Sharpening my selling skills while experiencing high quallity merchandising and clientele.
bad,The seven yrs. I worked for the company a Hugh turnover! Poor management.
bad,"I personally did not like Nordstrom. I started in August of 2014. I was very excited about getting the job. My first day I figured I would have someone there to help me through the day, instead no one wanted to help and they kind of just threw me on the floor to sell, do returns and check people out alone. I didn't know how to use the registers yet so I had a lot of angry customers. After grasping how to do everything a week later I still didn't like the work place, Employees and management were super rude. I Gave management 5 stars because in my department ( Kids wear) My managers were the only nice ones"
bad,Nothing changes at this warehouse. Management staff is very strict about cellphones. Hardest thing about this job was packing large orders and packing men suits
bad,"a very fast paced atmosphere, where in employees are value. is a great place to work it helps you learn new skills everyday at the job. All the co workers are team players and you know you can count on them to help you get things done.The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers, its a great satifaction to know that at the end of the day you feel good about yourself, to know that you went of your way to help the angry customer at the customer values your time and effort."
bad,I despised working at Nordstrom in cosmetics for the year i worked there. Nepotism ran Nordstrom from the top straight through the bottom. You get hours based on how much butt you kissed.
bad,Over priced merchandise that Nashville is not ready for. Nice to see it here but the store has too much of a botique feel. Managers want you to hound customers when new product comes in.
bad,"Long breaks, have to work weekends and nights, and sometimes early mornings. No availability to have a set schedule. Communication is lacking among management."
bad,I worked there a few years and I worked with some of the worst people horrible horrible people I had to go to therapy to stay sane. I start having anxiety and panic attacks when it was time to go to work I went to HR it help for about 2 months and these ladies would start on someone else and hr would still let these ladies get away with it so eventually I had a to breakdown an left.
bad,"Trunk club has some ambitious talent and goals. They have gone through many strategic iterations over the past several years. They currently have a very low cultural and employee engagement rating and have been through leadership changes every 2-4 months. "
bad,"My experience with Nordstrom was traumatizing. I can state that my self and other co-workers suffer racism coming from our store managers, the shoe department and the Men's department.  They have no respect for people with disabilities.Working for Nordstrom i would say it's similar to High school."
bad,Used to be a pleasure to work there. Over 20 years of dedicated and successful service and eventually targeted for termination. Lay-off was orchestrated as all veterans who contributed to so much success were systematically targeted and pushed out in favor of younger and inexperienced workers. Wrote to corporate and they did nothing but sweep it under the rug. So sad.
bad,"They give me 39.5 hours a week just so they wont pay me the benefits. Now I have to find another job.They do it on purpose."
bad,"I hated working for Nordstrom. I was a Pace setter and  worked very hard, but always felt like the company/my mangers did not care about me. I was never able to take time off when I needed it. The sale environment is catty and your co workers are always trying to steal from you. Departments are over staffed and that why co workers are stealing sales and clients because other wise they will not make any money. It is genuinely a terrible place to work. They pay you so little in commission and once you work your butt off for a whole year and have close to 750,000 in sales, they give you a .5 percent raise. WHAT A JOKE!!"
bad,"The most enjoyable part of working is my coworkers. But we all agree that the management doesn't know what they're doing - not enough people are ever scheduled for our busier days (weekends). They're also stubborn about requests off, even if your excuse is reasonable and enough notice was given. Starting pay is 11.25, which isn't the worst, but still by no means a living wage. Decent job if you're just looking to make some money while in school."
bad,The overall work environment needs improvement. Managers have favorites which makes it a little difficult. They don't get on lazy coworkers who like to just come for a paycheck. Management is overall lazy and only care about you when its convenient for them. Not to mention you can't go past $13 an hour which doesn't leave room for much growth with the company
bad,Don't work there.  You are just a number and they do not care about you.  So much turnover.  Terrible management.  Hated it.  They expect you to produce miracles when no one is even shopping.  People would much rather shop at The Rack.
bad,This is not the best job if your looking for something full time. They say you are full time and you only work 2-3 days out of the week sometimes not at all.
bad,"I worked her for a few months and honestly everyone is so competitive. You're not allowed to have two customers at a time, your coworkers will complain. Management said they would work with me when i got another job but were never willing to work with me. You either got hourly or commission not both. A lot of people try and steal your sales and management always wants you on top of your customers. A lot of fraud went on. No return policy they changed it to two years back minimum, so if you worked there for a year a customer can return it and it will affect your sales the day they return it."
bad,"If you're young and you need a job to get you through college or you want to break into the makeup industry then this works. If not... don't bother. The hours are long, the management plays favorites and the pay of just isn't worth it."
bad,"although I loves the clothes and products, I did not like working there they treated me horribly, NOT somewhere I will EVER recommend. Especially if you might have some health issues"
bad,The management sucks. They all take up for themselves and down talk the employees. They love to belittle the people underneath them. They treat everyone as if they're children and talk to you how ever they want.
bad,"Working for Nordstroms is a fun and learning experience. But as far as have a consistant  pay check to pay rent and bills and maybe to raise a child, then nordstroms is not for you."
bad,"My experience at Nordstrom was horrible. "
bad,"As far as the store mgr is concerned, Nordstrom is about the employees right? Wrong, store manager would not even give me 2mins of their time when i had an emergency to discuss. Worst Nordstrom ive ever worked at and Ive worked at 3 different locations."
bad,"this is a okay starter job , gives you a raise after a year of being a slave but pays more than minimum wage so that's a plus . you would get tired of customers . they all think your there slave ."
bad,"everyone is trying to dress better than everyone else on little pay. Straight commission job,customer but one day return the next your pay check is always a guessing game. Management dose not care. No chance to advance unless your under 30"
bad,"I started back in 2015 I would never work here again. The management is horrible from store manager and LP manager- no type of structure. If management does not like you they will find a way to get rid of you. This particular store I worked at has no sense of direction, it's certainly not a work as team kind of place. It may be in the beginning but after a while you will see the true colors of everyone. No team meetings to motivate employees or show appreciation. I am in a far better place where I get treated with respect and my bosses appreciate my work and me as a human being. Overall this was the worst job ever."
bad,Nordstoms except alot out of there people they set standard to high when you are suppose to do 40 pieces a hr. that is way to high
bad,Management only cares about themselves and their bonuses they want you to multi take and do 100 things at once I l I ve my co workers managers not so much
bad,did not enjoy working with nordstroms. I had a severe health issue one week and management was not understanding at all.
bad,"I left Ulta to work at Nordstrom for better pay. I did receive a much higher pay than ULTA, but at a price. The hours were here and there never really consistent and management had bad communication skills and they would ran off anyone that wasnt making enough money for them. I feel like they care more about quantity than quality in both employees and customers. Customers were not treated equally, those who had money got the most treatment and left other customers with no service."
bad,"This place was one of the worst jobs I have ever had. Yes, the pay is great, if you need the money. However, the overtime is not just for the holidays or for Nordstrom's Anniversary. It is a constant six day, ten hours for months at a time. The pay is great, if you enjoy not doing anything else with your life. "
bad,"Unreal, micromanaged  unpleasent , unrealist goals no room for advancement, worked like slaves. Too many hours for part-time work ,un flexible hours. ."
bad,Working at Nordstrom is like being in high school. I worked at a really slow Nordstrom so i was never able to make commissions and on top of getting paid minimum wage I had to pay for parking which was around $100.
bad,"The store Manager is not personable.  Only looks out for sales and numbers for the store. In the winter time we had really bad weather and she wanted us to stay open.....stating it was a piece of cake. When CLEARLY there were accidents outside. She does have her favorites and that's fine but I was there to do a JOB! And I did it dang good! Not the one to kiss any but. One thing I miss is my great customers and my 3 past managers Taught me a lot.  They have lost a lot of great dedicated employees. SAD! I lost 2 FAMILY members in my FAMILY on the same day not once did she say sorry for your loss or even a hug or card. Not even from my assistant Manager and manager. "
bad,"Day to day duties: meet customers, store upkeep, go backs, ringing up customers, pitch rewards, clean fixtures, merchandising  projects and following inventory processes. Unprofessional and underqualified management. Biased work culture and lack of growth opportunities. Higher ups don't live up to workplace values, don't follow through or recognize their own responsibilities, are complacent about poor performing team members, manages with fear, not fairness, lacks humility or self-awareness, don't lead by example, Unable to listen and respond to feedback, unavailable or avoids tough conversations, Doesn’t provide clear or realistic direction, Doesn’t show appreciation or give recognition to employees, and assistant department managers take credit for others’ work. Despite the poor leadership and overall workplace inconsistencies, I gained great customer service skills and loyal customer relationships from working there. Hardest part of the job was dealing with management when bring up an issue in the workplace. They get upset and turn it against you. Also, declining business due to online shopping and competition. Unable to get benefits due to unsteady hours per week. Most enjoyable part of the job was the PTO, pay bumps and paid holidays after you qualify with 1000 minimum hours"
bad,"This used to be the place to be until managers started getting demoted and people without experience got promoted. There’s no work life balance , management is not willing to work around scheduling even if you’re still meeting the needs of the business. The people are extremely messy"
bad,"Favouritism at it's eating yes best. You must be all smiles,  fake like a phoney, and lie about products so u can look good, make more commission sales, and get the manager position. The rack is better and Is half what was mentioned above. The greatest area about this job was talking to the guy on the phone who was with Nordstrom benefits when I cashed out my 401k from the company."
bad,"I’m not sure about retail work but Nordstrom has its ups and downs fairytales just not for me "
bad,"Advancement is hard and politics are involved. Cliques are common. The work is not innovative and the ability to work autonomously isn't there. Unless you're in sales, teams have small budgets."
bad,At first my experience with Nordstrom was great. After about a year things started rolling down hill. I experienced super high turnover where I was a ok and retail in general started to trend down.I attribute  that to online shopping. The burden of the  deficit falls on the sales associates and it's not a great  feeling.
bad,"Managers are never there to train/help employees and sales interaction becomes competitive. This causes employees to fight over who gets the sale- even had another employee yelling at me in front of customers because I was in her ""sale"" space grabbing more choices for my customer in the fitting room."
bad,Managers choose favorites. If you have to leave due to an emergency your pentalized for it. They push you till your bed basically to get stuff done. I worked 3rd shift and there was barely work left to do since 1st & 2nd have been there first so we would be sent home early. Over time is manadagory.
bad,"No, Not great at all. Period. Some people are good. Some people are bad. Don't trust anyone. They're all  out for themselves. Sharks steal sales. Untrustworthy co-workers."
bad,"To call and create new clients "
bad,"Working here you are pressured to meet sales goals that are highly unrealistic and not reflective of the customer volume on average. After working there for only a month, I was being given sales goals which required me to sell more than what the department made in each of the last three days as a whole. Peers are quick to steal sales as soon as you aren't looking even when they know you are helping a customer and are passive aggressive about sale stealing habbits. Don NOT recommend."
bad,"Nordstrom could be a great place to work if only they would change a few of their policies and ."
bad,"Stocking the floor, maintaining a clean sales floor, selling. The company does not value employees time. They constantly over staff and do not care if you are able to sell and make money they only want the store to make money."
bad,"Very stressful job, underpaid over worked the rainbow is painted at the beginning but you burn out fast when you realize all the task that are associated with one position."
bad,"When i first started, my manager and her assistant were very competent. However in couple of months they got promoted to work in other stores and a joke of a manager was hired, she had 2 years of experience with the company and didn't know how to do a single thing. Extremely low hourly pay and you are expected to make as much commission as someone who's been there for 10+ years. unfair hours and nothing you do is appreciated."
bad,Nordstrom is commission based pay and they don't set you up to succeed. The CEO's are typical money hungry thieves that don't care about the little man. The discounts aren't all that great and if you are less than attractive and/or not a kiss up you will not go anywhere in the company. They really make you put that fake smile on and the whole company has a plastic feel. Thats being said it is good money if you hustle but there is little to no job security.
bad,"The hours were very inconsistent, I was a full time employee and got about 35 hours per week. I did work commission but because there were so many workers and not enough customers and I took a hit on my paychecks. The customers make the job so much worse, I had a lady throw a scarf at my face while she told me to fold it for her. The worst part was that I wasn't able to do anything about it. Management is all favoritism, they don't like you, there is no advancement, you get lied to and talked about. The worst part are the returns, if a customer returns an item for ANY reason you take a hit on numbers resulting in a small paycheck."
bad,The management does not help you very much. If the work day is slow they put it on you to randomly call people that bought in the past to see if they would come in.
bad,"Managment was bad, hours were bad and other employees had bad additudes. Managers didn't really take the time to train you and left you not knowing what your job activities were."
bad,Nordstrom prides itself so much on satisfying its customers that it sometimes forget about the employees who work to keep it afloat. There's a lot going on behind the door of this company that I don't even think the Nordstrom brothers are aware of.
bad,Personally the job is pretty easy. But when it came down to balancing work and school management was not really understand when it came to school.
bad,"I worked for Nordstrom Eaton Centre in designer shoes and I have to say for a store that wants to be elevated and luxurious they hired the most unprofessional, immature and shady management team I have ever encountered. The absolute worst and because of that the staff are unhappy and feel terrible and they have some really great staff but they will all leave because of this management. "
bad,"The DC is really nice and has a lot of technology . Management is HORRIBLE, the Highjump Processes are HORRIBLE and poorly written coding. There are no process flows so you don't actually now how any of the processes are supposed to work. It's ok with I.T directors that most Highjump processes don't work and require a ton of database fixing . Orders are always duplicated , over shipped, or forgotten about and no one cares to address the issues. There is little to no QA on coding changes, they are fine with putting in coding that doesn't work or causes more issues than it's supposed to fix. Hours are HORRIBLE as the place runs 24/7 365 and you can always be on call to fix something even after working a long shift. Benefits stink, they are really expensive and there are huge deductibles you have to pay. Your pay periods are not on set days, they fluctuate between a 4 days span so you are never sure when your pay check goes in  this is due to commission at the stores and has nothing to do with the DC but they still  pay you that way. Time off for vacation is very limited and same with sick days. I see no improvement at this place , it just keeps getting worse."
bad,Very limited on advancement. Stuck in same position for 6 months and cant move to any other dept. Hardd to live off of 8.00 a hr if you dont make comission everyday
bad,I like working for the company around the holiday season. It is commission only with the exception of inventory so when it gets slow you will not make any money. Ideal for younger college aged kids.
bad,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for. You learn a lot about team work, customer service and merchandising but compensation  is unreasonable."
bad,work life balance nonexistent. treated like sub-par unless you can sell +$10K daily. work in mac cosmetics with highest volume and still treated without dignity
bad,"Nordstrom lends itself to competition between co-workers that creates a conflict amongst its co-workers with unrealistic sales goals."
bad,they promise good life balance but there is no balance the money is bad and the people will stab  you in the back the second you trust them
bad,"Work is fast paced and management isnt the best. There is a feeling of hierarchy within the department and room for growth hardly seems likely. also very strict, not a lot of downtime, prepare for a hard days work because slackers are not welcome."
bad,"Unless you are a sheep do not work for this company. They make many promises but follow through on very little. They do not reward hard work, only popularity."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to apply to this company. It seems like everyone has a motive.
bad,"Not a employee morale building company. It is a 'at will' job with poor management and terrible leadership. Job lacks inspiration and a focused employee building objective. Low investment in management training is evident. Store goal is  all profit driven; employee promotion is not based on day to day performance but meeting monthly Credit Card goals. Store manager is a sales only manager, lacking interpersonal savvy on day to day operations, fairness and employee building techniques ie engaging employees. Store manager- all hype no substance- not memorable or inspiring."
bad,"Stocking shoes and helping the customers if needed. If we did not have the size on the floor, we checked in the back to see if we had it."
bad,"Doesn’t matter who you are what your background is once you step through the doors you are nothing less then a money maker for them, you are disposable like garbage to them they will never value principles and work ethic over another employees word of their own"
bad,They pay ok if you have experience.The management is young immature and useless! It’s a cut throat environment . They cut hours throughout the year without letting you know .
bad,"In the logistics field I feel like I didn't learn much. If you want to advance you are better of doing sales, which is what the company values most. If you are lucky you will have management that values you."
bad,"The company promotes from within. In order to be promoted an associate has to make their way into a cool kids type of culture, and then they can start the promotion process if they carry some type of sales skills. Many associates in leadership roles in Nordstrom do not possess the leaderships qualities needed to run and improve business."
bad,"Counter managers have no freedom in scheduling rosters. Incompetent management. High turnover ratio.    "
bad,"I never got considered for the department I wanted. Nordstrom was all about the in-clique. Compensation was sad. Once you’re in a bad Dept, good luck making it out. Sell, sell, sell, but for what? The regional manager’s spare change."
bad,"Too much gossip. Too much politics. The more you kiss A-- the faster you move up."
bad,I started 4 years ago loved my job i loved it so much that i did such a great job they no longer needed us so they did away with my position moved to another position and worked for someone that blamed everyone else for there problems i never thought i would ever leave Nordstrom but at this point it was the best thing i could ever have done
bad,Management is very set in their ways and there is very little opportunities for advancement up the employment ladder. Same repetitive workplace and the work was boring.
bad,"Don't work here. If you don't like being harrassed by crackheads and snobby rich b**ches or your managers on a daily/weekly basis, I would recommend working somewhere that is more down to earth. Also the amount of waste that is created by retail companies in general is insane. Not worth it. Toxic environment with toxic management."
bad,"The company tolerates wrong people. They get away with a murder. It's a jungle out there, the manager is not really the sharpest knive in the box, disrespectful."
bad,"Your feet start hurting, your back starts hurting and you haven't had your first break yet. You're counting down the minutes until you can finally leave. After the first couple of hours, I wanted to shoot myself. "
bad,This job was mind-numbing and highly repetitive. Constant standing during your shift. Only a 20 minute break for an 8 hour shift which includes the time it takes to walk to and from the break room. Leaving you with about 7 minutes of time to sit and actually relax.
bad,"Working at the downtown Seattle Nordstrom was one of the most off putting jobs I’ve ever had. Seeing the employees spend all of their paychecks on the merchandise through their Nordstrom cards was cringeworthy.  The one positive thing I took away from this job was how to sell, they drilled it into me. No matter how unhappy I was they made sure I could sell anything."
bad,"The company is famous for its great customer service but that's all. The only good thing about working at Nordstrom is the paid 3 week training. I would recommend that you stay until you get paid for the training and then leave after the third week. The HR does not know anything, the management is inexperienced and definitely not transperant. Waste of time!"
bad,Department Managers are guided to start on the sales floor in the inverted pyramid scheme and given little incentive for growth. The company is lacking communication among leaders and the message given in inconsistent.
bad,"Great team members. Certain managers leave a lot to be desired! Schedule is always changing to the point you need to check it everyday!!Managers have no planning system and do not perform as a team. The most enjoyable prt of my job is the team and manager I am assigned to work with. No one on the team is afraid to work and will always assist you when you need help!! Overall, morale is pretty low in the Baton Rouge store!"
bad,"There's a lot of nonsense and pettiness that hat happens in any department store. However, due to on-going restructuring, a lot of my staff had drastic cuts in hours. It was disappointing to tell them that they would go from 40hrs to 10-15hrs per week. Management changes a lot!"
bad,"The thing that’s gonna destroy Nordstrom, besides their inability to keep up with current trends, is their willingness to stand by terrible managers just because they have seniority."
bad,"I just wanted to work my way up from Logistics to Personal shopping and despite ignoring the negative environment. It started to affect my health. It also did not help that the women in Personal Shopping were rude to me even the moments I was instructed by my department head to assist them with anything. (ie: sorting hangers, taking empty racks, bringing them their new shipments in the AM). Generally snarky behaviour and felt sad continuously trying to get close to these people. I know what the fashion industry is like but it definitely put a bad taste in my mouth. In my own department, I noticed that the individuals who gossiped and stuck on to management got promotions and eventually a lot of us got laid off."
bad,"Management takes all the credit for all the work that is done by the employees, example- won a white glove in the region,  the names put on the trophy was management not the employee team! "
bad,"They like to micro manage everything. They want to know where you are even when you are not at work. They make comments when you call in sick. It's a very toxic environment to work in. They expect you do a lot but the pay does not reflect on it. They are cutting their budget and it's cutting into people's salaries. They have an invert pyramid which they say employees are on the top, and they treat them well because they are their assets. Well, that's not true they treat employees like garbage something that can be replaced within a second. The higher ups come into the store point a finger and you are out. It's a company full of politics."
bad,"They were very unorganized and told people false information. When I was hired I was told that my position was permanent and not seasonal. A day before the season was going to end, I was told that I was seasonal. When there wasn't enough work they would sometimes have people go home, although they often kept a lot of employees at work having them stand around."
bad,"Fun place to work at, they provide really good training and it is embedded in all employees to provide excellent customer service which is good but sometimes customers abuse it."
bad,"WORST retail management EVER."
bad,they said that they would train me but they still haven't after 5 months. I don't one supervisor on me I have 5 each one wants me to do the job in a different way and all claim that that is how the company wants it done and my manager she doesn't know how to sew and she isn't a tailor and she doesn't know when her employees are messing up.
bad,"Job posting said it was a stylist and what it really was just me taking clothes back to the floor and clearing out dressing rooms. Hunting customer, seeking out commission and meet the monthly goal."
bad,Not a good environment . On the down fall. Only want sale associates the support team is no longer going to be there. I guess the discount and benefits are okay.
bad,"They do NOT care about their employees. Disgusting working conditions. The bathrooms smell and are always dirty. The management is a joke. And worst of all, they have the most messed up ideals of promoting from within."
bad,They work you to the bone with an amount of scrutiny that makes it near impossible to assist customers in a natural way. Does not care enough about employee mental health. Scheduled breaks that always changed and sometimes the breaks would be within the first half of the day and have nothing for the last 5 hours of the shift. Awful management. Felt like working at a sorority. It's very much a popularity contest.
bad,"Fun place to work for extra money, but they are not fair with their employees. They treat everyone differently. "
bad,The company is a wonderful company its the management thats the problem! The management is rude and doesnt care about you they only care about using you !
bad,it would good in the first 6 months of me working there then everything changed for the worse.  never worked for a company in my life and felt so uncomfortable working.
bad,Typical day is day is answering the same questions over and over from sales associates that do not want to learn anything. The company USED to promote more from within but now it seems like they just give anyone a job or a management role and that really breaks down the culture. I am not really into fashion so I don't use my discount.
bad,"unless you are completely self sufficient at teaching and learning this is a miserable experience. "
bad,"Working at Nordstrom is a good place to work if you don't mind not having much of a work-life balance, or for those who don't have much to do in their day to day lives, because be prepared to apply for a part-time job but have full-time job hours and little to no time off, and unfortunately if you're thinking that this company gives room to improve and grow and move up to higher positions, think again. If you try to move up in a position, no matter what your actual position is at the time, be prepared to be knocked down lower than your current position and then treated as less than dirt. Nordstrom: Great place to shop, not so great place to work."
bad,"Terrible management young and unprofessional, horrible culture amoung sales associates, cutthroat competiition and unfriendly co workers. do not follow company structure of valuing employees."
bad,Sales associates were often presented with unrealistic goals and little to no support from management. I was there for less than a year and had three different managers with three very different leadership styles.
bad,"don't miss the harassment, or being mistreated. Management did not have my back because i was a guy being harassed by a woman. Instead of letting her go they decided it was best for me to part ways."
bad,"Stressful, competitive work environment with no type of recognition or incentivizing when one did well that day. Management was poor and disconnected. There were slow days where we were penalized for not selling, despite no customers coming in. However, I did learn very much about fine jewelry and watches, gemstones, types of gold, how to resize watches, etc. I also learned wonderful customer service, in regards of how a customer should be treated. A typical day for me consisted of stocking new inventory, making sure it was presentable in the cases or that it was visually marketed to catch the customer's attention. I would have to answer phones, handle and check repairs, along with filing paperwork. I was also a sales associate. The hardest part of the job was dealing with returns, seeing as they worked against OUR commission. The most enjoyable part was learning about all the different jewelry brands, companies, and trends."
bad,"It's not a career. There is no advancement. Commission based pay is difficult, the store and brands are going downhill. Not many people are shopping brick and mortar anymore."
bad,"- There was a lot of negativity and lack of trust inbetween the employess and managment and vice verca. "
bad,"Company sales culture is poor, with little focus on development and training.  They would rather hire and replace people weekly then invest an ounce of development in training them."
bad,"Well, it started out great and then the dreaded return policy kicked in and the amount of money lost was not worth the overall effort. Plus, you get no weekends or holidays. The benefits are not so great, and on top of that the management is highly incapable of delegating tasks."
bad,"on the outside it looks like a great company, but it is not. Management does not care about the employees, everyone is just a number. I was a Department Manager for a couple of years, so I got to see first hand the shady stuff my peers as well as my higher ups did."
bad,Not a stable place to work very few hours inconsistent schedules changes without notice poor communication from managers lack of training
bad,The place was just full of old women on a power trip in a high school type setting. Dont work here if you want workplace advancement.
bad,I enjoyed working at Nordstrom for the most part. There were areas of opportunity for management but overall I was treated fairly.
bad,Pay was entirely too low and no raises. I left due to low money and lack of enthusiasm. I don't recommend this employer for anyone but an entry-level worker.
bad,This job was super messy and unkept to me people wasn't very clean there and the managers were very mean except for one she was super nice and I loved her so much.
bad,"Overworked and underpaid. You sale and you do not make 10% of your sales and you are held accountable for returns, which subtract from your sales."
bad,"Management are snobs and don't offer advice on advancement for their own job security. Pay is terrible and at one point they were cheating employees out of money. Return policy is absolutely ridiculous considering its commission based and Nordstrom takes back everything because it's ""Great customer service"". Job culture is extremely catty and stressful. Co workers are not your friends and will steal your sales!"
bad,"Great place to work during Holiday season! Men's sportswear department could use better management! the main cash wrap is a complete joke, working around a HEAP of clothes."
bad,Management had no clue how to run the restaurant. Was promised full time hours and was only give 25 hours per week.
bad,"Assist customer, protect company asset, complete audit through out the store to deter internal theft, assist is customer and employee incidents, maintain safety of customers and employees while in our store, arrest and process shop lifters, write report of any arrest made."
bad,"The goals for my position were very high. It was not attainable within my first year of employment. If I had stayed in the position for over a year I might of been able to make it, but the makeup counter I managed had very select groups of customers, which did not have loyalty to one sales associate. The other associates are always trying to steal your sales even when you are working with a customer. Be prepared to fight back, or loose your job. I was constantly threatened with loosing my job. Two weeks into my employment is when the threats started. The threatening of my job just saddened me, and made me feel like I was fighting a loosing battle. Eventually I had been threatened so much that it desensitized me when they did fire me. They give people about six months to meet goals. I had been given almost ten months, they kept telling me that when they fired me. Since the goals are so high with this counter, they will likely be replacing the counter manger every six months. Also in the ten months of employment I had one single saturday off."
bad,Not a good place to work if you are looking for job stability no benefits
bad,"If you don't want to live eat and breath your work with no time for a home life this is not the place for you. With not enough pay for your all your hours worked and all the responsibility they continue to pile on to you it makes it impossible to have any kind of life outside of this company. I have worked here for years and it used to be a great company to work for, but it has gone extremely down hill and while I still loved working with my fellow managers and my team the management above me is horrible and talks down to her employees and makes us feel as though we are easily replaced and not valued at all. They are cutting back their benefits and with the amount of time you are expected to work you do not get compensated for it at all."
bad,"They choose people with experience and college degrees to work jobs that ""don't require experience"" (as said by the ignorant HR employee in NHO.) No matter how hard you work, if there's no traffic, there's no money! If you have a family, this is not the job for you! You will be working all hours... closing then opening the next day. And all the departments are commission, except Customer Service, Fine Jewelry. So no steady income. If you borrow from the company twice, you're fired."
bad,I worked at Nordstrom for 5 years and all i can say is it was great in the beginning and at the end they forgot we were people that had families!!!
bad,"Mangers wouldn’t fair , rude nor understanding nor professional always had important and private conversations on the floor or around others . favoritisms is shown , schedules weren’t always set to your availability."
bad,"not every nordstroms is the same, the west coast chains run better and more organized than the ones i’ve worked at in the south. do your research on the store before you apply"
bad,Perfect job for a student. Lot's of young adults which makes it an enjoyable place to work. If you're looking for pay and career advancement- look elsewhere.
bad,"Pay is $17.75/hour starting. The benefits was no paid holidays until after 500 hours work. Pto doesnt accure until after 1000 hours worked for full time employees; thats 6 months before you begin to earn pto. 3 days of sick time after 90 days.  Only recently started offering set schedules. Management play favorites and you only move up if your buddy with management. Theres not much room for growth. There are people working for the company 10, 15, 30 plus yeats with minimal growth. Most advancements will be out of seattle or denver due to the fact of people holding their postions limiting growth opportunities. Nordstrom credit department allows you to learn a lot of behind the scenes info. However Nordstroms credit department is about 15 years behind in their technology, but isnot willing to invest the money to bring the computer systems with up to date systems. Overall there are better companys out there that offer far more better benefits and work environment."
bad,Very competitive and no work life balance. Long hours and they do not value employees. There is a lot of micro managing. This is based on which department you work in.
bad,Low budget money in paying for unexperienced managers ignorant of business law in the united states.  Poor quality product in 30% of fashion.  Over pricing o goods and services offered.  No set prices on alteration charges.  Alteration prices vary due to shop managers individuals opinion.
bad,"Nordstrom has gone through difficult changes in their senior leadership that has negatively affected the culture. They are in the process of hiring the “right” leadership, but the leaders that they are hiring are not upholding the vision that they once had. There is no work life balance. As they take on more projects leaders make poor choices in deadlines without having the resources to support the initiatives."
bad,"They tell you to have a work/life balance, but don't actually mean it of course. They expect you to answer your cell phone even if you're asleep. The worst employees are constantly rewarded."
bad,"When I started years ago it was a great company to work for. But now Dept Managers are lazy and want the counter managers to do their jobs.  The trend now is to get rid of experienced seasoned employees by making them miserable and replacing them with inexperienced much younger staff to save money. Upper management  has no interest in retaining long term staff, PTO accrues very slowly."
bad,You do not have job security. It is a fun environment but very competitive and you are always on the go. You do not get a chance to relax and it is hard to balance life with this job.
bad,"There is NO life work balance. You do NOT Have any life . You work over than 8 hrs on the weekends and mangers are not professional at all."
bad,The corporate culture is stuck in the 1990's and is very slow to change to the demands of the current workforce.  Leaders a stuck in a time where technology wasn't available to make the work more efficient.
bad,"If you are in college or right out of college this would be the ideal job for you. The foot traffic is not in store so you are like a shark trying to get sales. Constant reminder of calling and texting and bothering your customers and opening credit cards. This store is not what it used to be 5 years ago. This would be great for someone for part time or someone that just needed extra cash, not so much as a career choice"
bad,"There were a lot of snooty women there and the pay was not very good especially since foot traffic was very low. "
bad,The culture in Nordstrom's is a younger generation. Tinge of no tolerance vibe towards coworkers uniqueness. No room for outside of stereotypical kind of person.
bad,"The company was good. The particular store was the worst. Also very poorly managed, the worst store I've ever worked in. The store manager had zero concept on what it takes. To run a facility of that magnitude."
bad,"Managers always make it seem like you are gonna get fired even when you are doing your job correctly. And if you aren't selling those stupid credit cards ( and heads up, not everyone wants one) you get in trouble"
bad,"I loved the beauty company I represented. Nordstrom offers great benefits. Knowing that on line sales are 20% higher and growing, the goals in store are set way too high and very hard to achieve. Customers complaining daily we had no stock."
bad,"working retail is a joke  , rude customers , entitled customers, no life, cant get off at the time your scheduled to. goals are impossible to reach not a very good discount for the amount of work you do for the company. Its all about clout not hard work."
bad,"Working here almost broke me.  I began to feel that nothing mattered except for the sale.  Employee's hours were always cut which made for a ""shark tank"" sales environment."
bad,"Salesmen at nordstrom are commission only, no base pay. So anything you are doing besides selling you are doing for free, and they expect a lot of it. It's illegal. Not to mention they are trying to direct as much of the business to online as possible so they can eliminate the salesman."
bad,"Upon being hired, it was to my understanding that it would be your hourly rate, PLUS commission. Nope. It’s one or the other. If what you make commission exceeds your hourly rate, then you get the commission. That was not made clear at all. Extreme lack of management skills are present within management. The managers should not be managers. They don’t know how to manage. The pay is decent but not if you’re trying to support a family or even pay rent. Only offers full time positions and will work you. Breaks are stagnant and get told off if you want to take your break. HR is so incompetent. They needed my social THREE times over the course of six months. Was told six months after working there that they need my social again as it was not in the system and I would not a W-2 generated  for the time worked there. So what did they do with my social for the fourth time?? I get once for the I-9, to prove you’re a citizen, etc. but several times. So incompetent."
bad,Working for Nordstrom Distribution center was a alright job. The job it self was alright. Did not mind the work. In order to get hired permanently you had to be near perfect. The job did not offer consistent hours. One week you work a lot and the next week you would barely work. Not a proper work balance life. That's all you do is work. Not paid enough for the work done. Pay was not that great.
bad,Nordstrom is legendary for it's service and lives by that. They are also very active and supportive of the community. They don't take stands politically or apologize for their business.
bad,"I worked there as a seasonal consultant in Luxury handbags. I was told that I wss one of the best consultants in the department and I was conintually assigned to this area. I enjoyed working with the clients as for the most part they were nice and appreciated the help. But that was it.You would actually get looked down on when you helped people too much. Imagine that!!!"
bad,"Your net earning are unpredictable, depending on how much the store will return of your previous sales, up to one year!"
bad,"You would start the day with a new employee, teach them all day long until lunch time, to only have that brand new employee leave on lunch and never come back, that happened over 5x. Going through 3-4 Different Store managers in a year, not even including Department managers."
bad,"Working in cosmetics is much different than working in any other department. The managers aren’t supportive and don’t care about you, you are just a number to them. They hold grudges and hold salespeople to impossible standards. If they think you’re not cut out for the environment, they will drive you to quit. There are too many events to keep up with and no customer has the time nor the money to attend every event. Many of the counter managers treat their beauty consultants unprofessionally. There are very few options for job advancement unless you want to grow with Nordstrom. If you really love a brand I would recommend freelancing because it is a much easier job and you still get to work for the brand you love."
bad,A lot of leaders with bad habits keeping each other safe. Nordstrom seems to be stuck back in the 90's with some processes and people who have made it this far.
bad,The management within this company is absolutely atrocious.  They will stab you in your back given the first opportunity and promote strictly based on duration of employment over education and knowledge.
bad,"I love the Nordstrom company as a customer. However, working as a stylist (I will say this may have been exclusive to my department) was a terrible experience. Customers in special occasion departments demand the highest amount of attention and praise, whilst simultaneously having to cater to every single customer on the floor, maintain the counter and keep the floor looking nice. I had no social life while working for the company, the hours are terrible and management I did not feel cared to help anyone out. I did feel that this department should be specialized, when dealing with high priced inventory and demanding clients. We were  understaffed and overworked. Money was not worth the job/work we did, online sales and returns were out of control and in store sales associates suffer because of this."
bad,"I enjoyed learning more about business and learning from bad examples. There were many things that made this job stressful, but I was able to cultivate my passion for the client and growing my customer service skills. The management at my store location was disappointing, kept moral low and didn't share many if any successes to employees. This wasn't just an isolated incident within my department either, but I don't believe it was a company wide issue. A VERY catty place to work and not a very good sense of ""team,"" which I understand this is a business but we aren't robots we are humans, trying to work under such stressful conditions can make you feel isolated and unmotivated. I gained a lot of experience in general, about what a business that chooses favorites arbitrarily, and doesn't give equal attention to its employees looks like and how to avoid that behavior because it isn't an efficient way to run a business."
bad,"A selfish environment. Pretends to care , but only interested about the numbers. Managers are not properly trained. Requested Job letter is a joke from HR."
bad,"First, management has to work on communication amongst staff.  Communication as far as management sucks (a whole lot of brushing you off when you ask questions).  I was so excited about working there, but I can't get pass the unfriendly atmosphere.  Majority of the people are truly friendly but the others aren't so friendly.  Before, being an employee I was a customer but now after seeing the way they treat certain customers.  These JOKERS can't have any of my money.  If customers doesn't look the part they don't speak or acknowledge them."
bad,Very competitive culture. They don't train you very well. I had to learn as I worked. Customer's weren't terrible. Also very peppy environment. Always trying to promote something new. Return policy is dumb and can and will hurt you if you are working off commission.
bad,nordstrom a place with many stuck up people where you think you're doing the right thing but you're actually doing something wrong. you get picked on by management and no one will defend you it's worthless.
bad,"Customers returned worn used merchandise "
bad,"Nordstrom is very inconsistent when it comes to the treatment of its employees.  It seems the harder you work, the worse life at Nordstrom is.  I was promoted after being written up and receiving a poor annual performance review and then decided not to do very much work.  I was bullied out of a position, which caused me to leave the company.  I went back to Nordstrom and was forced out because there was inconsistency win how employees are treated and I was disciplined for something that managers and even the company heads do constantly."
bad,Minimal loyalty with management decisions made in a vacuum.  Caught up in the outsourcing craze with too many decisions made by politically minded leadership wannabees.
bad,"Nordstrom Technology started out as a great place to work, but poor management has killed off the once-loved work culture.  Not many people are happy."
bad,"Company isn't what it used to be. Hard not to sound like one of those bitter employees with a chip on their shoulder but after awhile this place really gets to you. Poor management. Poor organization. Overall just a somber place to be. Dealing with it because the hours in my current role work with my school schedule but other than that, couldn't see myself wanting to progress any further in the company."
bad,"Ring customers out fast and friendly. Sign up customers for rewarding memberships/Credit Cards. Clean the store, making it look clean and clutter free and easy to shop. Restock the floor also the back stock with new merchandise. Organize products in a logical easy to understand manner. Help customers find what they need and ask questions. Call other stores to find products. Call credit lines to see what going on with a referral or see what nordstrom benefits card holder may have."
bad,Management does not know what the jobs are like as they never have worked them and have unreasonable expectation.
bad,"Nordstrom is dishonest, the company only worries about their own skin.  Not even the skin of their management.  They will but full timers with 35 hrs down to 15-20 hrs and give you a hard time about unemployment.  If you go out on disability good luck having your job when you come back."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend this place at all. Nordstrom or Nordstrom Rack has an ""every man for himself"" culture that opens the door for backstabbing and little to no advancement."
bad,Over promised under deliver. Do not quit your current job to work here. Lots of returns due to their policy thus making it hard to make commissions...
bad,the job itself is not bed but the high culture was too much. it was a bunch of 60 year old ladys reliving high school. its not youth friendly whatso ever. retail isnt for everybody .
bad,My co-workers make my job enjoyable. They need better management. I have no life outside of work. I never get scheduled for decent hours. I need balance.
bad,"Management was kind..the work days dragged on. I was given lots a free cosmetics to try. The pay was pretty decent, but because the store was so slow, and not meeting its sales plan, I worried about job security constantly."
bad,"Typical day at work varied. There was alot of unorganization. Sales goals could be unattainable given the current seasons. I did learn about products and their uses. Management varied. Alot of politics involved. Promotions arent based on numbers and a persons sales. My coworkers were pleasant for trh most part. There is no job security. Benefits can be taken away at any given time for lack of hours but schedule is done ""based on business"". Not ideal for a person with real bills. The most enjoyable part of the job was constantly excersing my craft."
bad,"Good environment and a lot of incentives but the money wasn't worth it after a while, and I started out as part time because I am in school and slowly but surely I was working 40 hours a week."
bad,"Honestly, my time spent there as a seasonal worker was, underwhelming. Most of the staff try hard to skirt actually working, though they are usually friendly. They pay is good for what the work is, though the management is in need of revamp as more often than not the manager of stock team has little to no idea whats actually coming and going through his inventory dock."
bad,"It is hard to make a living working at Nordstrom.  They do not ensure that employees have the resources they need in order to be successful.  "
bad,Great Customer Service was a MUST at Nordstrom.  Hardest part of job for Salesforce was reaching goals that were quite unattainable.  Felt Store Manager was fair and approachable.
bad,"Poor management constant inconsistency with directions for work on the floor."
bad,Not very good to employees. Even the really committed ones. Should not be one of the top companies to work for-
bad,Technology is going through a major identity crisis - poor leadership and competing priorities cause for bad morale and loss of culture.
bad,"Everyday the workforce turn off their alarms and sigh - we have to return to work in technology at Nordstrom. We march in to another day of sadness, anger and despair. We are cast adrift in a sea of constant uncertainty. We can never accomplish anything due to ever-changing teams due to leadership re-organization - and a lack of support from our ""servant leadership"". We are meant to be agile - instead we are stuck in the mire of waterfall+scrum = scrummerfall. "
bad,I truely enjoy working for this company however with me being a full time student it is hard to balance both things. Also this position is commission only which makes it harder to have a stable paycheck
bad,"Nordstrom is not a bad place to work, however It's the worst job Ive had. Nordstrom customer base is unsophisticated. They wear the product and return it. But Nordstrom has trained their customers to do so,when their employees work on commission base salaries. The management don't get paid anything and don't know working labor laws and protocol dealing with staff."
bad,Nordstrom Galleria of Dallas is extremely slow in business. They are losing clientele due to NorthPark and close competitors. They make you work long hours when there's absolutely nobody coming into the store. If you work for the company make sure to go to a busier area!!
bad,"Nordstrom credit is a high stressed, low pay, glass ceiling call center.  The credit division is managed and employees are treated more along the lines of a Wal-Mart job environment. Their idea of showing employees their appreciation is occasionally ordering Papa Johns and putting stale candy out on the tables. The hiring managers sell their employees a dream that Nordstrom is doing them a service by hiring them. However employees are under paid and over worked. The call center is poorly staffed because their scheduling is just as incompetent as their supervisors. The schedules they offer are all over the place. One day you can get off at 12am and the next day come back at 10am. Since it is a call center the calls are monitored and evaluated by a Quality Assurance team that has an unrealistic and overcritical evaluations partly due to their new Vice President. And due to their QAS unattainable goals this ultimately effects the schedule you get. The customers that call in are neurotic, pretentious, highly rude, and irrational and since its Nordstrom you must take it with a smile. And to make the situation worse you have supervisors that micro manage everything each rep does (from breaks to call evaluations) while they stand around eat, gossip and are on social media. There are in dire need of employees because they have had several seasoned employees in both locations quit including supervisors. To put it lightly there is usually two reps that quit or get fired every week. Aside from the office itself Nordstrom's credit card is a joke from the benefits to the overall handling"
bad,"Nordstrom used to be great but sales revenue is all that matters now. The 20-something managers make you clean for 1/2 hour but you're commission only (6%!). If your sales don't match those who have been there for years, they'll write you up. After 3 write ups, the evil store manager orders the dept. manager to fire you. In this economy be prepared to be looking for work again in a few weeks..."
bad,"Would recommend Nordstrom to a younger employee or someone who doesn’t “need” the job and just wants extra income and discount  "
bad,If you are interested in a fashion career this is your place to work.  I perform logistic responsibilities to further my career in that field.  I am not a fashion employee.
bad,Management wasn't very understandable about personal situations. Was overworked sometimes. Cleaning took a really long time. Was asked to come in at 5am from time to time.
bad,They preach that they like to grow within but hire from the outside for regional and manager positions. The store manager is a bully and HR doesn't support staff with real concerns. People are targeted and removed from their position or fired after speaking up against upper management.
bad,"Nordstrom was a fantastic company to work for, but things have changed over the past two or three years: Career progression has become an ""up-or-out"" thing (at least for engineers), and with an unofficial target-ratio of juniors to seniors, this doesn't leave any room for an engineer-2 after a couple of years. Culture isn't what it was - though some may find the aggressive / eat-or-be-eaten style to their liking (it's not for me)."
bad,Benefits unclear change job procedures and expectations prior to raises which affects raises mgmt does not provide positive reinforcement negative feedback with no constructive input
bad,"It started off good but the longer I started the more unhappy I was. I was overqualified for my position, bad management, and lack of communication throughout the company."
bad,Retail is a dying so any retail sales based job is really hard to keep up with. Base pay is super low unless youre making salary and in management. The best part is probably the people you meet. I’m a creative person and I met a bunch of cool like minded people while working there.
bad,"The managers Are unprofessional, your sick leave is not automatically added to your check when you call out. You have to request for it while your sick. No support. No one to go to if co workers or managers are a problem for you. Lots of gossiping and spreading people personal business. Your Also-overworked for the small amount of money your being paid. Constantly changing coworkers because everyone hates the company"
bad,"Extremely negative, vulgar and rude operators.  Management is afraid of the operators clique and allows them to do and say whatever they want would like to."
bad,"Did not enjoy working there due to bad management. Met a lot of good people when working there. Moved from full time to part time, left because they kept flexing people off"
bad,Nordstrom was a fantastic employment opportunity and environment when I first started.  At that time the company was run by the Nordstrom brothers and there philosophy was that customers and employees were number one. It has now become a company all about the bottom line.
bad,"Nordstrom was an interesting experience, to say the least. Most of the coworkers I had were great, and even made friends with some of them. However, the management in this store is terrible. There is a major lack of consistency and communication."
bad,"My experience working for Nordstrom might be unique & specific to the store I was at but it was the worst. Management was unhelpful, there was so much drama as they hired mostly early twenty somethings who had inflated egos, benefits were good but I was unable to claim some of my benefits & when I called our support to fix that issue I was told they would call me back which never happened. Totally looked over. If you’re going to find a retailer to work at, find one more elevated that Nordstrom."
bad,"Overall, Nordstrom is what you make of it. If you’re at the Rack, growth potential is extremely limited. Ultimately, you mean nothing if you’re not at the full-line retail store. They’ll claim to promote from within, but it’s very seldom that you’ll ever get the opportunity to move up in a position within your own store (even if you’re more than qualified or deserving) Also, not sure if this is across the board, but race plays a huge part in how you grow/how you’re treated at this company."
bad,The management is poor if there was better management this place would be better work environment. Manangement is highly critical and dont appreciate hard working employees.
bad,"Ten years ago Nordstrom still kind of cared about its employees...at least treated us like people. I quit after ten years after watching a company I once really enjoyed working for transform into another Macys. "
bad,"I have been working for Nordstrom for about three years and within those three years I have completely become disillusioned from how I felt about the company when I was hired on. Business has totally changed and now the focus for the company has become about expanding the online business. In a meeting last month management explained that corporate wants to focus on competing with Amazon (seriously..?!) in online sales and shipping, but instead of trying to be understanding with the employees that in store business is slowing down that our goals and personal sales would obviously take a hit, but no, goals are going higher and higher and more and more employees are being written up for not consistently hitting our goals. And for those who are meeting there goals we are seeing goals changing at the last minute to be more or  management complaining that we should be beating them by a higher percentage. In the last six months my department alone has lost at least 15 or more of our regular 40+ employees who are tired of being harassed for not making events or goals and how slow the store has become but yet everyone knows the company is focusing not on the store but online business. Nordstrom employees also are seeing less and less of the benefits that used to make working for Nordstrom a highly coveted job now they are trying to make it harder and harder for their employees to benefit. For a company so famous for excellent customer service, they really should try to take better care of those giving that service."
bad,When the CEO talks about balancing the roles and compensation for all jobs. He disregards the tech community because we cost so much. So managers have to go around loop holes and hire new folks straight from college with a higher pay than those that have worked at Nordstrom for years.
bad,Awful management and a very stressful environment. No work life balance if you have a family. Very little vacation and a lot of months are blacked out for use. High pressure now that online sales are taking more than 50% of the business.
bad,"I have learned that no matter how hard you work and how good you are, management will still overlook it and only care about their needs and not yours. Time off request are denied by Store manager  even before department manager can see it and even if approved by dept manager, store manager will go back and deny it. What is the point of having department managers if the store manager do not trust how they manage and constantly micro manage everyone. Sad part is a manager is always reported by employees and nothing ever gets done. Employees are always getting disrespected by managers and no consequences. The only good thing about working at Nordstrom were the benefits, perks and discounts, that is it!"
bad,Showed favoritism towards people they liked. Unfair to hard working people that had worked there for years. Hiring and promoting friends above seasoned workers.
bad,the company has changed for the worst since i started 11 years ago  they just want to save money by cutting jobs and combining portions with employees that ae newer and make less money
bad,"As a logistics employee, you will never be appreciate out side of a single, fake, corporate required, breakfast event that ""shows appreciate"" for all the support roles in the store."
bad,There were a lot of issues I had with the management here. I was literally bullied by the assistant manager and my department manager didn't do anything about it. There was another assistant manager who made a racist comment and nothing was done with it. I was constantly calling HR because of inappropriate remarks and activities my manager was doing.
bad,"While the position itself is a strong addition to the Company, the unreasonable actions taken simply for ""visibility"", as well as the expectation that you aren't there to actually prevent but merely observe defeats the purpose.  You're held accountable for theft occurring, but you cannot intervene, even to speak to someone stealing.  Everyone is in it for themselves, and the lack of enthusiasm daily wears on each employee, as does the false pleasantries.  Additionally, for a department allegedly integral to the prevention of internal and external theft to ""run out of funds"" within the first three months of the year indicates poor management and planning, especially when hours were cut from the beginning."
bad,This company hires the worst possible management. They are all young individuals who micro-manage and do not care at all about their employees. It was an absolute nightmare.
bad,"You always have someone on you about goals and calling customers.  Too many blackout dates for PTO (which they barely let you use if you're in cosmetics).  Too many events with barely any downtime in between them.  Not much movement or promotions within cosmetics department unless willing to relocate to a different region.  Mandatory weekends (getting a weekend off is like pulling teeth).  Being told that you can't go to a family function like a wedding because of store events (there is one like every month).  No sick days, you have to use your PTO.  Lack of professionalism within department managers.  One manager telling you that you can do something and then being yelled at by another when you already asked permission.  High school like atmosphere.  Co-workers are awesome and helpful but everyone is competitive with sales because they are afraid of getting fired."
bad,I worked at Nordstrom Rack for 20 months. Nordstrom Rack is the off-price offering to the retail industry from Nordstrom. I took the job because I needed employment and it was the only option I had at the moment. As a retail associate in the shoes and men's department I worked an average of 20 to 30 hours a week.  After 1000 hours my wages where automatically raised to $15.10 an hour. I committed to working there but found in the long run that It was not the best fit. I will say that I learned a lot about business and retail. Nordstrom is a great company to work for If you have a passion for retail and fashion. I treat any employment I decide to take on seriously and do my best. My cautionary advice for anyone reading this is this. It might not be the best idea to accept employment that you may not feel driven to do well in. I will emphasize that I did my best but I have learned that retail and fashion is not something that I am driven to do well in.
bad,"Very competitive due to commission, which makes for a depressing workplace. Management has unclear goals and expectations and there is no room for growth."
bad,I was hired for this job and while I was still learning my job my Department Manager was promoted. Upper Management took 3 months to hire a new Department manager.
bad,"I quickly realized that the Mentality is very high school and managers only care about you making your goal."
bad,This company does not take care of their employees. Management pushes for numbers and not customer service. They will fire you if they can and they are the hardest to work with. Pay does not compensate for the job you have to do and the grueling politics. I am so glad I can finally say I don't work there anymore.
bad,"Was able to grow my customer service experience and really focus on growing a relationship with my clients. But with retail being a failing industry, sales we're often beaten out by online. With the company pushing online sales and accessibility so much it made it nearly impossible to meet such high goals that just kept getting higher each month and each event."
bad,Overall the job is okay to work at but very stressful and very demanding people are very rude very inconsiderate talk to you any kind of way and expect so much out of you that is impossible to give
bad,"Management in my department was slow and negligent at moving people up in the company even though Nordstrom makes a point to be proud of helping people move up in the company. The women's designer department was always slow making it hard to make good sales. Sales directly affect your paycheck, and on top of that any sale you make can be returned within a years time and be taken out of your sales."
bad,"I am lucky that I have a good department manager otherwise it would be totally unbearable here. It’s so cut throat and no one tries to save sales or help their fellow team mates. Also the fact that we are commission vs. minimum wage is terrible. There are times when no matter what you do you cannot generate enough business to make your commission. There are also circumstances where one person is the only one in the department who takes care of Work that needs to get done and the other associates sell. It’s imperfect and we suffer. I wanted to cut my time to part time to build my personal business and the hr department gave me the run around about changing my availability with my supervisor- which resulted in my getting 2 write ups. This is not a company I recommend working for. They look out for the business and put the employees second. When you’re in training they give you a lot of stories about how much employees love working there and the endless earning possibilities, but Work there a couple of days and talk to the employees and you’ll get a much different picture."
bad,High stress work enviorment. HR skills were poor. management was created hostility and stress. Pay does not match the amount of work employees have to do.
bad,Working in a support department that maintained the overall physical function of a Nordstrom store.  The work was varied and interesting but be expected to available 24/7 365 days of the year.
bad,"Although the environment was not the best in terms of pay or growth potential or management, there were amazing people to work with and the job was straight-forward. Would be a good fit for some people."
bad,Just typical retail environment just with more opportunities to be overworked by company.  Treated only if sales are up in the store but store manager is really nice throughout the time on sales floor.  Customers are more so the ones that will stab you in the back if you work there.  They will put any of their negative feelings towards you.
bad,The management plays favorites and you don't receive a steady paycheck throughout the months. It can be hard to sell in such a competitive environment.
bad,Great place to work if you have a good manager and you do not need to support yourself from you paycheck.  The company sometimes promotes bad managers and tolerates abusive behavior from its managers.
bad,"You work your behind off and they promote the guy who walks around and stares at shoes all day. He never helps the team but because he ""fits"" the job description."
bad,Employees may not be valued at their true potential due to the high volume of employees constantly circulating through the company. Gives an impression that you are easily replaceable and may not feel appreciated as an employee. Extremely difficult to balance if you have young children or other priorities.
bad,"They are not organized, and I would not work here again. Work at home is somewhat new and they need help on how to structure it. Nice to be able to work from home though!"
bad,"When I started working for the Nordstrom company back in August, they promised the world to us. We started with 800 employees all so excited to work for a company that believed in us. Slowly as the We are down to less than 300 now. Most of the good employees realized what the company was about. They were not going to make the money they said we were going to. Months passed and sales were coming in. Returns were rolling in as we were supposed to tell the customers ""We have no return policy, you can bring it back for a full refund anytime"" This affects your pay and the company wins by gaining the customer. The pay is terrible if you are trying to support yourself. You can work at McDonald's and make more money. Management steals your customers and they have a schedule with at least 6 different time slots. You cannot plan your life around that. Evening shifts you need to wait until the restaurant is empty before you can do your cash there are nights you will leave passed 11pm  Management promise you the moon just to keep you going but they are all empty promises. It's a lie, they don't promote within maybe 10% the rest is hired from outside. Find yourself another job where you don't expect empty promises and work for a  team of inexperienced managers."
bad,"This is not a place to make sales exclusively, but the payment is by commission. There are many tasks to do besides sales, but the company does not count that, they want the sales person to do those assignments, but only the net sales count. Beware of the return policy, because those returns reduce the sales volume of any sales agent."
bad,"If you are looking for a job where you need to work a certain amount of hours - this is not the job - you can work 25 hours one week and 12 the next. They do not guarantee hours. If they hire you as part time or full time that does not mean you will have those hours. "
bad,The work hours were usually full days. Example: 1:30 - 10:30. Managers were not really willing to work with your personal schedule and they did not promote growth within the company.
bad,"As a stylist, my typical day consisted of gaining new clients to join my network of personal styling services. Company did very little in helping employees develop new clients."
bad,"The Technology Organization is a bit of a mess. If your looking to advance your career in technology I would target a more robust tech company in the Seattle Area. If you have designs of moving to a big name in technology Nordstrom isn't really a stepping stone to get you there. "
bad,"I enjoyed Nordstrom, I loved meeting customers, I am a very hard worker, I enjoyed helping customers find the perfect shoes, opening reward cards for customers."
bad,"Pros"
bad,"I have here for years. The job is okay, decent pay. The management is awful and they tend to throw anyone under the bus including their best workers. Quality Index (QI) and productivity index (PI) are stressful. They expect you to maintain a 70 (PI) one hundred hours average even when we're slow. Management also is very open however they never resolve issues. They continue to promote the worst workers who then turn into the worst managers. The higher level management isn't honest with the future of this location being as there is a new fulfillment center (FC) in Pennsylvania which is draining our work."
bad,"My passion for Food didn't match the level of work, for the most part threw out the year we was always slow even on holidays"
bad,"The company has great values. They just need to do a better job with the people that they pick to run things. Worked at two different stores where management was immature and not helpful. If you can suck up you can get promoted, you don't have to know anything about the job that you are going for. People that they hire are not autonomous in their work efforts. They have to constantly be supervised, managers included. There is also a blame game that they play, no one takes responsibility for anything. The pay could also be better, it is not worth the stress."
bad,My co-workers were awesome and what made the job fun but management had some problems. Nordstrom in Bellevue had a very high turnover rate.
bad,"When I was hired I was guaranteed full time and benefits, I was told I would get PTO every pay check and there are no black out dates. It hasn't even been a year yet and our manager started stealing hours from my team to give to her unbudgeted assistant, so he could get benefits, even when I was ""full time"" I couldn't even get benefits (I'm barely making part time hours now). The company does not require less hours for overnight stock team, which is unfair. The department managers, store manager included, are all very immature and will hold grudges if you question any practice they require that isn't corporate standard, they constantly flip flop on how they want their merchandise processed and then will complain when you don't do it the way they wanted it done 4 months ago. The managers talk to anyone ""under"" them in a very condecending way it doesn't make you want to work very hard for them. During the holidays the truck is constantly late (multiple hours on occasion) with very high volume, if you manage to process the whole truck except for one small pallet they will question why you didn't finish, accuse you of wasting time or milking your breaks, but if you stay later than scheduled they complain about you going over hours. As far as PTO goes, the managers will grudgingly let you take it, if none of their buddies want to go on vacation, but be prepared for the massive guilt trip they're about to put you through. Even for sick days they'll guilt trip you. They claim to be flexible as far as scheduling but the managers do not want to see anyone other than themselves having"
bad,"As a Wedding Stylist, I spent much of my day working with high stress customers to ensure that their expectations were met. I find great joy in building relationships with my customers and through my work I was given the opportunity to learn from each one of my clients. With there being only three Wedding Stylists at Nordstrom, I was also given the opportunity to build my leadership and managerial skills. I find myself to a have a strong work ethic and I strive to better my work skills everyday on the job."
bad,"I was led to believe, upon being hired, that I would be able to sell ANYTHING in the store (NOT!)..That sounded SO great as I believe that I am an excellent sales person with a superb work ethic. I  have the ability to communicate and relate to just about anyone, have high energy and an upbeat personality and the ability to empathize and relate to customers and their various needs and concerns.  I am extremely comfortable with ALL price points, designers and degrees of fashion. I have a very developed sense of style and an ability to assess a successful look for different individuals..including all body types- heavy, thin, tall or short. UNFORTUNATELY, Nordstrom was unable to utilize these abilities.  I was reprimanded several times for selling outside of my department which was ""plus"" sizes..""Encore"". Rather, I was told to ""cross sell""  and that if a customer did not approach ""my"" department, then I could not sell to that customer..Really?? Cross sell plus size women to what other department..????...""wait a minute, I have the perfect handbag to go with that""..it will only take me a long time to go and find it for you, along with the perfect pair of shoes??....and lingerie that we do not have!!....this model does not work for me..Nordstrom needs to rethink their model..too many sales personnel in each department working long hours means that not very many employees are making very much money..and that adds up to discouragement for the sales associates that come to Nordstrom from very successful past jobs. Add on to that problem, the difficulty of dealing with very young, very"
bad,"Some of the snobbiest people ON EARTH to deal with as coworkers and customers. Although that can be expected I didn't expect to cry so much. RUDE managers! No amount of money was enough to keep me content in that dark abyss. My coworkers had secret nicknames such as ""shark"" or ""ghost"" because they could literally come out of nowhere and STEAL your customer with a fierceness that a mama bear wouldn't play with. Being around that rubbed off on me because hey - I have bills to pay too! Just awful."
bad,They want you to to be able to run the store and know everything about every department you're apart of without paying you for extra training or even providing training. You're your own boss unless you don't have amazing numbers then somebody yells at you for not doing their job.
bad,"I only worked for 4 months but I did learn a lot being that I've never worked in a department store.  The worst part is working the Anniversary Sale. You catch more from the manager than the customers. You can make commission but if you miss 6 pay periods, you will be terminated. You're kinda forced onto the sales floor with only 2 days of training, which is NOT enough. People steal sales to make their own commission. At the end of the day, it's not a permanent job.  I was eventually was fired for false accusation of changing my schedule and out of retaliation of going to HR on my manager but in general, Nordstrom is a decent place to work."
bad,Nordstrom is a great please to work for if you are a person that is in to fashion and keeping up on the latest trends. I have met great people and enjoy helping others.
bad,"Everyone turns on each other because of the commission based salary, not good for people who just want to make their money and leave."
bad,"I thought the percentage of commission was very low considering it was 100% of the pay.   That being said there was a fail-safe compensation which was $9.25/hr, which is fine considering I am a student and was using this money for extra spending, not for rent or groceries."
bad,Really good pay depending on department and season. Management is ATROCIOUS. Don't care about you. Will find any reason to fire you or make you quit. Turnover rate is insane.
bad,"I have been with Nordstrom for 6 months. Im staying bc i need the benefits but its not the ideal work environment."
bad,"A typical work day consisted of working with my General Manager and three Sous Chefs to maintain day-to-day operation of the restaurant; including but not limited to opening, mid and closing checklists, daily menu item training, daily menu item tasting, a.m. line checks, p.m. line checks, and ordering."
bad,"They hired me for the morning shift (3:00 am to 11:30 am) wich works for me cause I have to pick up my little one from the school at 12:00. First week all was perfect... Then the manager gave me my schedule wich had a note at the top: THIS SCHEDULE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE... The next day I checked the wall and surprise!!! A totally new schedule was there.... The same day after I got home I received a phone call from the manager saying that he changed the schedule again and that I had to work 2 days a week from 1:00 p.m. To 11:00 pm ( wich is not morning shift) well I tried to talk to my manager about it but he said that was the schedule and he didn't help me AT ALL!! "
bad,"Nice colleague, Suck policy. Working schedule is a joke because they can change it whenever they want. With the most ridiculous low payroll, it's not worth to get it."
bad,Nordstrom was a good company. There was potential to move up and they offered a unique atmosphere.
bad,"It has changed so much since I started and in the wrong direction. It is less customer focused. There is favoritism and although I was not a victim, I don't like seeing it play out. They can also be ageist, promoting the very young over experience."
bad,"wouldn't recommend. treat their employees poorly."
bad,"A typical day at work usually goes by quickly. We are a call center for ten Nordstrom locations on the East Coast. I assist with management by coaching operators throughout the day, pull daily stats to ensure service level is maintained, document and record vital information regarding the overall workday and employee progression. My overall goal is to progress taking the knowledge of business managment I gained with this company (Nordstrom) and further my career goals."
bad,I was working for them on a one week assignment through AppleOne. I was suppose to be there for one week but they end up letting me go unexpectedly. I was pretty bummed about it. I couldn’t stand on my feet for eight hours.
bad,"They micromanage so bad, you cant even go to the bathroom without them timing it and commenting about waiting till your break.  Your breaks are 2 15 min. breaks (which they time) and you can't be late clocking in.  If you are 1 min. late it counts as an occurrence,  you use your sick day it counts as an occurrence.  you get 3 occurrences and you get written up, 1 or 2 more you are fired."
bad,It was a nice experience but unless your someone who wants to work on your feet all your life then this job is not for you. I wouldn’t recommend this unless you have experience
bad,I had such high hopes for this company and I was really excited about opening a flagship in New York. Overall I don’t like they way this company does business with employees and it leads one to question the legality of some of their business practices which is why I had to leave. Pay structure varies by department. Managers are selling managers. *Read your offer letter carefully*; make sure they list you as full time at 32.5 hours per week because you will be ranked and will receive hours based upon your rank which can go below 32.5 hours. This place does have the potential to be a great place to work but only for certain people.
bad,The worst experience in my work life. No support. Not worth reviewing this company. I would rather forget I worked there. It was a waste of my life and time.
bad,"The people are friendly and the pay is decent. However, they operate by ""occurrences"" and are very strict by them. They are marks against your employment if you are late or leave early or call out. The big problem with them are that even if your parent dies and you leave early that day, you still get one. If you have a mandatory court date and didn't get that day approved, you get one. If your child is throwing up in class and you have to go pick them up (even if you come back to work right after), you get one. I witnessed so many people getting occurrences for things that didn't make sense at all (all of the above situations were observed)."
bad,Management is unprofessional and fail to properly communicate with employees at times. They also fail to recognize and appreciate their employees; don't accommodate to their needs to help with their work efforts.
bad,"Selfish unprofessional place I've ever worked for in my twenty-five of career. Unorganized company with terrible unprofessional leadership, "
bad,$9.00:hr unless you sell enough to make commission which is around 3 percent. Overworked and underpaid. Typical retail job not worth it unless you enjoy the 20% discount.
bad,"The work culture is sophomoric, and I mean that in a literal sense.  It was if I stepped back into high school... cliques, favoritism, backstabbing, juvenile behavior, in not only the hourly employees but front line supervisors as well. Not what one would expect from a longstanding corporation.  The company's ""Think Like a Customer"" and ""Team"" talks run contrary to the individual performance expectations, creating confusion.  The lack of training, because 'we don't have time,' promotes sloppiness in work quality and increases their indirect costs.  Supervisors have no understanding of labor laws and practices willful blindness (""No one is taking a break until all the replens is put away""), and the human resources staff is oblivious unless an employee reports an issue or violation.  Human Resources personnel have no presence in the warehouse and do not actively engage employees.  During the state of the company address the presenter, who was addressing employees who frequently live paycheck to paycheck and work two jobs to survive, referred to his wanting a raise, too.  One employee commented later that perhaps [presenter] should sell his BMW to save money.  Need I continue?  Management is clueless and I believe this distribution center is in an impossible turnaround.  The employees are generally unhappy, overworked, physically comprised, dead tired and TRAPPED because the high wage prevents them from seeking employment elsewhere.  It's the only thing the Nordstrom ECFC has going for it, and that's just incredibly sad for the employee, for the company image, and for the community."
bad,They sell you on a good quality of life and then work you to the bone. Benefits are great but they really do want you to live at work. Particularly the restaurant. Not to mention the sales people look down upon and treat the restaurant employees as personal chefs for them and there clients. Also a dash a racism exists in the higher echelon of management.
bad,"I can’t speak for any other department but working in kids was awful. Everyday I was scheduled to work with 2-3 other people even on weekdays. There were just not enough customers to sell to and it created massive conflict and tension with co workers at all time. Many times there would only be 4-5 customers a day and while you’re waiting all you’re doing is thinking about how to get the opportunity to talk to the customer before your co worker. "
bad,No real career path and the pay is extremely low for titles. Recruiting system is flawed/confusing and that is from an internal view. Recommend short stay.
bad,"Gone downhill and that is it. Used to be a great company to work for but lost that feeling a long time ago. "
bad,"There were good things about the job but the culture at Nordstrom is very unwelcoming. I was made to feel less than and lots inappropriate gestures about weight, size and appearance. I had co-workers literally laughing in my face about things that were being said privately.  I was followed and asked very personal information. Constantly, wanted you to buy products from the store."
bad,"Any job that has people working for compensation is going to have groups of people that will do anything to make more money, even if it include stealing someone you are currently working with."
bad,"Upon first getting hired I was excited to work there but that quickly changed. Firstly the people working there were rude and not very welcoming, only a select few were. I originally interviewed for the women's department and was transferred to the Customer experience department without my knowledge or input. The break room is disgusting and you occasionally will find a bug or two."
bad,"A typical day at work...."
bad,"😔  Nordstrom would be a great place to work. Only if in store management was professional at all times & not showing partiality. Treat people like you would like to be treated. Stop the favor games and do business, should be a shame of themselves. No security or  L.P, help PERIOD!! Either way business, driving sales and hard workers will shine you can't stop that, CUSTOMER WILL ASK FOR YOU. From a True HARD WORKER!"
bad,Though various locations may differ slightly the overall complaint is Nordstroms managerial staff. There are too few and far between managers who are professional and treat their employees with respect. The store managers in particular at the majority of stores have personal relationships with managers higher up the pyramid and as a result if you have a complaint or disagreement and you are beneath a managerial position there will be retaliation against you.
bad,"As an hourly sales associate I received 10.75 an hour plus commission but the way commission works is this your sales commission needs to cover your hourly rate times the number of hours you work. "
bad,"First of all, you're easily replaceable unless you're one of the top sellers in the store so don't think you mean anything to upper management. They don't care about you at all unless you have the numbers. This is a department store so each department has their own department manager. BOTH of my department managers had favoritism, and it's an issue in every department. Assistant managers were never on the floor, they were always going around the store talking to their friends and never helping. Getting days off is easy if you ask in advance however don't even bother asking during the summer sale (July-Aug) or winter (Nov-Dec) because those are ""black out days"". "
bad,My time at Nordstrom was a great take away.  Met a lot of great people and helped a lot of great clients.  Nordstrom helped me with my interpersonal communication skills and selling techniques and I can use in my future endeavors.
bad,It’s a great place to work. My best best advice is learn what you can quickly and move up in the company. Know your products best way to make money and commission.
bad,"There are way too many managers and some of them were unkind. Poor schedule planning. The ""Rover"" job title was a complete joke. We received poor training from other departments because we were supposed to be the ""Jack of all trades""... but were evidently the masters of none. I felt very disposable as a Rover and I never received recognition for my hard work. Always overlooked. Got the worst shifts as a Rover. They would always schedule me when I had class, even though we would discuss my availability ahead of time. Only apply if you have no other commitments and don't apply for the Rover position."
bad,"Management abused their power"
bad,Nordstrom will not move you up if they see you are a key player to their team. Each department manager gets a bonus if they're numbers are met at the end of the month so that's why they don't want to move any valuable players up.
bad,"Nordstrom management is not well trained and favoritism is evident.The good  managers they let go and keep the brown nosers who have no experience. HR violations run rampant. You spend some days standing around because it's so slow and other days are so busy you can't breath. The pay is terrible and even if you do your due diligence on selling, the customer can bring back item at any time and you lose your commission making it extremely hard to make a living working here. When they take your commission away you basically end up working for free some days. Competitiveness runs high and some sales people steal sales."
bad,"The day to day operations at Nordstrom is not to bad. Work is fairly easy to learn for most entry level positions and even some lead positions. However, once in a management position, upper management could care less about work life balance or your own development within the company. Normally this wouldnt bother me, however it is something that Nordstroms tires to pride itself in, the development of their employees, so the inconsistency between what their message is and what is actually delivered has me disappointed. I hope that this company is able to find a way to rectify this, because it is painful to see a company I once respected go down this road."
bad,I had a lot of fun working with many people but it is a tough environment to work for because they need you to meet your goals per pay period. I had an excellent record with them but had to quit for family emergency reasons. I wanted to go back but my new manager won't hire me back because after one month working for her she said she does not like me and we won't work well together. I have been working for the company for more than 2 years and gave them my loyalty but it just sad it ended this way.
bad,"Across the board, management is pathetic at the Nashville/Green Hills Store. Compensation does not meet current Nashville cost of living."
bad,Overall not worth the hourly pay to deal with the specificity of the sales floor layout and organization among having too few staff at any one time to function more smoothly.
bad,Management was the biggest opportunity in my department. Enjoyed my day to day tasks but the pressure was intense. Too many events in my opinion does not make the events special.
bad,"Managers are hypocrites and if they don’t like the best person for a promotion they will choose a less deserving candidate "
bad,"it might be that I was working in Utah, but the people are very fake and have a tendency to not help with growth and other associates steal sales like no other..."
bad,"I worked at the Nordstrom eaton centre location from its opening day in august of 2016 until January 2017. The only positives about this company is great co workers and good work/life balance aside from that nothing. The department I worked for had very little traffic most days thus difficult to hit daily sales targets, also very little assistance from management aside from threatening to fire you for not hitting targets."
bad,"Great culture on paper, sadly walking the walk has become less over the years. It's become  a company where your experience positive or negative is based on 'who' you work for and which division vs. the amazing corporate culture."
bad,they only give you a 50 cent raised every 1000 hours.  they start of cooks at 13$ an hour. they only way to get a raised is to become a chef or lead. i wouldn't recommend working in the kitchen at Nordstrom.
bad,"I love fashion, I loved helping customers find what they needed, I loved organizing and keeping the space looking beautiful, I also loved the people I worked with...however the expectation to sell so much in a dying retail market and basically that is your ONLY value. "
bad,Lack of training from management to hourly employees. No appreciation for job well done from employees. Management was not present for most of the day and spent day in office saying they “were unavailable” to help employees with customers.
bad,"I may have just had a bad experience, but I didn't feel like my managers cared or that I was given any realistic opportunity for advancement. My schedule wasn't good, and managers didn't want to work with me on changing it. Also didn't particularly like the other people I worked with -- Nordstrom makes you feel like you can't have friends at work because you're constantly competing."
bad,Nordstrom seriously needs to reevaluate their company policies and mission. Train managers instead of bullying people and chanbge with the times. Not very great benefits as well.
bad,"If you want to feel like part of a team, this is not the place for you. They expect you to work until you can't anymore. You feel like you are able to be replaced easily."
bad,"I'm sure working for Nordstrom in a different department would have been great! However, working as a stylist assistant meant just putting clothes away all day or using client's credit cards to buy things online for them. Coming from a previous management role to a go-backs runner felt very boring and unfulfilling. There was also a lot of gossip and talking about people behind their backs at this job. Calling other stores for inventory checks was a hassle because people need better training on how to answer the phone. Asking where something is located at your own store was also met with attitudes from other employees. I went into this job with hopes of job security and new experience, however, what I didn't realize was that after the Anniversary Sale ended, you had to reapply for a job with the company. This annoyed me because after submitting an application for a different department, I immediately heard back from Nordstrom stating that they weren't going forward with my application. Despite having a lot of experience in retail management and sales. By the end of my run at this job, I contemplated killing myself because it felt so draining and a waste of my time."
bad,"When I first started working for Nordstrom, the work ethic and management were adamant about making sure their team was happy and successful. I started as a stock person at the age of 16 then grew from there. Being on the selling floor, I had help from my team members, my managers, and even the store manager. This allowed me to grow and to move to other stores. Throughout my 7 years at Nordstrom, the quality of employees and management has deteriorated and it is not what I remember. It seems they hire anyone to do anything. Just a body to stand on a floor, or a manager who is not afraid to give bad news. No one is there to help you build anymore, and the atmosphere is very negative."
bad,A slow paced environment where it should be fast paced. A restaurant environment where the chef’s duties and responsibilities are unrecognized as the rest of the environment leads to a very poorly operated company.
bad,"No comment... It used to be a great place to work, then things drastically changed. The open door became closed, the transparency became not so transparent."
bad,"It was fine at first then management changed and the vibe of the store changed along with coworkers. If you didn't make your reward goal for the month you would get trained and spoke to about it all time. Sometimes it wouldn't be your fault, customers would just say no . The management team played favoritsm, had a problem if you needed to change your availibility to less hours and would try to low ball you. Discrimination at it's finest."
bad,Not a good place for a Christian to work.  It promotes wild lifestyles.  As a Christian I had to leave good money on the table bc the people you generally work with or for there are bad influences.  If it wasn’t for the poor work environment I would have never left Nordstrom bc I loved what I did and was really good at it.
bad,I like the job and a fun place to work i work part time and the job is okay for college student the job has good pay you would like working there so give it a try
bad,Night and weekend shifts are tough if you have a family. The management is poor. It can generate good income if you are a good salesperson and stay focused.
bad,"Management patronized employees. Caddy, girls locker room environment. "
bad,"Though Nordstrom had a beautiful working environment, the poor management and hectic work schedules were too much for me to stay. There were a lot of cut-throat antics and other workers were fine with stealing sales."
bad,"Great potential, benefits could be better. Discount is only ok considering prices. You will get offers for advancement but its a question of if you will actually make more in commission sales vs being promoted to a manager...."
bad,"25 years working in this company, responsible for all action, best result as a management,."
bad,"I did not have a very good experience there!  Management is disrespectful, work/life balance doesn’t exist and If you enjoy being micro managed, than this is the place for you."
bad,Not productive and fun workplace.coworker is so series.Nobody have smile on face.Very often I ask my self did this people know how to smile.Everybody is so sires..
bad,"I’m not sure if it was just my store manager or the company as a whole, but from the beginning, training was an after thought. To make a very long story short, This store manager does not believe in setting up for success."
bad,"Typical day working in Nordstrom Rack is to focus on customer service and make sure every go backs are well organized and back on the floor area. My work schedule is less than 20 hours a week, mainly I only focus on customer service and cashier to check out customers merchandise. I would like to continue my career in Mortgage banking where my heart and passion are in it."
bad,"Nordstrom used to be a very fun, exciting place to work. Changes to the econemy created extreme competitiveness, creating a now stressful anxious place to work. Nordstrom is a working and selling commission based environment. The return policy that is offered to the Nordstrom customer works against Nordstrom sales people. Taking commission back from the sales people after months of using the items seems unfair to me. Further more the company now has an online store which also takes away from their employees. Though known fro their outstanding and exceptional customer service, Nordstrom fails to take into consideration the hard work their employees put into every sale and customer relationship."
bad,Management was not supportive at all. They have an outdated way of gaining new customers. Management only want numbers. They are not helpful in assisting. They used scars tactics instead of coaching.
bad,Its a retail company - so they are still using old technology. It was a short term contract for me and the project was terminated before it started due
bad,"I enjoyed my job very much.  Unfortunately many of the younger employees I worked with were immature - constantly on their cell phones & IM'ing each other - and couldn't have cared less about the Nordstrom culture or our team. There was a lack of respect for others & rather than having a conversation to clarify someone's work etc... they gossiped amongst themselves with members of the same team. If they would just go to the other team member and have a conversation, they could quickly clear up many misunderstandings. "
bad,"Let's face it, it's a factory.  "
bad,"I have worked in the company for almost 3 years now, they pay great and a raise every 1000 hours; however, it could get quite stressful and an management takes quite a long time to recognize individuals or move them up within the retail side. I am leaving the company for now because the new management I personally had to work with day to day was a stressful, and very negative environment."
bad,"when I started they made it seem like it was so wonderful to work there and if u show up and do your job and your best,that u could move up the ladder quick.but that was not the case I did my best and learn the job.very quick and within 6 weeks I was top picker.but when I got sick and then my mom had open heart surgey I had doctors notes they still gave me points.was on my last point when they said if u late or miss a day.iam fired so couple days after my car broke down.om my was there I was 40 mins late.they let me work half the day.then they fired me."
bad,"This company only cares about making money, no concern for the employees. The employees were great, but the management staff could care less whether you're hurt or not."
bad,Decent pay decent job but too much politics and favoritism and a typical day is stressful if there are no sales being made . The management here play favorites and pick and choose who to support . leading retailer with worst upper management .
bad,Corporate culture is changing and people don't feel valued or appreciated.  Lots of layers of management who don't understand or appreciate the work being done at the bottom of the pyramid.
bad,"Many people talk. They don't clean up after themselves. They steal sales. No honesty and you can't trust anyone. I speak from the juniors department, however I've heard that the other departments are the same just not as dramatic. We go there to work not act like little kids."
bad,Great discounts when you work there. A lot of hard work and long hours when the holiday seasons come around. Very low salaries for the amount of work you do.
bad,"Working for nordstrom spa was a good place to work, and the products and services were great. The staff was ok.  The best part was the products and services offered."
bad,The most difficult job I have ever had.  Working on commission is tough.  I love the people and the environment and the customers. Too many young people in management positions that aren't qualified to do an effective job.
bad,I believe the company is not heading in the right direction. When I began working for Nordstrom it was wonderful. They hired me on it 20 hours a week part time which is what I got. As the Internet market grew and online shopping became big and Nordstrom rack became big they cut the retail store hours down to in my case five hours a week. It was not worth it. It is dog eat dog and they had not the best of management. I was in the fragrance department and it was very competitive. After seven years I realize Nordstrom was not for me.I might add the turnover there is extra Remely hi basically for the same reason as I have stated. I am an extremely loyal employee but I do know right from wrong and this became wrong.
bad,"it's a great place to work and keep busy, very open staff and management system. I would highly recommend this as a great place to work, I appreciated it."
bad,Psychotic & shady co-workers and management. Bad medical benefits. You will have no life and will schedule everything around a million Nordstrom events. Pointless morning meetings. Hours will be cut if your counter isn't making sales. Money is good and you get extra $$ per hour if you make pacesetter.
bad,Nordstrom was a great company to work for because it always had to top brands at the lowest prices. That made it easier to accommodate customers when they had questions or concerns. Very rarely would conflict arise because company procedures were thoroughly followed.
bad,I had this job in high school and some part of college. They are real selective on who to advance from a rover position so get on someones good side. Also they force you to sell people credit cards and put your job on the line.
bad,"the company has changed since becoming publicly traded, there is no longer loyalty, and attention to personal development anymore. it is a culture where everyone is more concerned about themselves then the betterment of the company. I have observed these changes within the company, and felt so disappointed that I no longer invest in the stock options. Truly disappointed as this was a company I truly loved at one time."
bad,"Mangers are unprofessional. Customers are disrespectful and it is allowed. HR doesn't step in when asked. Schedules is extremely unstable and hours are constantly being cut. I'm not sure if its jjst my location,but hiring seems to be based on who you know in the company vs actual experience."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of hard work that is not acknowledged or appreciated. I noticed while working, employees sit in the back room on their phones and get angry when you ask for help on the floor (even though they are clocked in and supposed to be working.) Most employees that work at Nordstrom in any department have been there for years and are very exclusive. The workplace culture is one that is not welcoming and actually quite rude to any new staff members. Even the department managers were displaying favorites and would not include new staff in open conversations. On multiple occasions, I was left at the cash register by myself while the lines were out of control (the employees on duty would be taking it easy on their phones in the back stock room.) Customers would approach me, furious, explaining they could not find any sales staff on the floor to help them find products and then leave without buying anything. I would not recommend working at Nordstrom, you are not appreciated and it is very difficult to move up or move to another department. Also, not that this is a crucial component to working there, but the discount is very low."
bad,"fun employees, hardest part not being understood, the most enjoyable part is the people i work with, i learned patience while being there."
bad,theres never enough staff so it is pretty difficult to get lunches not many coworkers want to help each other out when it is needed. some managers are not knowledgeable on the product as they should be
bad,"Prepares a variety of meats, seafood, poultry, vegetables and other food Items for cooking in broilers, ovens, grills, fryers and a variety of other Kitchen equipment.  Knows and complies consistently with our standard portion sizes, cooking Methods, quality standards and kitchen rules, policies and procedures."
bad,There is not much room for advancement. The corporate structure on earning money is not for the advantage of the employee. The return policy effects the employee daily being that it is a commission based job. Customers are allowed to return products at any time while the employee looses money on every item returned.
bad,"Customer Service is the main focus, but the treatment of their employees is not. I enjoyed moving up in the company but I do not feel that the treatment I have received or the compensation that I have earned is enough for the work and the impact that I have on my job. I want to work for a company that will compensate and appreciate all that I am and do."
bad,It's a nice work place but the reason why I'm looking for another job is that there is no job security and the hours are not full time hours.I leaned how to use the CFR machine on this job.All my co-workers make this place nice to work at but there is not enough hours.The hardest part of the job is that we do not have fixed days off.The most enjoyable part of the job is we are the first in the store and the first to leave for the day.
bad,Unloaded the trucks to the warehouse and separated the merchandise. Placing price tags the clothes and shoes. Face past environent.
bad,"This is a great place to work to build your skills, and it's a great position if you're motivated. It is a lot of hard work (standing 8 hours with little to no compensation). Terrible benefits is an understatement!!"
bad,"This was a good place to work for the benefits. However, mamagement was overwhelmed with tasks and protocols from corporate. Therefore causing stress and hasty directions for the staff"
bad,"I left a full-time job with vacation and all benefits. The hiring manager assured me the low base of $8 with shared team commission woud be 14 to 16 per hour. Well, the highest hourly amount was just over 14 and that was with all the hype of the new and only full line Nordstrom in Wisconsin. and the 2nd check was down to 12. Which was bad enough. But I just saw January schedule and the hours are 5 or 5.5 per day. My manager said they were only given 6.5 hours per day because traditionally January is very slow. And they want to keep the commission high. How does keeping the commission high give you money to live on if I work 25 hours a week. So, it was a lie to hire me as a full time employee and 3 months later I am part time. What a kick in the head. I think they want a lot of people to quit, and of course people will quit if they need full time hours. I don't respect this company or the managers playing with people's lives."
bad,"I liked it, but wouldn't make a career out of it. No training what so ever. Customers were nice for the most part,but there was a few snobby ones. You got a whole hour for lunch if you worked a full shift. It could be boring if customers didn't shop in your department, so there was a lost of standing around for 6 plus hours."
bad,"If you love to compete with other people for sales all the time this job is for you! If you get a manager that suck then your work life wont be very pleasent, if you get a good one, then going to work is a little more pleasant."
bad,"I was so excited to be working there. Unfortunately there was management problems. I had health demands that were not met.  I was expected to do jobs before proper training or instructions. I was left alone at night, expected to work front of house and clean back of house at the same time with one break at the beginning of a five or six hour shift.  More than once I found mold in food and there was a lack of concern among co workers. Nothing was dated for expiration. I was threatened by other employees that they'd get me fired if I complained or changed things there. I had to fight to get my pay checks afterward. It took them 9 months to send an expired pay check to me."
bad,"The compensation was great if you worked hard and my coworkers were great."
bad,"it wasn't what it use to be.  when I first started, it was  a fun place to be. I would never go back working there.  The company has gone downhill after budget cut"
bad,A typical day at work began with meetings about business for the day. Touch bases with staff members on how to make the day. Working at this job I found it very easy to make business happen seeing as it is a small neighborhood store. You are able to meet loyal clients easily. My co-workers are very diverse and make the work day fun. The hardest part of the job is the the low compensation.
bad,I think management can train better to really teach you how things work and how to sell expensive clothes. I really liked it other wise because everyone was pretty nice and you were able to do your own thing.
bad,no i dont want to talk about that place they fire pregnant people instead of job placing them. the only way to advance is by taking a commission based job even if its not related to what you would like to do.
bad,"When I first started at Nordstrom I thought that I had lucked out, who doesn't want to work at Nordstrom? But, as soon as I started I saw how flawed management was. To start off, my managers never told me where to get the schedules. They made me and the other new hires write it down on a piece of paper and then proceeded to give me the wrong schedule. Because of their poor management I didn't come in for a shift that I was scheduled for and then got angry with me for not coming in. There was also extremely unfair treatment of workers, the big sellers were treated fantastically but the smaller sellers were constantly yelled at for any small thing done wrong. The big sellers were not expected to do the daily tasks the rest of us were. There were/are a lot of flaws with Nordstrom's management, I loved the environment and my coworkers but I hope to never have managers like that again,"
bad,"I would arrive at the store dressed in the most recent styles. Before the doors would open to the public it would be my responsibility to stock all the merchandise, making sure everything in our department ( men's clothing) was perfectly presentable to the customer. I was always ready to greet the customer with a sincere smile and assist the shopper in choosing the exact outfit that they were looking for. I was the cashier responsible for opening and closing the cash drawers for the department. We would transfer merchandise from other stores to the customer's address, and accept all returns that met the company policy. The team that I worked with were all very knowledgeable about what the expectations that were required. The team worked on a commission basis and were always trying to sell the most expensive clothing. I had a hard time doing this because I knew that a shirt that cost $285.00 could be found for mush less in another part of the store that would fit the event. I was able to communicate and connect with any type of personality a shopper had. I really enjoyed meeting new people and establishing a relationship so that when he or she would shop at Nordstrom they would ask for me. Working at Nordstrom was fun but the pay was less than I expected."
bad,"Customers are not very pleasant, must be very disciplined to work in this environment"
bad,"I must say that I did learn a lot at Nordstrom. It was always ""Baptism by Fire"" which is a hard way to learn but if you are up the task, you learn."
bad,Treated poorly by coworkers and managers. Learned how to assist fully assist customer with everything they needed. Perfected customer service skills.
bad,It was good working there at first. Then you start to see past all the fake smiles and politeness. People backstab each other to get ahead and the Managers choose favorites based on personal relationships and not the quality of work.
bad,its mainly commission and co-workers are at each others neck to make commission goal. HR and Store Managers dont really care about co-workers
bad,"Nordstrom is a good company; however, when it comes down to it awful employees who can sell are rewarded with promotions, praise and perks. In an effort to stay competitive with the online market Full Line Nordstrom locations have suffered a great deal. As a leader in customer service in the retail industry Nordstrom has lost its edge trying to stay relevant, consistently they have dropped the ball in order to stay profitable. Nordstrom has lost sight of its culture in the pursuit of the almighty dollar."
bad,"Store is not busy at all but you still have to meet your goals or you will be coached and terminated. Friendly staff but the store manager seems always nervous with store not meeting goals, when a department regional manager is visiting we are expected to be on our best they, intimidate us and I have heard my manager talking to RM about getting rid of employees. Customers can be rude. I like that I can sell from all the store."
bad,"I enjoyed my job at Nordstrom until a manager decided she didn't like me. I ranked high in sales and achieved all goals, however the Department manager had it out for me. She was a dishonest manager with race issues, I was not born the same color as her and would not tolerate her incompetent and inappropriate way of speaking to me and my co workers. I held my job for almost 3years without any trouble and in a 4 1/2 month span she seem to find all kinds of BS reasons to write me up and terminate me. I would not recommend this company to anyone, what the managers have to say about you right or wrong is truth."
bad,Compensation is entirely commission based and because of their very lenient return policy you are constantly having to compensate for returns from your customers. There is a high turnover and the management hires so many employees that it made it difficult to make money because you're constantly competing with others in your department.
bad,A company with an unlimited and wide open return policy makes working solely on commission extremely stressful and next to impossible.
bad,"A customer service representative at Nordstrom Rack is responsible for assisting customers with purchases, inquiries, soliciting credit cards, and accounts payable. The most enjoyable part of the job was the using my knowledge to help customers."
bad,I worked here for a year before I left and returned to a chaotic and unorganized store. Management can now care less about you or your outside life. Be ready to do a lot of puckering up to advance. The new change to this company isn't worth your sanity. Depending on what department you work in determines your pay. This company forces you to open credit cards with customers. Overall I miss the old management and direction of Nordstrom.
bad,"Great JOB, not a career. Its an ok place to work. They make you work overtime to meet the day. The company seems very money hungry, more about money than the employees. Don't work in a seasonal dept. b/c you will not make any money. If you don't meet your goal you will be fired."
bad,"In Cinti, the clothing merchandising was terrible, my manager knew nothing about clothing and very little how to get people to work together. Store man was great! However my complaints to her ultimately fell on deft ears. When I told them I didn't like their mgmt style, they fired the Men's mgr and the Tailor shop mgr 2 weeks later and they were my biggest complait for months. Store assoc. too young, no balance.I had 26 years experience and they wouldn't listen."
bad,My jobs was very good up untill some changes right after my first year working there things weren't the same and my manager didn't really help like my last one would she would create more work which didn't really motivate me to go to work more plus my hours were cut by 60%  out of 110 hours every 2 weeks
bad,"Depending on the managers, the enviorment can be anywhere from tolerable to miserable. The hours are flexible but the fact that returns are taken out of your commissions, is the worst aspect of the job."
bad,Micromanagement is stifling  and the constant worrying about sales being stolen is daunting.  The salespeople have become order fillers as every store has become a fulfillment center
bad,"Nordstrom is a great company to work with for a few months however as time passes by management became wonky and toxic. They will stretch you out until your body cannot handle it anymore. No breaks if they are missing people. If it is slow they will cut your time on the spot."
bad,"Employees are not well managed. Merchandise is not great quality anymore. It is not the step up from other stores it once was. Employees no longer have any type of dress code, they look sloppy. Food place in the middle of the store is just not classy. Not what Nordstrom should stand for."
bad,It is a fun place to work at but a lot of competition among employees. Management has a lot of favoritism. Goals are often hard to achieve unless you have a huge clientele base. You are on your feet all day which can take a toll on you if you are not used to that environment. Overall it was a good experience.
bad,New management was introduced to my department and the management threw the work experience off. Working under the new management was not a fun experience
bad,"Management is beyond terrible. They do not know what they are doing. They change the rules to suit the situation to their advantage. They will lie straight to your face. The best way to get them to leave you alone??? Ask a question. You won't see ""X"" manager for 3 days. "
bad,No work life balance. You will work crazy hours and be expected to put up with unreasonable expectations set by management. I had to stay there till 1 Am to clean up the store and was locked out by security. Really think if this is what you want before you accept.
bad,Lifers who started in the stores love the company but there is a very strong resistance to those who join from outside (even with prior retail company experience).  Huge focus on diversity in the lower and mid-management ranks.
bad,The direction this company is headed is nowhere good. Working there for two years I experienced so many changes and most of them were negative. Management is praised for anything they do even if it is unfair. Favoritism is a MAJOR problem as well as bullying at this store.
bad,The company is really great about going above and beyond exclusively for the customer.  Always making sure the customer is taken care of and that they leave satisfied and willing to return.
bad,"They take a long time to promote if you get promoted. Having great support seems difficult. The department I was in, was client base so slow days were tough to make goals. Sometimes your team could be shady and step on boundaries."
bad,"It's hard to make a living especially if it's commissioned based. Customers can return items whenever and it comes out of your paycheck! I did like the people that I worked with, however managers had to enforce sales goals, usually not in a nice way."
bad,It is a competitive environment and the managers only care about you hitting your sales goals. They place less stock in personal growth and only care about hitting the metrics.
bad,Working at Nordstrom’s was a mindless job for me and would be a good foot in the door experience for a first job. But the management was terrible. The manager made me feel guilty when I became very sick during my weekend shifts and had to call out even though I explained to them I was dizzy and lightheaded. They also said I called out over and over again but the previous time I called out was for bereavement. I was also accused of lying about being sick just to get a day off. All of my coworkers had similar encounters with this manager and in the five or six months I was there I witnessed a very high turnover rate due to poor management including employees that had been there for close to or more than a year.
bad,"When I first started working for Nordstrom, I was hired for seasonal help. However, I became quickly well known for becoming one of the best selling employee's in a very short amount of time. Although I made genuine connections with many of my wonderful co-workers, there were some individuals who couldn't fathom someone of my background outselling those with 30+ years of experience. I was accused of ""cheating the system."" "
bad,Was a great place. Family oriented. Then it got so it was all about the numbers. Push more. Do more. Less having to do about the employee.  More injuries with shoulders.  carpal tunnel etc. Got to be very stressful. Quality of inspection went down. Let so much nasty stuff return to stock. Most Management is about yearly inventive. Push more out. Poor quality.
bad,They promote people they like or favor instead of people that is actually good at what they do and know what there doing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,I worked with Nordstrom for about 6years I worked my up to assistant manager within 2 years. At that time I decided to move and become a sales associate at their Scottsdale location that's when I stepped down from management. The hours were ok at times but it was stressful more when you would constantly hear over and over how important it is to talk to customers about our rewards card and sign them up. I get it but when your job is on the line when you don't open enough to make goal that the company wants your not motivated to do so it's stressful knowing you can be terminated. Health insurance now you have to be consistent with 32 hours or more every week to be insured otherwise you will not have anything which I didn't for about 2 of the years I worked you're pretty much living pay check to pay check. Working with the associates was great it was management who were more of the issue.
bad,The Nordstrom that I worked at had poor management which caused many of the workers to feel unappreciated for their work. Many times I felt like I was being micromanaged when the managers themselves do not know the products they are selling.
bad,"Being a nail technician at Nordstrom  is a very frustrating job, the group of nails technician  is very catty, very mean.  They always look over your shoulder for little mistakes to tell on you.  Manager  is very unfairly,  she  makes her  own rules and in favor of those who has been there longer."
bad,"The set work hours of 20 hours a week for part time were great. I was guaranteed 20 hours a week, until they start flexing people off during the slow season. I like that  you can opt to put in more hours when they are offering overtime to the full time people. My assistant managers where not great at all. It's kind of a sink or swim mentality when you first start until you get the hang of things. Same with when you learn anything new."
bad,I worked at Nordstrom for 9 years. it had its good and bad. I always seem to have an awesome boss. store managers are always a hit or miss. they want you to do whatever it takes to get things done. they love to play the blame game when things are not going according to what they think. my regional manager had no idea what she was doing. she got her position because she was well liked. its all about being liked in that company. so many good workers have left because they weren't appreciated.
bad,"The Job is not hard and can be very rewarding, however the management seems to pick and choose who advances in the company and does not show fairness. The commission also causes cut throat atmospheres and inconsistent pay checks."
bad,Poor management. There is not enough daily business and the goals are unrealistic to reach. The reviews are also unrealistic because the managers expect so much when there is not enough business. They are also overstaffed on the sales floor.
bad,"Typical day at Nordstrom included restocking your department, helping customers with items and providing customer service with a smile. You start by restocking items. Some slow days, gets very busy around holidays. RETURNNNN central and scammers galore so be careful when checking out customers to check ID. High turnover rate and some managers show favoritism which affects others. Managers team up together so it turns to a managers vs salesperson word so be careful. As long as you're kissing everyone's butt, you have a job! Yay!"
bad,"good pay."
bad,"Working for this company was a mess! I will say i was working there when it first opened up so it may not be as choatic now. But upper managermwnt was always changing, there is no work life balance. They called me on days off. The managers moved from one department to another and do not have the training to train others. They have ""clique"" that pushes others to the side and was not really the environment I liked working in."
bad,"I have been a manager with Nordstrom for four years. As I have gotten bigger roles, it has been hard to create a good work life balance.  Staffing issues are always a problem, with little help from Human Resources when it comes to recruiting.  Also, compensation is not that great for managers or salespeople, and having a manager that is not transparent makes it hard to know where opportunities for advancement and growth are."
bad,"I worked on and off for Nordstrom for about 15 years. When I started, the company mission was clear and concise- provide excellent customer service and make great customer experiences. That mission was lost on the smaller stores. The only stores that now get product are the flagship stores and they started to find more and more ways to take commission away from the sales people busting their butts on the floor between .com taking the majority of our size runs before we had an opportunity to sell it to buy online pickup up in store initiatives that eliminate the sales person and the experience entirely. Your customers can tell when Nordstrom doesn't value their community, especially when they travel for business and see what some of the larger stores carry for their communities."
bad,"A typical day for me at Nordstrom included both fulfilling and disappointing events. The relationship between department managers and sales or customer service staff was often strained. However, fostering relationships with the customers was the main highlight of each day. Nordstrom's mission to treat each customer with respect was instilled in the employees and provided a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Knowing that I provided each customer with top notch service was my favorite part of my job. My least favorite part of the job was the mandatory task of strongly encouraging each and every customer to open one of three types of credit or debit accounts. If morale had not continued to decline, I would have continued my career with the company."
bad,It’s was just an “ok” position. More than anything I enjoyed meeting new people and being in the fashion and retail environment. I wasn’t the biggest fan of our merchandise selection and returns were brutal. In my opinion allowing returns as the normal procedure made it hard to earn a steady income.
bad,"I work in Invoice Processing as part of Merchandise Accounts Payable. This position is subject to multiple productivity metrics that management scrutinize on a daily basis. Everything you say and do while at work is placed under scrutiny. While questions are encouraged, asking them will also give management the impression you have no idea what you are talking about and they will question your competence. The office is a maze of cubicles and it is overall an antisocial environment. You actually get in trouble for talking with your teammates and coworkers. This has been described as a “head-down” job. This position pays between 16 - 18 per hour. If you have student loans or other kinds of debt and have high rent, you’ll want to take a second job. Cost of living in Seattle is high and wages do not keep up."
bad,"I have been at my location for about 3 years now and was awarded customer service all star in 2015, I am a veteran of the store. Though I have been there for so long I do not get prioritized for shifts or anything. If anything I am the one that has to fill in all the odd hours from the week. Also the management only cares about singing customers up fro credit cards. No matter how the employee does it. There have been many incidents where customers felt very uncomfortable and forced into signing up. The ill morals of the management goes to the team as well. If you do not sign people up for credit cards the managers tend to almost harass you until you sign up a customer for their credit cards. I constantly feel that I am not good enough for them when ever I work. I am also not the only one who feels like this."
bad,They all always hire new people and you never know what type of people who you talk to or interact . Salespeople are selfish and creepy at most times.
bad,"It's a great place to work if you don't mind working both weekend days and excess OT during peak times, July to August and October till Christmas. Good money to be made."
bad,I choose not to review past employers. I don't feel this is helpful when trying to focus and concentrate when looking for other employment. This takes up way too much time.
bad,"The company puts the customer first, which is a good practice but eventually leads to neglect of the actual employees. The company rarely listens to employee feedback and the ""open-door policy"" does not help at all. It is a good job experience-wise, but management is the deal breaker. Its hit or miss but I have found a lot of stores to be very mismanaged."
bad,"The managers expect the impossible, I worked at nordstrom in the women's shoes department for a few months. It was a very good learning experience as i was able to deal with many customers and learn about how the customer always comes first.It was also nice working in commission because i was able to determine my own salary depending on how much sales i did. I left because the hours became too much with school."
bad,I wouldnt say the company itself is bad just the managers. they dont care about the employees and they are so open about it. its a lot of discrimination the rack you have to have a certain look to get promoted i wouldnt recommend as a job maybe seasonal
bad,"No room for advancement. Supervisors only care about themselves. Nobody is in the right position, they're only in the role for a paycheck. Only good thing is the benefits."
bad,This is a productive job. I have worked in every dept. some dept is physical. A typical day at work sometimes can be challenge. The hardest part of this job is making incentive.
bad,"I came to this location looking forward to an amazing experience but I was sorely disappointed. "
bad,Nice team members but a bad company if you work really hard all the time to get a promotion. Just good for a temporary job in college or part time position.
bad,"I liked the discount and my co-workers were nice. Culture was cut-throat and the HR and management seemed unqualified in their professions, mostly because they were promoted from other roles and they lacked training. The time off and benefits were minimal, but typical for retail. Sometimes the higher up leaders don't listen to the people who aren't part of the family or inner circle. Very political."
bad,"It could have just been the Nordstrom I worked at, but it was not a good place to work. They put you on the job and expect you to know exactly what you're supposed to do within a few days. My managers were awful, and I had anxiety attack every day. It was extremely unhealthy, and I would define it as a hostile work environment."
bad,"80% of employees are absolutely miserable but with limited retail positions in Nashville, you are given little choice. The company at a corporate level is absolutely fantastic! They truly do care about their customers and employees. Unfortunately, lower management is promoted based on sales volume rather than leadership skills; this transcends to poor relationships with department managers and an overall toxic work environment. During my tenure, I experienced managers prioritizing self-advancement before their team members, and even ‘stealing’ sales from sales associates. The store itself is a revolving door of employees. New hire classes are held every two weeks to address the high turnover rate. If you are considering applying here, run."
bad,"It is very confusing working for the company. It was expressed to us that hours would be posted however we would have a change in the schedule or late schedules at times. Training and Assistance with certain devices or items are not expressed by management, however i was able to adjust. if you are able to adapt quickly with little training this is an easy job. However it would be more professional if management would manage."
bad,"Treated like a child, even when I was the highest performing employee at the studio.  Management does not have any repercussions for their actions and poor management of their teams."
bad,"Not a fun place to work..."
bad,company will not have your back if you are innocent in a situation. they are more concerned about their own.  very unorganized.  many post conditions are unsafe and unethical and it is clear that they are not as concerned about the well being of their employees.
bad,Good company great place to work and  grow skills. Also great culture  of diversity in workforce. Love the  job would  be a good spoke person if I ha d the lane
bad,Need more carts for people who have to pull from other banks don't have to carry heavy totes back to their banks most trainers were willing to help but a few need to remember why their in that piston in the first place
bad,management was rude and did not value employees. employees complained about not being paid enough. commission was unfair. schedules were okay but not the best.
bad,"Pros include positive work environment, engaging managers, good opportunities to sell, flexible and accommodating schedule."
bad,"The pay was good but they were constantly raising the quotas and expecting more and more from everyone. I worked at a makeup counter. One month they would say we needed to focus on selling our specific line of makeup. If someone wanted a different line of makeup, we needed to pass that customer along to the worker at that counter. The next month they would say we weren't selling enough of other lines' makeup. And we kept having events that we would have to cold call customers asking them to buy things. Our jobs were constantly threatened if we didn't meet quotas or sell enough things during the events/cold calling. I would never want to work there again. It was very overwhelming."
bad,"If you want a career in Retail and tow the company line, Nordstrom is the same as any other retail store.  "
bad,Nordstrom focuses on customer service. The customer is always right and they come shop with us because we understand by training how to take care of their needs.
bad,"If you have a very good manager as in 2015 - everything is wonderful.  But when Logistics and Store Management changed in 2016 - life is horrible.  The Logistics management is the worst I've worked with in 40 years of retail.  There is zero support, assistant came in with zero knowledge of logistics.  When a ""team"" is small everyone needs to be willing to work.  The people taking 2 hour naps are not being held accountable and the others are being blamed for slow work."
bad,"A typical day will start out at 9:30 am and go until 6:00 pm. Have a few brow waxes, sell the line. I learned not to let management walk all over me and to stick up for myself. I was promised a job and they gave it to someone who had no idea what she was doing and hadn't been building up a clientele for the last 6 months. As soon as she started the position our clientele disappeared and she drove customers away."
bad,"Nordstrom excels at providing an atmosphere in which people can thrive, as long as they stay sales people. There are ample opportunities for career advancement, but no consistent guidance to make sure that everyone is on the same page. This leads to many people being told contradictory messages at multiple levels of the company."
bad,"I honestly don't have anything good to say besides saying that the Christmas paychecks were beyond amazing, I loved having hour lunch breaks and our discount was pretty nice."
bad,"My time working here was great i have went through so many changes, I feel like it is an awesome company to work for. only if you have the support from your management team."
bad,"Provided training was as good as it can be while still remaining fiscally responsible as a company. Quickly became clear the position burns people out constantly and is not a good fit for many applicants."
bad,"It is a good company to work for but the people who work the hardest and do the most for the company don't get paid what they deserve and the people who work the least amount go on without ever being reprimanded.  Managers don't want to hear or believe anything that is going on that is wrong and people who are ""shady"" never get in trouble."
bad,"Nordstrom is a great company overall to work for! But depending on which location your at can have its cons and pros! Wauwatosa, WI is the worst Nordstrom!! We barely had anything our customers wanted! Customers wanted big designer in the store and was upset and would go to Chicago Nordstrom! (Lost many customers because of this) we do to much extra work we don't get paid for! By the way it's a Commission job so it's very cut throat and competitive! It gets to the point where mangers are taking customers even coworkers! During the summer it's so dead it's ridiculous! Only time you see what you really worked for is anniversary sale and Black Friday! The sales goals and open credit card accounts goals are not realistic!!!! How can we have $2,000 as a sale goal when we are overstaffed with only 3 window shopping customers?! To sum it all up it's a Eat or get ate job!"
bad,"Not good pay, competitive environment, Million dollar seller has issues with competition. A lot of collusion between managers and female employees. The million dollar seller seemed to have control over managers because of her status. I would not recommend working at this location."
bad,"The owner was terrible. raises didn't happen. There were no lunches or breaks. The manager was amazing, but the owner restricted a lot of potential growth."
bad,"Not an easy job. Employees in sales are pushed to sell hard but the return possible makes it EXTREMELY difficult to make money there. If you sell $1200 worth of merchandise and up to 1 year later someone decides to return it, even after it has been worn, then you to have to take the return or try to sell them somthing else so you dont lose the commission. I would have customers buy clothes, wear it and bring it back a year later and I would have that commission taken out of my next pay check. You can try to sell them something of equal value or more so you dont lose the $ but a lot of times they will return it in a different department to avoid you and someone else will take the sale. Your first few months you can make good $ but eventually the returns will hit you hard. At least 1/3 of what you sell or more gets returned. "
bad,"Great company, but you are simply not paid enough. Nordstrom prides themselves on promoting from within but when you are in management you are not compensated enough to grow with the company. I wanted to build a lifelong career when I started, and now I am eager to find something that pays more and has more work/life balance. "
bad,"Honesty, I feel like if I worked at a Nordstrom at a different location, this probably would have been a better experience. However, management is terrible, they're rude, they don't practice what they preach, change scheduled hours randomly without informing you, and not only that, there is nothing about team and development worth convening yourself. However, holiday season and the paychecks are amazing and the only time I felt I could outweigh the cons (plural) with the pro (singular). There aren't even benefits until you have worked for the company for a significant portion of time, but its rare they will give you full time status to reach that goal quickly, unless you have disclosed medical info in which you need to meet it. You also need to keep a certain amount of hours to keep that."
bad,"The company has great ideas, and the direction it wants to go is good for their clients. Its a culture that revolves around a means well, dresses well type of hierarchy, but lacks actual character. The most enjoyable thing about working at the Rack was being surrounded by the products coming in, and out of the stores, also building close knit relationships with fellow sales associates, since we had opened with that same store. Soon after opening the store, I became more aware of the culture and how management wasn't stable in keeping a reliable person in charge. I strongly felt that as a sales associate for this company it was a great title to have but short lived compared to the reality, of the culture. I also did not want to grow with a company that seemed to change the people who are so indebted to the cause, that their ethics, and morals become distorted, and they treat workers down the cycle less than."
bad,"Management was unfair and did not work with school scheduling. Schedule was never correct. Never spoken to about my career path. Felt like management did not care about employees. "
bad,"To be fair, this is the experience of a software developer, not someone in retail, so the perspective isn't the same for all of Nordstrom."
bad,"I went into Nordstrom right after I graduated college. I have been selling shoes and was under the impression I would make a good salary and have opportunities to advance in the company, neither have come true for me. "
bad,Management not organized creating tension between sales associates. no gratitude for employers budget cuts right before christmas
bad,"My daily expectations at work are servicing every customer who walks in as best I can and to maintain the sales floor. I am also expected to make phone calls outreaching to my customers letting them know about the newest items and promotions. I have learned how to wardrobe, add on items, and build lasting relationships with clients confidently. The atmosphere between coworkers can be trying at times because all customers are serviced by the first person that sees them and sometimes people will end up with multiple clients while others a servicing none. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a work life balance, the weekends and late nights make it hard to have a social life. I absolutely love creating relationships with customers. I have learned so much from the experience of others and I find it incredibly rewarding to put a smile on someones face."
bad,"I already did a review of this."
bad,Great company but management has NO consideration for work/life balance. If you have another job they overwork you. I barely get a day off and completely overworked and overwhelmed. The pay is okay seeing as though if you make $12.70 an hour your really make $10.70 cause taxes eat you up! They could value their employees more and management could be a lot nicer and more organized!
bad,"long hours expected to come in on day off in stock no room to advance and are considered bottom of the barrel, get there at 4am go home at 3pm and days off never consecutive always split"
bad,"Commission pay, often overstaffed for expected business."
bad,"There needs to be alot of improvements starting with management, it is very difficult to move up in the company. Unless you are considered as a managers pet. Trying to balance your life and work is very difficult to plan things due to working more than usual."
bad,"Due to constant change - it is very difficult to get things accomplished at Nordstrom.com. There has been an incredible amount of turnover - changes in leadership as well as rank and file."
bad,"A typical day was going through your client book registry and finding a client that i have not contacted so you can sell her skincare."
bad,"Great coworkers and a fast paced environment."
bad,"polishing shoes, cash sales, helping customers find shoe size and products in shoe department.  I learned how to make transactions and do returns/exchanges.  My coworkers were helping but most managers were either late to work or not there at all.  The hardest part of my job was fitting in overnights (such as inventory night and markdowns) into my schedule with school.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the feeling of satisfaction you get when you help a customer and they leave the store happy."
bad,"Working at Nordstrom for 4 years, is ok. In this economy it is hard to get customers in and the expectation here is unrealistic, a typical day at work is trying to sell to customers pretty much. Its good for students living with parents pay is up and down and you have to deal with other workers being sharks on the sales floor. I would say thats the hardest part dealing with other ppl taking this job too seriously. Management is OK not the best HR hires you then your on your own, if you want to move up u really just have to be a yes ma'm, yes sir, that is the only way to move up in this company. The most enjoyable part is developing friendships with fellow co workers who are on the same page as you. Overall can't make a living on this type of job because of how up and down the economy is and they put expectations on you that are not realistic, if not they write u up and your job is in jeopardy. This is coming from someone still with the company so trust me. I have seen a lot of ppl come and go because its not what they thought it was. I warn them always do not give up your dreams keep striving for something bigger. You can get caught up in the commission sales and lose touch with what real then you become old and unhappy like i have seen a lot of the older folk there, so whoever is reading this you have been warned."
bad,"Its a very clean and charismatic place to work. Again, its great for a college student and for a part time position. However, Nordstrom does have a high turn over rate with employees."
bad,"The workplace at nordstrom was a learning experience. A typical day would consist of stocking the floor with merchandise,sales and cleaning. From greeting every customer that walks in the department to just have a friendly conversation"
bad,"Okay for students and retired adults, but a headache as a career. The customers are rude and inconsiderate. The managers do not value employees. The store manager is biased to customers and will always bend the policy for customer satisfaction and will make you look like you don't know the policy or the products. He creates his own rules just because ""he"" doesn't like something. No one truly works as a team at this place."
bad,"Not the best work/life balance. Very numbers driven. They only care about the bottom line. When I look back at my retail career this was the worst place. Nordstrom used to be great but it had lost its identity. Now it follows the trend of other stores and doesn't set any trends. It's a shame, it used to be a great company."
bad,"Heavy favoritism with lots of drama, but the pay is outstanding if you can put up with the culture of that building. Unless you are in with the right ppl you can do nothing right in their eyes."
bad,"Nordstrom is a place that is only fun to work for maybe the first 2 months. After that your main worries are managers constantly breathing down your back, a fake fun culture, a cliquey environment, and a sub-par employee discount.  They work to make things worth your while, but in reality that company does not care about your complaints to management, does not care about other employees making you uncomfortable, and barely cares about your wellbeing as a whole. The only concern is sales, sales and more sales. "
bad,Easy phone interview. Easy in person interview. Need to pay attention to your daily numbers. This is a great seasonal job for someone trying to save a lil money or buy a car or down payment on something.
bad,"Based on the current conditions at Nordstrom, I would NOT recommend anyone joining the Ross Park store   Management at this particular location is terrible"
bad,"Lots of potential here, but it's in the hands of the wrong people (in Technology).  Not sure current execs know, see, or care to do anything about it."
bad,"Nordstrom cuts hours if your not management. I averaged 30-33 hours a week but hours can get cut to 25-27 hours a week. Making it impossible to get benefits ( PTO, Health Insurance) if certain hours aren’t meet."
bad,"I worked for Nordstrom in several locations and while my review does not reflect all management, favoritism is a huge problem and political promotions."
bad,If you were in management they worked you to death.You were required to do way too much.There is a serious burn out in the retail world and I would not recommend it.
bad,Nordstrom was ok however there wasn’t a lot of advancement for others around me.  Nordstrom can be fun at times and then there’s plenty days you are there looking for another job
bad,"Nordstrom rack provides a nice part time job but is not ideal for a full time career. the managers are not considerate and show favoritism. requesting time off is a hassle and they are not accepting to schedule modifications. This is a not a good job if you are a student, the hours leave you no time to study. it also takes forever to accumulate vacation time"
bad,Employees are catty and dramatic. Sales are extremely competitive due to lack of customers which can create an uncomfortable work environment. Standards are set extremely high and most of the time so high to the point it does nothing but stress you out.  Employees like to say we are a team etc but actions prove otherwise.
bad,nothing to say.......... company does not tell you upfront about work life balance. it's made to get employee excited but not helpful once employed. Promises that were made did not happen
bad,Most managers are rude and treat you like a number. They let their job title get to their heads. i strongly believe that Nordstrom is a good company but they need to train their managers peoples skills.
bad,"I worked for the Nordstrom company in NYC and the company is okay I guess but its the management that needs improvement. They aren't organized and because of it makes it hard for the rest of the staff. The managers are also rude (Not all of them). They are too comfortable  with speaking to the staff in a rude or sarcastic way. They don't appreciate the workers  as much as they say they do. Also when their bosses come to do a walk they change their approaches.  They also drive the staff crazy when its time for their bosses to do a walk, because they over work the staff to pick up the slack in order to pass their walks. They become very helpful to the staff and speak with positivity and motivation when their bosses are there as well. Not all the managers are this way there are a select few. The workers are also unhappy. They need better leaders who make the workers feel happy or content with being at work. I think its a great company I just think the store I was working at wasn't the best."
bad,"I was constantly told I wasn't moving fast enough and that quality didn't matter as long as we got it done, I was told that I was going to be fired before my season ended so I decided to quit early."
bad,The pay was great but it was very competitive. You work basically on comission and have to deal with the Sharks so to speak. Everyone is there to look out for themselves and have the highest sales of the day.
bad,I worked for Nordstrom Product Group for 4+ years. I was never able to advance my career as a designer. I was never rewarded for my hard work. I always tried to create efficiencies and was usually met with resistance. Often times people talked down to me. There were a few great people there who rooted for me but for the most part is was a negative environment. I never understood why they didn't foster their talent. It always seemed like they were looking for outside people. My favorite part about working at Nordstrom was all of the friends I met. They helped me through the hard times. I ended up leaving the company after 4 years. I still have PSTD with how I was treated and don't have the confidence that I did before starting. After working at the company for a couple months my manager gave me a really terrible review. It wasn't during review season and it seemed to come out of nowhere. I know I was doing a great job in the position. It seemed like a personal attack. I would be careful before accepting a position.
bad,They dont tell you at hire that you have to call in e veryday to see if your working.your sent home early alot i worked there 2 months never ever got hours
bad,"U May love shopping there and u think the money is worth it it’s not.... catty coworkers, entitled customers, and the hours are so long for no reason. Management is very poor."
bad,"Customer service, sales, distribution of cash drawers, provide work direction to staff, inventory, Loss Prevention, return approval, resolving customer complaints and sales floor merchandising."
bad,"I was a barista and only worked part time. However, the hours and the pay are horrible. For the time Nordstrom expects you to work, I felt I was not compensated fairly. If you want time off do not bet on it."
bad,"Dedicated worker for 7 years.  Never called out, and always wanted more hours.  They do not give you enough hours to pay bills. Management always takes sides of the customers - not supporting employees."
bad,"As the only male in a female-dominated office, there was little room for advancement - there was a lot of back-biting in the office when I was there - some co-workers climbed over me and did not help in my development"
bad,"I have worked in cosmetics for several years advancing my way into management and artistry as my talent grew.  I understand how to run a business and create a nice atmosphere to work in.  The cosmetic department here was a nightmare.  Older women who were intimidated by young women were just plain nasty and went far beyond healthy competition.  They would steal customers, phone numbers, and talk behind my back.  The management was a joke because they picked favorites and didn't bother to help anyone who needed it.  It was the worst job I ever had and I would not recommend anyone to apply to the cut throat nasty environment of the cosmetics department.  Truly pathetic behavior by predominantly middle aged women."
bad,slow paced unless during holidays. lots of returns. commission based - low pay - too many late days.  Poor work culture due to employees being unmotivated.
bad,The hardest part of the job is making pep. You have to have a average of 70or higher. You get scored on everything you do. Most of it is very unfair!!Not everyone works at the same pace. Most shifts involve working weekends. Would be nice if they could have it so you work every other weekend or have at least one weekend day of. There are shifts like that its based on your ranking in the department not how long you have worked there! Have to be flexible as they call overtime all the time. Management is a joke!
bad,"You are told to treat it as your own business. You have to build relationships with customers. Calling customers for every monthly event was cumbersome. Customer would complain the are being called to often. Walk through traffic has died down making it really really hard to make sales. Home much money you sale will determine how much you will take home on your check. All departments except for Cosmetics, restaurant, logistics, house keeping, loss prevention are Commission Base Pay Only. I was losing money year after year. Making it really hard for my lifestyle. You get hit with returns and they count negative towards your daily sales"
bad,"To be honest the management there is terrible, the only people there that are trustworthy are the close friends you make there, otherwise everyone will stab you in the back."
bad,Cut throat. Mean management. Lack of respect. They don't care about their employees. Experienced discrimination a couple times. Lots of double standards.
bad,There is no direction for the architecture or network groups; work is open ended with little forward movement.  There are multiple projects going on at the same time that step on each other.
bad,"I was the counter manager and the only represenative of the product in a small store. It was very sales oriented. Being I was the sole person to represent our product all of the financial, management, merchandise was my responsability. It was a good learning experience all around."
bad,"Fun workplace"
bad,everyone is super nice and open to help. I really enjoy working there. my co work are very nice and super understand. going to work sometime feels like im going to my second home. the only thing i didnt like was the management and the favoritism
bad,"Management is terrible and they will lie to you every step of the way. If ever any type of mistreatment occurs between you and your manager, they will take the side of your manager."
bad,"was not impressed with how they promote in the company ,its not based on your skills or talents its base on who you know in the company , all the mgrs that i came in contact while at nordstroms were all under qualified"
bad,"very deceiving company to work for"
bad,"No balance between work and personal life."
bad,"Daily inhalation of dust, dust! High pile amounts of dust all throughout the work place and it can badly affect one's health. No open windows for fresh air to circulate. Sneezing, coughing, and germs spread quickly in the work place. The best part of the job is the PTO. (Paid time off)"
bad,Full time hours were drastically cut down to part time without notice. Difficult to grasp once you are out of training depending on if your manager reaches out to you to provide further assistance or not.
bad,"A typical date at work would be checking business and in stock by store/brand and order products in the system, talking with vendors and DCs to control goods to arrive to store for daily business and special occasions. I have learned how to manage buying/planning pre-season and in-season, and how to handle difficult vendors. Management was not that great as they manipulate and change words when coaching employees and the direction was not clear when working on the projects. It is definitely not a friendly or family environment to work with as it is very intense environment. The hardest part of the job was to plan daily routine as there are always urgent matters that need to be taken care of right away on top of daily duties as team doesn't communicate it in a timely manner."
bad,"a typical day would be to clock in get to your station in 5min or less and process shoes. Open Packaging box,take out each shoe box, remove paper/plastic, insert ticket & security tag on each shoe, place it back in the shoe box with a rubber band & into the shipping box then tape it and send it down the lane."
bad,"The company is great because they pride and are based off of Customer Service..working with so many college students the place starts to feel like a college campus rather than a work site. Being that its a commission based job the environment becomes very catty and people start to steal your sales, that can be very frustrating when you are trying to make honest money and wouldn't do the same to them. The manager that I work under is not a good example of what managers should. I was a store manager before I started working at Nordstrom Short pump and i know that as a manager you sacrifice things for the position you have. My managerS do not on the other hand, they will leave the store for the day without there being appropriate coverage in all their departments. Leaving me to have to man 3 different departments alone and get complaints because I couldn't be there when a customer needed me."
bad,"If you like fashion and catering to questionable people, not too bad."
bad,"great, awesome, lovely, best company ever "
bad,"This job was interesting and fun. Be prepared to work in a retail setting and be mindful that you have to ""blend"" in and not stand out as you investigate employees, as well as customers for retail theft. I always enjoyed prosecuting customers for attempting to defraud the company."
bad,Looked for different articles of clothing around the store and assisted customers.
bad,"process merhcandise, help customers, teach and coach team, communicate to your DRM."
bad,"part time base, job helps with organization, and proper goal setting. friendly enviroment, friendly enviroment."
bad,"You have to depend on other people in the company to be honest since it is 100% commission and returns hurt your pay. "
bad,"nice place to work , the pay is good , strong on customer service"
bad,I enjoy managing my team and working and developing new talent. Working with customers one on one is also very rewarding.Although working in a commission based environment can be quite gratifying it is also very stressful.
bad,"One of the things that I have learned from this company after being there for five years, is how to provide great customer service. At this store we go above and beyond for our customers, to ensure that they have a great shopping experience with us as a company. I have learned so many great things working for this company."
bad,"I sold shoes and hated it. I hated the people I worked with and worked for. They all thought they were better than you can reminded you of it daily. They only promote within, which means they have the same idiots working for them for many many years."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of executing the truck of new merchandise and processing it into the back rooms and keeping control of inventory. The management was the weakest division of Nordstrom, with a lack of consistency and authority in place for them to follow. My coworkers were hard working despite the lack of support from the managers. The most difficult part of the job was the physical labor, and maintaining a positive attitude in such a negative atmosphere for all. I enjoyed my schedule, my pay, and the lack of micromanagement."
bad,"the most enjoyable part of the job was dealing on a one to one bases with my clients, sold ladied high fashion appparel, exclisive clothing line."
bad,- typical work day: No two days are alike; balancing between working on the sales floor with the team and back office duties
bad,"Company forever changing all about who you know. Fast work environment, family feel. Not as loyal to their employees as they are to their customers. Fake it till you make it."
bad,"Nordstrom taught me a great deal about receiving and processing multiple types of product. Although sometimes lacking in communication between management and employees, it is a satisfactory employment opportunity that was greatly appreciated."
bad,"It’s horrible now. People are being lied to about their pay and duties. And if you question and don’t do what isn’t under your job description, they’ll cut your hours. Like they have don’t with me. Even after reaching out to corporate. This company is going down hill and it shows. I felt completely ignored. They don’t care about the welfare of their employees anymore. People are trying to get into management or grow further into management but being denied or ignored. Even if that person was requested. Someone who was with the company for 6 years was denied to become an Asst Manager and they gave the position to someone that wasn’t even in the company for 5 months! This company is turning into a huge disappointment. Or at least with what I’ve experienced while being at the Dallas, TX location. And with how the company is slowly starting to go down hill, this should be the time to start treating the employees with respect. Unhappy employees does not bring in satisfied customers!"
bad,"Like many corporations, Nordstrom is always looking for ways to cut costs. Sometimes those cost-cutting measures are at the expense of quality. My job upon hiring relied on skills I wnt to school for and had years of training and practice in. As pressure to cut costs rose, the job my department did was almost completely outsourced to poorly skill individuals making pennies on the dollar overseas. The job of most people in my department then switched to fixing the poor job done by outsourcing and quality control. (which sucked compared to before) this also took less time so hours were cut, which meant benefits were cut, people were laid off and many others then left due to lack of hours. "
bad,Nordstrom was a great stepping stone for me to really get in to depth with customer service. It offered learning and growth oppurtunities in conjunction with a general sense of care and empathy for their employeesan applicants.
bad,"If you like working in fashion this is an okay place to start. You learn about brands and would be proud of the product, but that is it. The money isn't too good, the only reason I mad money occasionally because I worked during Christmas season, and the management isn't good or bad. Job security is lacking."
bad,Working at Nordstrom was fun but not rewarding. People have worked in the company for 30+ years and has been in the same department without promotion. I need to see some growth after a few years at a company
bad,"I gave this company my heart and soul.  I worked very hard achieved a lot when I was there. Finally after years of work I was allowed to go to a promotion program. Which I attended and passed."
bad,This job was great in the beginning. Great pay nice clean environment and a cafe for breaks. But after the first day everything that seemed great wasn’t. You only get 2 10 minute breaks for an 8 hr shift. And mind you you’re walking 8-10 miles every shift. By the time you get out to the break room and get relaxed it’s time to go right back in. Also the pay is great but that doesn’t really matter if you’re not getting any hours. They have called half of the crew off for a whole week and a half. Also you only get paid 2 times a month. And it’s not biweekly pay. I plan on leaving as soon as i have an interview elsewhere.
bad,"Worked in NPG. The most common complaints are poor compensation as you grow/take on more and little opportunity for advancement. In-seat promotions are not allowed, so you can only advance if there's an opening to apply for (someone leaves), there isn't already someone on that particular team they want to promote, and they focus on hiring internally. You may end up ""continuing to grow in your current role"" to the point of outgrowing it, and your salary won't budge much as you wait."
bad,"I find that the Nordstrom workplace is very clean , organized and cared for . As well as safe and secure. But the job its self has the rule of no sitting or leaning on the job. The workers have to take many stairs everyday just to enter the store. Because of the percentage of commission, the environment between co workers are very aggressive for a customer."
bad,The pay is good but nothing else about this job is. Someone can literally walk right out the door with stolen items and you can do NOTHING about it. The management is horrible and everyone is just plain messy. They say that my job is soo much more but all I can really do is stand at the door and push carts for 8 hours because they will question and make a big deal if I do something else. VERY stressful environment with annoying re-sellers.
bad,"They overwork you for limited pay. It was great in the beginning they told you about all the things they do for their employees but in the long run they do absolutely nothing. It’s really upsetting. As service experience all they do throughout the store is dump their problems on you, making the job that much more difficult, if you are to bring this to the attention of managers of departments or store managers they brush it off. Definitely not a good place to work."
bad,"If your looking for a company with a good loss prevention program this is definitely not for you. The policy's and equipment are severally outdated. The company just went from undercover agents to full uniform security. This means you stand at the door all day. You are responsible for securing and arming the building at night. Some locations there are hundreds of doors you have to lock. It is a big responsibility for such a low paying position. There is almost no advancement in loss prevention. Often times if you are required to stay 2 or 3 hours past your schedule then come back 5 hours later. "
bad,The culture is pretty good and you can do okay with commission.   Minimal benefits and very hard to take your PTO due to blackout dates that are every month and poor work life balance.
bad,"They had a lot of workers that didn’t do anything and favoritism was very obvious. To advance or move different departments you had to know somebody or be in good Graces, had not much to do with your work ethic"
bad,"Very slow pace, no room for advancement unless you have experience or have been there for years or have degrees. They would not let me change my schedule so I quit. They did not want to work with me or compromise changing my schedule. They literally ignored my request to change my schedule. They have great benefits and overtime during the holidays. However not the ideal place for a black man to thrive or move up. The lunches were very short. My co-workers were very judgmental. I felt like I did not fit in. My manager was great at telling me were I stood with stats and my performance. Their security monitored me heavily which made me feel uncomfortable and not trusted."
bad,"I got paid great at the rack but I got extremely tired of the constant gossip between managers/coworkers. A lot of drama. They work with your hours and can be flexible but was not worth it to me with the carelessness that went on between everyone working at the store. At orientation they made it seem like the environment was amazing but once you started working there rules changed fast and enforced greatly for no reason. A lot of employees smoked weed on the property and drank. Management did nothing about it. There were a lot of rumors going around of me and another male employee at the store that was extremely unprofessional that made me resign and look for other work. Again, pay is very well but atmosphere is very stressful. Just the thought of going back to work there is very stressful. This is the store in the Belmont shopping area in Lancaster, PA."
bad,"Everyone that works here is rude and clique-y, especially the managers. My manager basically told me to figure out how to do the job myself and let her know if I had any questions afterwards."
bad,"Under paid employees and big turn over rate is high. the hardest part of the job is dealing with rude managers, but overall good food and cool environment"
bad,There was a lot of unfair favoritism and no room for advancements. great in terms of dealing with customers but but not a lot of advancement opportunities.
bad,Nordstrom was a cool job to start but the unfair advancement of unqualified coworkers was what drove me away they like to play favorites. I wasn’t okay with this so I left the company after being promised a higher position an not receiving it
bad,i left Nordstrom after burning out from working 70 hours a week for a month. these hours were mandatory and we had employees passing out from being overworked.
bad,"you must have a strong desire to sell and if you enjoy fashion and assisting others, you will enjoy working at Nordstrom.  Training is a little on the light side but you will learn immediately on the floor as the pace can be fast and furious."
bad,"it was ok but stressful, people would steal your sells and it being commission it really hurt the pay checks a lot. so people were always quitting. it was petty and clique like as well."
bad,"Nordstrom  tells all employees that this is a great place to work and its family first and that they are working for the employees.  However, the employees are being overworked and exhausted due to the amount of OT they are mandated due to them not hiring enough employees based on the volume of work we have.  We need to have well rested employees.  Employees that are exhausted now are going to be even more exhausted come our busy season which hasn't even begun yet.  They need to get their acts together and pay more attention to the employees including their leaders.  Their leaders work their butts off but make less than the employees during mandated OT which is all year at this point.  THey need to look at raising the salaries of their leadership to accommodate for this or they will lose really good leaders."
bad,Great place to work to start a fashion career. Learn about brands and retail environment. A lot of support from different team members. Fun and entertaining.
bad,"I had several roles while employed here. I never found my fit. The pace of the full line store is extremely slow. The job is commission based and at times the goals are completely unobtainable. Be prepared to make cold-phone calls every month if not more than that."
bad,"Large company, to big to truly take care of its employees. Good part time job, in between careers place holder job. Most young people in love with retail benefits often work for clothes."
bad,"I learned a lot about shoes, merchandise in general, how to help a customer, the everyday scene at Nordstrom is nice, can be hectic with a lot of customers on special events, good job if its your first."
bad,This office has shady hiring practices and a lot of in office politics. Supervisors pick favorites and nobody is loyal. They will fire you in an instant for even minor indiscretions. They think they own you. They have no problem cutting your hours for business needs and they have no problem assigning mandatory OT with very little notice during busy times. It's very difficult to be promoted internally even though they tout themselves for doing so.
bad,"I believe that it was all about timing.  Because I opened the first Nordstrom in Hawaii.  Nordstrom hired a lot of people and laid off 1/3 within the first 2-3 months.  The expectation back then for employees were to dress a certain way which was out of my budget. The work hours were some times not worth the gas, traffic and time."
bad,"The competitive environment doesn't create a enjoyable place to work. You are made to feel like you are pitted against each other.  The company overall isn't for their workers.  You are not compensated for working hard, but only if you number one in the company."
bad,"Stock team is responsible for unloading, unpacking and  markdown's, corrections. And bringing all items out to the floor. You are also timed and very seldom receives help from the sales team.  I felt that management was very ""clickish"" and I didn't feel appreciated.  Stock does most of the work with little compensation."
bad,another than in and out management. its a nice job to move up in sales with. great for college students. The job easy to learn and the customer had they days.
bad,"I worked for nordstrom for 5 years and im not sure why.  Let me first say that it is my fault for going to a very expensive school and majoring in communications.  I graduated when the economy collapsed in 2008 and imedeatly just felt thankful to even have a job at all.  While here I met some of the most amazing people and made some of the best friends in the whole world.  I loved the social aspect about working at Nordstrom.  If you move to a new city or you are just bored working here part time would be great.  You can become addicted to working here there are times such as christmas where you will make so much money you almost can't believe it.  Then there will be time when you have to ask your parents for help with rent.  It is run much like a place for children.  There is loud pop music, chanting, and clapping in the mornings at 9am.  I am"
bad,Nordstrom takes pride in providing excellent customer service. A great place to work and for those who know how to please the guest.
bad,Management is unable to recognize talent both in their teams and in choosing assistant managers.  Sorority mentality when picking management for promotion.  Great culture however management doesn't praise teams when they exemplify that culture.  Pay is average for job category.
bad,"I was a tailor/fiter. All you hear is Productivity,Productivity, Productivity. Points, points,points! Faster, faster. 10 min on a suit , pant fitting, 15 min for a dress. Nobody cares that customer wasn't ready - (standing in front of the mirror by the time you came) or decided to try another dress for you to see! Forget it ! And if she decided that she needs shoes ( and you definitely need them if it long gown) , sales person have to go downstairs to get the right shoe size and heel size. But for some reason it always wrong heel size even if you give them the ruler to take with them ... It looks like they are all from the same school... AND...if the customer will realize that she needs a bra... OMG!!!!!! People from lingerie department start bringing all these bras, girdles and cups... Another 20-30 min are taken.. Than you start your fitting. You take care of the customer while manager writes a note how unprofessional you are spending too much time and losing productivity not only for yourself, but for the whole shop!! If you tapered suit, hammed pants, took it in, shortened sleeves, shorten collar - it's too much - you are considered unprofessional !!!! You had to give customer suit that fits him perfectly. But what are sales people for? Aren't they trained to chose the size for a customer? How many times they fought with me that ""That's the size"" . If it's the only suite in stock, don't promise to the customer that we can resize it. We can't. Not because we are not able to, because it's the policy :""Fit first!"".  But what if customer is broad-shouldered? Of course, we have"
bad,If they did not have a commision only enviroment would be great
bad,You are expected to do a million things and it becomes hectic when your also working in the shoe department.
bad,"organizing clothes, taking care of costumer needes, answer phone, maintaining department clean."
bad,"Nordstrom's benefits are typical of any retail company - average pay for the role, average medical and a discount on merchandise. But while Nordstrom has a reputation for innovation - they are still behind the times. They are trying to innovate, become more agile and adapt - but they have a long way to go. I don't trust the Executive leadership - and I have seen a lot of turnover during my time employed here - both voluntary and in-voluntary!"
bad,"Your never standing still , your always on the move being productive, you have to be alert and pay attention because the smallest error can become a big one."
bad,"Terrible managers, bad hours, just not a place I would want anyone to work at."
bad,"It's all about numbers, other than that they could care less about anything else!  Also it's hard to succeed there with other employees who have been there long before you having a feeling of entitlement.  If you don't hand over a sale they will stir things up and try to get rid of you.."
bad,Spa- hourly compensation + commission + tips= could be good if the business was there.
bad,Department Store GM oversaw restaurant. He didn't know anything about restaurant operations. Required F&B managers to attend store sales meetings where we learned what tie went with what shirt.
bad,"Was excited to work for a well established company. A very prestigous place to work. However, management is not so great. Management is young and a little inexperienced. They expect a lot and help with very little. Sales Goals are set very high. I asked to move to another line where I thought that I might be more successful and was not given a chance."
bad,Working on th sales floor at Nordstrom is like working for free. It is a commission based payscale so depending on your sales and/or returns you can have a $200 paycheck for two weeks of working or during the busy season which is July- December you can have a $1200 bi-weekly check. Honestly it's not worth the stress..
bad,I have worked in and around the retail industry within luxury department stores during my entire career and I would not recommend this employer to anyone.
bad,"75% of customers who come in have huge Karen energy, they come in hot and if you don’t bend the rules for them they want to speak to your manager. Managers give them what they want which makes them come in often expecting they can basically do whatever they want. You might make your sales goals but returns are out of control which makes it difficult to actually hit quota aka get a decent paycheck. Paychecks can range from $400 to $1600 for me which makes it impossible to save"
bad,"It was overall a good job, the management was what made the job unpleasant. They were lazy, there was favoritism with certain employees and there’s barely any room for growth! (well there is but you will not get paid for it)"
bad,As my father as diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and dying within days they wouldst give me the necessary time to go see him for some unknown reason.....
bad,"I’ve worked for the company for many years. As a sales associate and management. Management acts like high schoolers, it’s all gossip and politics. No matter how much you care about your position / work hard. It’s all about who’s butt you’re kissing. Once upon a time it was a great company to grow into, learn retail / business skills. It was also a great place for creatives and visuals to work and express our creativity, network ect. They no longer care about those things. Also they barely train ADM’s and sales associates anymore..... it’s customer based but they don’t care about their employees. Also you see a slim picking of colors in management. Especially after the “company reconstruction” I will say if you need a FULLTIME job to take care of bills or family DO NOT work here full-time."
bad,"I worked as a beauty on call associate. Hours get cut during the slow months even if you're a manager or top seller. Not reliable to pay your bills, demanding goals to hit. But i did learn more about makeup and products and work with some amazing people. I just think nordstrom should do as much for their employees as they do for their customers."
bad,"I somewhat enjoyed working at Nordstrom, however I concluded that retail was not the best fit for me. I mainly enjoyed working with customers. I did not like the fact that employees were only paid based off of commission. It was a very diverse work place and I loved working with coworkers."
bad,its a job not a carrier. I recommend it to someone that doesn't have a lot of bills or kids. the management their was good and uplifting. plus its a good place too meet new people and make new friends
bad,"a great environment but not a lot of room for growth in some departments, smaller departments have less opportunity for growth, less management and encouragement"
bad,"The pay was great but did not like the fact that they worked us overtime for 4 months straight and I don't mind working overtime I like the money, but that was just ridiculous and we only had 2/3 15 minute breaks."
bad,"It was my first sales job with commission. You have to be very experienced in sales to make it here because it is very competitive. It was eye opening experience, fresh out of college."
bad,I would not tell any of my friends to work there unless they did a major management cleaning. other than that it was a decent place to work. most of the people were friendly.
bad,"If you are striving to become an entrepreneur then work your hardest to become management! You will get an in-depth working knowledge of what its like to have your own 'store' when you run a department. You are responsible for every aspect including reaching out to your vendor in your department! It can be exciting and scary at the same time. It's unfortunate now, however, that the stores have gone fully online. The commission is non-existent for the in-store staff. They have nothing basically to sell. They accept returns all day due to Nordstrom's flexible return policy which is abused. They should now consider going hourly for the staff...I've been a sales associate, a department manager, a cosmetic counter manager and then moved onto online customer service rep due to the flow of biz...There's your clue...."
bad,I Recommend this job to college graduates that want to develop customer service skills. I would consider this job to be survival of the fittest because it is commissions based and your returns do count against your sales. You have to build relationships with people from all sorts of backgrounds to be successful at this job. Must be motivated by money.
bad,"""The customer is always right"" is pretty much how we live by. The worst part of the job is when you work hard and sell a lot to try to make good money in a pay period, then having half of it returned. (The commission you made on the items you sold gets taken away when the items get returned). Upside is the holiday season, the opportunity to sell is there. Sometimes, the fact that Nordstrom is known to go above and beyond for customers undermines you making money when you get stuck with a customer for over an hour, they ask for multiple items in multiple sizes and don't even end up buying anything at the end of it."
bad,cut throat. lots of envyy. unstable salary. long hours standing. rude customers. high sales goals of cold calling and poor management. everyone fighting against each other.
bad,"My stint was seasonal and it didn't last long. There was constant commotion happening in order to pack items for online customers. Everyone worked together to get it all done in time. I learned to wear the right shoes for work and not flip flops. Seriously, my first day in and no one told me but an old lady who worked in jewelry did.  2.5 Stars"
bad,You wont have a summer or a Christmas while working here as thats when they have their two big sales and they mandate over time. You get all kinds of OT and then when there is no sales lots of times they flex you off and you get no hours.
bad,"The pay varies depending on the department you work in, but I do not think it's worth working the job due to the lack of good management and difficulty getting promoted."
bad,"I learned a lot from working at Nordstrom, such as improving upon my skills as being a team player and being flexible. I loved helping mentor and onboard new members to the team. I even was able to assist in facilitating in trainings as well as making the documents other educators used to train new employees. It was my dream job for the first 2 of my 4 years working there and the pay was exceptional. It all changed when management wanted to become more money focused and it seemed less and less like they cared about their employees. Once this change occurred morale went way down and the shockwaves of said change were felt throughout the call center. Lots of opportunities to get involved in projects and career advancement though. I loved that they tried to promote from within as much as possible first."
bad,Not a good place to work as a sales associate on commission if you are part time. You have the same sales goal as full-time employees which quite obviously is not fair.
bad,The company call center is being ran by a lot of immature people with bad attitudes. The building is beautiful and the customers love the product. With the right leadership this company could be amazing!
bad,"Excellent job to have while you're in school or simply have other, more important duties in which only require you to sustain a part time job."
bad,"I worked at the call center in Colorado.  Very high turnover rate.  I started in January with another class before me and another after. They hired about 30 people.  After 8 months there were about 10 or 15 left.  they try and make people work evening and weekends.  They make you change shifts and give you a shift depending on where you rank so unless your in the top 5 percent, you'll probably be working in the evenings and/or weekends.  They have good benefits.  The nordstrom customers were nasty sometimes.  With the exception of the scheduling department, the Managers were helpful."
bad,They were always under staffed in the hub and was treated very poorly by management. Was cursed out on several occasions. Job is only great if you're willing to kill yourself at the entry level positions.
bad,"A typical day would consist of overseeing the receiving bay employees on the trucks to make sure they cargo was being unloaded correctly and efficiently. Also I would help answer customer related calls about orders etc, as well as assist with creating maintenance request that needed to take place. Overall the co-workers were ok but definitely could have been better in terms of work ethic, and being punctual to meet productivity timelines. The hardest part of the job I would say is working with the less reliable employees and having to pick up their slack. The most enjoyable part of the job is by far the hours, being able to work late at night and get off early in the morning."
bad,very good place in retail to work but very unorganized and hard to really have stable pay
bad,The store was sometimes slow which means your paycheck will be based on hourly. Mangers was cool not all of them! Everyone experience is not the same personally I wouldn’t go back.
bad,"It was a job an I did the best to my ability. I met good people an networked alot around the company. "
bad,There was a large lack of communication between management and workers.  Schedule was not clear. Was not in the position I was hired for.  Hired for seasonal and told it would go through the end of the year but was let go after the anniversary sale.
bad,"Working for Nordstrom was OK,  what mean is that i love the fashion & the discount around the Christmas holiday. But Not for me, there was no room to grow in my dept. so i reach my rise cap fast  but wasnt able to build a career.  I learn lots enjoyed the ppl that work there& the customers"
bad,Nordstrom has the opportunity to be great but management in recent years has become disconnected with staff and the goals just keep coming. Management
bad,"Any attempt to help improve the work, or the environment were considered insubordination. Company seems to micromanage the wrong areas, favoritism is blatant and rampant."
bad,"I worked at Nordstrom FSB for over 5 years. The compensation was GREAT, however be prepared to have almost no work life balance. The company is 100% dedicated to their customers which is wonderful but customers are very difficult & demanding to work with & for lack of better word VERY spoiled. They are used to getting whatever they want no matter how ridiculous their request is & have ZERO respect for the employees. Prepare to be dehumanized and humiliated by the customers multiple times a day every single day. Management is okay IF you stay on their good side. Really would only recommend for the compensation. Other than that job is not worth it & will literally leave you unhappy and feeling depressed all the time."
bad,"Over the last few years of my employment with this company I am sad to conclude that they have shifted their focus onto pandering to their stock-holders and boosting online sales rather than trying to find and create a balance between internet and in-store profits. Because of this, unless you are looking to make a 'quick buck' and add to your resume, I would not advise trying to build a career through sales experience here. Management has become filled with people who only care about their paychecks and are completely terrified of the prospect of any sort of confrontation. The days of giving amazing, yet reasonable, service at this company are long over and the product retailed here is not bought, it is rented."
bad,Fun Work Place. Great Management DIscounts And great people to work with. Busy seasonal events with great rewards. HR vary help in hiring and great tools to use.
bad,It wasn't a great place to work. thats it thats all. nothing but a number to them. I really don't want to make a review but you guys are forcing me to.
bad,"Not much room for growth, no matter the amount of effort you put in. Seniority is ranked higher than merit. I was in college during this experience and developing myself as a retail and visual merchandising specialist."
bad,"Managers hover/micro manage and what they call ""coaching"" conversations were one sided with no opportunity to give feedback or have voice heard. Scheduling is hard unless you're in school with a fixed class times. Don't expect them to work with you're availability unless they like you or you've been there for a long time. Managers looked down on certain employees, talking behind their backs to other employees, and showing favoritism."
bad,"my love for cosmetics was stripped out by one of the beauty department manager. after being in the industry for 10 years, no one ever managed to make feel miserable at my job... a dark cloud was / is floating about this department. however, if it wasn't for that particular manager, it's a great place to be."
bad,"Poor management, low pay, empty promises. Business tools are glitchy and result in poor client connection. Too much liability on client's behalf to keep personal information safe."
bad,Their quotas are impossible to meet. Their trainers weren't very good. I did like the workplace culture and a lot of good people work there. But a big issue I had was with the breaks. It took me 10 minutes to walk to the break room so I could only sit down for 5 minutes.
bad,not good overall. really would not suggest to anyone. commission based and retail is dying. Nordstrom is like high school all over. nothing good really comes of it.
bad,Depending on who your manager is will make or break your experience. I had a manager who was awesome and enjoyed my time working hard for the customer. When management changed which is does often the experience was less then desirable.
bad,Hours are available in certain departments depending on your manager. Students do well there because department managers really work with their schedule. You wear a mike during you entire shift and they call you every 10 minutes to help with cashiering guests out and at the location I work at they really take advantage of it. You are responsible for following suspicious customers around during your entire shift if they look like they are trying to steal merchandise and this happens a lot. You are responsible for trying to keep your area clean and running all the items from the fitting room back to your pads. you also have to ring up alteration purchases in the alteration room. They do not tell you any of this when they hire you and as a bonus you get zero training. A very stressful and frustrating work environment.
bad,Very large workplace lots of walking. Picking area is very unorganized and hard to get your pick numbers for the day to satisfactory. it is a state of the art facility very clean
bad,The managers cause unnecessary stress on the employees. The job is pretty simple but can be tedious based on the request of the managers. It can be a bit overwhelming when the store is busy on the weekend. There's usually a lack of employees which will increase your workload.
bad,sales in Nordstrom dadeland are very aggressive. not a fun day to day. didn't enjoy my time there. HR team has there favorites. its all about making numbers not about whats right for the sale
bad,Nordstrom had been a profitable job in sales for many years however the retail world is changing making it nearly impossible to make any money. After the manager had it out for me I needed to go else where bc she made it clear that she did not like me. All in all it does not take a rocket scientist to work there pretty easy job as long as you don't mind working with idiots they hire
bad,Its all about if your coworkers like you at this place. if they don't like you then they'll sabatoge your sales opportunities and prevent your growth within the company.
bad,"Good pay, lots of overtime available depending on dept. But management here isn't very good. No consistency between dept with regard to policies, Management is very young and inexperienced. Break times are almost non existent."
bad,"When I first started in 2014, Nordstrom was a great place to work. As the years went by I noticed that the work environment began to get more and more cutthroat. On top of people stealing sales, you have to work twice as hard to make up for your returns. I have had 6 managers in my department and I've just reached my 3 year mark. I was a top seller the past 2 years and I feel appreciated for my hard work. I think everyone is out to get everyone. I am not sure if it is like this at their other locations but stay far away from the King of Prussia location!"
bad,"The pay was terrible. I was a college graduate with over 8 years of retail experience. I was paid as an office assistant; however, I did the work equivalent of a Assistant Buyer."
bad,Online is taking over retail but Nordstrom isn't doing anything to save its actually in store employees. Commission only even though they said there's a base pay.
bad,Was super busy all the time and met some amazing people. I enjoyed having the hours and the experience. It is always a fun place to be. I enjoyed working with some great managers.
bad,Decent wages and benefits. They recently change the way they run the store in Westwood MA at the Nordstrom Rack. Very bad move. Associates not happy.  Management not interested on going back to old system. I am looking to move on. Time for me to leave. Not happy working there anymore.
bad,"The IT teams were set up as AGILE teams, this help with communications,collaboration and team building. Communication was a challenge between Business and Technology."
bad,"I liked working there, I learned a lot but I felt stuck in the same position.The bad thing is Management starting from the Store Manger not friendly only greets employees when she wants and you somewhat have to suck up to Managers to be on their good side. Management needs a lot of Professional Training! They need to learn how to keep Professional and Personal separate.Corporate should really talk to the employees who are on the bottom of the totem pole  and they would really know how their employees are treated by Management."
bad,"This was a very busy warehouse . But kept busy and learn a lot for different departments of this business.Very fun business to work for."
bad,"The kitchen was very small and hard to work in. I also was cooking food and doing dishes, your not encouraged to do both do to cross contamination. Needed some other employees in the kitchen to help so we would not get so backed up."
bad,Clean and casual dress environment. Building is open 24/7 and offers decent pay scale for non-college employees. Benefits are ok and company offers matching 401k and profit sharing program.
bad,"I have always worked with great people, however leadership has been unqualified and a constant lack of communication has been a pain point.  I've enjoyed the people I work with the most, but the hardest part about working here is the inconsistencies in communication and training that cause unnecessary work."
bad,Healthy growth however very harsh environment to grow in. Once you enter the management fields the Nordstrom way is no longer an option. It is played with dirty politics and unfair favoritism.
bad,"Sales of clothing. Great work environment for those that need a flexible schedule. Transferring between locations is easy and readily available, meaning that your job can potentially move with you. "
bad,"Fun and great place to work. Bad place to get hurt and think they will take care of you. The employees and the customers make it worth coming to work. I loved my job at Nordstrom's and I was proud to work there, but when I got hurt by an overload of work, I felt they let me down because I worked very hard for them. It was a sad ending."
bad,"horrible hours, bad management,and overall a bad place to work."
bad,Great company to work for it just depends on the management you have to work under. I was in shoes and my manager was terrible but there were other managers for other departments who were ten times better than my manager.
bad,"You're either in the fitting room, or out on the floor cleaning or putting back clothes that people didn't want in the fitting room."
bad,It is ok. i did not plan a long term career. i was not into it i would not want to go back or sit on the phones all day. very stressful and unhappy
bad,I have nothing good or bad to say about this company. I appreciate my manager and have made a few good friends but it is not a company I would enjoy to move up in.
bad,Do not plan on making a ton of money working off of commission with a nearly empty store or working for a company that relies on its employees to advertise sales and other information that the company should be doing itself.  Prepare to cold call people who will not be happy about it and to beg customers to come in and shop with you.
bad,"Commission based pay, so your paychecks are never consistent. This drives employees to trick customers into buying items they will eventually return. The competition is incredibly tense and causes a lot of friction and catty behavior (even amongst managers). My greatest thought while working there was knowing I was only seasonal."
bad,"This branch has a toxic atmosphere that is eating the store from the inside out. It's a little bit poor morale because none of the good clients are coming anymore (the area it is located in is TERRIBLE), part pay cuts, and mostly the worst managers I've ever seen. Ever. They also make you work 1,000 hours (roughly six months at full time) before you can even start accumulating vacation time at a pitifully slow rate. Supposedly at other larger stores (Tampa, Mission Viejo, Aventura) it is a much different environment, but all I know is that everyone is bailing as fast as they get hired at the Orlando store. Also, the employee discount is pitiful. They have no appreciation for their workers."
bad,Food is actually pretty decent. Everything is made fresh. Would run a lot smoother if it was not controlled by a clothing company who knows nothing about how restaurants operate.
bad,This company is amazing to their customers but horrible to the employees. If youre not selling even if your a few dollars off your goal they fire you
bad,"A typical day at work would be getting out on the sales floor and making sales! the hardest part of this job is getting people to buy the maximum, especially since it is a commission based company. The people I worked with were very friendly and I did build some great relationships here."
bad,"Learning the basics of customer service was good. But I wish the company cared more for the employees also, as any business should. The customer / sales associate relationship should go hand in hand."
bad,"A typical day at work is pretty chaotic.  Always busy helping customers never any down time.  Some department managers are fair and helpful, others take too much time off or are in back not helping their team with anything.  Co-workers are friendly and give good customer service.  Hardest part of the job is the occasional grumpy customer.  Most enjoyable is seeing my co-workers."
bad,"A typical work day includes checking your company email, touching base with personal customers of yours. Walk the sales floor and try your best to connect with customers and provide them with an excellent shopping experience. Dust, organize and fill in stock when you have down time."
bad,The marketplace cafe General Manager micro manages to the level of insanity. She tries to do EVERYONES job and never is able to do her job correct. She constantly lies to cover her incompetence and inconsistency in which she performs her job.  The Chef is a flaming queen who throws a tantrum whenever things in the kitchen don't go smooth. He will scream thinking it makes him look like he is doing his job. He will run to the back before he will help the hot line when they are busy. With the current management team you will be looking for another job after 6 weeks.
bad,"My typical work day was exciting to be at work."
bad,"Not a bad company to work, if you like interaction with customers and fast pace work environments, Nordstrom is a good fit."
bad,"Manager sales rallies in the morning. Employees are informed of company sales and events, encouraged to participate. "
bad,"Typical day set up prepare your sales floor. Co-workers here are the best although a little competitive it helped the day fly by. Management, I hated. They leave little room to succeed. Tell you anything. The hardest part of the job is trying to make your daily sales quota when the store was empty and getting written up for it."
bad,"meeting new faces, establishing new friends, and being a personal shopper to many customers. There is nothing more rewarding than having a client want to shop specifically with you in helping them to update their wardrobes because they value your opinions. I have laughed and cried with these women in a good way. The job came very easy for me after time. I enjoyed the cross-selling aspect as I was able to be more diversified with my clients. Able to serve men, women, and children. The hardest part of this job I would say would have to be the returns. Each return would come back out of your paycheck, therefore the inconsistency of each pay period made it somewhat difficult, so as it goes in retail..the higher your sales, the greater your returns. I am very aggressive, and have a very out-going personality, and would greet 4 customers at a time, taking care of each one patiently, and easily. At times co-workers that were not as quick would frown upon that which at times made my job difficult. None the less, it was a challenge, and I very much enjoyed it."
bad,"I loved the CSR position because it allowed me to be well rounded in the company. Meaning i was able to handle the multi-lined phone calls, making outbound calls, faxing and copying while still having that interaction with clients!"
bad,"While working at Nordstrom and it's little sister store, Nordstrom Rack, it seems as though they only play favorites. If you gossip enough at the store you're liked, but if you do your job and save socializing for the break room or lunch time or even outside of work, you're not liked. There were even people who had just begun working there after I had about a year and a half's experience with the company who would be assistant managers because they would gossip with the store managers. Overall, it felt like High School working there."
bad,"When I started last May, I was sent home with everyone else earlier than 8 hours a day for the whole month. Then in june it was 40 hour days. July was their anniversary sale and it was 9 or 10 hour days, 6 days a week. Then by October it slowed down to 8 hour days, and it slowed to a stop pretty much by January. Now its may of 2019 and I am lucky to get one day of work in and not be forced to go home."
bad,Customers first and task second. Always drop everything  for a customer. The hardest part is working with management but as long as you complete your task and show up on time you should have no problem.
bad,the company generalizes itself to much and does not adhere properly to changing demographic of customers in different areas of the country. alsi need to develop better methods of training
bad,"Del Amo is a beautiful store. If retail is your passion and you don't mind the schedule, this is a great store to work in. You really get what you are willing to put in here."
bad,Nordstrom gave me the opportunity to seek many job positions in my career to further on my education management not the greatest worked a lot of overtime the schedule line was not very accurate in which they pronounce people's names wrong and had them off on the schedule when they were supposed to work the communication was bad and you weren't allowed to talk and you only got two 10-minute breaks
bad,"Nordstrom is a great place to work, but its not the place for me. I want to work for a company that i know i can grow with and a company that appreciates my hard work."
bad,I learned how to stay on my feet for several hours and also constantly be on the move. I enjoyed my job for all the people that were involved and the experience.
bad,"When I first started working here I absolutely loved it. After my immediate manager got replaced I wasn't happy anymore. It takes a lot for Nordstrom to fire people or demote people, especially once someone is in management. They will keep inefficient people in their position as long as the metrics look good on paper."
bad,Management has really gotten worse through the years. I went through 3 managers within a year and there was no hours for me to work. My work was so underappreciated. I wouldn't get a simple thank you for going over and beyond for each task I completed. I loved working there when I first started and now the company is going downhill for sure.
bad,"High turnover because commission pay structure does not work well in a low volume store. Company should compensate employees with a higher hourly wage. When opening, every manager told their story of how quickly they got promoted, but it does not happen that fast. They look at sales instead of management qualities when promoting."
bad,"I learned the most effective ways of providing customer service through watching other professionals and feedback from managers.  The daily sales were somewhat reflective of the amount of effort we put in, although returns have the adverse effect. I got along with all of my co-workers because I really enjoy helping others succeed and building relationships with each person I come into contact with."
bad,"Great company with good benefits. However the management at the Rack's are very unprofessional. They at times threaten the workers jobs and when writing their workers up, they use a lot of terms that sometimes are not true and/or terms that makes issues look bigger than what they are. There are a lot of cool managers who work there, but from my experience, the cool managers either get fired or transferred for some reason. Certain Managers love to play favorites and be very catty towards their staff and towards other managers. Great company but the management is going down hill."
bad,"Honestly it was an amazing experience being able to work closely with the brands I've always loved but the biggest downfall would have to be the stores management skills. "
bad,"One thing I love about Nordstrom is the structure. When you start your day every manager has a red book with daily tasks that we must follow, it gives your day a balance even on the toughest days."
bad,I learned how to train and develop a team of employees. I also learned how to run a successful business. Creating lasting personal relationships with clients and delivering impeccable customer service is my specialty.
bad,Nordstrom isn't really what it claim to be. It's not all smiles and laughter. There are several employers that doesn't work as hard as others but are still being promoted.
bad,Working at Nordstrom was a fun job experience for me. I got to embrace and express my love of fashion as well as meet and make friends with my employees/supervisors that loved fashion as much as I do. The workplace culture was not something I enjoy too much because they did not give you time to really get to know the people you work with and micro-managed very much.
bad,It was a pretty decent place to work but the management is terrible. Many of them played favorites and singled out other hard working employees for their own personal reasons. Management was highly unprofessional and didn't really care about the employees unless they shared some type of personal relationship.
bad,"I would handle the cash and set up the stations for the customer service department for the daily usage. After the initial setup, I would provide help to customers and try to sell them reward programs and credit cards, as well as have them sign up for our email program and inform them of upcoming sales events and call select customers for special events. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers and having them leave with a broad smile over the level of service provided. The worst part was interaction with managers in a demeaning manner."
bad,love working here mangers a lil crazy but overall the pay is great if you are a hard worker such as myself you would do great here if your lazy then just don't apply you will fail
bad,"A typical day at work was restocking merchandise, dusting and redisplay merchanise. Greeting and assisting customers. Operate a cash register."
bad,"So the place is a great place to work at. Not hard work at all. It's very easy to learn the process. You can try different departments to learn more. A lot of cross training. Well... There is good stuff to stay about this place but theres way more bad stuff.  First of all, they say it's 15min breaks buts it's really 10 because they give you 10 mins to be outside and 5mins to walk from the work station and back. They constantly watch those periods and if you're 1 second late they attack you. There's a lot of targeting if you're not one of their ""favorite"". Their system for work progress is trash. They don't count your peices or cases per hour, they count for the time that you've been in each case. Each case has a time that you have to put them away. They make keep track ofevery case and pieces you put away, for no reason. They have a system to keep track of it so it's less productive to do so. More importantly they cut your hours like crazy. Sending people to their homes because they messed up on their budget. It's not our fault but then they send us home putting in jeopardy or biils, food and home. It's not a good company to work for. Honestly you're better of looking elsewhere."
bad,"Start the day with emailing and following up with customers, then its onto the sales floor. Most enjoyable part of the job is teaching customers about the product they are buying."
bad,"Allowed students to learn the retail business in one of the most important jobs in the company - sales. Interns spent time on the selling floor in a specific merchandise area, working  with many levels of management, and gaining exposure to different areas of the retail business. We also work closely with department managers and other interns on assigned projects and attend management meetings and training seminars."
bad,I like assiting and meeting new people. I like helping others.
bad,"Good job to work at very team oriented , goals are normally met , great working environment , would recommend this job to anyone sales and goal oriented"
good,The company is a great company but what's expected from employees isn't realistic anymore. The store doesn't have the merchandise it use to have. Manager doesn't hear the opinion of the employees. They company will only promote eternally if there isn't anyone that the store manager has interview and agreed to hire. I enjoyed working there but there was absolutely no room for growth.
good,I wouldn’t wanna work there again because of management is very bad if the company was ran different it would be a very better place to work and only getting paid twice a month was trouble
good,Unloading new merchandise and displaying it in our department. I worked in the Accessory Department so I had the pleasure of Merchandising the Home Decor.
good,"- fast pace and very compititve "
good,"When a company supports their customers before their employees, they become unstable. Very unethical standards, managing through fear."
good,"Low paid job roles, rude employees and management! Not as rewarding unless you are in sales with a commission incentive. Overall a good store to work, nice things to look at but not much you can afford to purchase yourself."
good,Requires lots of memorization and quick learning of abbreviations. Takes a particular type of person to work here. Not at all for those who learn slowly but thoroughly.
good,While working here it was extremely  unorganized and other workers would constantly steal your sells which means no added pay.Also management was dysfunctional and chaotic.
good,whether your in sales or management your life revolves around your job. there is no work life balance it really is just a work life. they claim to have opportunities for advancement but they will easily let you go
good,"Retail in decline.  Not the best place to work as a counter manager, unreasonable expectations from upper management that does not have proper training, other than high sales.  Upper management has little to no experience in coaching and ethical standards in professional environment."
good,"You are in a sharktank working at nordstrom , the staff is very young very immature , its 100% commission based and the ability to progress in this company is virtualy non existant. I met some life long friends in the company I must say which outweights all the cons. Its definitely a stepping stone company to get your foot in the door in the world of sales."
good,"Nordstrom get's rave reviews for customer service, but you would never know that most of the managers treat staff horribly and outside of the military, one of the few companies that I've ever had a manager get in my face and raise their voice was at Nordstrom."
good,The hardest part of my job is not enough breaks for the hours you standing.
good,"I learned the proper fitting of suits and clothing. The holidays were busy and due to the length of the store hours, there was a lot of no customer time.The management was very transitional and a tremendous amount of turn over. Co workers had been with the company for many years and had a large following of clients."
good,"If you latino don't get job here is a lots discrimination from employers, and customers. The managers have to much power,  if they don't like you they ruin you you life correer. HR make you velef that if you have a problem you go and talk to them, but is like when you get arrest what ever you say they used against you. I wonder 20 years there I never get promoted or recognized"
good,I love working at the company except they dont and will never offer full time unless your the company for so many years or promoted . i love getting discount on a high end brand.
good,It was ok when I first started but it became very stressfull Nordstrom is a revolving door they real look y don't care about there employees if you go to them with a problem they will act as if they are helping but really not Nordstrom has there picks and chooses on who they want to excel in there company
good,"This job will make your social life disappear. Some coworkers are great others are a hassle. No team relations in the departments, its all a competition on who can sell the most. The company is based out of service yet some employees won't give service. Management is horrible, not flexible at all with school schedule. Gives horrible shift hours, not fair with being equal with each other. If you are not number one in your department get used to getting closing shifts. No information is ever relayed, don't know when events are happening till last minute."
good,"I am a dedicated, efficient and hard working professional. For the short time I was there, in the ladies apparel department called ENCORE the manager and assistant manager had terrible communication issues and the inability to deliver proper training. The manager was very bias against new workers and not welcoming.   I enjoyed working with the customers and taking care of their needs, , however, because of management in that particular department, I was looking forward to moving on."
good,"wouldn’t recommend people to work here, a lot of change doesn’t seem for the better. expectations are extremely high and unrealistic. not steady overall, everyone is not treated equally/fairly"
good,"I experienced a lot of cattiness between co-workers, a manager who was the opposite of hands on, and extreme difficulty when you want to move up. I learned a lot but ultimately it was an unenjoyable experience."
good,"If you're working sales, you MUST be ready for the drama associated. Co-workers WILL NOT hesitate to steal your sales, and still tell you they do not. Commission is not a lot depending on your department, so you'll have to sell TONS of items to AT LEAST make a check decent. Some employees feel that they do not need to participate in the cleaning process, so you'll be cleaning up their slack even if its not your mess."
good,The management needs to be better and have prior experience.  My schedule was posted 3 weeks in advance but could change 1 day prior to my scheduled shift.
good,"A typical day, you open the store hang up any new items that hit the floor the night before. It was very stressful working there. It was a low traffic store, so it was very hard to meet your sale goals."
good,It was the most stressful job i have ever worked It is very cut throat they say they care and are willing to help but it really just to much and almost ridiculous to work there.
good,Employees spent a lot of time moving around looking for customers. It was hard to make the goals because of not a lot of shoppers but there was always something to clean.
good,"Health benefits doesn't kick in until you reach ~650 hours, management wasn't all that great, more people were leaving than actually staying, unorganized, lack of communications, managers are always finding someone to blame"
good,"Too many people with little to no work ethic.  Too far to drive for me.  High turnover in all departments.  People do not work together as a team.  Good benefits.  Good company to work for, not a good store to work at."
good,"I will not publicly comment on the company."
good,"Worked long hours, but you learn valuable experience which can help you at all future jobs. Compensation is pretty good, for what we are doing. You learn how to work with people from all walks of life."
good,"The people behind the counter will either try to take your sales, or they will give sales to someone else if they don't like you. Sometimes they just have to like someone else more. Hours are hard to find and what I did was a contract job. Sometimes hours were taken away because of budget issues or the company simply wants to move them to a later date."
good,"A typical day starts out with checking a book to see what daily task (chores) you have been delegated. You are required to maintain the work place and push sales on customers, while still graciously taking returns that can pull out of your CURRENT paycheck for up to a year! Co-workers are catty and act as hungry sharks the second a customer approaches the department, they don't care if you have already greeted them. The hardest part of this job is having to listen to a ""manager"" who believes they are more entitled than you when you can easily do their job far better than them. The most enjoyable part of this job is when you get a great customer who spends at least a $1000 with you, isn't difficult, and doesn't return (at least until a year is over (; !) "
good,Nordstrom is like any retail job when working on commission. High in drama yet can be very rewarding if you are passionate about providing great service. The pay is unpredictable which can be a high cause of stress if one is not used to working in such an environment.
good,This job temperory. Lasted a year. Learned to price clothes & shoes.
good,"Very young inexperience management, Employee that are hired party all the time, they come to work with a hang over they call off allot and they are late for work all the time and high as well! Very frustrating when your team is to high to work it puts more pressure on you when they are unable to work!"
good,No real rule book to go by so favoritism is really bad. Flexing off employees sometimes 2weeks at a time to the point they lose their benefits. OT when employees would like to spend time with family. No structure and no morals.
good,This facility was very unorganized. The management is very rude and disrespectful. When you ask for clarity and help management is unresponsive to you. You cannot speak with your peers to get help from them. You are constantly in competition with your peers to have the best production rates.
good,"The management for Nordstrom is atrocious and the work life balance is non-existent. Thankfully the HR for the company is very supportive. Long days with little to do, business is extremely slow and I have worked at two different stores in two different states. Expectations are completely unrealistic and unachievable. Aggressive, uncomfortable work environment."
good,"No Chance for over time unless you been there for more then 1 1/2, Management is poor, every manager plays the blame game when their numbers are not were there supposed to be."
good,"If you fit into their cult(ure) you'll be just fine. I didn't really fit the image of what they want in a person, so I felt ostracized by the people who didn't work in the restaurant"
good,The supervisors were horrible. The clothes prices don't match the quality of the garments or names.  Generally speaking other department stores are not marked up as high as Nordstrpm Mark's up things.  Their customers don't realize the brand tips them off
good,"The management was usually pretty pore. The customer clientele were a joy to work with. The coworkers were not that great, and very unprofessional. The hours where not dependable. The job itself was very enjoyable."
good,"a typical day at work you got grill for not opening credit cards. you had to constantly beg your customer to open an account "
good,"Working here the staff was very unorganized. Making working there hectic and troublesome. The managers have favorites and it is unfair. They do not go by your schedule, always hold you past your time because they want a longer lunch break."
good,"Nordstrom has a great mission, but it's too loosely followed by management.  Even if the ideas and mission are great concepts, its too hard to get ahead or even stay afloat most of the time."
good,"Nordstorm's Ebar is an awful place to work, there is no regulation on when or how things get cleaned and there are bugs and mold everywhere. It's a health code violation. The management is awful. They take days off when it's short-staffed and have employees work more then they signed up for or cut their hours by sending them home early on a regular basis."
good,"Fine for part time. Management is always changing. Working in retail, colleagues and managements come and go like a revolving door."
good,Management need better training and need to get back out on the sales floor to understand the business.  You are not able to work enough hours so you can't meet sales goal.
good,"Nice environment, hard to make commission if you don't already know what department makes most money, or if you're not already comfortable working in the department you are in."
good,"Inexperience young managers full of favoritism. There are so many cherry pickers that managers turn a blind eye on. New Employee performance has been introduced (85%) but manager's are yet to understand the process. This department inspects all sorts products which has different times to process. As such, cherry pickers tends to process the easy bits of which the managers are not doing anything about it. Inexperience manager would position the employees they least like in stations whereby they would be processing  the big and time wasting products that affect the employee performance."
good,work life was not balanced spent a lot of hours for a company who did not care about employees . I was able to move up and become a manager and the job also taught me great skills for the real world.
good,Management promotes mainly from the store into the Card Service department and does not promote talent within the department itself.  Management is very disorganized and unavailable most of the time.
good,"No matter how many years you are employed at Nordstrom, you will always feel disposable. They will always feel as if work is more important than one of your children's events and you are only as valuable as the productivity in your last paycheck. I believe the Nordstrom family themselves are great people, but they've let others come in and destroy the family environment they created."
good,"Nordstrom is heaven for only managements."
good,"solely commission based and very cut throat atmosphere.  In order to make money, you need to sell a lot which often causes a hostile work environment with coworkers."
good,"It is an easy job if you know how to talk to people. "
good,"Same thing, different day. Nordstrom prides itself on its benefits and promoting from within but whenever I needed assistance with benefits, no one had answers and just told me to go to the website. When it came to promoting from within, no matter what I tried to applied to further my career, I wasn't even given the chance to interview. I was stuck where I was with an inexperienced manager and finally had to leave."
good,The job itself was ok.  I enjoyed working with my co workers and actually enjoyed most of the days that I was scheduled.  The bad part about the nordstrom I worked at is that most of management were very unprofessional.  Most didn't value their employees and treated majority of them as if the employees were beneath them. In other orders they belittled us pretty much every chance they got.     I've even had experiences where something dealing with me that was suppose to be kept confidential turned into the whole entire store knowing because of management.  Overall the company is great.  Great benefits and I definitely learned a lot!   I just felt as if the store I worked at was horrible and from what I hear now its getting worse.  The Nordstrom is store 631 Mall of Columbia
good,Unfortunately the area of the company I am in is going through a restructuring of systems and processes. Not rolled out in an organized fashion / lacking role clarity.
good,"i learnd so much ost about managing a floor in a busy day "
good,This is a company that looks great from the outside. They talk about promoting within but that only works if the right people at the right time like you. As a sales person it is better but as a manager it is the complete opposite.
good,People determine ones advancement at Nordstrom as oppose to ones work performance. Nordstrom promotes based on favoritism and not on ones ability to perform at ones job.
good,"Nordstrom is fantastic if you're right out of school and wanting to gain sales experience. You learn a lot and commission is great. Sales expectations were high but again, if you like sales it'll be a good fit, plus the discount is great!"
good,"highly stressed and unprofessional environment, over priced food, bad service. The manager is never their, the employees don't get along and the staff and upper management is disrespectful"
good,I have worked in the Department stores for 11.5 years. Started out as a good job with good benefits. It has become pretty tough with erratic scheduling and 0 work-life balance. The training has also become impractical and ineffective.
good,"There are pros and cons to every job. This company just wasn't a good fit for me and what I was looking for in a career. I know the company has worked out great for others, I don't discourage people from wanting to work there, I just advise (as with all jobs) to interview them as well as anyone interviews you."
good,"My Nordstrom experience has been an eventful one.. I have never enjoyed representing such a leading brand more, however once on the inside things quickly go from ""fantasy to REAL"" real quick!! I love servicing my customers, and my heart is genuinely passionate. Therefore, the service level I provide is impeccable. Nordstrom creates an ""illusion"" that you will earn great salaries at commission rates, however in my store location specifically, that was all a struggle due to lack of product the Nordstrom customer appreciates, as well as the stunning fact that there is NO RETURN policy which KILLS the spirit and monetary compensation of its few LOYAL and PASSIONATE employees. Nordstrom creates an environment of cruel, numbers driven campaigns and promos only to build Nordstrom's bottom lines, when the employee who services can barely earn enough gas money to make it to work they enjoy. It's sad and hurtful that commissions are hit so terribly due to high rates of fraud and returns. Loyal employees are run off due to compensation and clique like environments."
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work if you are a college student with not that many responsibilities. I liked working there, but being that the pay is strictly commission I do not like the environment. It is very cut throat and you have to make sure you stay on top of your customer or someone will steal the purchase. If you don't mind an environment like that you'll be fine. But, I do not like that people in your own department can be just as back biting in regards to purchase ""steals"". Pay isn't that great unless you sell a significant amount, and at that it can go down because when people return the items whether it be a day or a year down the road it is taken from your commission."
good,"Providing great customer service and helping customers with purchases. "
good,"strong customer service"
good,It was good at first then they hired just way too many people. Then they don't stand behind there own non rules. Also discriminative against gender and sexual orientation especially heterosexual men.
good,"I went into work set up the coffee makers, got food ready for the day. Made sure our till was set up for thee day."
good,they would talk behind your back about you and other thing its a ok job the pays good its just not the environment thats a problem people arent doing there job
good,You work hard for customers that appreciate your hard work. Not ALL customers but the majority.
good,"People fought over sales, commision was never worth it, and the senior employees hated and were aggressive towards new employees. Minimum sales required were ridiculous and booking time off was like pulling teeth."
good,"The team at Nordstrom was great, we all got along and worked efficiently.  Management on all levels treated you poorly unless you were working a higher ranked position.  You were always being threatened to loose your job if you don't meet there quota or during slow peek times."
good,"I was very excited to work for Nordstrom, I started off strong in sales and customer satisfaction but because of that the other associates saw me as competition and started bullying tactics. I talked with all the supervisors and manager only to create more divisions. The Supervisor join in on the girl gang, she was not trained on how to create nonpareil unity.  The return policy is way to loose, this effects your ability to make fair money. Too much sales pressure for these economic times."
good,"I worked in Fulfillment at Nordstrom only for a little bit, but in the little bit I learned a lot. They give you an iPod to go find things on the floor with. The iPod will have the item the customer ordered and when it expires and gets transferred to another store. They want you to get 15 items and hour and that would be fine if they actually trained you, but they have a sink or swim environment. They only trained me for like 2 hours before setting me out by myself."
good,"Nordstrom is great for the money but has made a lot of negative changes. The management team just keeps micromanaging, wanting sales people to do things their way and only their way, and the work to life balance is terrible. My boyfriend still works there and we barely have time together and he barely has time for schoolwork."
good,"Pros"
good,Management expects soo much from you with little to no training including managers.. You have to ask for help and when you do it seems like you are bothering them.. The scheduling needs to be more fair in the sense that only certain people can have a set schedule.. they need a better training program and work a little more on work-life balance with everyone not just certain people!
good,"Let’s just say if you want your job, you have to brown nose a lot to get what you want. Management can be bias towards some workers. Don’t have opportunity to grow."
good,"Advancement opportunities in the fulfillment area of the business are not based on skill set but on the repoire that individuals have with leadership.  They are very weak in this area of matching skill set to advancement opportunities."
good,"When I first started it was great for a college students but soon the competition between other companies started to take its toll and made employees (especially myself) feel as if we were just numbers and the store performance was all that mattered. I could only stick around until the new schedule didn't align with my school schedule and there was unfortunately to room for compromise because of the ""serious"" competition. although I did come out with a lot of useful skills and tools for future employment."
good,"I love the integrity and customer service the Nordstrom brand epitomizes. However, the application and execution of this varies by both Store Manager and Department Manager. At the (now defunct) Providence store, the Store Manager was very aloof and condescending-- it was a mixture of Devils Wear Prada and prison warden vibe, which was very contrary to how she came off in the interview process. She only was interested in who had sold the most.  Worse than that, was my departmental manager experience.  I was in Individualist/Collectors/Encore (We didn't have enough product for one department, so all three were smushed together.) and my manager was, at her best gregarious and inspiring--(she was a high-end retail veteran), but at her worst, she was gossipy, extremely critical and aggressive-- she also only cared about sales numbers and customer feedback. At the beginning, both women went out of their way to promote me and welcome me because I had an impressive background--but as soon as that didn't directly translate into high sales numbers, their attitudes changed.  My department manager was very into Trump, and would talk about it and her disdain for democrats often. Her temper was also very unpredictable and volatile. At the end of the day, you have some very good salespeople who are drawn to the company because of its reputation for good service, but that dedication to service comes with the caveat that it is contingent on how much a customer is spending; the people that stick around seem to have gotten there through very calculated and cutthroat means-- and are very territorial"
good,"The building was nice however dated it may be and so were some of the other workers, but the idea of holding a conversation there was to say the least ""difficult"". Alot of them are caught in thier own bubble and if disturbed respond like a pufferfish becoming defensive and awkward, this transferred over to the customers as well on occasion. Point being it's an awkward company to work for and with as well as the one I was working at had dreary turnouts day after day."
good,"Job only cared about making money for themselves, the only way to move up is to work there forever because they don't care about your productivity. If your looking for a job that your just trying to make it day by day this is it."
good,"There are many changes and rumors throughout Nordstrom Credit.  No one feels secure with job security.  The joke is as long as your badge works... you're good.  However, people are let go left and right, seats constantly changing and the executive level has no idea how to make their employees feel secure.   It was great for awhile, then changes happened and its back to blah!"
good,Lots of changes. There’s a saying if it’s not broke don’t fix it. So many things will change and they realize the change was pointless and go back to the original way of doing things. It’s tough as a Sales Associate you’re either hourly or commission hourly is only minimum wage. You don’t want a hourly check but the economy has gotten so bad it’s almost impossible to make decent money selling consistently. And if you’re a manager they have you managing multiple departments with a small increase for the year. You have to also worry about being demoted as a manager all based on business or the changes they want to make. Yikes such a stressful thing to think about. Lastly everyone gets sort of trapped and feel like Nordstrom is the only place out there. You were fine before working and you’ll be fine after.  So wrong don’t fall for it!
good,Poor communication between management and staff. Constant changes to the schedule and low room for escalating. They pressure you especially when they are low on employees.
good,"They only care about sales, and you are a walking dollar sign to them.  In some departments the pay is great, in most it is commission only and people get very competitive and aggressive.  I really enjoyed working there because I had great coworkers though, and with commission my salary was actually great.  The manager was a bigot though, was mean and nasty and was why I ultimately quit."
good,"Theres a lot of Favoritism going on, you've to do a lot of butt kissing to go anywhere within the company, management doesn't do their job well just focus on themselves!"
good,"Nordstrom has changed drastically since it has been in the online business.  It cares more about online sales then their employees that work in the full line stores.  They don’t pay their management well and result in a lot of unqualified, young managers.  The online business uses the stores as replenishing centers and constantly deletes the inventory.  Difficult for sales team to make sales if they don’t have sizes and inventory.  Nordstrom’s return policy is  ridiculous and result in many people renting the product and then returning after they wear it.  Salespeople lose their commission every time this happens if it is a one year timeframe.  Impossible to make money here unless you work full time.  Even working full time can be challenging as they keep on destroying relationships on the floor by encouraging all the convenient ways to shop in the store and online and eliminating commissions from sales associate.  They have set it up so the salesperson is servicing online no commission sales with alterations , fit questions .  Salesperson is not making commission and time is taken away for them to sell.  They end up making minimum wage."
good,"Managers are very pushy to sale and makes the sales people very uncomfortable and nervous when there is not enough clientele because of online shopping and not enough merchandise. I had 2 weeks nightmare because my manager told me if you don’t make your SPH we will fire you. I made my SPH very hard but they didn’t give me commission. They put their good  sales person in the management position when they know nothing about managing. When I start I was happy for the opportunity, but after awhile I was disappointed."
good,i did not enjoy my time there it isnt for everyone. they dont treat people equally and the supervisors all treat their teams differently so no one is treated fair.
good,over worked and under payed support is the lowest payed members on staff. No appreciation is shown. You are expected to go over and beyond with little to no compensation
good,Helped during the busy holiday season. Worked in men's accessories it was commission based. Then moved to Women petite's section which was more competitive.
good,"The company as a whole is good, but management at individual stores is not great. Managers sit comfortably in roles for lifetimes. They do not address real problems at workplace, but sweep it aside. They also make lots promises that they do not keep, i.e., saying that taking a role will help you to advance to a management position, but not following through."
good,Great health benefits but not very flexible or respectful of their employees time outside of work. They are also not supportive of continuing your education and believe that time within their company is far more important than any external education. I liked some of the people I worked with but it was difficult for everyone when dealing with some of the upper management.
good,meeting sales quota was not easy. The hardest part working at Nordstrom was dealing with managers that never worked behind a counter....sales expectations were ridiculous.
good,"My manager mostly traded off her work to other people, rarely knew any of the metrics or requirements of duties. The management team catered to the people that would ""make a bigger issue than things needed to be."" It created an hostile environment where everyone was looking out for themselves."
good,"The fun can only last so long so don't get to comfortable, It's basically high school with all the gossip that goes around. Management won't teach you anything"
good,"I liked working there for the most part- I thought the job was challenging enough, but not overly challenging. But when I got sick and ended up in the hospital for a few days, my boss was not understanding, so even though I was offered to stay longer than the seasonal position, I declined the offer."
good,"They have great benefits, the hours are long for managers, not really given a straight answer to why they kept switching departments on me .  They bounced me around with three different managers in just six months.  Did not understand why they did not utilize by strongest assets and talents."
good,"Opportunity to make a lot of money. Management isnt the best, but they have an amazing cafe upstairs, delicious food and wine. "
good,This company is definitely concerned with the wellbeing of their employees. They are an awesome company to work for they just have the worst pay. You work hard and its actually fun meeting new people but the commission needs to be way higher and so doe s the hourly. The commission in some departments was just not enough for all the work you had to do but I feel like it could just be a little higher.
good,"Typical retail job, where only the select few are able to receive promotions or obtain advancement goals.  Same old high school drama with people who think having designer clothes is more important than being a respectful human being.  Don't worry, you will not be able to afford the designer clothing that the store offers, because you will barely make more than minimum wage and the ""great discount"" is only 20%.  If I could do it all over again, I would have skipped over the opportunity all together."
good,However there is an atmosphere of any sale at any cost.  Sales professionals were hovering a line of simple retail clerk to complete upscale customer is always right service.  The company would hire managers that were inexperienced and threatened to maintain high sales numbers.
good,"The compensation scale is not balanced and the expectations vs. work life balance do not balance.  The work itself is rewarding serving the consumer.  Nordstrom has some work to do internally in my opinion.  It would be an Awesome place to work if some internal issues are sorted out, or if aligned within the click that promotes!"
good,"Very political. People moved into positions they should not have. Poor management. Unfocused meetings, meetings about meetings. Poor benefits. No leave for having a baby"
good,This is an okay place to work but after awhile you will get burned out. You enjoy it at first and then the returns start to hit you and it hits hard. Also a alot of micromanaging.
good,"Your deal with crabby customers, customers return things from a year ago and think they should get a full refund. Co workers are great. Management does not work well with employees."
good,"Great company to work for."
good,"In the beginning everything was great, the people were nice and the team worked with my day to day schedule. After a couple of months of worker and a change of management things went down hill. But i always had hope things would change. The main problem I had was management and favoritism."
good,"Warehouse jobs are never fun. The warehouse has a AC unit thats good, most don't. They give good hours but you can be replaced within a few hours. The employees steal items and take advantage of the lack of supervision. They also wont work with any schedule you live by. Either you work your 8 hours a day or they'll replace you for some one who will be available everyday. So I definitely don't recommend this job to a student. Moving up in the company is nearly impossible unless you know any one. Management is horrible with training and safety guidelines. Employees keep a tight  knit and it makes it hard to try to fit in."
good,"Nordstrom is a cult based corporation.  The direct manager I had was so narcissistic, her vacation plans came up in nearly every conversation I had with her including my exit review."
good,"commission based job, all of your sales returns count against you even years later, plus is having your lunch break at the Nordstrom café and not behind the scenes like most jobs."
good,No work life/work balance. Management shows favoritism with little interest of your needs or wants.Great benefits if your able to get full time and work any shift
good,"Discrimination by ethnicity is a bog thing at Nordstrom store at Bellevue, one of the manager is so flexible with a white skin but very hard on a brown skinner. Never felt like it before while working for this company before.They always focus on open door policy, but its not an open door policy. Its really hard to move if your manager is not referring. Every promotion happened by referrals."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company with a strong desire to create a fantastic environment for their customers. The structure of command is an inverted pyramid which shows that Customers are what keep the company alive and the employees on the front line, at the store level are most important. With that being said there is no structure for moving up within the company and you get different answers or the run around when asking for help. When I first started with the company no one explained about the benefits or where to go to find answers so I was in the dark a lot. The employees I work with are fun and I enjoy seeing them every day, however there are clicks within the company and a lot of gossip. I enjoyed wearing what I wanted to work and being able to adjust my hours to get off earlier. Everyone is positive and a team player. The technology they use, for example direct deposit comes in 3 days after your payday, is behind."
good,"This place is high stress, absolutely no regard for family time, time off needed for doctor appointments, illness anything really."
good,Decisions made based on a lack of understanding of any part of the company that isn't directly tied to sales numbers has resulted in a company that is much more short-sighted and difficult to work for than it was when I first started four years ago.
good,"Big company."
good,The amount of responsibility placed on the Visual Merchandising team has increased tremendously. The stress is not worth it.
good,As a sales associate at Nordstrom I am expected to keep my workspace immaculate. I am also expected to meet my personal sales goal aswell as contribute greatly to the department sales goal. As a sale associate at Nordstrom I am expected to create a warm welcoming atmosphere for every customer aswell as meet their every need even if their needs include merchandise or questions regarding other departments. I am expected to open reward cards and be well versed on the procedure of opening a card aswell as the benefits of opening a rewards card.
good,"At hiring, they give false promises about Inverted Pyramid, and that you come first. When treated like the lowest of the low. Everyday something will change, whether  a change in how the workplace works, with no desire to change at all when employees come up with their concern as their ""Open Door Policy"" says. "
good,very catty on top of catty customers and  management is only there to make commission and salary. work hours are all over the place. mostly mids and close so if you looking to find a place with a work/life balance-this isn't the place for you.
good,"A typical day for me personally is traveling 55 minutes to downtown Chicago. Spending 9 hours a day training sales associates on technology advances, sailing took and promoting reward accounts."
good,"know the new designers"
good,"Typical day involves cleaning your department, taking down items to be sent out, alterations and sales.  High level of turn over within sales staff and managers.  The hardest part of the job is there is no consistency of assistant managers and managers.  You are always working with a manager who is learning and training your fellow co-workers.  Another down side is that they do not have a customer service desk, so you are the customer service person.  Since this is a commission only job, returns and customer accounts could remove you from the sales floor for over an hour.  Off the sales floor means no pay.  Most enjoyable part is interacting with customers."
good,"Terrible work hours, under performing and under working management."
good,"A typical day was just to bake off cookies, make soups, cook and slice meats, cut lettuce for salads. Clean all of the equipment used, cean my station, cool off foods so they could be stored correctly."
good,duties changed daily
good,"I don't believe the company is bad, but more like the store I worked in. The best part of going in to work for me was my interaction with clients and also my coworkers"
good,There is always something to do. My co-workers were energentic and were a key part of completing daily tasks. The hardest part of the job is not being able to complete the job effectively all the time by yourself. The most enjoyablee part of the job was the constant interaction with customers.
good,"great money if you can sell, your experience depends on your location. they like for you to be competitive amongst each other. To keep tour sanity, do your job and go home."
good,"Not for career building,  unless retail management is your focus. Be upfront about scheduling, may get locked into open schedule for years. Company supports management roles way above team members."
good,"Too much favouritism and competition between co-workers caused by management.  Long hours, no work/life balance.  Pressure to sell no matter what.  No HR privacy when dealing with concerns."
good,"Nordstrom offers great benefits, but management has gone downhill over the past 3 years and they never have any stock in store, which really upsets customers. That makes it very difficult to reach your daily sales goals."
good,Our manager got commission for every card we sold. Unfortunately she only cared about her Botox. Customers were typical entitled zealots. I enjoyed it though. One of my favorite jobs. I met some interesting people and we had fun times. There were cliques and the mangers were as immature as the rest of us. Nobody took breaks when they were supposed to or they took breaks way longer than they were supposed to.
good,"it was temporary, I enjoy working there but it was time to move on. friendly atmosphere, the store was always very clean.  I really enjoy my time there."
good,"Customers really really suck and they expect you to bow to their every request. Very micromanaged and I never ever was approved for any time off. Only bonus is IF you get good numbers, you can get an incentive on your check which helps because they definitely don’t pay for what you have to deal with."
good,it can be an ok temporary job wouldn't recommend for a long period of time. Weekends were busy and weekdays and slow. Pay is not enough for all the duties you are assigned to do. Does have good benefits if needed.
good,They don't understand when you or you don't feel good they just don't care at all. I gave them a hospital and doctor note and they don't accept it. i think that is crazy because it's my proof for not coming in to work.
good,Great co workers! Discount and flexibility with employee schedules! However they’re staring to lower wages to minimum wage and it is not as great as they used to be. They’re cutting on costs and getting rid of a lot of great managers.
good,"Lack of communication, they always had bad attitudes towards mw and a very rushed environment. The hardest part of the job was making your proper count at the end. They expect you to know what your doing in the second day."
good,No help for advancement unless you want to spend twenty years trying to climb the ladder. As most retailers are brick-and-mortar stores go they continue to close fall line full price retail. Nordstrom this is not like any other store I mean they're not exclusive to that. During my time there they restructured two times and my career path initially was a 5 to 7 years which now looks like would be a 10 to 15. if you're interested in having a career at Nordstrom's apply at the rack their is  business is booming. By the way they've left 14 managers go at Corte Madera due to their online fowl cast. So real soon I won't have a job!
good,Ok company slowly losing its identity. Keeps low levels of stock instore to boost internet sales. Learned tons about interacting with diff. personalities. Hours will fluctuate from fulltime to part-time. Most enjoyable parts of job is the co-workers and clients I built great relationships with.
good,Job was cutthroat. Management could pick and choose what problems they were willing to report to HR. Unprofessional language and no training provided.
good,"I worked at the rack in Tulsa, OK. There is a lot of favoritism in the store. Managers hang out with some of the workers and those workers get treated better than regular employees. If you are not in their circle they will mistreat you. If some of the managers could be replaced the rack would be a better place. The starting pay is pretty low, 11.00 an hour. You do not get yearly raises. You only get a wage bump when you hit a thousand hours. Not a bad place to work if you want to spend every weekend working."
good,temp. assignment never called me back as I was told they would do. That is all i want to say  about working there.  No job security at all would like to have returned there
good,"it had fair pay, with hours but as a fulltime single parent, it was hard to accommodate unpredictable mishaps like, a sick child. I felt in trouble everytime I called in for my child."
good,"Very customer service based.  We did phone calls to draw the customer in.  I wrote thank you notes to people.  I cleaned the dressing room of clothes, steamed gowns and dresses.  Returned clothes from the internet.  Put new clothes on the rack.  Ran the Farcash register and closed the register, counted the money."
good,"Nordstrom Rack was a very stressful job. Per day, management was just bad and hard work done always became discredited. Never satisfaction for them, etc."
good,"numbers, numbers, numbers. that's all they care about. Oh and pushing credit cards on people."
good,"Management tends to overstaff their department and they will also sell on the floor against you instead of helping you get better. Closing one night and opening the next is stressful and inconvenient, but it's mandatory."
good,Inconsistent management and there is no proper training for management. They are promoted into a role based on favoritism and then left to figure out what to do.  So it's like the blind leading the blind. Since I have been in the company and I capped out for the hourly rate I can't advance. It's sad that I'm still not making money like I was in the NE region.  The alternative is to sell on commission the drawback is the high rate of returns in the Atlanta area. Pretty pathetic
good,"management had huge turn over rate and was disorganized. Very cut throat environment. Management made you feel as though your job was always on the line, no sense of security."
good,"My time at Nordstrom started out wonderful and I frequently was commended for exceeding my sales goals and beating commission goals. I made it clear early on that I wished to work towards a promotion and consistently took on more than my position required. My manager left for another job a few months in and the new manager that took over was a MESS. She was constantly on her phone, did not care to help anyone get to their goals and frequently took vacations for long periods of time. Myself and one other stylist essentially took on her job duties for her since she did not even care to try. I asked her many times to sit down and let me know what I was doing well and what I needed to work on to reach my goals and her response was always less than attentive. Towards the end of my time there I was so frustrated and fed up that I barely even spoke to my manager. I truly do not understand how she even got the job..."
good,I came in as a dishwasher even though I've been a cook exclusively. But I wanted to show my worth and so I moved into the prep position and eventually line cook. But the manager never kept his word regarding coaching and further training.
good,Working here is okay. You can either make it fun or miserable. But when managers can’t do there jobs properly and solve an issue it makes the team look bad.
good,"i got commission once and it was the month i only worked two days, the culture is garbagio, and the other salespeople will try to shark your customers, dealong with lawyer types made me want to die"
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at nordstrom, it was a fun place to work for. Got to learn alot of stuff and coworkers were very nice. Management were also nice but not quite organized."
good,"I loved my job and the people I worked with.  Nordstrom used to be a great company to work for, and then I'm not sure what happened.  Everything went digital and the managers stopped caring about the emplolyees.  The truly good, hard working employees never get recognized.  I was an employee that never called off and was never late to work, I helped in any way l could.  I worked longer hours than many of the managers, and knew how to do everything in every position available, and yet...an employee who was always late and did not care got recognized as an ""All Star"".  I have never felt so worthless when doing so much.  They play favorites, and all of the managers get promoted because they are well liked, not because of job performance and knowledge."
good,A typical day at work would be moving and arranging store merchandise before the store opened and managing employee performances and sales goals. I learned how important great customer service is.
good,"A typical day here was filled with lots of smiles from coworkers and customers, but when it came to management, it was quiet messy. My direct manager at the time was very self involved, all about the money you bought in for the department, but never about her employees. I learned that with a great (counter) team (which I had), you'll be able to survive the cut throat. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with their daily goals (especially on very slow days). Most enjoyable part of the day was when you were able to meet new customers and interaction with great co workers."
good,"Customers are demanding and can be sweet, the work flow is constant. The fellowship between floor members is great and fun. The relationship between management and team members can be trying and unrewarding. Hard and accurate work isn't as recognized as being available to ring. In house promotion is possible if your willing to change locations. Having a great relationship with individuals that are where your looking to go is helpful. The pay is nice compared to some other retail companies, and there is flexibility in scheduling"
good,"A typical day at working at Nordstrom, is fast paste and somedays slow , you never know what you'er going to get and you never know where they going to put you to work on them slow days, Needs to be more efficient. building pallets are the fun times"
good,"Nordstrom was a good company to work for due to the store environment and the relationships that were built with customers. However, the commission pay rate made it difficult to make a living off of. The pay checks were I consistent."
good,"The leadership often seems as though they don't want to even  be there. This leads to their employees slacking off, which hurts the store overall, resulting in a poor customer experience and making things harder for the people who actually want to work."
good,I come in the am set up the line learn what need to be prepped for the shift management is ok as long as you stay on task work place culture is ok the hardest part the job was the fast paced rushes to get the food out the most enjoyable part of the day is making quality food
good,Working for a non-sales department is not ideal with this company. Support Teams are over worked and under appreciated. Often tasked with doing jobs outside of normal job duties. Direct management was very distant and hands off. Management not supportive of employees who have expressed furthering careers with the company.
good,Working at a Nordstrom full line store is definitely fun and rewarding if you can handle the pressure of selling and commission if you are a sales associate. 
good,"They string you along telling you what you need to do to be able to stay on after the seasonal position is over. You work super long hours, 6 days/week and at the last minute they tell you they aren't keeping you."
good,"I would like to keep what I think of the company to myself, I would like to let others fill Nordstrom out for themselves and see what or how they feel"
good,The everyday work is fast paced and hectic. Nothing is organized. They only give you 3 ten minute breaks in a 10 hour period. Pay is decent. Trainers and Managers are always busy.
good,"Poor management, last minute schedule changes, a lot of mandatory overtime, strict on break times (only 10 minutes), lack of communication, will be terminated if you can’t meet their goals, cafe is over priced"
good,"My manager was the rudest, self center and laziest person I have ever meet. She had an extremely nasty attitude and disregarded all other humans beings in her path."
good,"management too strict, and too pushy,  too focused on the job doesn't let the employees focus on life outside of work and give the employee its own freedom to make sales his or her own way."
good,"During my typical workday, I need to work so fast to meet the daily goals and if i can't meet my goal my agency gonna call me to let me know if i have or no schedule for tomorrow  thats the hardest work i ever experience."
good,The Nordstrom Company is a good company to work for if you are on their career track. If you are only looking for part time employment and don't want to move up the company food chain then you are stuck with the local store management which isn't always good. In the years I was there I had 3 changes in store manager and multiple changes in assistant managers...constant adjustment! Loved the staff and the vibe on the sales floor.
good,"This was my first experience with telecom work and I got to learn a great deal that help me advance to other great jobs. Work/home life was not of great concern, it was get the work done and family is second."
good,Nordstrom is an okay company to work for. They want you to believe that they are this great Company but then you get in the door and its nothing like they said it would be.
good,When working at Nordstrom you get paid commission and it gets really stressful when you are trying to pay rent and get food. There's never enough people there to make it worth your time and when there are customers everyone is trying to get their business.
good,"Managers dont treat everyone fairly. They play favoritism and its all about politics. You get promoted if you the favoourite not by performance. Im one of the top sellers, constantly ask for opportunities to grow with the company but never given a chance. Human Resource is not even helpful, they are always on the companys side not on the employees'. Nordstrom is a good place to work for if you want to earn quick money, however, a horrible place for a career. The managers dont care about employees they care only about their well being. I've been with the company for more than 2 years and came across quite a few managers ( they are all the same=selfish)."
good,Working here has been a great learning experience and I get to work with great people who inspire me. Unfortunately with online shopping retail is dying.
good,not compensated for the amount of work the sales associate completes daily. the managers didnt have the employees best interest in heart. associates werent being held to their expectations. nobody met there sales goal in my department for 2017.
good,working here through out my career i have learned to gie exceptionally high customer service and also expect to recieve it. They do not give a good work to life balance even though they try to promote it
good,"Nordstrom customers have high expectations. You must meet their expectations. No free lunches unless you're in management. No free anything. Every person that works for the company starts off at the bottom aka a salesperson including management, hr, customer reps, etc. If you want a job where you can move through different positions/departments in the company, this is a place you can try. Extremely stressful."
good,Customers not happy about loosing the alteration service. Selling staff inexperienced in sizing customers. High turn over in staffing and management.
good,"All departments pay rate are different, but majority are commission based. In order to receive a good pay check you must sell A-LOT! But don't get comfortable, if whatever you sold is returned, then that amount is deducted on your next pay check. This was never told to any of the employees while the hiring process. It was hard making a living while working in a ""low volume"" store. The store itself was ok, but  management are very unfair and will have you scanning RACK and doing assistants job on a busy weekend when you could be selling the most. I loved what I did, but for the over all it was very inconvenient. Ask them about their turnover rate, that will tell you much."
good,A decent job. fun environment. the management could do with some sprucing. a great job opportunity for college kids. the discount is great. takes care of the tax.
good,"Managing several departments can be challenging you are expected to merchandise your floors in the morning before opening, be on the floor selling and coaching but also there is a lot of paperwork that needs to be done i.e schedules, business plans, communication with buyers, reviews, schematics and much more.  The hardest part of the job is finding a balance life so that you can get everything done at work but still take your two days off a week."
good,"Nordstrom is known for a great customer experience. This reputation is solely provided by the extremely hard work the employees put in, for little to no recognition. Nordstrom plays favorites. If you focus too much on making money for yourself and not workplace politics, you won't advance. Management is full of unqualified managers hired based on nepotism and not results. If you do not enjoy someone interrupting your work by nagging at you about credit cards, I would advise not to work at Nordstrom."
good,"As a beauty stylist i get to learn a lot of things from different product from all the skincare and make up line,Including shiseido,lancome,chanel,laura mercier,dior,estee lauder,Fragrances and etc.. We normally get busy during our anniverssary sale and costumer rewards night.. I love working with all co worker,time flies when you are having fun.So why not enjoy it right!"
good,"Counting money from previous night, getting deposit bags ready, preparing cash reos for the day."
good,Its ok working here. I enjoy it. The management is ok and the co workers are awesome. The hardest part are the customers sometimes and the most enjoyable part is being around my coworkers.
good,"A typical day at work starts with shipment and merchandising of the floor. In between and after consist of customer service, merchandising the floor, selling of products, engaging with customers for there wardrobe needs, along with maintaining prior customer relations and pursuing new ones."
good,"Nordstrom is just a name. This is not a place you want to work if you  want to move up in the company, make money, and/or have a life outside of work. The management is horrible, and if your not a veteran, believe you'll be working until 10 pm four times a week. You'll be working really hard everyday for little pay because the commision is bull. Not to mention, most of the time your working to get back in the positive from all the returns. Overall, if your okay with working over 40 hours a week for a $300 paycheck, this is the place for you."
good,"Only a handful of people put in hard work here, and that does NOT include management"
good,"I worked as a cashier, it was hard at times, but I got through it with the help of others"
good,I unfortunately did not have a pleasant experience during my time with this company. The management is unqualified and unprofessional. The only way to advance in this company is based upon who you know and not what you know. Very unfortunate.
good,"In a typical day I would encounter many customers, greeting them, asking them how their day is going and asking if they needed any assistance. If they needed anything I would help them find it and add on anything else they may find useful. Management was good for the most part, depending on the manager at my time there I had three different ones. One manager spent a lot of time on the sales floor and two others spent a lot of time in the office. Though there was a lot of competition co-workers were nice for the most part. The hardest part is the unpredictable hours and slow retail periods. The most enjoyable part was being able to style women and men and having them leave in a better mood than what they came."
good,"I started out extrememly excited and eager to get my hands dirty. I wanted to absorb everything retail, having designs one day to own my own shop. Instead I saw the ugly truth about high end luxury retail. My pay was not what was agreed to in our contracts, customers with MONEY were less than human to the sales associates. For high end discounted luxury retail, you mind as well had been working at a cheap knock off sweat shop retail thrift store. It was that bad all around. Only reason I went to work, before quitting were my awesome co-workers. They were the ONLY BRIGHT SPOT about working at this company. From the very TOP LEVEL supervisors to the Manager I reported to, left this sales gal with a bad taste in her mouth. Sometimes the grass really is BROWN on the other side."
good,"Fun and exciting, excellent place to work, great management and job security. Great place to start your retail career."
good,Enjoyed customers but new management treated employees like dirt.
good,no work life balance. Long hours. Competitive pay. Management is not up to par for a high end retailer.
good,It sounds better than it is. Timing is everything. Co-workers are great. A lot of drama.
good,"Difficult to meet daily quotas.Lack of training.Returns really hurt your sales, if it does not produce an exchange."
good,"when i first started in 2003 the job was fun, made alot of money and the managers cared about the employees, around 2006-09 thing started to change, to many rules that wasnt worth the stress"
good,"Fun environment to work in, you can make 20hr if you are a excellent sales person but,it is exhausting working the required hours to get any health insurance. Not a place for anyone over 30 or trying to manage a family. If you can't work whenever they want you definatley won't ever be a manager, not matter how great you are in sales, customer service."
good,lots of management - typical for a cosmetic position. It really is about 'who you know' with this company.
good,Nordstrom was a great place for me to polish my customer service skills and become confident with direct selling. Nordstrom allowed me to build customer relationships and manage my own business. This experience taught me the true meaning of brand loyalty.
good,The store was very unorganized and there was never any work to do on my shift. The managers all seemed to young to be in charge of most departments and were more worried about their title than their job.
good,Employees are generally friendly and welcoming.  There is a lack of resources and many are stretched too thin.  You are expected to way too much with so little resources.  There is also a shift in senior leadership and upholding nordstrom culture.
good,The culture is very reflective of the NW. Very diverse and tolerant of everyone and pushing of progressive values. Everyone is welcome from all backgrounds.
good,"Nordstrom is all about the customer and not the employee. They claim work and life balance but department management rarely grant requests off. Pay and benefits are above average so that is what keeps most there. In direct department management, it is all about favoritism. They don’t promote the associate who is most helpful to customers, sales, leaders and team players. Promotions go to those that assist the managers in their duties and have common interest. SirStore manager should have one on one sit downs with employees to get their feedback on department management."
good,"I've seen a multitude of experiences with this company, mine started off really well and got terrible after three years.  I ended up with a manager who acted out her emotions through the schedule, and was very passive aggressive."
good,"I wish there was more sense of growth and opportunity to go up in the company. My manager never handed off responsibility which, in my opinion is never a way to help others grow."
good,"I worked for a day over my year mark and in the Kids department and the day after my yearly review they ""let me go"" for not meeting the commission standards that were like $200 a day and logically no one is gonna buy kids $200 worth of clothing they're gonna grow out of. Overall due to it being commission based it wasn't team oriented more of a ""fend for yourself"" lifestyle I didn't really enjoy."
good,Very repetitive and monotonous   Be prepared to work mandatory OT  pay is decent for what you do but leadership lacks sense and caring     You are a grunt in the wheel
good,"Pretty good if you're just looking for a job to work at for a long time just to get the experience, had fun & very busy enviroment. Overall Enjoyed it."
good,"The company is decent, they pay you barely above minimum but expect an outrageous and impossible amount of work to come from one person.  There really isn’t much room to move up in this company & they take you for granted. You do get a very little amount of PTO however, that might be the only plus."
good,"Nice place to work, but no professional development program exist. I have been working there since 2015. Co-workers are friendly, and can be helpful. Organizational skills are lacking. Overall you must have the ability to make decisions with clarification."
good,The company has completely changed in the last few years. We are constantly being threatened about our jobs and are treated poorly by management. There is no support and we are expected to figure everything out on our own. Nordstrom is losing employees that have been with the company for years and have brought a lot business and built long-term relationships with these costumers. Nordstrom is coming up with new rules that only cause problems and disloyalty on the floor. The people that have been working for the company for over 10 years had great things to say before it changed. These employees built a great clientele and brought a lot of business to the store. Sad to see the store turning its back on them. This is not what the company stands for and the management needs to realize this. They once were in our shoes.
good,It was ok when I started but it’s been going down hill.The management could be a lot better they talk about that there is no favoritism but you can clearly see that there is favoritism the trainers overstep their boundaries new hires and transfers are not trained properly to fully do their day-to-day duties
good,"If you are a favorite, you can get away with not doing anything, after you’ve hit your numbers. You have to beg management to cross train you in different areas, and they only pick who they like to be doing the light work."
good,"It’s commission based, they set crazy high sales goals for slow week days and then get mad at you for not selling enough when there isn’t any customers to sell to. Management doesn’t care about staff at all, they only care about sales"
good,"Really started out OK but having to work in shoe dept was rough. Constant restocking and lining up product in the biggest dept. in the store! Also the constant upkeep of women's clothing was endless, you never get any sense of accomplishment, as no task is ever complete. Not very gratifying work and physically grueling as well!"
good,"Nordstrom in Cedar Rapids paid fairly well but the work flow is very unreliable. One month you are getting flexed off, not a lot of hours and it can get slow and boring. Then next month you're on overtime working a lot, things pick up and there is more to do."
good,Bla bla bka vkufufigpjöjöjöhlvmvbmvmcjfhdgjcmcmvljkgkgkglclvlclv
good,"This company wonderful however there were major issues with turnovers and management that made the environment hostal at times. There were very positive experiences with work colleagues that accommodated for the lack of communication, business,and personal interactions with some management personnel.... excellent pay poor management"
good,While the clients were great to work with the company went through a corporate change and compensation was significantly impacted. Many people were left to find new work.
good,"Management is only about the numbers, the workers come last. You need to open a lot of credit card accounts so your bosses can get promotions for it. They have as little people work on the floor as possible, so be prepared to have to do the work of three. Also, calling in sick is not an option."
good,Although the management takes pride in working their and meeting and exceeding sales goals the expectations are very unrealistic. Often time the sales associates are no always given a realistic method to meet goals as well as opportunity to grow within the company.
good,"I like sales and meeting people.  Giving customers advice on outfits, such as suits, shirts and ties.  Employed with Nordstrom for nine years. Ready for a change and new challenges."
good,The salary was decent but poorly managed cosmetics department. Hours are mall hours so no complaints there but definitely not something I would have been happy to stay at long term.
good,"Assistant management has its challenges as you are responsible for all the manager is responsible for, yet are expected to sell much more. It can be hard to put aside selling time. Fun place to work, though."
good,I worked with a great team at Nordstrom and enjoyed my time there. A lot of people there were very easy to talk to and wanted to see you go far in your career.
good,Pay needs to increase with longevity of employment. easy work. Culture is diverse. Training is good in some areas and poor in others .Hardest part of the job is loosing hours.
good,"The culture in certain departments can feel a bit hostile at times, and more or less like a popularity contest if you want a promotion than actually based on skill sets and productivity."
good,"This job is suited for candidates looking to thrive in Sales. I was at this position briefly throughout the holiday season and learned a lot in regards to providing that ""White Glove"" service for new and existing clients."
good,"The job us sometimes busy and sometimes very slow they will put you off at times for days NO sick time, sometimes they schedule you on your days off and you better come in"
good,"If you want to work here I advise you, consider it as a part time job or secondary based on your needs. Full time is good if you are wanting a retail job."
good,"The work itself at Nordstrom is mostly great, but the people who are in management lack team skills. Overall there's very little career path offered and the yearly 'cost of living' increases are minimal. In order to advance in the company, both financially and in terms of career growth you need to leave and come back and that is verbally encouraged."
good,"Department management provided very little product training for my role. Most training was from the brands for counter managers. I was at a store in an area where luxury shopping didn't do very well. The department was over-staffed and under-trafficked. As a result, I wound up being written off the schedule for about two months before taking a pay cut to move to a different area of the store. Management in my department was not communicative enough, but the HR manager was helpful."
good,"The days of hands-on experience in designer apparel and a genuine love of providing personalized customer service are gone. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at Nordstrom. "
good,"Overall, I met some great people at Nordstrom but it was extremely cutthroat. It just was not for me but I appreciate all it taught me in terms of customer service."
good,"one day off a week.. 60hr work weeks so if ya like OT and don't have any kids that's good for ya. "
good,I was an assistant manager that couldn’t advance to a department manager because I had not had “enough experience in my current position since I was on leave”.  So I wasn’t even able to make a lateral move to a different location.
good,"Great learning experiencefor someone returning to the retail field and working commission. I learned that I don't like working commission only.  I prefer hourly/salary, but a good company and training for new hires;"
good,"Glad I had the opportunity to work there. "
good,"There is good months but also lot of flexing thru out the beginning of the year, right after peak season . Learned how to drive heavy equipment. The people are great but the managers are very rude they ignore you . They never have the time to talk to you , some don't even say good morning to you as they pass by . If your gonna use your PTO you always have to say that your sick . If your late you have say that your sick and you have to use your PTO to cover your tardy or off days. So goodbye vacations ."
good,"Never considered all my vast experience in retail. After four years of working for the Rack I am ready to leave. I have gotten enough hours for healthcare, and very hard to move up. It is a young person's work environment and they are encouraged to move up. This company can well afford to make majority of their employees full-time but that doesn't happen to much money is going toward corporate salaries. Workplace culture depends on who your boss is. For about 3 years had a manager that played favorites and people complained but nothing was done. Almost everyone was glad to see her go.I was forced to change departments against my will and was told to do so or I wouldn't get any hours. The manager and others in leadership roles act like they care but goes in one ear and out the other. The area I live in has gotten expensive to live but no raise to compensate for the rise in cost in this area. If you are older you are better off at a full line store than at a Rack. If you have a spouse or roommates you may be able to support yourself. This company could well set the bar high for other retailers to follow but they fall short."
good,"You can have many opportunities to do different positions. You will definitely learn a lot because you are responsible for a lot if you are in management. The pay could be more competitive. If you are in sales you can lose benefits if your hours are unexpectedly cut which is a difficult risk. At times the management could afford to be more experienced. It is fashion so some attitudes are predictable - clique oriented, favoritism, etc. Overall can be a great learning opportunity."
good,Not to strict and pretty easy going. Not a lot of management presences. Flexible on time off and hours worked. Hit and miss with consistent schedule day to day.
good,"It is your typical call center. BE ON TIME! Leave on time. "
good,I feel their philosophy is work being pushed through over the quality done.  People do shortcuts to meet goals; and I feel customers are not given quality over quantity.
good,"The most disorganized management. They would have no idea what was going on and when they did, they looked the other way. People playing favorites, even to employees being so intoxicated that they had to be carried out, only to be right back at work 2 days later with no repercussions."
good,"While the pay is good, they micromanage your every move. When you go to the restroom outside of your assigned break time they time it. If you go over 10 minutes it affects your ""adherence."" Which over time can land you with a verbal and so forth. It also affects your ability to earn their incentive bonus. If you ask for help they tell you to use your best judgment. Which is cool in theory but when you're new you want the answer straight up because if you make the wrong decision you bet your buns they're on you about it."
good,"Employer is new to Canada and there are still some learning curves with regards to how business is run in Canada. "
good,"I really enjoy working for this company, however there has been a downward trend in retail. The current challenge is getting people to come in versus shopping online."
good,Sales associates are 100% commission based. In order to get a promotion your department manager has to approve. If your manager doesn’t approve of you getting a promotion rather your qualified or proved yourself or not it doesn’t mean that you will get the promotion. It’s very competitive and if you’re new to the industry be prepared to compete with the veterans because they have rapport and relationships with most of the customers who shop there. This is one of the things that makes this position challenging it’s not impossible to build your own book but it’s not easy either.
good,"great job for networking and advancing to next stages, however you have to work extremely hard for it. I enjoy the perks of customer satisfaction and recognition from my employers."
good,"In management positions (and certain the roles) finding a work life balance can be extremely difficult.  If you are a ""keep your head down, work hard, but don't toot your own horn too frequently"" type of person, advancement can be EXTREMELY difficult, as there are many other people/leaders who are not afraid to accept responsibility for your actions/success.  Often times, people are promoted who put on a good show/play the game and ""drink the koolaid"" because Nordstrom is FULL of koolaid.  You will meet some incredible people, and you will be exposed to some who should NEVER be allowed in management positions (true anywhere).  In a front-facing role at Nordstrom, you learn the art of saying YES. (and how to creatively decline, without saying ""no"")!  You will also learn invaluable lessons about diffusing escalated situations,."
good,Nordstrom is a good company to learn the basics of customer service. There is a lot of good but the bad out ways the good.  There is no work life balance even though they promote it. They don't take care of their employees like they say they do.
good,"Nordstrom was okay. People will judge you on what you wear, so if you can't afford designer products, chances are people are going to be rude to you. The entire store is just a bunch of adults in cliques. I made pretty good money and got lucky with nice coworkers (as nice as they can be when all they care about is $600 shoes). I felt like I didn't fit in because I didn't have money to spend on fashion like other people, but it was okay. The environment is super materialistic, but as long as you're good with talking with people it's a pretty easy job."
good,"The pay is great, but you pay for it by the poor work atmosphere and the management is poor.  Even though the pay is good you are required to work long hours twice a year, in July 2-3 weeks, Christmas 3 months."
good,"Nordstrom has been an adventure! Its always a pleasure being an employee at Nordstrom, it is a great place to retrieve amazing customer service skills."
good,"Nordstrom is not a bad place to work by any means.  Since it is in Seattle it has access to lots of highly competent engineers.  Many come from Amazon and other companies and just want a better work / life balance.  The down side is that there are still lots of long term Nordstrom people that are reluctant to change or that should have washed out.  To Nordstrom's credit, they chose not to push these loyal people out."
good,"If your used to pushing for your check, it's good. But if your not used to rude customers and being fake, this is not a place for you. You really have to push and fight for sales and the end result the cumsumers just walks to another counter and returns it all, and instead of the associate giving you the sale to make up the loss of commission, they just take it for themselves. In turn your worked so hard to make quota of 9,000 dollars in sales to come in the next day to have a 1,000 dollar return, how hard nust you work to get that back on a weekend where they schedule the entire department and there sharks. I had fun, but extremely caty and sharky."
good,initially i loved my job but after time my department barely received customers and as employees we had nothing to do because we already had cleaned. managerial was always shifting causing confusion.
good,the options you have to service the customers are amazing . the treatment of the staff by management needs lots of work.   it could've been just my store..   the lack of maturity displayed with the management team was appalling.   My first couple of store managers truly made you feel as if you were apart of a true team.   going to work didn't seem like a job and we truly rocked the numbers and had an amazing relationship with our customers
good,"The general manager was focused on promoting those who brown-nosed the most rather than the hardest working, most determined, or those who wanted it most. Those promoted, nearly all of the time, were either lazy or a theft (stealing money from the company, etc). The managers that showed the most initiative were taken advantage of; i.e. over-worked while the lazy managers sat around, got of work early, or chose schedules that fit them best. "
good,"I worked in management, but you would have never known it by the $16 per hour I was paid, which was also in a large city. So, the compensation was really off. Perhaps it's got better? Who knows. There were some good things about working at Nordstrom, but the Mean Girls Management Team was not one of them."
good,A typical day at Nordstroms consisted of cleaning the department for customer service.  It also included opening/closing the department registers.  Stocking shelves with new products.  The work culture was one of stressing good customer service.  The hardest part of the job was it did not pay enough for hours worked.  It was commission based.
good,Wish there was more opportunities for advancement. Work culture is lacking and the break system isn't great. The job isn't difficult and can be learned fairly quickly.
good,The atmosphere was positive and everyone appreciates you for your efforts.  The day to day customers are very professional and therefore were very understanding of the workplace.
good,Nordstrom is a company that one would not want to be at for long. The management is poor and is a high turn around rate of employees. Management and HR does not care about their employees.
good,Loved working there until department management changed. There are a lot of young (college aged employees). Environment reminded me of high school in more than one way but most prominently it was cliquey.
good,"Company and management have little to no sympathy for family matters, special needs children, religious commitments and going on a vacation is impossible without feeling guilty for spending time away from the store."
good,"If you are great with sales, Nordstrom is your place.  There is great management however, it can be a stressful sales environment. Compensation is competitive."
good,It was great working using carts n tots n dealing with RF scanners it was pretty layback till you were late or missed a day they didn't like missing anything but over all it was easy they had a cool big lunch room with TVs n couches n just fun when it was time  to work
good,"I loved the quality of training received at Nordstrom. You learn to trust yourself and how to really dig deep in order create that Nordstrom atmosphere. It can be hard too, with the other side of people you have to see and interact with. People will lie about their health and everything in between just to return used merchandise and receive a full refund."
good,the typical work days are pretty stressful and hectic.  In most situations in the corporate building there are not enough people to complete the needed work.
good,if you are looking for somewhere that drains you but makes you sign your soul away then this is the place. 6- 10hr (days) for months but at such a rate that you still have a hard time providing.
good,I was put in control of the Inventory Control Team at this position. Every item that went in or out of the store had to be scanned out by me so I learned to be very detail oriented.
good,Management is unorganized. Store managers dont  lead by example when it comes to embracing company initiatives. Its a great company if you working for the right person at the right time.
good,"It`s a competitive environment which may cause so many stress and you may not have the life that you expected. the challenge is that you will work based on commission and they appreciated those with higher volume sales and great customer service like other jobs. if you want you can earn great paycheck so everything is depends on you."
good,"Customer service, sales, distribution of cash drawers, provide work direction to staff, inventory, Loss Prevention, return approval, resolving customer complaints and sales floor merchandising."
good,"As far as retail goes it is a good job. & environment. The management staff was so poorly ran it was laughable.  The cosmetic manager was just that a manager, not a leader. Nordstrom has a great philosophy and they do of good job with keeping their employees engaged."
good,"Unhappy former employee, who enjoyed working but then slowly didn't appreciate the attitude from management. Did not appreciate the shifts placed in, mainly closing."
good,I would work full time hours. It was a commission base job. You would have to give really good customer service to succeed. I learned that you have to put your self in different situations to be flexible. The management was what it needed to be nothing more or nothing less. The workplace was a bit disconnected as far as a team I felt. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistency in traffic and the amount of money you would make. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that you are in control of your business and the location.
good,"The job was very competitive because you always had to reach a quota by the end of the two weeks or you don't get the desired pay you want. Some days are slow but the weekends are very busy, that's when you make a majority of your commission."
good,"best part is clothes and shoes, check and some people i loved working with. management can suck and there is sadly favoritism. i lied the marked down transfers and food that they sell at the store."
good,"Lots of pressure to do the impossible. No imagination allowed, however old systems to produce business generate little to no results and staff is held accountable. Great place to shop would never work there again."
good,Very long days.  Management is very inflexible and overrated.  Getting time off is next to impossible.  Not a team environment.  Very political and unreasonable.
good,"Nordstrom has been considered a bastion of success and respect in the retail community. Once a company deeply steeped tradition and resolubility, has yeilded to the pressures of Wall Street and developed a culture that emphasizes greed, over healthy competition, motivating each other to aim higher and being the best in the industry into a win at any means mentally. New associates are not trained do not develop core competencies, and there is little motivation to move upward in the company as there is not adequate compensation for larger roles of responsibility, thus most experienced sales individuals choose to stay in the sales floor while poorly trained and underprepared individuals take manger roles with little experience."
good,"Highly stressful sales environment, unrealistic sales expectations for associate. Management are on your case. "
good,"the job has its up's and downs the best time to work for nordy's is during the peak season which is xmas that the time i started and i loved it the commission was great but when business is slow it slow!!! you need a second job to make money, when it slow you go in for a 7 hour shift and half the time you'll be standing around the floor looking at ppl and then they try to find the littlest things for you to do"
good,"The benefits are actually top notch in comparison to other retail companies. 401K, medical, vision, and dental but you're only eligible if you accumulate a certain number of hours within a month. Excellent job if you don't mind constantly trying to sell store credit. For every account that is approved, you get $8 in cash at the end of your shift BUT it comes out of your paycheck. Honestly, management at this location needs a reboot. The job in itself is relatively easy especially if you're a people person. Also, get used to a very bright green shirt. They literally change the configuration of the sales floor everyday so if you aren't scheduled consecutively then the start of your shift can be rather challenging. Give it a shot if you like fashion, it will be your first job, or you need a second job to supplement your income."
good,They stress you out beyond what the job entails. The culture was fine at first but then the company switched on us. I felt like the managers stopped having my back.
good,"I worked in the call center. Over the last year or so. Communication has been less and less on what was going on. I had loved working for Nordstrom was the best job I had up unitl now.  I would not recommend working in the call center since they have taken measures to improve the website, according to management less peoople are needed. Only to have to hire for seasonal. Which I feel is not productive. You should keep your seasoned employees who know what they are doing and have the tenure. I loved working with customers but the direction that management had chosen to go, I don't agree with. I did learn alot of how to handle customer situations better than in past jobs."
good,Nordstrom at City Creek is a premature store for the area. their inventory is slim to none and the transferring of goods is timely and inconvenient. The competitive nature of some sales associates leaves you hanging dry.
good,"Competitive sales product knowledge from vendors, Fun filled events trunk sales and sales events. Stock options available great opportunity to network with buyers and customers."
good,This position is great for someone coming out or going to college due to the flexible schedule of working nights. Be prepared to stay late for shipping and any needs the store has.
good,If your not friends with management to help you grow with the company you will stay stuck in the position you started in. I personally know a lot of employees who put in the work and have not been able to grow because of bad leadership.
good,"Kiehl's is an awesome company to work for. However, working in a retail environment is very much sales goal-oriented, and less about talent. I have a passion for artistry, and sometimes feel limited when it comes to my ability to practice artistry. I do feel it allows me to learn and share product knowledge, which I appreciate."
good,"Overall, Nordstrom can be a very fun, fast paced place to work. However, your experience will depend largely on who you have as a manager. Some managers had very little experience."
good,"Nordstrom has and will always be a top tier place for fashion.  However, behind the doors there lies a place of cut-throat business where everyone is considered replaceable.  What once was a family run local company that was a cornerstone of Seattle business has now become an over-inflated ego driven machine.  The pay is below standard for the industry and the hours are long and arduous.  There is very little reward for the dedication and passion that the employees put into their work except for the fact that they get to say they work at ""NORDSTROM"".  Sometimes that just isn't enough for a job well done."
good,"I've learned that working retail is no typical 9-5.  The hardest part of the job to me was adjusting to working on the weekends and holidays, as these days are crucial in retail."
good,Nordstrom taught me the value of customer service and hard work.I will always treasure the value of personal relationships because of my experience at Nordstrom.
good,"Pay sales associates terrible wages. "
good,What they say about retail is true. If they had a better system of management & support it could be otherwise. It's not. High hopes-- high expectations but too much investment on growing online revenue streams without supporting the brick and mortar experience which is what will keep Nordstrom alive.
good,"This is my experience in retail after coming from the ""corporate world.""  I was hired as a full-time employee, but because business is slow, my hours have been cut to less than 15 a week. I would not have left a previous job if I knew this was going to happen. They are kind to the employees, but there is a lot of information omitted during hiring and training."
good,Days were long and busy and coworkers offered a supportive team but management was weak.  Management at the Nordstrom Ebar was horrendous.  The Manager was unproductive and rude to employees.  I learned how to manager a store.  I learned how to work quick and efficiently and how to communicate with customers and coworkers alike.
good,"Not a secure place to work. They have cut everyone's hours by half almost and poor management team. But loved the environment, its a fun place to work, respectful co-worker, and mostly loved give a great customer service. Unfortunately, due to bad economy, the store is not doing well as volume so they cut everyone's hours by half and i need a full time job where i can at least work between 35 to 40 hours a week."
good,"As a company, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing people across many aspects of the company. Their employees are the number one thing the company has going for it."
good,"management is over powering, what i mean by this is. not enough Indian for the chiefs.  most of them are sleeping with coworkers and not being fair to others.  they make sure you do not make pep. by changing it so you can't make it."
good,"Human resources at this particular location could be better, the women in HR are snobby and judgmental they don't care about anything you have to say. HR is the biggest downfall here. They are all very unhelpful and don't work. They just dress up and look at you harshly when you have concerns."
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom in kidswear would be coming in to open the registers. I then check the dock for new shipments and begin unloading new merchandise, displaying the new merchandise and freshening up old merchandise. I also clean the department and prepare for store opening. Throughout the day I am customer servicing each individual customer helping them with whatever they may need. From putting together a baby shower gift, to outfitting their children in the latest merchandise. I also am required to take returns, help with gift cards sales and payments. We are also individually required to do daily floor tasks and stock assignments along with meeting the selling goal. Educating customers on the benefits of opening a Nordstrom retail or debit card as well as our new rewards card. All things to help further benefit the customers shopping experience. Management is not where it should be as far as Nordstrom standards go. Over the past five years I just can't help but notice a change. I enjoy managers that are supportive, positive and able to manage any situation. Co-workers are great, I enjoy being a team player so much so that I am actually told that I take on too much. I like things to be done right and sometimes I end up doing other people's job. I finish my own stock and tasks in a timely manner which is why I sometimes feel the need to pick up other employees slack. I have to keep busy because it's what my previous managers trained me to do. Hardest part of my job is merchandising because we have such a small department we lack inventory. We are only given a certain"
good,"very competitive environment.  don't know who to trust.  training is poor for the expectations.  if you're looking to move ""up""  this is probably not the best place unless you are willing to work there for several years."
good,"I loved the customer service aspect of my job conferring with sales staff, stylists and customers about the proper fit of garments.  The  management was not very supportive though and the hours were very restrictive and difficult to apply to real life.  My co-workers were very diverse but we worked well together in a supportive atmosphere.  There was not a lot of consistent communication from management or HR however. "
good,"pay is inconsistent, Nordstrom is built on customer service but they are taking away from their sales people by building too much online business"
good,"The most important part of the job, was that we had a core diversity family atmosphere. Therefore, from the start of the day, we had positive attitudes and wanted to do a great job, which was contagious. It's important to treat everyone with respect. The hardest part of the job was that the workload was extremely high, but at the end of the day, it was the joy of accomplishing the workload with management and my co-workers."
good,"the job itself is great, but very poor management, not enough working hours. I have enjoyed working for Nordstrom very much as I tend to build great relationships with my customers, I have learned so much regarding merchandising and how to handle customer issues when necessary."
good,Learned how to connect with customers and give great service. Management takes great care of customers but not employees.
good,"What started off as a great job with the opportunity to earn lots of money has devolved into an overly crowded sales floor with young, inexperienced managers that have proven wholly ineffective. My store has a manager that is never visible on the sales floor and does not have the time of day for you if you are not in their social clique. The last three managers that have been selected for my department have had no prior experience in my area and have been given no training on how to effectively increase sales or handle top employees. These unprepared department managers have all burned out in less then a year and have alienated a floor staffed with top 10 sales people."
good,If you are a hourly employee that does really have a degree than this place is not bad. Can make decent money can move around in positions. But if you are IT then have fun. Not that best place for IT people. No communication at all here everybody has special tasks that no one can take over or know anything about if that person not there or gets fired or quits. There is favoritism in the management with certain co workers. They have a high priority on things that are not IT related. Understaffed on 2nd shift. No growth potential unless someone quits. You work with people that have different skill levels of IT. Job requires an associates in IT. That is a joke. Anyone who can build a gaming PC and has had basic customer service skills can work this job blindfolded. If you are lacking IT experience go for it but I would hang around for longer that two years and move on to bigger things.
good,"Great Customer Service training."
good,"Management is awful. They really need to hire more competent  managers. Training was terrible, they do not do a great job of setting you up for success. Products are awesome, great with returns although that really hurts sales people."
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom would entail dusting, cleaning glass, straighten displays, size clothes. I would assist customers in finding clothing, trying on clothes. I would ring the purchases. Make returns, exchanges and reticket merchandise using the po of service  system. Take alterations to seamtresses, send sales, direct to customer orders to the dock for shipping. Place online and direct to customer orders via the cash register."
good,"Nordstrom/Rack is an extremely hard company to work for."
good,"The company was an excellent place to work during the last part of my college career. The managers gave me plenty of information about the business, about sales, and management within the company that helped me learn a lot about myself.  The entire environment is based around service experience and making sure that the customer is always being taken care of. The most difficult part of my job would have been working extreme extended shifts for days at a time. However, with the teams that I have had the pleasure of working with, the energy and overall environment makes it the most enjoyable part also. I enjoyed being able to see how specific parts of my business were doing by checking daily and monthly figures and being able to set goals to those facts. I also enjoyed being able to merchandise the sales floor for changing seasons or for a change in customer business."
good,Overall a good place to work.  The culture is okay for someone beginning a sales career.  My experience at Nordstom was satisfactory.
good,"Fast paced work "
good,"Nordstrom is a commision based job that is very competitive. On a typical day be prepared to always put your best foot forth if you want to make money. Management is the worst, a lot of young managers with no experience being promoted quickly.  The hardest part of your job is knowing your paycheck is never the same. Nordstrom is a very easy job if you are an expetional salesperson.  No experince is needed, and  if you understand the Nordstrom Culture you will do well."
good,It was a great place to learn initiative because for the most my position was of an independent role.
good,A typical day at work is to convince customers that they need Nordstrom merchandise and I learned that sales is definitely not for me. I really liked my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is to sell because I am more of a visual merchandising type of worker. I sell by setting up displays and love to deal with mannequins. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I straighten up displays.
good,Employees are fun and customers really appreciate the fundamentals that Nordstrom's stand behind in the way they provide customer service.
good,didnt have the best experience working here. pit stop on my teaching career
good,"If your passion is customer service and logistics then you have a great opportunity with Nordstrom."
good,A lot of sales. it was fun and keep you on your toes. You have to be a people person.
good,Nordstrom has a lot to learn from. The associate fight over sales and they are always changing the policies to keep employees happy. non of the department ever made goals unless you worked for the shoe department. but; I'm glad i intern at nordstrom because the experience made me open my eyes wider....
good,Nordstrom is an okay company to work for. It really just depends on you and what your personal goals are.
good,Nordstrom was a great company to work for.However you have to know that your giving up Holidays/ Summers for this job if you are in Management.... It all about how you make it.. the store I was in particularly was like walking in to a dark cloud of negative energy.
good,"The pay rate in the cosmetics department is great. I loved my work but was constantly being harassed by management. They walked around the cosmetics department all day drilling you about how much product you've sold today and if you hadn't why and what are you going to do about it. Honestly, during the week it was so slow and you could only do what you could. If you weren't meeting sales goals they would treat you like a red headed step child but if you made goals you were the favorite for the week. It was really uncomfortable to be treated like that. Unfortunately, the line I worked for wasn't nearly as big as the other lines there. My sales were low even after making every out of the way effort to make it happen, I was let go in January of this year and I'm STILL looking for work. I feel I go shafted and the management didn't make genuine efforts to help you be the best you could. It's do or die."
good,"It was fast paced yet fun"
good,"I worked at Nordstrom twice.  This is a good company but in redirecting its market, skews to young adults in both opportunitiy and customer base.  "
good,"When i started at nordstrom it was the ideal company to work in sales. Unfortunately over the years they have gone very far away from the ""family values"" company they once were. It has moved to a much more corporate sales feeling. Which is fine but they still have the same rhetoric they did ten years ago, which i believe is very misleading."
good,"I enjoyed working with the people. Worked from 4 am to noon, or 5 am to 130. Fast paced environment."
good,Very humbling to work outside of my comfort zone / specialty.
good,All my clients get a foot soak. All therapist are required to sell products. I do love the spa services.
good,Nordstrom taught me a lot about myself and the companies I wish to work for. The politics of the store forced me to leave on my own and never look back.
good,I worked with every customer that I could that walked into our department. I caught up on the latest styles and fashion trends. I am more use to selling other things like cars so it has been an adjustment. I am on my feet all day as well which is something I have a hard time adjusting to
good,I learned how important great customer service is and how stressful selling on commission can be especially in retail.
good,good commission trend shows and half yearly sale always brought in the business!
good,Every day was different and I worked hard and was on my feet all day. I would come out wet and with my hands cut scrapped. The pay really wasn’t worth the amount of the work.
good,the work days are pretty easy not too much or too crazy were someone couldnt handle i liked what they made me do i was in my own workspace and zone but the only bad thing was the mangers they are pretty bad at communication
good,Great place to work for a short time. You have potential to make a good chunk of money. Not crazy about company culture or management. They preach how the company is a reverse pyramid and how sales staff holds all the power but in reality it is nothing at all like that. My suggestion is to get in and get out. You can get stuck working there for a long time if you let yourself.
good,"Great modern workstations for processing shoes, apparel and beauty products. Outstanding expectations must be met. Process items quickly at all times."
good,Pay continues to decline while responsibilities continue to increase. I don't think this is necessarily the companies fault- but the brick and mortar retail sales industry is losing profits and cutting cost wherever possible. It is not the same place to work as it was 10-15 years ago.
good,"I don't like to diss a company, just to do so...so with that said, I found their reaction to me calling in sick when I was legitimately so (and with zero voice left. As a direct result), to be very unfair and counterproductive, of them wanting me to come to work and get other employees sick with my germs!"
good,It was okay. What made or break the job was management. But besides that it was a good retail job. Managers just lack when it came to scheduling based on your availability. But it was easy to get by.
good,Each location is going to be different. Working for the Novi location was great but I transferred to the Tigard location it was awful. The work environment was horrible.
good,"An ok place to work if you do not need a consistent schedule and are not worried about having a personal life."
good,I met some of the nicest people while working at Nordstrom some whom I made life lo g friends with today but management needed work especially the store manager. Just because you are great at selling (or being a shark) doesn’t mean you’re fit to manage and lead others. Hr is no good at this store. Not a good job unless you work in the shoe department or cosmetics and are a favorite.
good,"Nordstrom credit card employee. Working at a call center, the work is easy but your happiness will really depends on who you direct supervisor is. My previous supervisor was amazing and left the company. The woman that just replaced my previous one just got the position at the end of October, and she is a terrible supervisor. She gets easily frustrated by questions, she is condescending, not understanding and honestly not qualified for the position. I will be leaving this company because I am currently stuck with her and refuse to work for her any longer. Keep in mind that your supervisor will make or break this job for you"
good,"Nordstrom is a good place to work during college but definitely is not sustainable for living a life that an individual deserves. The compensation is relatively low and the demand for time is also incredible. You work hours that are unconventional and the commission pay structure isn't the best. Nordstrom also has a return policy that is excellent...for the customers. Even if a customer returns a used shirt that can't be resold, it is taken out of your pay. REga"
good,It was good work experience. If you want to make a decent pay and work a lot of hours than it is the right place. In my opinion tho i didn't like how to treat the employee's.
good,"I was excited to work for Nordstrom bc I respected their authority as a fashion destination. But things started to fall apart once the dept manger left after 2 months of me working there. after that the days became just grabbing as many customers to make your goals (which led to team tension), and pushing credit cards. The only conversation I had with the store manager was when I was working the floor and she walked up and asked if I had opened any credit cards that month. When I responded ""no"", the store manager then proceeded to explain how I will lose my job if I don't. Quality of products in my dept also started to decline, making it more difficult to sell to the high-end clientele nordstrom is known to have."
good,I enjoy working for high level retailer. I have experienced much growth until the restructure happened. WAY TOO much on every manager no time to sell and lead your team.
good,There’s just so many changes going on with the company opening up so many new stores with not enough people to fill positions and the pay starting off is in great.
good,"I enjoyed my job in the Wedding Suite, and working with the brides to help them through the process of finding the perfect dress for their big day. As well as walking with them through every step from the purchase to the alterations to pick up"
good,"Customer Service is clearly number one. Clear direction from the ET; however, message gets lost three to four levels away.  Attention to employee needs is not even number two. Culture is struggling. Pockets of pure brilliance and excellence exist; however, struggling areas are becoming more prevalent."
good,"Working at Nordstrom was a love hate relationship for me. I loved the people I worked with and I loved dressing up everyday. The only downside to this job was dealing with the customers you get. You get this problem at any retail job, but some people that shop here can be very picky and difficult. As long as you have good customer service and a smile on your face, you will do just fine."
good,"Blatant favoritism even for under-performers. This company claims to be all about its people and the customer but it’s all about the dollar, even if it means doing things that don’t seem right."
good,"Nordstrom isn't a terrible place to work, however it has not been getting better, it has been getting worse. From when I began at Nordstrom in 2014 there was great leadership who was supportive in helping you advance in your career and putting you in a place to succeed. however toward the end of my tenure, I found that the management trends had changed where they were more looking out for themselves than the employees they were there to help. Don't get me wrong there is still a handful of great managers but they come far few between. Being able to interact with regional managers and department managers from different stores and regions it became clear that there were too many people in leadership roles who viewed it very much as a dog eat dog world and would do anything to cover their own behind even if it affected there employees."
good,Nordstrom hires almost anyone.  they hire seasonal and after that it depends on if the manager likes you if you get hired on full time. Rarely do they hire for first shift and everyone works at least one weekend day.
good,It was ok. I felt like my coworkers were very rude and did not want to get along. Tips were very good though especially in the mall locations versus the outside locations
good,The only downside to working at Nordstrom is that the management is corrupt and there's obvious favoritism. Certain associates get their desired schedule while others are left high and dry.
good,"While the work environment was fun, it was stressful when it shouldn't have been. The manager was a huge control freak and stressed everyone out, all day long. The sales goals for each person were sometimes unrealistic. I didn't like going to work stressed."
good,"the work place at Nordstroms was just okay, the management over all was not that great. scheduling was always confusing and there were to many store changes and you tend to get over whelmed with the work loads some days"
good,"Lets just say this is a good job until they find something to hold against you. When I first started it was all rainbows and sunshine however you realize very quickly that you have to sell to keep your job, continuously be fake, and do whatever it takes to "
good,"The restaurant was still pretty new when I got there, so it was very disfunctional. The management was very new and very catty. They would talk about people behind their backs often. Some room for growth, but not much. 50% off food on shift and 30% off in the store. Lots of security and a huge back room."
good,I really have nothing to say about working at Nordstrom. I wasn't there long enough and didn't get enough opportunities to advance within the company.
good,Great company but mangament had favorites and it was obvious. They should’ve treated all employees the same instead of letting other employees advanced by skipping steps. Higher pay would be awesome too for all the work.
good,"My first job upon leaving college. It was mostly a print driven position. I worked on in house store sales and in newspaper ads.  Not much actually to say, it was a low level graphic design position, but I was happy to have it, as it was my break into the field."
good,Your experience will be by turns amazing or terrible depending on how well your store holds up the Nordstrom culture. With the current retail climate there is a lack of hours and plenty of job cuts making it next to impossible to move up in a reasonable amount of time.
good,"No one get full time hours unless you are management, and they do send you home if business is slow, so you will loose hours. Was not happy about that."
good,"always something about the budget is short & the company has no money, always cutting hours, never enough employees helping out in service & manager doesnt even know how to do cash room"
good,"Nordstrom is a good place to start off as your first job. You make a-lot of money as a teenager, also if you do not have plenty bills, the paychecks can be rewarding. It is strictly commission based which can be a really good thing or a really really bad thing lol, especially in the slow seasons. How much you sale is how much you make. my lowest check was about $200 and my highest check was $2,200 and this was after taxes. This is why I had to leave, the inconsistent in my pay was frustrating because it was not guaranteed that i was going to make enough money to pay my bills. Also the job was VERY TIM CONSUMING. i remeber want time i left the store at about 12:30 am, AND weekends off is a no. If you want to make money, you HAVE to work weekend because that is when most people shop"
good,"the recent focus on doing more, faster is being applied broadly and sometimes to the detriment of employee satisfaction with work/life balance and reasonable expectations."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for but it wasn't for me. The scheduling wasn't consistent, it was hard to take time off. I didn't have that work/life balance. However I did have a great manager and I loved my coworkers."
good,"Some locations provide healthy working environments for employees to grow in their career with Nordstrom. Unfortunately my experience in working with Nordstrom was not at its best. My managers were not as present, and yet enforced unrealistic working goals that were difficult to maintain in the Customer Service realm we were provided. The location in Rosemont could most definitley acquire new management in order to produce the goals that are being set by the company. Degraded employees for not accomplishing goals does not promote a positive working environment."
good,"At Nordstrom there is intense pressure to meet outrages goals. With online sales increasing, less people are coming into stores and the associates are paying the price. We are treated as though it’s our personal faults that no one is shopping in the store and blame us for not coming in."
good,Nordstrom was a good company to work for but changed within the last few years. There is no loyalty to it's employees. Recently many employees that were employed for years were let go.
good,At the end of the day you're working in retail. Nordstrom is not so different from all other big box department stores. You are full commission and their return policy (aka no policy) can really hurt at times.
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Nordstrom. I have been promoted multiple times throughout my time with the company and after having my children, was welcomed back with open arms!"
good,"The best part of this job was meeting new peoples, and building customers trust,  Over the years so much has changed it feels like its no longer about the customer service but about the business. The management in my department is the worst ever."
good,Almost impossible to advance due to favoritism. Management is sometimes unorganized. If you're not apart of the popular group you wont get a promotion.
good,"its an ok job depending on which department you work in. the customers are the most obnoxious people on earth. The managers cater to the customer all the time, even if it hurts the company."
good,Not the best job in the world but I did learn some useful things to use to my advantage in the future. The money was decent but getting paid commission was difficult due to unrealistic sales goals.
good,It was a good experience especially since it was my first job out of high school. It was fast paced and demanding. Providing customer service with a smile while assisting a difficult customer was exhausting.
good,I love how great it all is when you first start and how hands on the training is then a month after you start you're sharked not just be the coworkers but your managers as well? I don't believe the whole side by side selling. I was afraid to ask managers for assistance and guidance in fear they would steal my sale. I started and built the sale just needed assistance in closing it. I ended up walking out of my review because I was met with such immaturity during the review I just laughed and walked out. Then instead of trying to help me relocate I was just let go. This specific manager has had multiple complaints to her before and instead of trying to help someone who met every single sales goal and exceeded long standing #2 or #3 employees I was let go to protect this one. Then three months later someone who came two months after me was then promoted because everyone kept leaving I'm assuming and they were desperate. the assistant managers who actually cared about the employees and were helpful were never promoted and the people who have been with the company for 25+ years who know nordstrom more than the store managers were never given a promotion or even offered it and feared for their job every day.
good,"At Nordstrom IT, our focus is customer experience.  100% of our objectives are to provide unparalleled customer experience.  Employees are passionate and strive to achieve this objective.  As a result, we work with the same mindset.  The hardest part of the job is dev-ops.  I have really gone outside of my comfort zone with server hardware and OS support."
good,I hated working here due to the fact the top sellers could treat other employees carelessly and disrespectfully. I was told positions weren’t open however when those department managers approached me to transfer my manager refused the request when I never applied for her area. Management was terrible and pinned employees against one another.
good,"Highly motivated for customer service being its main focus. Trained daily to enhance customer relations, being that there are repeat customers that come back to the store for the same associate that helped them with their previous purchase."
good,"The pay raises are inconsistent. After 7 weeks training pay was set. the next class to train after me had a totally different pay structure and for the same job, made $1.20 more per hour.  The class after that trained for the same position started at 2.00 more per hour."
good,"although the pay is good, I have never worked at a store so unorganized before. The management wasn't professional at all. It was always overcrowded with not enough staff, so it was stressful."
good,The higher ups are wonderful..but as you climb down the ladder management can either be a hit or miss. Which I believe management should be strong. The whole way up and down the ladder.
good,Opportunity for career development and employee empowerment. They promote from within and if you are mobile there are a lot of opportunities for growth.
good,"When I was first hired on I was given a weird position title, permanent/seasonal. All of my coworkers were extremely nice, but there isn't really a promising career at Nordstrom.  It's awesome if you are going to school.  However, not if you are working 2 jobs. My department manager gave me an ultimatum.  Either I dedicated my time at Nordstrom or she will let me go."
good,typical day at work is arriving and greeting customers .. hoping that the other employee's don't steal your customers when you step off the floor to grab something
good,"I work at Nordstrom RACK as customer service. The managers at my store never seem to be on the same page and are all usually pretty clueless about most things. They change policies randomly and expect every employee to know when it randomly gets changed. I work as a trained cash room employee as well, which you don't even get paid more for, even though you have to go through more training, background checks, and a test in order to do this duty. We get 20% off the merchandise year round. The mangers at my store highlight negative actions more than rewarding positive actions.  We are NOT allowed to have another job at competing stores (i.e. retail). Requesting off is almost always a hassle. They never schedule enough people in customer service so the rest of the floor people always have to come up and help ring out customers."
good,Compensation not explained very well. Difficult to make much commission as long term sales people scarf all the good sales. Management is confrontational.
good,"Nordstrom is such a wonderful company but management is horrible. I am a student and when it came to school, my department manager was not as understanding."
good,This company was cool but watch out there false accusations and people who act like they are in high school. Management has favorites and no room to grow. Don't trust any one cause they turn on you to get a. Higher spot. To many people get fired for wrong things. And. Favorites are promoted rather than a hard worker.
good,"Productive Commission sales that made you earn at your own pace. My first clothing manager was excellent, but my second was substandard. Brick and motar stores are trouble, but it is a superior retail operation."
good,"Nordstrom gives you all the autonomy you want on the sales floor, but does not set you up to actually make commission from your sales. Making commission depends on which department you are placed in, and in the end it is extremely difficult to make over your hourly pay."
good,"Once my supervisor left to start a family, the new manager was a stickler for rules and what corporate wanted. She just wanted to move ahead and make more money."
good,"Nordstrom was a great company to work for overall, but the management wasn't always fair or respectful. Favoritism and being biased were reoccurring problems with the management team."
good,The people I worked with were nice excluding the managers.  They did not do a good job connecting with employees and I eventually became so fed up that I had to quit.
good,Working at the Rack was mostly filled with chaos and drama. You have to be a strong willed and determined person to do well in that kind of atmosphere
good,"Typical day included greeting guest and preventing theft of merchandise."
good,Hardest part is making sales quota and fun engaging with customers and learning about sales and how retail is run.  Learned about treasure hunting and other nordstrom stores
good,I really enjoyed my time at Nordstrom but they switch out managers all the time. Some are better than others but it can really affect the way the store runs. Definitely not enough hours and sorta competitive
good,"Management styles vary, some are very hands on, others have a very light touch. Quarterly meetings are held to keep employees abreast of achievements and opportunities. Work days are filled with expected tasks that are worked regularly, but can include surprise tasks in order to assist the call center located in office. The hardest part of the job is interpreting requests and notes from a large variety of parties, while the most enjoyable part is working with a department that allows you to learn and manage your work without being overbearing."
good,it was an ok place to work but too cut-throat and rude for me. I liked it at the beginning but then I did not get enough hours. It would be a good place for someone who loves competitive sales environment.
good,If it's a fairly busy store you can do well. They only pay in commission for most departments. The cosmetic department pays a base salary with 3% commission on anything you sell. The goals for the department are very high and the salespeople can be cutthroat. Even if the department doesn't have a single customer you are still expected to reach these goals through outreach.
good,"Lots of new learning and change requires quick adaptation to new programs. Opportunities to work at home. Multi-tasking ability required. Very large company, hard to get noticed. Retail stores are main focus so peripheral departments are support. No clear advancement strategies. Young management, not always on task or team driven, lacking in experience, diversity, sound judgement, education. High turnover in both base employee and management roles."
good,"The lack of education and coaching that happens throughout the company is unbelievable. I relocated twice for the company and they didn't help pay for it as a manager. My last manager didn't help me develop my skills and stayed in the office a lot. Overall i had two good mangers and two really poor quality managers, its hit or miss with the company. The day to day stress of making sales and the pressure from the upper management was always felt."
good,"I only need to say if you decide you want to work there,make sure you let management know where you want to be and in how long."
good,"While the culture is there and most employees are friendly, Nordstrom has a pretty cut throat environment.  If you are a sales person, you make decent money off commissions, until the client comes and returns the items and you lose the comissions... FOR UP TO A YEAR from the date they made the purchase.  A lot of managers are juvenile and act unfairly to employees.  Also, as with all retail jobs, there is absolutely no work/life balance."
good,"I honestly don’t really have much to say it a job pretty much just to get back on your feet but I honesty"
good,The pay for part-time is horrible unless you have another job or just don't have any bills. The hours are pretty flexible and negotiable for the most part.
good,I felt that I could only work at Nordstrom temporary. It's definitely not a career path for me. I really didn't like being a sales person. You had to work on commission which wasn't good at all.
good,"It was a fun climate with your co workers, but the pressure that management put onto the sales people created a stressful work environment. As an employee you learn to work through it and make sure that you are focusing on being the best at providing your customer with the best service."
good,Fairly typical non IT company struggling with IT. Being downtown was nice and the pace of work it not difficult. Communication is a problem and drama with a dash of crisis seem to be the management style.
good,"I started at Nordstrom when they had their grand reopening in the Marketplace Cafe. Everything started off great, and then things quickly went downhill."
good,"although i enjoy working for Nordstrom they pay isn't reasonable and the hours are steady. I feel like if Nordstrom is a "" family "" business they should actually look out for their employees. They make is difficult for you to get any benefits threw the company with the hours they give you. I will say I've gain some friends from working there."
good,"Great company culture, very little room for growth from a sales position. Very low pay, long and unusual hours (as expected in any retail sales position)."
good,Working at Nordstrom gave me a great opportunity to meet new people and provide excellent customer services to my clients and the store always look great during the holidays
good,"Whether you have a good or bad experience is totally dependent on the team you are on. "
good,"My schedule was around fabrics high end made to measure clothing for business people."
good,"Overall a great place to work.  Unfortunately, I had many different managers in the same department over 4 years.  It's hard to get ahead when your manager is constantly changing.  They offer many perks but it's ultimately a retail company.  I think there are better opportunities for tech employees."
good,Everyday show up and work hard.  The Store Managers can be nice and supportive but Managers struggle to be great managers.  At the Rack they tend to be in the back and do not get their hands dirty with fellow employees.  Show up everyday and work hard to get noticed by the store manager and moving up in the company will be easy.  Always ask about openings and let your work be the example.
good,"Nordstrom poses itself as a customer and employee friendly company that hires from within. What I saw was a customer friendly company that will give you a promotion if you are drinking buddies with the right manager or have been a top seller for decades. Retail is a dying industry and that is felt no where more than on the floor of a Nordstrom store. Most of your day will be spent processing returns and taking on work that should be handled by management but isn't. Once promoted to management, since the positions are so competitive, upper managers of a store are very relaxed in their roles, seldom responding to the day to day needs of a store. The store manager is often out of touch with what is going on in their own store, this creates an air of chaos and bickering amongst coworkers. Sales staff fight amongst themselves and across departments as everyone is starved for commission. Sales are low and the Nordstrom family and their partners have chosen to continuously undercut their staff by minimizing opportunities for sales staff to make commission thus exacerbating the issue of pay."
good,Upper Management was terrible at communicating with lower management and employees. Everything was done last minute because management would drop the ball on communicating important task. So once they decide to communicate this huge task you only have a day or two to complete it.
good,Very stressful job. You will run into customers who are constantly rude and managers who only care about making money. I was always the top 10 sales people but if you weren't in the top 10 the managers wouldn't care for you.
good,"I learned a lot of the life of Nordstrom, and how much this spot means to many people. Through my time working there I would open and close the registers when the mall was closing or shutting down for the evening. I approached customers asking questions and provided them with certain information abut an item of the day, or a special that could have been going on. Customer service was a big thing, we wanted our customers to be happy, so we would do anything and everything to make them leave happy and would want them to come shop with us again."
good,"The job I worked was simple enough, loading and unloading products part-time.  Sorting out the product and putting prices to be shipped  to local Nordstrom stores."
good,"I admire Nordstrom as a company for their organizational style. When I worked at the warehouse, there were many things that could have been done better. However, everything was brand new and that was growing pains."
good,"the customers make the job cool. Its promote from within however, you must work on the sales floor firs. which can leave you feeling a little stagnant. promotional pay is based on selling salary."
good,"Nordstrom is a fairly good place to work. For me, the job is really not very challenging. To be honest, I am quite bored. But the environment is healthy and they do promote from within. Just not the right fit for me."
good,"The culture in the office does not match the people-oriented culture in the store. There is not enough training or support from managers, and most employees are overworked and under appreciated."
good,Its good if you're okay with working for commission and with a bunch of people who are out to steal your sales. A lot of the girls that I worked with were crabby and working on so many projects that there was almost no way to get a sale in for yourself.
good,"Fix go backs. Dust, clean, trash. Sizing, putting things in their proper place. Help departments that need help like Shoes.  Restock clothing. Open the store, greet and ring up customers. Sales pitch and open rewards/credit cards. Help with the changing room."
good,"Managers come and go, creates stressful environment for employees. Bad eggs easily get into this company. Sales associates are the last employees cared for."
good,have had different managers no clear directions. roles keep changing.technology org keeps changing. benefits are decent. work life balance.nice team and people.
good,"Really fun environment to work in. Management could do better at recognizing hard workers and acknowledging the positive. It's hard to get more than a 3 out of 5 on your evaluation, which is really discouraging when you work really hard. They tend to play favorites when making decisions on promotions. I would recommend working at Nordstrom Rack to anybody, but to move up to fullline as soon as possible if you are needing or wanting to make more money and/or work up."
good,Grateful for such a great opportunity to learn and grown from such a sound establishment. They really value their customers and understand how important the market is for their success.
good,"Great environment and great company to work for. Management needs improvement, lack of communication and trust. Not willing to listen to associates.Not able to move up with the company as easy as it should, when took classes to be promoted. Workplace fantastic, very friendly."
good,Internal teams work together and support each other. Management is out of touch and involved in power struggles. Lack of advancement opportunities. Many projects are last minute and not planned correctly.
good,Great pay and commission. Friendly work environment.  Great customer service experience.  I was able to build meaningful relationships with customers and coworkers.  No longer associated with the company due to changes.  Had to relocated due to closing.  Hostile work environment due to poor management at the Downtown location.
good,"micro management, inability for management to let you work on your own terms. each manager that comes in sets new rules. no set of structure within the environment"
good,"This past year I worked in the shoe department. It's a high energy fun place to work. It can be demanding but you develop relationships with customers very easily. The only downside was during the odd season, there wasn't anything to do. It could be dead for hours and you would have the time to clean the entire backroom. However once that was done, there were times when I would just stand there and literally do nothing because there was nothing to do."
good,"This place gives you a lot of control over how well you do which is nice if you are driven. It is retail hours which can mean late nights and long weekends, but that's when you make the most money. Slow seasons can get stressful, but remember to ride the sales wave till better times. Be sure you work under a great manager because they can make or break your job."
good,"Sales sales sales.  On an every day basis, my ""regular"" customers and fellow sales associates made the day go smoothly.  I absolutely loved my co-workers within my department.  And my manager was one of the best leaders in the business.  Every morning we would have a floor meeting.  That of which involved getting  up to date on what was currently on sale and what to promote to the customers.  Along with getting the moral of the staff up and going.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the ""returns"" that customers brought back.  Which in turn would be taken out of the profits that we as sales people had accumulated."
good,Nordstrom was a very sales oriented competitive workplace. Not much give back to employees. You mainly work off of commission although I enjoyed building relationships with the costumers
good,nice place to work. management can improve. great work environment. people are nice. management need a lil work. a lot of favoritism. a lot of group of people are family.
good,"There is a lot of not so great things to say, for starters they are more of helping themselves instead of helping the employee. You as the employee will make the management look better, they are out for themselves not there to help you grow."
good,"My typical work day consisted of duties that should have been carried out by management. I went above and beyond to make sure the department ran efficiently. On countless occasions, I stayed more than 2 hours past my scheduled shift. At the end of the day, that wasn't good enough according to the unqualified manager they brought in. This manager takes pride in throwing around the title of being manager, instead of focusing on getting the department in order."
good,"This store opened with a lot of fanfare, but quickly fell short of expectations.  Customers were disappointed in the selections, and the lack of popular brands such as St. John, Canali, Ferragamo, and others.  They began to compare the store to Dillards and just walked across the parking lot.  The training for salespeople was hurried and as a result, the Nordstrom culture was not set in place.  In general a great disappointment to employees and customers"
good,good company just not enough growth in mac there was not enough help from mac ctr managers to promote anyone . as far as  nordstrom yes there is room to get promoted but I was not ever interested in that direction I love working for MAC and Nordstrom together.
good,"Overall, this job taught me a lot. I gained an in depth knowledge of how a large business is ran. I also gained valuable communication skills with the costumers. My managers also taught me a lot about how to deal with different problems on the fly."
good,"Very little diversity with staffing. Very few African American working for the company in management and selling associate, Plus don't promote within."
good,"A typical day would consist of reviewing CCTV for over/ shorts, entering customer refund data, checking customer history with regards to refund history with Nordstrom. Occasionally apprehend shoplifters when all required elements were met. Hold monthly shrinkage meetings with employees. ."
good,"If you're a good rep, you can make great money. Tough to compete with online sales. Pricing is also never as low as bloomingdales."
good,"When I had my interview the manager never got super detailed with what you have to do. However having retail experience I didn't think it would be rocket science to figure out. Everything started fine. I had to kinda go for what I know and train myself because management acted so busy they expected for me to know EVERYTHING. Which I didn't. They wanted everyone to bribe customers into signing up for credit cards. Even via Facebook to your friends. The management was very childish they acted as if they were on a high pedestal because of their position. You have one that's a adrenaline junky, one with a attitude problem, one that's too young so she wants to fit in so bad and talk about people in her departments, one that's too sensitive, one that's too laid back, and one that has mixed emotions every shift. North point market center in Alpharetta store #783 is the worst store to work. I wanted to transfer but instead they fired me for a false reason of blaming my schedule issue. The entire store knew I was getting fired except me until the day it happened and everyone just stared at me. Even the HR lady (Beverley) acted spiteful towards me as she gave me a piece of paper. Awful store but Nordstrom as a company is great to work for."
good,"Customers are always taken care of in a timely manner. Management was not that good at understanding sales, salaries, and staff management. Great benefits offered. Some staff were not that pleasant to be around."
good,Co-workers were very enjoyable to work with. I gained valuable learning experience with exceptional customer service and gained more knowledge on fashion. The hardest part of the job was the commission sales as it would lead to unacceptable competitiveness. I enjoyed working with a variety of customers.
good,"Fast paced work environment with strong customer service focus. Shifts are random and include nights, weekends, and holidays."
good,"Typical FOH position making artisan espresso drinks, developing customer service skills, and all general retail expertise required."
good,My typical work day begins with going over daily sales goals and event goals. I help a lot of customers and make phone calls to get customers to come in and shop with me. There is a really high turnover in management. Im my two years of working there I had 4 department managers. It not easy to get promoted either. I believe it easier to come in as a manager.
good,Managers and Higher level management are too harsh due to commission environment. This causes workers to compete and possibly work against each other.
good,Poor management. No job security no matter how long you've been there you can be fired the next day. NO sense of teamwork. People get hours based on who they know :(
good,"Great company"
good,General lack of oppurtunity. Full line stores are consolidating/eliminating positions which makes it hard to grow. There is a constant pressure to increase sales even though as a company sales in the stores are down.
good,I believe that Nordstrom is a great company to work for. They offer great benefits and pay. Where they fall short is the management training.
good,Hard to move up the company and pay is not good. You work too hard and get barely recognized for it. Management is not the best. They say they have open door policy but pick and choose their favorites.
good,"As a manger, you must be available to work everyday all day. If you work under the right person you will move up quickly. Always stay to yourself and never get too personal"
good,"Manager's in some of the departments were not very effective, especially providing support when and where it was needed. "
good,The warehouse is too noisy can hear the announcement well and the goal can even reach cause the task is isnt really easy the time is not worth it especially the 15 minutes break the breakroom is way too far to work station
good,"Extremely competitive work environment, to the point of hostility. I enjoyed watching the transitions of the brands (especially the incorporation of TOP SHOP) but was not worth the misery, and overall daily discomfort."
good,"-Giving a stressfull goal and in balance assignment"
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,"If you're a full time student looking for a part time job, make this your last resort. They were never understanding when I had a lot of work to do for school, never sympathetic. They would get annoyed if I needed to leave for school as well. Also, I was fired from the dress department because the ladies who had seniority over me ""nonchalantly"" made me clean THEIR dressing rooms that THEIR customers were in, so  that I would not be able to make sales. I tried addressing this with my manager and she was not understanding."
good,Overall was a fun experience due to the staff but the management made enjoying the job very difficult.  Whether it be petty tasks that took away from helping customers or being told not to help customers to the fullest extent because there is no policy on their issue made it quite frustrating.  A little more freedom to help the customers with their issues would be nice.
good,Good program that allows you to learn all about the retail business. Good customer service and training given to the employees. Promised promotions that happen a lot later then told.
good,Enjoyable place to work with rallies and company gathering. Culture is held at a high expectation. However some management needs a attitude adjustment.
good,I loved Nordstrom. Fun Trendy environment. No work/life balance. Ted are way to many events to keep up with. Goals can be exceedingly high. Great co-workers
good,"Far commute from the city, fun internship get to see a lot of the business side."
good,"Great company to work for!"
good,"I have worked at Nordstrum Rack for nearly a year which to most people would not be that long, but considering the revolving door of the store I work in, it is one of the longest times anyone has stayed. The job has it's good and bad days as any other would when it comes to the actual working portion of the job. Of course weekends are always the busiest, the fitting room and putting clothes back up on these days being the ""hardest"" part of the job. Although even on the busiest and hardest of days, the most enjoyable part of the job is the small group of co-workers that always manage to make things better. Though there are the few other co-workers that always seem to find a way to push just the right button, again as you would have at any job, but it's those few that also make things very hard at times. Management at the store I work in is very good at playing favorites, if you don't fit in to their favorite group of people do not expect to be listened to. I was also told at the beginning of my career that certain things (such as reward cards and e-receipts) would not be required, only in the end to be punished for my slow months and have my hours taken away from me. Management is not the brightest, does not listen to the employees when they have something to say (when not a favorite), is good at throwing people under the bus when it is beneficial... let's just say in general does not take care of employees. I have never worked in such an unprofessional environment, and never have I been treated so horribly in a work place. It would not be a bad job under other circumstances,"
good,competing with close co workers for sales/hours/and customers. Managers played favorites.  Although working in retail there was no team collaboration or trend knowledge shared.
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for if you are looking to grow a career.  You have the opportunity to grow up the ladder but the higher you go the more it doesn't promote good life balance.
good,"Very great learning opportunity:  typical day was pleasant, customers generally nice and liked hand holding aspect.  Management supportive.  Hardest part of job was dealing with the very high school atmosphere of co-workers.  But I learned!  Best part of job:  surrounded by lovely merchandise."
good,"I really enjoy my coworkers and the sales environment and customer relations. The hardest part was the the commission structure, when the store was busy I could depend on a good paycheck but then when it wasn't and they cut hours is was challenging  and at times very difficult."
good,"Scout for potential customers, as customer approaches your department you approach to become their consultant.  After assisting with finding what they like, you input their personal information into the customer contacts.  The best part of the job are the customers, they come back to see you.  The pay is based on a draw, if you do not hit your quota, it is drawn from your pay  That was the hardest part.   Enjoyable part was the customers that come back to see you, they request you by name."
good,"Fast paced, very structured. I have learned to embrace change and view it as a positive. I have worked with my co-workers for many years and enjoy working with them everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with daily."
good,great environment with great person. loved everything about it.
good,"People are great, but your experience depends solely on your manager.  This is normally the case no matter where you work, but a bad experience at Nordstrom can poison the well."
good,"This job was only a temporary position soo I can not state how well they treated their full time employees, however, the management staff was a joy to work for."
good,"sales. I learned how to sale women clothing, didn't really work with management. Usually worked alone in my department. The hardest part of my job was when the customer returned the clothing they purchased,cause we worked on commission. The most enjoyable part was seeing the ladies in new clothing."
good,This company is great for employees that are just starting out. You are most valuable if you're a high selling sales employee.  If you have or want a family it gets difficult with sales the day after most important family holidays and summer time.
good,"it takes too long to move from positions. great training, management is constantly given new tasks, compensation is low compare to other retailers"
good,"nothing special always work different shifts"
good,Greet customers and help them with a wardrobe. The best part about this job was meeting all wonderful new people daily. The hardest part was managing school and work. Also maintaining a social life. 
good,"my is fast paced and sometimes non stop production. Teamwork and leader, as well as communication is key."
good," If this defines your personality, you'll do great here cause you get rewarded for exceeding your sales goals no matter who you stab or step on to the make it happen! Its only about the numbers and you are kidding  if you think you're a valued and respected team member cause you are only if you rank a 4 or are a pacesetter. The minute those sales start declining you become transparent to them & you only hold their attention long enough for someone representing Nordstrom to remind you, you havent opened enough accounts, you havent lied to enough people to get their personal information into your personal book, so you can harrass them by phone, a procedure called a calling campaign (mandatory) on a monthly to bi-monthly basis to lure them in one of their endless list of promotional events in order to seperate them from as much of their money as you can!"
good,"Nordstrom is a top rated company on the outside chosen by Fortune 500 as one of the top 100 best places to work.  This is based on the fact that the company has profit sharing and benefits available to all FT and PT employees.  From the inside, I would say that I learned a lot about business management while working there.  However, advancement isn't based on tenure or even financial performance of your department.  It is cut-throat environment where people are rewarded because they do nothing but work (no time for family or life outside of work) or because they are able to use what influence they have to cut down the competition."
good,"Commission based, easy hours, learned about different customers."
good,resolve customer issues relating to purchases and credit accounts
good,I have been at Nordstrom for 12 years. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with customers. The hardest part of my job by far are the night and weekend hours. I am ready for a career with day hours.
good,I started working for Nordstroms in the cosmetics department because I love makeup and wanted the experience. There was not a lot of job security or friendly culture because the sales floor was a shark tank and there was a lot of competition. I liked my co-workers but management was poor.
good,"Pluses: If you are making your metrics with Nordstrom they will help you go anywhere. They are very interested in advancing people and promotions are strictly from within, They have a great Mananagement Training Program and they fully support relocation to any other store in the country if traveling interests you. If you're a good sales person they will move you up to management fairly quickly too."
good,Hours tend to get cut if you are hourly. Focus is opening credit cards.
good,"Nordstrom would be an amazing company to work for if they followed their own advice. They boast of a great working culture with a work/life balance, but then don't enforce it store-to-store, particularly: overnight shifts with almost no notice, long shifts with no break, a lack of constructive criticism and coaching, and a deaf-ear from HR and upper-management."
good,"As a Nordstrom Rack shoes sales associate, a typical day consists of replenishing the sales floor, sizing and reticketing shoes, and making sure that they are placed in the correct area, along with putting away go backs from the customer service and fitting room areas. One thing that I have learned from working at Nordstrom Rack is that when you engage customers and try to figure out what it is they are looking for, not only are they willing to buy more shoes, but they are also less likely to leave shoes on the floor. Management at the particular Nordstrom rack that I work in could better. For instance, I had informed my manager a month in advance that I needed to change my availability because I am about to start graduate school and I can't have my hours conflict with my school schedule, and she gave me a hard time about changing my schedule up until I informed my store manager about the situation. I work with a wonderful group of people. Since most of my coworkers are around the same age as I am, it is easier to communicate and understand each other, and we are able to create for ourselves a fun working environment. The most difficult part about my job is the fact that my schedule is inconsistent. For instance, last week I close every single day that I was working, and the week prior to that I was working more opening than closing shifts. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to network and build a rapport with my customers."
good,"Really focused on productivity, results and learning, New initiatives daily, never live the same day twice. The hardest part of the job is the lack of constructive feedback, work/life balance and general morale from leadership. I most enjoy the people, the ability to make decisions, providing of constuctive feedback, growing a team from good to great and getting their buy-on through mutual understanding and respect. I love taking initiative to grow my own business."
good,"Despite working 10-11 hour days, the time went by quickly because of the amount of work that needed to be done. Sadly, there wasn't much anyone could take from that job and apply it somewhere else unless it was another company that offered the same kind of work. Honestly the only thing I learned was how to tape a box properly for shipping."
good,its good if you just wana make $
good,"Retail in general, no matter where you work, and especially if you're working for a commission, is extremely competitive and stressful. This is not a job for someone who isn't interested in hard selling and isn't good at selling. If you want an easy, get-by retail job for clerks, then my advice is to apply to Nordstrom Rack or a lower-end store. The Nordstrom FLS (Full Line Stores) only want top sellers, people who have the potential to be top sellers, and people who are willing to work harder than most people working in retail positions. I worked for a Nordstrom FLS for two years, then transferred to Nordstrom Rack. I was a top-top seller and a quarterly pacesetter until business became slow and more people in my dept. were hired with more sales experience. The competition and the work level is strenuous. I was very aggressive, and I had to be very aggressive at selling, if I wanted to keep my job. An then the dreaded RETURNS, coming right out of your pay check. The only reason that I will ever work for this company again is to work a seasonal or part time position for extra money. I discovered that I was very good at putting together outfits for customers, but not as good when it came to selling and making instant connections with customers. My PTR (Productivity Track Rating) was inconsistent. I'd get a high sales rating one week, then a low, then a mid, then high again. It was just too much pressure for a retail job that paid a salary that was below $30,000. Had to get a much better job, a much more reasonable work load, and oh, A LIFE!"
good,if you sell well and bring in a lot of money you can get away with anything. work place culture is in favor of those whom befriend management and are a doter
good,Staying Focus and providing customers with excellent customer service to make goals. Training staff on new technology to make their selling experience impactful with their clients.
good,"Worked seasonal part-time for 39.75 hours a week. Pacesetters are very welcoming of new employees because they know no one will be kept after seasonal. A month into seasonal and i got very competitive and very catty.  I did not build any long lasting friendships because everyone went to ""do their job and not make friends."" It made work long and dragging. Management seems to be hiding most of the time and never on the floor. The only thing I enjoyed was being able to go to e-bar often and catching up with other departments when its slow. Also, the store policies are not strictly enforced when it comes to customers. Policies change depending on the situation so it gets frustrating when dealing with customers and their various experiences with other sales employees."
good,i enjoyed doing my job and only left due to medical issues.  i stayed busy and earned a fair hourly wage.  Discount was great and people were amazing.  Very flexible
good,"Unless you're not a 20+ year employee or have the right connections; you will not get ahead. Turnover is high and you will be demanded to pick up the slack due to poor planning and staffing. Also, your hours are not guaranteed. One week you're working 40 hours and the next managers are asking for voluntary leave."
good,"At Nordstrom Rack there were many things that were to be done throughout the day by myself. I had to ring people out, hang clothes, ask for donations, organize sensors, handle money, take out trash, restock any missing materials, repackage items, and still manage to stay busy when it was not very busy. The management there was not the best none of the managers seemed to be on the same page when it comes to some of the policies. I had a great time working there but as I was there the environment did change it seemed as if there was a lot of choosing and favoritism going on. The hardest part of the job was to open credit cards but every month I made my quota. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I knew that I could always come into work knowing that I had people I liked to be around and work around. I learned a lot working there especially about retail and how those companies work."
good,The schedule is not flat. One day mornin and another evenings. Doesn’t help with to have another job. There was a situation where somebody crossed my sale and I didn’t like that. Also the paying doesn’t cover my basic needs.
good,"Only full time will get benefits(insurance, dental etc.) after you work 390 hours, and take another month for checking."
good,workplace culture is evolving.  commute from the north-end is challenging. bonus metrics change each year and should be consistent.  division culture varies by leader.
good,If you like just and ish company then this is the place for you. If you like working all the time with no time for personal life. Then this is the place for you.
good,"First, I applied and was employed as a part-time seasonal worker.  I ended up working around 35 hours a week, with odd hours (sometimes to midnight or 1am).  I had requested a limit of 20-25 when I interviewed as I had school full time.  Though, the pay was good."
good,i have learned a lot in Nordstrom. Management mostly is good. Workplace culture in general is decent. Enjoyable to be around interesting people and hard working ones.
good,Personal retail is not my thing but it's ok for now. They have flexible hours if you are going to school. If you want to move up with the company than you have to be full time and vocal about it.
good,They do have ok benefits. Managers need classes on how to manage. Managers do not train new employees. Peers do the training. Not much for rules and regulations. You’ll learn what not to do after you do it. Logistics are a team who do the grunt work at the lowest pay in the company. Selling departments differ by ‘class’ ie who makes more money
good,"The hardest part of the job- selling credit cards, and customers yelling at me or telling me that I'm not good enough at my job. People were really rude, one of my managers, who was 22, hated me after I asked to be let off an hour early. Which was pretty immature in my opinion."
good,"I worked during summer and winter when i was coming home from college and used it as a seasonal job. i wouldn't recommend it long term unless you like retail and want to go into retail management, otherwise I think there are better things you can do with your degree if you went to college."
good,Being a part-time worker allowed students to focus on other important things such as school while earning money to support themselves but the clown stuff was cool
good,If you do not meet their set quota you will get written up and eventually fired. It can sometimes be stressful to work in an environment such as this.
good,Good job pays great but it’s an extremely fast paced environment and they want you to try and sell there credit cards but you get $5 per card you sell
good,"I worked for Nordstrom for 2 years, 6 months at Nordstromrack.com as a product stylist & 1.5 years at a retail location. Overall not a bad job or company, but one that isn’t fair in the pay structure for the retail associates. Online takes up a large amount of company profit & they encourage customers to utilize it. That’s great for the customers, but not so much for sales associates working on commission. They do offer benefits, so that is a plus. It’s just not a position most can really survive on alone."
good,"management was constantly unorganized and staff we're left to figure out things on their own, lots of company gossip, overall not a great place to work"
good,It's an ok place to work for a retail job.  Benefits are very good but the pay is low (although it is better than Macy's and other mid range department stores).
good,"I personally did not have a good experience during my time at Nordstrom. I took the position with the understanding that I would move up to management and not just stay in a commission only environment. After interviewing with the store manager at the time, and having a completely unprofessional experience with her, I was told I wouldn’t be enrolled in the management program required because it went by seniority."
good,"Management needs to have quarterly reviews of the ADA laws because I have spoke with friends and coworkers who have experienced large businesses who have broken ADA laws without consequence too many times, but small businesses always bend over backwards to comply because small business owners have to time to invest in relationships with their workers."
good,"Had a quota for the day, had to help customers all the time. "
good,Some of the people can be very childish you just gotta keep to yourself and only associate with a few. It’s like higshchool but in a work environment. Some managers are the best and then you have others who do everything in their power to knock you down. You have literally no life outside of this job
good,"It was great at first, learned a lot about the retail industry. But since they moved managers it has been horrible managing and schedules.  Many can say they care more about the costumers then their employees, yes they have done great stuff for us but it does not make up for  the problems they have ignored and because of those problems it caused many more.  Ive seen people quit on their second day but if you are a caring manager please apply and be my guest at changing the whole environment and scene in that place."
good,"I worked for Nordstrom for roughly five years and enjoyed all but the last six months, in which pay was reduced for all starting staff, benefits were moved to a a less satisfactory provider, management was drastically changed/reduced and work expectations rose dramatically above what they were previously despite pay reductions."
good,"As someone in school and working part-time at Nordstrom, I sometimes found it hard to balance school, work, at one point an internship as well and a social life. "
good,"Typical retail store, it's slow and tedious. I didn't enjoy the strict schedule and strange hours. I found it was a decent seasonal job the pay was good, but long term it would drain you."
good,"I felt as if collectively department managers were not given the proper training and tools to build and develop a cohesive team. "
good,"Fast pace environment, really big on efficiency and being customer obsessed. It's important to have knowledge on store products. I leaned to be professional at all times"
good,"He's not bad but they could have done much better in hiring an engineering manager.  He micromanages, which is the lowest form of management styles, and seems oblivious to how he treats people.  I would recommend this company but definitely not this manager."
good,It was an easy work environment but not much progression in advance in regards to a career. People really don't vibe with each other. A lot of pretend relationships.
good,"* Clean and upbeat environment "
good,The ridiculous return policy makes it difficult to earn commissions. Cutting commission percentage is not the answer to failing business. Reviewing the return policy is a better solution.
good,"Good work-life balance in most of my positions. Downfall is, slow for company to make decisions and clarity who the decision maker is. Has been a good place to work - collaborative."
good,"Overall Nordstrom is a great company. I worked as a salesperson and then moved into the art team dressing mannequins, display windows, and lighting the floor. "
good,Nordstrom is a good starting point and you learn a lot of basics through coworkers and on the job experience. Management isn't much help as they are generally just passing through and trying to make it to the next promotion.
good,"This is a great opportunity for people who love fashion and have strong customer service skills. Be prepared to spend all weekends and holidays at work, no exceptions."
good,"It was a good job to help advance my sales abilities. However, the company is slowly going downhill by not supporting their employees enough. Almost like they want you to bake a cake, but take away your flour, eggs and butter. It wasn’t always like this, but as most retail stores, customer presence isn’t the same therefore effecting in-store sales."
good,"Working at E-bar was alright, i didn't like the way management was being dealt with. Sort of made the play a bit hostile. The people i worked with were kind and very diverse. Minimal to no drama, it was very appreciated."
good,"For two years I felt underestimated by my managers because I started working here at 14. With the pressure, it motivated me to try harder and to become a reliable employee. Unfortunately, the managers kept switching so I was back to square one every time. Being a part of the team was enjoyable since I met great people and pitched ideas for the new fashion line, but eventually it didn't work out for me especially because of my schooling."
good,"Nordstrom can be a great place to work or a terrible place to work. If you are lucky enough to have a great manager then you'll love it. If not, you'll probably hate it. Expect long hours on your feet & competitive co-workers. It's better than most retailers but if you don't have incredible sales skills you won't go far."
good,"Fast paced environment especially on rainy days and sales days. It was a fun part time job, but it was very hard to advance and get full time hours. The plus side are the mall hours and discounts you receive from the company."
good,"It’s definitely a fun place to work if you have the right  management crew running the place.  The first time I started it was a great fun place to work, managers were awesome! The store manager was awesome! But after the previous  store manager left.  Place wasn’t very good after the new store manager came in basically ran everyone out.  It was either her way or the highway. Simply ran the place down hill to work for."
good,"Typical day involves sorting out department clothing, unboxing and lifting shipments, and online. web order fulfillment. Pretty much straightforward tasks. Management was decent, as long as you. did your thing then everything was fine. The Nordstrom work environment can be hasty and competitive if you're in sales. Some sales associates won't help you find certain products because they don't want to loose any sale potential. Overall, decent job for extra money."
good,"Always working, even when you weren’t at work. Emails from managers after hours to do things, called into work on days off. Forced to hire/fire employees you were not comfortable with doing. Forced to meet unachievable goals and felt like job was in jeopardy if you didn’t meet goal. Poor store manager."
good,Stressful for sales associates from management lack of work ethic and pressure. inconsistency of work hours per week. super competitive but no  opportunity within the company to grow.
good,"The work isn't hard, the management expects a lot from their teams. Management does treat team members unfairly a good amount of the time, willing to point out flaws but not giving ways to improve. "
good,"Nordstrom is a decent company to work for if retail is something that you are passionate about. There aren't tons of opportunities for grow unless mobile, so keep that in mind. Work is fairly simple and to the point, very customer/sales driven."
good,"There’s a lot of restructuring that goes on and changes to the business. Employee roles change pay, job titles, and even demotions. They promote from within but they also downsize too. And most movement is based on networking rather than good old labor."
good,Loved working with children in the kid shoe department. Job was very organized. Didn't like the fact that if someone returned items it was taken out of your check.
good,"Unless you drink the koolaid, this isn't the place for you. Being in the store is very much a popularity contest. People are promoted what seems more on their ability to drink said koolaid more than the actual ability of the individual."
good,"Great employee benefits and opportunity for advancement. However, since the store was very new, things were trial and error and work responsibilities were all over the place. "
good,Efter 11 år hos Nordströms med kundkontakter hos byggentreprenören vill jag gå vidare som leverantör för återförsäljare.
good,"Great place to work if you have little ambition or are just somewhat inexperienced. It's a job, it's comfortable, very little stress, very little change...amazing if you have a family or something else where career is not your #1 or #2 priority... if it is, however, and you want to be challenged, pushed, surrounded by smart, invigorating and hard working ppl, go elsewhere.  It's run by higher-ups with a very traditional retail mentality, and it's not how you do, but simply who you know. A great mentality, work ethic, enthusiasm and results don't matter, it's about how much you ""don't rock the boat"" that leads to success."
good,"I worked in stock and it was really fun at times and also stressful. You'll learn what they want you to learn when they feel like they need you for something, promotions are very rare. management shows a lot of favoritism. the hardest part of the job is the hours you tend to be in the 15 to 35 hours a week range peak season included. I did enjoy working at Nordstrom regardless. benefits are for full time employees but by what they consider full time."
good,"For a college job it's an alright job. Duties depend on if  you are opening (easiest), mid (preferred), or closing (hardest). Unless you have legit restrictions in your availability, if you are a new hire they will give you a mix of shifts at first but once you are settled, they will hit you with all closing shifts and expect you to be ok with coming 4-9:30 every time with no break. Manager is nice until she starts micromanaging you and you realize she doesn't really care about you on a personal level nor the work you do but if you do one thing wrong, be prepared to be coached (written up). Workplace is cut-throat, employees that have been there for 1+ years will come after you and talk behind your back while management is aware but nothing gets done about it. High school drama all over the place, especially with 2 of the oldest employees, they are the source of it. Super unprofessional and stressful. Hardest part of the job would be dealing with hours and coworkers who don't do their part and let you to die on the bar when it's busy, besides dealing with needy boca customer who are never contempt and expect you to even put the straw on their drink, if you are part time they will barely give you hours and if you are full time they will also cut some hours too unless you re one of the two older employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting free coffee and drinks on your shifts, that's it. Overall, it could be an awesome job if it wasn't for the manager, the coworkers, the benefits (no benefits nor PTO when you are part time until you reach like 1,000 hours and its"
good,Nordstrom it’s self is a very good job but the service experience managers need to treat employees better and be fair all across the board just improve somethings.
good,fast and competitive. unless you have an amazing manager you’re work to social life ratio is unbalanced. depending on your sales you can live paycheck to paycheck.
good,with Shopping in decline it is difficult to meet sales goals. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for several hours. Being expected to match or succeed your hourly pay by commission is difficult due to low traffic.
good,Most of the business happens between noon and one so most of the time you're either cleaning or completing side work. There are better jobs out there.
good,"It was a positive and negative experience. I learned quite a bit and had some very successful months, but retail is a roller coaster industry, especially in this age of everything being online accessible."
good,"Although most sales positions give you the opportunity to make commission, it is unlikely you will make any extra money from commission. This is because the full-time employees have a monopoly on the good customers, and to be honest this store just does not have a large customer base. They dont offer holiday pay to Seasonals or new employees, and seasonal periods are only 6 weeks, overall Seasonal's will get scraps. Although Nordstrom does offer a higher than average hourly wage. "
good,It was a decent job but there’s lots of favoritism and the commission can suck sometimes. Didn’t trust my co workers they would steal my customers. Overall it was an okay job I guess.
good,Theres a lot of office politics here. Managers really don't care about anything else other than how much sales your making. Being a team player doesnt really matter here
good,Even though it’s a great company to work for I was unable to make enough money with all the returns. The 401k was great but insurance was not.  I know I could always go back.
good,"Good company to work for, fair management but the rules are many. No lunch break only two 15 minute breaks. They have mandatory overtime of 6 10 hour shifts. Very hard on your body."
good,"Dont have nothing else to say about this nothing spectacular. why am i being forced to speak about this place why vant i movwe on to the next part of this website, if the informaton is confiendtial then why force more from people"
good,Nordstrom is a very Safe-Productive  fun Friendly environment where you can get to know all of your co workers and enjoy your day on the job & still get your job done
good,"I liked the idea of the restaurant the chef was excellent, the store was slow so the restaurant peaked during holiday times. The manager was somewhat disconnected from the team so it was tense at times."
good,"High expectations to reach out to customers for new and repeat business. Competitive yet fun environment. My current position allows me to sell all products in the beauty department including; makeup, skincare, fragrance and hair care. Exceeding my sales goals on a monthly basis places me on track to become a pacesetter, top producer in the store."
good,You will work at least five days a week sometimes 6 if we have intentory. Days are long and if there are no customers you will not make money. The discount isn't that great either. The people you work with are fun but it is all about the business and how much money you make them.
good,"Management has moved from a Supportive Management to a Dictator Management, that is directly from an Assistant Manager.  The culture has definitely gone down hill during my 7.5 years with the company.  They work seasonals hard with all of the overtime, most do not stay on or come back.  The job market has made it harder to recruit for our busy times, now most of the seasonals have English as a second language."
good,"Company culture was not stellar, but if you advocated for yourself, there was room for growth. "
good,"Learned a lot of skills when it came to working with people!"
good,"The former regional manager of the restaurant was a misogynistic, small-minded unprofessional with a ""big fish in a small pond"" mentality, who treated women very poorly and disrespectfully. Their Human Resources Department was an even bigger joke, so unprofessional, so one-sided.  I thought HR was supposed to support employees and help through grievances."
good,"I have worked at multiple Nordstroms, full line, regular Rack and XTG Racks. Least favorite in the XTG. However it is a learning experience. There is not a lot of room for self involvement. The day consists of tasks that are to be completed in a timely matter that is given. It is just a different way that this side of the company works. All in all I have had a great experience with the company as a whole. It is not a hard job at all. In my late teens early twenties the company taught me social skills and personal productivity and giving and achieving goals. In my thirties the company has been there for me in a way I can earn some money and still have my children come first. Which is not easy as a single mother. Forever great full but ready for a change."
good,"Nordstrom was a good company to work for especially if you're looking for seasonal summer and holiday gigs. However, they have poor management communication in the logistics division. College students apply here!"
good,"Great place to be. Met a lot of friendly faces and once you become settled inn you can begin to shop with the same people repeatedly. "
good,Nordstrom as a whole is a great company to work for. I unfortunately worked under terrible management and even after speaking to HR multiple times no resolve was every given. I did not feel there was a sense of Job security and at times I was made to choose between my job or my family. That is not a choice anyone should have to make.
good,Over all the place has competitive pay in comparison to its competition in  the market but advancement is dependent on whether the boss likes you not how well you do or how hard you work.
good,The two people I point out where only there to take more money and give less to the hard workers they would eat for free while we paid for are food at a discount .
good,"Pay compensation is average, my particular experience with the management was very gossipy and back stabbing. It reminded me of a more political setting where you couldn't really trust the smiles in your face. They preach advancement opportunity but do not provide the opportunities."
good,you have to work very long hours with little recognition and compensation. if you are not the department manager expect to work every single weekend and don't dare complain.  very poor management everyone sits around and gossips about other department managers. maybe it was just the store I was at but it was horrible the department manager had no idea what she was doing in the shoe department and the store manager was clueless. I had to teach my self things and everything was extremely unorganized.
good,If you’re looking to make good money it’s best to work during holiday and sale time however returns definitely hurt you. Also management needs work. Some managers  are unprofessional and I even had a manager steal a sale from me  and yell at me on the sales floor in front of customers and upper management didn’t do anything about it
good,Nordstrom is an ok workplace. Not many opportunities for advancement. the discount is not great and the returns are overwhelming. The returns decreases your income.
good,With commission based jobs you are always looking over your shoulder for the next customer and who is stealing the next customer. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet.
good,"I worked for Nordstrom for over 15 years.  One bad manager can be your downfall....whomever get HR's ear first usually wins in this company.  Work life balance was decent on the right team.  I had many wonderful leaders, one very very bad one."
good,"For the most part I really loved working at Nordies!  The people are the best part of the company."
good,"Working here was cool the first 2 months until you realized the entire company stuff are like a bunch of high school girls. The employees are so cliquey and the managers don't make it any better. If certain managers didn't like you or managers from other departments who didn't like you would result in working less and less hours each week, or your hard earned commision being stolen by other employees."
good,"If you're a good sales person and thrive in a fast environment, you will love it here. It's stressful, though, because your paycheck is based on your sales and you have to meet sales goals. Money is king and your loyalty is not really rewarded. "
good,"if you start in the morning you had to attend the morning meeting and if you closed you attend the closing meeting. talked about yesterdays goal, today's goals. Helping customers find the item they need, checking stock and other days we would have inventory."
good,"Long holiday hours were required, and you didn't know when you switched to 7 day mandatory. Management was very detached, you didn't know who to go to with issues"
good,"It's a grind.  Adding a restaurant into a retail environment was a good strategy for them, but combine the stress of working in a restaurant with the stress of being in a mall from November to January.  The money is good, but it will crush your soul."
good,"Fairly simple, everyone lives off commission. Educated yourself on anything and everything. Cross selling really helps sales. Theres lots of room to grow, different departments always have opportunities."
good,"My least favorite job because of the micromanagement when working both with both Credit and the Rack. They are very strict about appearance (will send you home for chipped nail polish), encourage you to buy their product (vicious cycle of money going to me back to them), favoritism/ clique-y, almost unhealthy competitiveness promoted and ignored when it steps over the line. The main reason people like working for Nordstrom is because you can make a lot of money with commission, but you have to have a cut-throat attitude to overstep your ""competition"" i.e. your co-workers which contradicts the whole ""team"" aspect they are trying to convey. If you already look like you work at Nordstrom, can cater to fussy, high maintenance customers and you dig the intense competition (be ready for that ""I didn't come here to make friends"" attitude), then maybe this is the place for you. I had co-workers hate it then turn to love it when they found how easy it was to move up and around in the company. Nordstrom is very loyal, I will give them that. If you stay on good terms with them, you can float around within the company (even off and on if you have school or something)."
good,Working for Nordstrom definitely helped me gain experience in the retail field. I sold products that I knew nothing about previously so i gained a tremendous amount of knowledge.
good,the company pays well but the management is terrible. its all about politics and whether or not they like you. over all its decent if you just keep to yourself. other than that i dont recommend it.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with great team members to solve customer pain points.  Nordstrom truly wants to do what is best for the customer.
good,"Based on merchandise delivery and space availability for inventory "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and employees. In my opinion, management wasn't very consistent and the workplace culture was extremely competitive."
good,this company will micro manage you all day. Management is very young. They work the managers until they are burned out. store discount is a plus. nice merchandise
good,"They were terrible at scheduling."
good,"Working at Nordstrom is good place to work when you are in between jobs. Enjoyed working with customers and finding solutions to their fashion needs."
good,"Busy enviornment,  poor management . Good people to work around,  descent compensation for work required but could be better. Management could be more productive and helpful on sales floor  ."
good,Manager at the time was not helpful to the employees. Did not put herself in the position to help her employees. Very stressful environment to be in under her management
good,"The store manager was catty, gossiped, and wanted you to kiss her behind enough for her to consider promoting you up further. Spent over a year trying to move up with the company, and she declined me every time. Management gossiped on eachother and associates, and same with associates. Loss prevention was a good team, aside from one hiccup. Sales teams were well run. Love the clothing and shoes, and love their benefits and debit card option. Opening credit/debit cards for customers were easy to obtain."
good,"I am still working for the company, just got transfer to Santa Monica store, it has been great experience for me... "
good,"I'm not a fan of commission because it takes time away from truly assisting customers and puts too much pressure on employees to up-sell every customer. The waters are filled with sharks when I worked here and the atmosphere felt like high school again with people clicking up, talking behind each others backs and spreading rumors. The best position to have here is in the customer service department if you don't want the stress of selling."
good,"great work enviorment."
good,I loved the job. I was successful at it aswell. Too bad it was seasonal because I feel strongly that I would have been a great asset to my team and ot the company.Thank you for the opportunity
good,A day of working at Nordstrom can sometimes be very long and stressful if there is an event taking place. The need to push sales is going to be very important if you plan on succeeding in your role. However sometimes there is a lack of walk through business that will in return make your days very long and often make goals impossible to reach. If you are not a salesman you may not want to apply for this position because it requires a lot of cold calling reaching out and getting customers to become your permanent  clientele.
good,The company has changed so much in the past 5 years.  Management quality has severely declined and caused me to leave the company.  I am highly disappointed in how this company has evolved and changed.  It used to be a great work environment but it has changed into a stressful one.
good,"A typical day included at least two condescending customers, one remark from management, and a whole bunch of miscommunication. Even coworkers know how to treat each other like dirt."
good,manditory hours are tough and work is long. repetitive movements and long miles to walk is hard on the body. When they don't need you they send you home early. But pay is good if your willing to tolerate.
good,"Don't expect good training from the management or other sales reps. Stealing sales and arguing over clients was a regular issue, as was hiding products for personal purchases."
good,"The company really does care about its employee by offering great benefits and saying that they will help and provide the tools to advance your career within Nordstrom. People who have been with the company for 4+ years, especially in management do what ever they please. Commission can get messy. Bad environment if you can't trust your coworkers and your managers are never to be found."
good,"I left Nordstrom for many reasons, mainly over-staffing and inability to get sales. Harassing customers to buy expensive shoes during a bad economy. Too many people on the sales floor made it impossible to get sales during slow months. Worked more than 40 hours a week, barely made draw - after one year of working there, I made less than minimum wage. Returns come straight out of your paycheck up to one year after the item is returned. Additionally, often other people would steal your sales (when people made exchanges). I liked my managers & coworkers, but overall, you cannot make money here, unless you like hounding every person that walks through your department."
good,The environment gets heavy and brings stress when you don’t make your SPH because of the area you live in. Managers yell at you for things that were their fault but expect you to get the responsibility for. Being yelled at in front of customers and cutting your shifts until you want to quit.
good,"Nordstrom is a great name to have on your resume and working here teaches you a lot about great customer service.  However, it  is purely commission based and that can be an uncomfortably competitive environment."
good,"A typical day at work consists of aiding customers, following up on orders, sizing and organizing items, conflict resolution, and of course, cashiering. I learned that even though I am good at sales, I do not like it. I learned about business processes and got a better idea of job advancement, but it was too slow and not rewarding enough to be worth it to me. Unfortunately, my management is quite passive aggressive and does not set their team up for success; in fact, they sabotage the productivity of their team by intentionally moving items around to see if you are taking care of your section...not cool. The culture is fairly positive, but there are a few established employees who are very condescending to people who are newer. The hardest part was worrying about sales when you weren't at work, but the easiest part was deeply connecting with customers."
good,The famous Nordstrom  has become a constant push to get customers into the store to buy in an economy that is more focused on ON-Line purchases.  This situation has caused Management to become relentless in its pressure to call customers over and over.
good,"Great for young people on the fast track, get into back of house is where it is at if selling is not for you, over all great company. Make sure your able to work any and all hours, and all weekends"
good,Stressful  place to work for new promoted manager. Did not have guidance that was offered. Was thrown in this position to pick up pieces from absent dept. manager.
good,They need to check on managenent so that they are fair and not abuse there position when an employee doesn't see things there way or doesn't agree with them
good,"So, I really liked working with my clients and i loved the overall company culture of Nordstrom. "
good,"I have been working with the Nordstrom Rack for about two years in the Merchandise & Inventory team, working with a revolving door of employees and managers. Your flexibility is a must to these stores, they will want you as early as 6 in the morning and as late as 2 in the morning. However, that does not extend to you getting to be as flexible as you will want to be, especially if you would like to keep the benefits Nordstrom Rack carries. On average you will need to be working 32 hours weekly in order to maintain benefits, yet in the time I spent working, this is much easier said than done. As a full time associate there would be weeks I worked well under the 30 hour mark off-season, while still having to work 5 days a week, it can end up becoming very inconsistent. Managers can also be very inconsistent, especially in terms of communication with each other and the employees. Often putting schedules out with shifts given outside of your availability, or one handling certain store procedures in a wildly different manner than another. Good luck trying to be promoted from within either, they will pull someone from the Full Line Nordstrom inexperienced with the Rack culture before they will bring someone already possessing leadership skills up to the position. The best part of the day is really the other coworkers you will be spending your time with, as they make the time go by that much quicker. Overall I did enjoy my time with the company, if only the so-called ""most important part of the team; the employee"" felt more important than expendable."
good,While employed here I was happy with some management and not so happy with most employees. I had a kitchen fire and a car accident the next day with a doctors excusing me from two days of work and still received a points on my attendance.
good,Nordstrom is a great place to shop not so much to work at. The pay is average and the management is very political. As soon as one sees you doing too well good luck keeping your job.
good,"•         Providing outstanding customer service. "
good,"I work 3rd shift. It is one of those shifts you really don't have a life unless you get 3 days off a week. "
good,Nordstrom will emphasize and do what they can in order to meet goals as well as always emphasizing great costumer service. The culture in Nordstrom is very specific and hard to grasp if one can not adapt.
good,The issue is with lack of educated management and the abusive return policy. The sales associate has the potential to make as much money as possible if it wasn't for the open return policy which has become a crippling force to the company.
good,"good benefits good pay if you are hourly or management   "
good,"You do a lot of work for very little money, and they hold returns on the associate for a year. So if you sold a high priced bag and the customer returned it 6 months later you had to scramble to make that money up to get a check. It's extremely hard in a smaller store."
good,"I learned a lot about customer service while being at Nordstrom. I enjoy fashion and seeing new retail pieces come in and stocking them on the floor. The managers were constantly watching us and pushing us to make sales numbers, so I would often get uncomfortable, but fashion has always been a fluent topic of conversation for me making it easy to try my best to make sales."
good,"nice palce to work at, always busy, flxible schedule, proper breaks and schedule , gets discount on shopping , love the enviroment , very amazing customer."
good,"It was a fun place to work, depending on what time of year it is, seasonally.  Customers can be very rude, when you try to help them through the line."
good,"Nordstrom is an okay place to work, everyone there tends to be pretty supportive. The pay is good. Told seasonal highers we get re-hired automatically at the end of the season when we were being hired, but towards the end we were told our job security isn't 100%."
good,"ok thats fine. it is what it is, no skin off me, no harm done, no pain no gain, everyday you have to grind, you have to go hard to get what you want ok."
good,If you're in college its a great place for a job. It's really hard to get promoted here. They say they promote from within but they always hire from outside.
good,"Depending on location and season Nordstrom is usually a fast paced environment. The shoe department and Cosmetics department will be the most busy, especially during holidays or in store events. Nordstrom is all about servicing the customer with your best judgement, so making your customer feel comfortable is most important. Over all, if you are ok with a ""retail life"" schedule, this is the place for you."
good,"This  started out as a great job, but there is only room for advancement if someone in a higher position likes you. There are many people who look great on paper who are often held back. To whom ever may read this, this was just a job for me but if you are looking for a career this may not be the place. I encourage trying it out but beware of the people you work with and your relationship with management. Be sure to kiss as much butt as possible."
good,"Work life balance was great.  You worked your 8 hours and got to go home.  Once in a while they would ask you to work OT but rarely. Management was concerned with numbers and not really helping you advance.  Job was pretty simple and self explanatory. If you were ok with doing the same thing everyday, this is the job for you.  Do your work and you will be left alone."
good,"long hours for management."
good,"We were short staffed during the holidays... a little hectic."
good,"You have have the potential to make money and grow in this company, however, the hours you have to work is ridiculous and long for a RETAIL job. I recommend it as a part time job only. You would still be working about 30 hours part time. And they will give you the hours because this is strictly commission based."
good,"Wonderful training program, but high turn and burn career.  Don't fall into the wrong social circle or you will get stuck.  Great extra's and looks good on a resume."
good,"If management was a lot better, I would've never left. The salary/benefits are fantastic, connecting with other departments to help boost business is a fantastic way to build up the culture of Nordstrom and there are many ways to move up in the company. "
good,"Being a Rover I got a chance to have a different job each day. I worked in every department within the store, from shoes, mens, women, kids, and accessories. We would try to help serve the customers to their needs."
good,"Building relationships with customers, stock assignments, and servicing the customer on their terms. fulfilling online orders and handling any customer issues."
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom goes as follows:"
good,"If you like sell to and enjoy selling this is a great place to work. I experienced discrimination on one occasion with a customer. However, I continued on only to lose my job because I didn't meet the quota. This was the downfall of working in the junior shoes ( BP Shoes) department."
good,"It's retail so you unfortunately work LONG hours. Management likes if you want to advance in the company or if you are good at your job. Other than that they can be pretty heartless. It's all about meeting a daily goal, if you do not make that goal, they are not happy."
good,"I was a host/cashier. I greeted all customers including Nordstrom customers as well. I sometimes use to run food on days it was busy.Overall, working at Nordstrom Ruscello was a great experience."
good,"If you are a student, this job would be great for you. Depending on the management and in which store, the hours can be very flexible and work with your school schedule. Most of the jobs here can give you incentive to want to be promoted, but it remains just a temporary job until you find something more to your liking or one that pays better."
good,This place helped me learn more about customer service and working with other people in a fast pace environment. However my boss was not very kind and when i was sick made me come in to work because her excuse was a lot of people already called out so yeah i quit after 3 months.
good,"I enjoyed working at Nordstrom. I loved my coworkers and some of the customers were great. The downside to working commission sales is your paychecks constantly go up and down, especially during  the slow seasons. Also your returns count against you which can definitely be discouraging at times. The compensation for managers and sales associates is too low, a lot of people who they hire are young and don't have too many bills yet. I liked Nordstrom at the time but I don't think I'd ever go back."
good,"A typical day in the warehouse is like a typical day in high school. Overall, not a good career choice. The warehouse lacks productivity at times. This is a side job"
good,"I have worked with this company for 2 years and I must say this job is very stressful. Nordstrom was a fast paced work environment that you meet people everyday .I can say that there this work place was diverse . Management was unprofessional , the managers only care about themselves and will do anything to save they're position . The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people and creating bonds with my team . The hardest part of the job was communication with management ."
good,"its was fun to work there, liked the discount, didn't like that hours weren't consistent. holiday times is best cause u can make more money, bad thing is its only commission"
good,"It was a grate place to work but they came first nothing else hard when you go to school full time. It is a fast paced environment, but it is easy to keep up with. At times it may seem boring but if you understand the company and the way it works you can always find something productive to do."
good,"Very unorganized, definitely a place to start if you want to move to there corporate side in Seattle. Work is not rewarding and you job security depends on your ability to acquire new rewards members."
good,"What you put into succeeding and selling, is what you will get out of it. If you can't handle high pressure to sell and presell to clients, this job isn't for you. You are responsible (to an extent) for your paycheck."
good,I do not feel management provided clear direction of the company and goals.  Employees were not kept updated on changes occurring in the company
good,"Working at Nordstrom made me realize why retail isn't for me. When I first started it was a fun place to work and I enjoy fashion so it made it enjoyable dressing costumers. After a few months working at Nordstrom, there was a lot of pressure to reach unattainable goals. My co-workers were nice but when it came down to it we had to compete for commission. It was not a fun environment and often felt unproductive due the times we had slow days."
good,"Rovers only work doing markdown,so when no markdowns are available you work as a fill in in case a department needs help or if someone who works in the department calls off. as a rover you have nothing to ""own"" the hours are spotty and can be few and far between. you could be scheduled 40 hours a week but only work 18. coworkers are not the nicest people. the environment is very negative. managers can be very disrespectful and rude."
good,"A typical day at work includes coming in, getting coffee from the store coffee bar then having an early meeting with the entire store. We go over goals and past year's sells versus this year's sales. During the day it's about finding the best customer and selling them the most items. They more you sell the more you make. The hardest part of the job is balancing the return policy and daily selling. There's is no policy so it's easy to leave work one day and have a negative earning amount for the day. Where you remain in the hole and have to go to work the next day hoping you aren't further in the hole and that you can sell enough to climb out! The most enjoyable part was the culture. Everyone was going through the same thing so it was easy to make friends"
good,Great local managment but once corporate gets involved things get bogged down and success varies greatly. Team is very united and management is constantly suffuled around.
good,"The job can be fun and like any place what you make of it. You meet some great people and some not so great people but that and nepotism are everywhere. But like any big company no matter what they say you are just an employee and a dollar sign. The commission is hard especially when if a customer returns anything they deduct it from your sales. Well when the customers can wear and return anything they will, and you will have to take the hit for it when you sold the item like you were suppose to. You get a base salary but you have to sell to hit your own goals and you don't have much time for that. As the company evolves we'll see what happens. It use to be a great place to work."
good,What I learned during my time with Nordstrom/Lancome was the gift of giving great customer service.  The standards for customer service were really high at Nordstrom.  Working for Lancome was great because I was able to develop a great client book.
good,"The company pays you well, the managers just play favorites. Good opportunity to grow if you know how to play the game. At FNL they teach you ""its all about perception."" So when you go to the manager with an issue, they'll just tell you to look at it a different way. They claim to have an ""open door policy"" but thats far from true. The managers will retaliate."
good,"Intriguing and overall fun place to work but eventually you get burnt out with long hours, low pay, and a continuously evolving job structure that is hard to keep up with."
good,"I have worked at Nordstrom for over five years and the company needs a lot of work. When I put stars next to categories it's tough to see what I mean, but having a social life and family is nearly impossible. The compensation is great if you try hard everyday to meet your sales goals, which is fair enough, but the lack of understanding that comes from management is unbearable. Not a place for people that do not have competitive personalities."
good,"work wise ok but management & colleagues are  friendly, that leads a better work performance. here i love to achieve my targets without any pressures. my seniors are also very helpful & supportive."
good,"Nordstrom has a lot of perks like discounts and contests to win free merchandize, but it's retail, so long nights, weekends and holidays. Other then that, its great to have a work family!"
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to learn what you're made of. Although it's a fun environment for the most part, it can be very stressful to keep up with the standards set in terms of sales and productivity. Other than that, if you're a person that enjoys working, that doesn't mind having to learn fast and being around people from all backgrounds, I would say it's a great place to start, and possibly grow."
good,"You are a worker, and no matter how much you get done, it's not enough.  Not appreciated for anything that you do, you are there to make them money."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, and liked the easy going environment. Retail is not always a fun job, but my coworkers made my first job experience the best it could be."
good,"I learned to engage my customers and created relationship with them.  The management wasn't the greatest but is progressing I've heard.  My co-workers were professional, always some sort of drama, hardest part was dealing with my manager.  My most enjoyable part of the job was helping my customers with what they needed whether taking a trip somewhere or just a normal shopping day."
good,"I was able to help in the new store opening in Midtown but i was not told that it was going to be a temporary job at the moment. I had to quit my old STABLE job to get this one moth job, next time they should be WAY more straightforward with the employees and what is going on."
good,Nordstrom has its moments of wonder and excitement but it is really competitive. At Nordstrom we work off of commission which is potentially an ingenious idea but if it is slow and the department is over staff it gets catty between other employee's. I learned so much about building a business especially how building relationships can blossom your business.
good,"Great place to work.  Strong selling culture dealing with current high end designers.  "
good,"First thing when i get there is restock my area to prepare for the rush and to have all my merpois.  Clean my area as well to prevent cross contamination.  Prepare every order that comes through the line.  When my shift is over, clean my area and restock my area.  Then i began to clean the kitchen.  The hardest part of the job is making sure the pizza's are perfect and out on time as well as prepare sandwitches.  Also making sure all of my hot meals are cooked right and out within a resonable time.  My favorite part of my job is the satisfaction of the customer eating my food."
good,"Nice company, fitting in with the culture is a must though otherwise you will not enjoy your time there and will not advance very far."
good,"Overall, Nordstrom wasn't that bad. The location I worked at closed last year. The manager was a total jerk and picked favorites, so unless you were a pretty female, you probably weren't ever going to advance there. He did the schedule based on who he liked best as well, (pretty females) and everyone else had to work the worst shifts and work tons of days with less hours."
good,I learned how to make sales and I developed a good customer service skill
good,"A typical day consisted of meeting and greeting customers, maintaining the cleanliness and order of the sales floor and merchandise as well as completing daily inventory"
good,Overall the company is good to work for. Compensation is above what you would make doing the same job elsewhere.
good,"Great place to work if you are looking for friends! I've meet a lot of people, the entire work place is a family environment The work is easy - Sell! However there are downsides,"
good,Assisted customers with department store sales and credit account management. I learned a great deal about the credit industry and personal customer service in an inbound call center role.
good,"on your feet for at least 8 hrs a day,"
good,"It was a nice quality store to work but hard to stay. When Hire around Holydays, it's only temporary and for around 3 moths. "
good,The retail industry is filled with all around energy but as a worker I felt the stress and pressure to match quota that was tough to do on a slow day.
good,provide great customer service everyday. E-bar downstairs to coffee is a must everyday. Customers are nice for the most part.
good,"Friendly work environment, reasonable hours, reasonable amount of mechandise"
good,It was ok to get me through the end of College. The big sales and events were insane to work through. Coworkers were all very nice!
good,"I love shopping at Nordstrom but I did not love working there. Working in retail, you do not have the best work/life balance because you have to be available to work any hours, including weekends and holidays. I felt as though there was a lot of ""favoritism"" when it came to when the schedules were made and requesting days off. I overall did not like the work environment. A lot of cattiness going on especially when it came to being honest about sales. I did like the store meetings we had to keep us updated on promotions and changes throughout the store."
good,"It was a great learning experience, it gave me a rang of fast and slow paste in retail."
good,"A typical day at work involved a high volume of customers. The environment was very fast-paced and filling and maintaining the displays was a constant task. Management did not play a big role in our day to day work. We pretty much ran the accessories department ourselves, with given tasks to complete. My coworkers and I were such a great team. We all worked together very well and still keep in contact with each other. The hardest part of the job was closing and preparing for the next day. The most enjoyable part was the family-like environment."
good,Don't work here unless you are ready to break your back. Stock work had almost nothing to do with stock work.
good,Great company for college students. Provided positive shopping experience.
good,"I was able to learn a lot and grow within the company. I learned how to hire, train, and grow my employees. I was given the opportunity to travel and launch new departments with the company."
good,"Handling, checking, or taking care of the stock of merchandise on hand: typing computerized price tags and attaching tag clothes."
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to gain experience. Employers love seeing Nordstrom history on your resume. If you are a good employee, they will promote you in the stores."
good,"On an average day at the Nordstrom call center, i would handle about 120 customer calls. The calls varied from credit card payments,applications,disputes,credit limit increase/decrease. I learned to always be prepared and efficiant at all times in order to be prepared for any type of call. My co-workers was the best part of my job. Im a team player. The hardest part of my job at Nordstrom was to learn new skills each day because the credit department was constantly changing its procedures. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers."
good,"This place was a great stepping stone into the work force because it taught me confidence, taught product knowledge, education beyond my area for expertise, entrepreneurship, suggestive selling and self selling to maximize every sales opportunity."
good,"Come in clock in , then grab material. After that i would look to see who i was partner with that day. Next i would start with what my line products were and started to work. after a few hours there would be break then after complete workload then take back material and head out."
good,"A typical day at work consists of dealing with customer complaints, opening and putting out new stock, application of skin care and cosmetics to customers and having a plethora of knowledge of ingredients and how products work. Depending on the position you have, you'll also be in charge of your schedule, counter goals and events as well as developing a clientele and maintaining strong relationships with them. There are so many things to do during the day, it's hard to list them all. "
good,"This company has codified a great working environment with the expectations that everyone has a balanced life. But this is not the case for support personnel. Sales staff will have it great and will see awesome opportunities for advancement, but support staff doesn't. Through multiple layoffs and restructuring, the average workload of a support manager has doubled and it is expected that you put in about 70 hours a week. The pay rates do not reflect this expectation."
good,"If you are looking to make money without having to go college or if you are going to college and want to make some money, then Nordstrom is the place for you. Granted you have to have strong communication, sales, and customer service skills. Nordstrom allowed me to make the money that I needed to get through college and still gave me time to study. IT WAS NOT EASY! Nordstrom is an extremely competitive sales environment. You need to learn to sell and hustle FAST! And yet maintain an excellent customer service experience for your customers. Nordstrom is not the place for people with thin skin! You have to be able to accept criticism from managers and customers alike on a frequent bases. Nordstrom is a performance based company. If you do not perform you don't get to keep your job.... And yes there are quotas that need to be met. Besides all the negatives, if you are able to be a competitive force on the sales floor, know your product, know your customer, you will be successful. All the managers are pretty much micromanagers. This is because they have to be! Mangers need to run the sales floor and the department as if it were their own day to day business. I have seen managers come and go because their superiors can demote them just as easily as they were promoted. If you are a full time employee at Nordstrom or are considering the possibility, then please understand that this job will consume your life.. especially if you are a manager."
good,"Fun place to work overall, but management doesn't stick around very long."
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom would be working with clients, processing incoming shipments, and communication between departments and sister stores. "
good,"A typical day at work includes responsibilities such as energetically greeting all customers, providing an extraordinary experience for each customer, and rewarding customers with the Nordstrom rewards program. As a sales associate, we are also responsible for maintaining the appearance of the sales floor, cleaning fitting rooms and stock rooms.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the customers and making sure that they leave with a smile on their faces."
good,"I had a fairly good experience at Nordstrom, but my employment was ended on the strength that, ""I looked unhappy"". I have never been terminated nor heard of anyone that was terminated from their job because they ""looked unhappy"". To my knowledge, if someone was unhappy, they would've turned in their two weeks notice. "
good,"Nordstrom is an excellent company that offers individuals growth and experience in all fields of customer service. Typical days at work consist of assisting customers with merchandise, returns and even wad robing customers."
good,"A typical day as a manager was to come in do a floor move within the merchandise to make it appear fresh and new. I would than check emails: reply to buyers, reps and/or other superiors necessary to communicate my department's business trend and my plan. I would then reach out to my customers and do what I could to book appointments."
good,"Working at Nordstrom is a mixed bag, on one hand you are really encouraged to hone your sales and customer service skills and are provided an environment and resources to do so. On the other hand sometimes the expectations are practically impossible, and some days working there can feel like swimming in a shark tank. Co workers are competition and most of the time there is tension in the air. They expect you to open what can sometimes be an unrealistic amount of credit card accounts, and your job hangs in the balance often because of the number of accounts you open. I learned how to best treat customers while I worked there and that is a very valuable skill. They are not very accommodating for schedules."
good,"I worked only for a short period with this company over 12 years ago. At the time I worked for the eCommerce/Catalog division and it was going through a lot of changes. While I was there, I was able to learn about the buying side of the business which was new to me. As the majority of my experiences were from the product development this was helpful to round out my skills and provide exposure to the market and domestic vendor matrix. This proved very beneficial in my next position where the buying side experience was crucial, giving me more credibility, making easier to influence my cross functional teams."
good,LIES its a selfish commission based company. Your manager is just as greedy for commission as you are. You then have to meet company goals as far as sales but you have no traffic on most weekdays after 3pm until close
good,"On your feet all day, very tiring."
good,"productive work place, friendly coworkers. enjoyed helping customers"
good,"- Sell, sell, sell"
good,"I initially enjoyed my job because of being able to assist customers with the new trends in fashion while building a customer-based relationship. There has been a shift within the company that has taken away from their business within customer service. Every store is different, but the change in management did not meet up to my expectations."
good,very professional.
good,I worked for Nordstrom for almost 14 years. I believe in providing good service in every aspect of our world. Nordstrom really declined in their Customer Service philosophy.
good,"You need to be very on top of everything- your sales,commission,goals, the managers and coworkers. Any one thing that isn't monitored can compromise your pay or even job."
good,I don't mind competition. I don't like to be micro managed. Very contradicting.
good,Great experience working with clients and buliding a customer relationships.
good,"Working at Nordstrom really taught me the best of customer service that I could give any person at any jobs. I had worked at other retail jobs but they showed me the importance of really caring and going the extra mile for anyone no matter who they were. A typical day at Nordstrom would be clocking in and going directly to the backroom to start shipment and move it the the floor and organize. The hardest part I would say is that its commission based and no everyone shops at Nordstrom, to make money you really had to work hard and try to get every single cutomer that came in the department and its hard because you are going against like 10 other co-workers that are trying to do the exact same thing. My manager was a very nice man but he stressed very easily and in many occassions he passed it on to us. I loved seeing so many different people and talking to them, learning about their life like kinda becoming part of the every day shopper's life."
good,"I enjoyed working in the Lingerie Department. Very nice product. I didn't agree with some of management,"
good,It was a fast paced enviorment but there wasn't much room at the time for growth.
good,"I enjoyed the vatiety of differnt stations i had the chance to work at.  The pay was good, and i liked the variety of people that worked there as well."
good,"Choose the store carefully. The company is great but the store manager makes or breaks your experience with the company. Otherwise, it's a regular sales position in retail."
good,"Can be all about cliques and not performance. Depends on your store. I have seen some managers who don’t know how to communicate with employees move up because upper management favors them, and other hardworking amazing managers get thrown under the bus for being too good at their jobs. This was seen as a potential threat to upper management in spite of the core culture of Nordstom management wanting others to want their jobs to grow and take their place while also growing."
good,"If you are able to survive the odd hours and abuse of the customers, there is a lot to learn from the company. They want employees to grow and move up, but it involves a lot of moving between locations and departments. At some point you will have to survive off of commission or a basic salary. Some employees thrive better with one than the other. If you would like to stick with only one way to earn a salary, then you are limited in your upward movement within the company. The same goes for family life. If you can not easily move and dedicate everything you have to the company, you will not grown. For those who can and/or want to, then there are many opportunities."
good,"Flexible work schedule but can get busy during peak retail periods throughout the year. If you want hours, you'll get them. However, there was always an emphasis on credit card applications so if you're sales-oriented, this is a good place to practice"
good,I learned a lot and was so grateful to meet such amazing people but the management was very cold. The management put you down and acted very plastic and unrealistic.
good,"Its is long hours on your feet with nothing to do (ie glorified mannequin). The management can be friendly, but they are not there to help you in anyway. You are not allowed to form friendships with anyone, and can get in trouble for it."
good,It looks good on the outside but once you getting it's all different. Management is mean and gets away with a lot of things. But I have met a lot of amazing people here including the love of my life
good,"I worked for Nordstrom Rack specifically and honestly, it wasn’t good or bad. The management was trash but they people and customers are wonderful. I learned a lot and miss the people (except the manager) and I almost wish I could go back, realistically I never would though."
good,Very competitive work environment. Not much of a sense of community or care for associates. Commission is not worth the work unless sales is truly your passion.
good,"Great place to earn much needed pay. Very faced past environment depending upon department location within the building. However, some leads and management need to learn the value of respect and proper communication skills."
good,"The job is very physically demanding but pays well. If you have just graduated high school, need to make more money and willing to put in the effort, this would be the perfect job for you. Management can be ridiculous but you can listen to your music or podcasts as you work through the day. The breaks are bs for how much work you do but it still helps pay the bills so I guess depends on how bad the situation is and how willing you are to work."
good,"Love it or hate it, I cherished everything that I learned from working here.  Nordstrom Rack is a viable career for those who can communicate well and befriend managers of the store, whom will give promotions to employees they like. "
good,"There are many areas for improvement at this location. It will take years to be promoted unless you’re one of the managers favorites. This is a good part time or temporary job but working full time will really take a toll on you. You get a raise every 1,000 hours but it’s only maybe 20 cents. After three raises you’re done unless promoted."
good,"they seemed to be more focused on pushing nordstrom credit cards and accounts, I didn't even make enough money at the time to take advantage of the very minimal discount they offer"
good,The place is full of friends and the environment is generally pretty relaxed. Unfortunately the lack of rules comes back to bite people sometimes and there is little training to prepare most employees for their jobs adequately. Their systems seem very out of date. Almost the entirety of management seemed to be buddy-buddy and most promotions were related to friend groups rather than performance.
good,"The style of workplace Nordstrom Rack is, its like any other retail job. but Nordstrom Rack is at the top of the retail experience workplace. You do really learn a lot from working at the rack"
good,hard working environment but the managers praise people that do not  work hard rather then those that give above 100% and above percent! Work is fun and competitive at times
good,Fast paced working environment with flexible hours. The hours are only great if you are working full time. Overs team moral isn’t too good but a still a good job for someone like a college student.
good,"The job in itself is decent, the people are another story. Each department has production requirements which lead to incentives, some are based on group performance and others solely on yourself. The job is relatively easy once you receive proper training. Some departments are more physically demanding than others but overall DO expect to be on your feet all day. Most departments have anti-fatigue mats but after about 4-5 hours they feel like they’re not even there. "
good,Its hard work but its fun fast pace. Workers can be cut throat. Keep up with your clientele they will get snatched. Sale the card and get paid right away
good,"I'd like to return if possible as a manager. I appreciate being able to display my retail management skills. If possible, I'd like a recruiter to contact me as soon as possible for an open position in the Bay Area."
good,Cross-functional continous improvement creative environment. A company with an entrepreneurial spirit ever challenging how we service our customer where we are coninuously looking at ways we can improve how we work and operate.
good,"So here’s the thing, Nordstrom has amazing benefits. I mean cream of the crop! The problem is the work environment. It’s not what it used to be and it’s not what they’re still promoting it to be. Nordstrom focuses more on the customer experience which is important but you can’t neglect the ones who interact with the customers. There’s too many managers who are on power trips and honestly don’t deserve to be in the position they are in."
good,"Loved my coworkers, fun place to work for the most part. Stressed selling credit cards and caused the job to be more stressful. The benefits, pay, and the discount was great"
good,"Management sticks very close to the company's core values and instills them into the employees. Typical day for me was about 8 hours, busiest times being during lunch and dinner. The concept of ""Keeping the customer first"" is huge at Nordstrom and I learned that very quickly. This may have been the hardest part because almost no matter what the situation may be, even if you feel you've been disrespected by a customer, management will always do their best to cater to them and satisfy them for the sake of the company. Most enjoyable part had to be the pay. The more time and effort you put into your work, the more money you see in your paycheck."
good,A good job for the money especially if you’re just looking to make money for a few years.  As far as attire it’s very relaxed. If you don’t start off on everyone seniors good side you may get treated unfairly for the rest of your time.
good,"great while i was in school, they're very particular about selling the customer cards. upper management was always changing. good job for students though"
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work! Great employee discount, product selection, and awesome co-workers. Truly care about employees well-being and relationships with customers."
good,"I wanted to build my career with Nordstrom but the work/life balance was tough and the compensation was not in-line with other employers.  A typical day was very busy with:  Reporting, coaching the team and making the numbers for the day.  I learned a lot about myself and how to manage a large team (35 off season and 66 during Q2 and Q4).  Management overall was good but could have been better at coaching you up.  The hardest part of the job was the schedule.  It was a retail environment which meant weekends and late nights were required.  No set schedule.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people/team."
good,My position wasn't that difficult mostly just kind of boring. It wasn't a difficult job and they paid pretty well. the culture of the employees was kind of weird and petty
good,"Very political, some backwards thinking. I've seen many wonderful people/ employees be fired for silly things while others who really should not be in management get promoted; who is willing to play the game, when it should be about supporting the customers and folks on your team. Used to be very customer service oriented, now it has gone down hill, much more casual. The work/ life balance is horrible. It feels very much like you have no life outside of work; exhausting and draining. The department managers are under huge amounts of stress. I have seen many crash and burn out. I did however enjoy helping my customers and the job itself. Just not the pressure of pushing sales from management to the point where your numbers mean more than your customers needs. The politics were the real turn off."
good,"It is a very fast paced, physically demanding job."
good,"The management only applies rules and policys to certain employees, there is a huge play of favoritism. Depending on your attitude, work can be fun. Even if you do your work, and perform above expectations, it is hard to get recognized."
good,I participated in the Management Internship but really I just worked retail 99% of the time. There was no rotation of departments and very few opportunities to learn about management.
good,some departments don't make as much money as others so its hard to make the pay period. company was unorganized at times and expected a lot from employees.
good,"A job for a great multi-tasker. A lot of favoritism within management. You wear a lot of different hats and must be okay with ""customers always being right."""
good,I started in the packing area where you were expected to do your job and if so things ran smooth. In the picking area I ran into issues where you can inform a lead about what’s going on multiple times and they act as if it’s new information or not report it and when the manager asks you about it there is no trail you thought you were leaving by letting a lead know what was going on.
good,"It was an alright place to work but the pay was very little and the opportunity for advancement was very little as well. The people there, however, are pretty great."
good,"Nordstrom is a very diverse environment, where you can express your personal style. However, work schedule is not the best. The workload can be overwhelming."
good,"Nordstrom is an okay company to work for. The pay is decent but not the best. The company just implemented a raise for all its employees due to cost of living, which was definitely helpful. My manager is alright but she has her favorites. She treats everyone differently. The loss prevention department caters to everything. Were basically glorified security officers but do more work then traditional security. Were responsible for everyone's mistakes. This is not a typical Loss prevention job. You do a lot of work. Some days you might be at the door observing customers other days in the office doing useless reports. Everything has to be done the ""Nordstrom way"". Even if your right in some situations you can be fired due to not being done the ""Nordstrom way"". The scheduling is terrible, you have no work life balance. You might get a closing shift which is scheduled till 11pm then you might get another shift the next day to open which is scheduled at 8am. You might get calls at 3am in the morning that the alarm went off or you might get called in on your off day to take care of a situation. In my opinion, this isn't a job for someone who has a family. The hours are very unpredictable. In addition, theirs only 3 LP Agents in the whole state of NJ! Investigators got moved to corporate headquarters in Washington State therefore, theirs limited opportunities for growth. You have to move across the country for opportunities. In addition, every March the company does changes to the budget and your position might get eliminated. No Job stability. Best advice to anyone thinking of applying"
good,"If you want to learn about handling all aspects of retail, costumer and interpersonal relations, how to be competitive, work under pressure, learn how to reach high sales goals, handle absurds amounts of returns then this place will give you all of that and more and it is a great place to learn and then move on to another."
good,"I work at a fulfillment center. Not a place to work if you want a reliable income. Used to be better but now they have too many employees and not enough work. They will lay you off for hours or a day at a time, and you won’t know about it until the day before at best. Then holiday time comes and you will be expected to make yourself available for an unlimited amount of overtime. The management is usually nice but poorly equipped. Communication is lousy. Long time employees are not appreciated. Top wage is decent but, for the last couple of years anyway, no cost of living increase. Focus is all on getting new people in the door, not on retaining experienced people."
good,"If you can sell, you will make great pay. Management is hard on you. Always need to make sales targets every week or you get in a lot of trouble. Commission is cut throat"
good,Culture has changed drastically and has gone from a career/company i loved to work for to a job that paid the bills. Managers over worked and there is culture of favoritism.
good,"Nordstrom is a workplace where they pride themselves in customer service. Must be willing to maintain a positive attitude and continue to work hard to make your paychecks satisfying. Hard to make money when it is slow, so it is highly recommended to build relationships with customers so they return and shop only with you. If school is a priority, I would not suggest working here because it is a full time position. However, some managers will work with your schedule. I enjoyed building relationships with customers who continuously shopped with me. However, making a satisfying career with nice paychecks takes time and effort. Paychecks will not be consistent unless you move to a management position."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for retail wise. I was a cafe worker. The chef (which was my manger) in that cafe was horrible! And the reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because when I went to HR to complain, it seems like they didn’t take my concerns serious. That manager is still there and making everyone else’s life miserable! No sense of coaching, being respectful and acknowledging when employees are working hard. Aside from this, Nordstrom itself offers good benefits and the environment is great (retail wise) I feel they need to work a lot with the cafe and culinary area of things. Some people just aren’t qualified for certain jobs and that can’t be overlooked."
good,"Hours were very flexible, but I would tend to get slack when I asked for a schedule change (was in school while working here). I liked my manager for the most part, but the sales training could've been a little better, and the team I worked with was very divided. Many would be very sharky and take on way too many customers, but wouldn't help with the cleaning and would constantly ask you to check out their customers for them. Others were definitely there just for their hourly and wouldn't try to sell or help clean. Pay was fairly low for what it was, but not the worst since I didn't have many bills at the time. Paid $100 towards my commute every month. 401k options, healthcare options (very expensive health care options that weren't the best plans; I just used SF Care City Option while working there)"
good,Business is slow. Company's generous purchase return policy shrinks sales numbers which affects badly on commission sale paychecks....................
good,"I absolutely love Nordstrom as a place to shop. However, the work environment was horrible. I worked in cosmetics, the sales goals were unachievable! You are expected to make them no matter what. You are constantly being micromanaged. The hours are very unstable, if you're not making sales for the day you could be asked to go home early ( and no, you don't get paid). If your counter does bad, every one's hours get cut. They only promote from within if they like you. There's alot of favoritism. Management can be major bullies. I'm not being dramatic, I've worked in cosmetics over 6 years, and Nordstrom made me feel like I was never good enough. The pay was great, and my coworkers were amazing. That's the only positive thing I can say."
good,"When I first began working for the company 6 years ago, things were great. The company was a great and the pay was great. As the online shopping became more prominent, the 100% commission lifestyle began to change for the worse as Nordstrom began removing product that customers wanted from in store."
good,Overall an okay place to work. Seasonal positions were pretty easy. Hard on your feet sometimes walking all day on concrete. Spent majority of the day tagging and ticketing merchandise. Company treats were frequent.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and helping the customers!  Ideally, Nordstrom is a great company to work for as its mottos are displayed on the walls in the employee's hallways and the company has great benefits! Although, most people don't realize that a salesperson's position is commission based!  So, in the workplace, it is very competitive with other fellow sales associates!  Setting that aside, you can and do form some wonderful friendships with many coworkers.  Also, management behavior sets the pace within each level of each department.  Therefore, good leadership begets a well-developed team within the departments of each store within itself.  But, when management leadership undercuts its employees and does not hold it's integrity for the company that it represents, then it leads to the downfall of that store or that department for which it is representing!  Unfortunately, this is too often the case within some areas of the company's stores.  Nordstrom would better serve itself if its managers were better developed in management skills with the team of employees that they represent.  Too often, too soon, unseasoned employees are placed in a management position in which they have not developed the necessary skills and/or have not been trained to effectively hold that position.  This goes against common sense and sets itself up for failure in the big picture down the road!  Not to mention, the employee that comes under the leadership of a manager, often needs to know and develop skills that will move that employee forward.  Which all too often, if the leadership"
good,"I started at Nordstrom as an intern. Once I completed the internship I worked another 3 months as a sales associate. I was with the company for a total of 6 months. This is a great job to have ONLY if you are a college student looking to make some money. If you are looking to move up the ladder and make a career in retail with this company, I would recommend you try your luck with another retailer."
good,"Most of the time very slow, other times can get very hectic but still all and all a good work  place to start of very young work place. You can learn from good managers but instantly see the bad ones. If you like people good and easy place to work if not then maybe consider other options."
good,I didn't enjoy the working environment. Management in my department was absolutely terrible and made me dread going to work. The money was good for being in college but I would never work there again.
good,"It was a decent job but the management was pure trash. Nobody was on one accord. It seemed as though it was also a lot of favoritism for people who picked the most items, which were usually the ones who came earlier in the day and left all the unfindable items for people who worked afternoon. Not logical at all."
good,"Not a bad company, better than any of the other fashion retailers, at the end of the day though it is still just that--retail. Decent for a little while but not great for anything long term."
good,"Nordstrom gets very hectic around the Anniversary Sale. The job includes commission on top of the hourly pay but you have to reach a certain amount of ""points"" before you can be eligible for it. Its hard to reach, no matter how much you sell. Classic retail, lots of putting back clothes, cashiering, and cleaning, strict management, not much creative freedom. The job is fun though if you get along with your co-workers. Competitive, no room to move up in the company. Long hours, lots of standing around depending on the department. Styling customers and booking appointments is extremely fun, however it is rare. You get business cards if you're there long enough. I applied as a full time stylist and ended up being hired as a part time associate for less pay than I made at a previous job. Parking at the mall is tricky and expensive. I did enjoy working here minus all the down-sides, the employee discount is nice and the cafe is close by."
good,"During my time in Nordstrom, for the most part, I enjoyed working with my coworkers and did receive decent pay. The management there could improve. They lack an understatement with there team and don't seem to be aware of who they are working with or frankly don't care."
good,"Yes nordstrom is a lovely company but the returning aspect is terrible. One day you’ll walk into your shift and be at 800 dollars in return. Some of those returns could’ve been from a year shi & returned because the customer wore the shoe and was ripping. it’s ridiculous, people abuse the policy."
good,Money was nice for the time i worked there. a lot of returns. management couldn't keep up with decline in sales. friendly people but very unorganized.
good,"Nordstrom is a lovely place to work. With that said -- how you are treated is really based upon the job position you have. Working in logistics, employees treat you differently than to say if you were another sales team member."
good,"Coming into to work for a sales job, you'll except to sell but they have you doing stock work, folding shirts and making boxes when you should be helping on clients job and working on your sale goals."
good,"Long hours on your feet.  Management doesn't want to hire summer students anymore.  Daily sales targets are unachievable on an ongoing basis."
good,"Great place to work if you’re great at selling and upselling. Making sales goals is important"
good,"The management in this building did not seem to care about its' employees and offered help they never followed up with. I asked for a transfer at the beginning of my employment and they were enthusiastic to help, but drawing closer to my time where I was ready to leave they did not help at all and there was no guarantee I would even get the transfer. They say they always keep their employees within the company and rarely hire outside or promote outside of their company but that was clearly a lie."
good,"Easy money and selling is fun. Return policy is inconsistent and effects bi-weekly pay. Minimal training, but job tasks are simple and comprehensive. Holiday's and Anniversary are great paychecks."
good,"Hey it's retail, there is pros and cons, I have learned the art of mirroring or ""reading"" customers based on nonverbal cues and the extreme art of multitasking answering the phone, ringing customer, communication over a walkie and calling for backup for a certain department all at the same time. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers that attempt to return merchandise from over 6 months to a year or used products.The morning shifts tend to be easier since you have a good hour to start trying to complete extra assigned tasks before the store open."
good,"Helped me move on to bigger companies. Pay wasn't much but I hear they're offering copywriters more now. Helped me advance in my career, but skills wise it's very basic."
good,overall fun people to work with however management could improve. They would just sit in the back and rarely come to the floor. only when we had a customer issue
good,Enjoyed working in Nordstrom's restaurant better than on the sales floor. Management makes a major difference in working experience and environment. Did not enjoy commission structure.
good,"I performed the best that I possibly could in that situation, and many of the employees complimented me on my work ethic and skills, but in the end, it was just too difficult of an environment to overcome."
good,"Must have ability to multi-task since you may be working on the phone, by email or live chat, at any part of your typical day. While the scheduled hours are flexible, you are ranked based on your monthly stats. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to work from home, on a part-time or full-time basis."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of assisting customers and cashiering, some days busier than others. I learned to multitask as well as product knowledge. The hardest part of the job as well as any retail would have to be the hours and holidays. Difficulty would be inconsistent schedules each week."
good,"Long hours on your feet, but room for advancement. The management has Little regard for employees work/life balance, usually no set scheduling.But  overall, a decent work environment."
good,Mandatory overtime can be quite a hassle as there are times throughout the year you're required to work six days a week 8-10 hours a day. This job is very fast paced and can be tiring and stressful at times. Can be allowed to take a 30 min unpaid lunch otherwise only two paid 15 minute breaks (from the time you leave your post to the time you return) sometimes 3 if working over 8 hours. They like all department managers to know other departments. In the two years I was there I had 3 different managers and 5 different assistant managers who all learned the department day by day.
good,"Not all employees are good managers. "
good,Management can make or break your success.  The company itself is very employee friendly but management store to store can make being successful difficult.
good,"Day to day work was fine. Many coworkers ran the store, treating support staff as though beneath them. Nordstrom needs better management and management training."
good,"I worked for Nordstrom on and off for 3 years in multiple departments. I was able to learn a lot from the company and was grateful for it. The only downside to working here is the pay. When I was an assistant manager it was 50% commission and 50% base salary. Which was incredibly frustrating when the turnover rate is so high in the company. If they were able to find a better way to pay their employees, the turnover rate wouldn't be so high."
good,"Manager I was under as Building Services, did not encourage training. Manager in Logistics Processing was not fair with employees and somewhat biased in schedule building."
good,Very unstable job. Inconsistent business. Average 40k per year if you work hard. Management sucks so you are on your own if you want to make money. Most customers are friendly but you will have your few nut-jobs.
good,"Working at Nordstrom was an interesting experience. Not only was I very pressured working there, my manager called me too urban and intimidating. Constantly trying to force me into resigning. I made my daily goals and exceeded my credit card openings. I've had letters written to me from corporate and it wasn't enough. I developed social anxiety and had to resign from my position. Managers were lazy took several breaks a day, very condescending environment. The only thing there was that was great was the credit card incentive, the events, and meeting new people"
good,"Workplace Culture - old school Nordstrom is better than new school Nordstrom."
good,Company puts too much emphasis on advancement through working at Full-line store in sales. There is no chance for advancement into management without transferring to the regular store and working commission sales job. As the Rack is NOT a commission climate they over look people with good leadership skills and promote from within only those who have worked in both environments.
good,Packaging and shipping sums up the daily responsibility of the logistics department. I have nothing additional to report about the typical work day for this company.
good,"Fun environment, lots to learn and it helps you learn about different cultures and how to deal with difficult situations. Tests your boundaries and teaches you many things."
good,"I started when the store first opened up in Calgary, Alberta. I really enjoyed the people i worked with but was not enjoying the boss or management. Overall a successful job."
good,Nordstrom was a good place to work if you are a great salesmen and very dedicated. It was a little catty because employees were fighting for sales My managers personally were a little catty but that's to be expected in higher end retail. I did learn how to create personal relationships with customers.
good,"Nordstrom is a great company, it however was a problem when working in the day to day. Things didn't get done, lack of communication, bad equipment, and an awful promotion system. I loved working at Nordstrom rack but toward the end it became too much for me and I was fired for calling out for medical reasons, for a job that they refused to have more than one person, me, employed for."
good,"As far as corporate retail goes, Nordstrom is about as good as it gets. However, through the years, Nordstrom has trained its customers to abuse the store (policies) and employees, making for an unhappy environment for employees."
good,"IT is lacking leadership and the gap is allowing the wrong people to make the business decisions for IT. The overall strategy for the company is directionally accurate, but the leadership has no clear idea of how to execute it."
good,They are sexist and only care about the employees that make them money. They protect employees that make them money even if the person in question is sexually harassing multiple YOUNG women at a time.
good,"The management within the beauty department at this location only cares about one thing and that’s numbers. You as a person are not valued. And neither is your time, effort, or opinion."
good,"Working at Nordstrom you really have to hustle as a salesperson to get a decent paycheck.  The job is commission based and the returns impact your paycheck up to one year. Any return within one year gets deducted from your paycheck.  Management when I first began was good, but as new managers started coming in the focus started shifting to the stock room. Keeping the back organized was now the main priority for when their bosses came around to check, and it was heavily impacting the pay. I felt the pay was nowhere near the time spent at the store or the amount of work needed to be done while there. "
good,"The company is completely commission oriented, which is obvious since it's retail sales. The problem is that is all you hear all day, is to exceed your goals. Once you do, you're typically met with, how can you do better?"
good,"I used to love working at Nordstrom Card Services, however the recent changes in management and the decisions they have made, has caused me to begin looking for something new.  I value my work life balance and that seems to be diminishing as the months progress and the new structure becomes apparent.  I wouldn't recommend working here if you're looking for something long term, but if you want  to develop skills in a quick moving environment this is your place!"
good,coworkers are very friendly and the job is easily learned. very strict on sales but its normal.very fast paced so time usually goes by fast.the credit cards always bring you extra money
good,Great company to work for full of benefits and opportunity. Management makes each individual feel valued and appreciated. It is a fast paced enviroment full of enthusiastic employees.
good,"Outbound is a nice place to work , great compensation easy job (sometimes) "
good,"The place is ok to work I transferred location my first location was way better than my second location. More hours were available, more organized and understanding more like a family. Second location was the opposite so my experience for working at the rack was not as good when I started"
good,"I had always dreamed of working for a well known fashion forward and prestigious store like Nordstrom but was disappointed in the lack of leadership, appreciation for team members letting the sole focus be on numbers. No balance between team members versus money and the customer experience."
good,"the warehouse is a bi*ch to work in, I'm surprised they don't have a high suicide rate among employees. A good job for teen moms and high school dropouts."
good,"Was decent enough place to work, pay was average, I was hired a temp employee and hired on after as a ""core"" employee, left when an opportunity more to my liking became available,"
good,"Nordstrom has a good management training program but when it comes to employees, it is not what it used to be."
good,No work to life balance. Management was helpful but there was not enough organization when it came to training. The culture was very fun at first but later they seemed to be a bit controlling.
good,Great starting point for anybody.  You work hard for your money and then some.  You will make friends for life which is a good thing.  Meeting and greeting poeple all day which will lead you to more repeat business down the road.
good,"It’s fair but not enough to support the average adult’s cost of living here in Houston, Tx. I’m looking for a company to work for that’s willing to truly utilize my worth."
good,"The first year there I loved it. It hardly felt like work and I was getting plenty of hours. The managers were good at their job and easy to work with. Fast forward the store manager moved on to another store as well as a few department managers and assistants (promotions/relocations) and then everything changed. A new store manager and new department managers were put into place, and the culture changed for the worse. At customer service, people were getting promised lead positions that they ultimately didn't get. An unhealthy competition of opening credit card accounts had begun and workers' integrity started to go down. They would say whatever to open cards to look good in the manager's eyes in hopes of moving up. Across departments, hours were getting cut and the employee turnover skyrocketed. The culture we once had is no longer there. IT feels less of a family and more of individuals working in the same building. Now that the store is downsizing this means even fewer hours, so I am sure even more employees will quit. Not to mention customers have been complaining about the products or lack thereof. We've been receiving less and less merchandise since the beginning of this year and customers have taken notice. This store is on its last leg."
good,There is a lot to learn and gives a lot of great experiences but there is a very particular hierarchy and mood which is often just played off as friendly competition.
good,"I enjoyed my time there very much, the people were fun to work with and the enviorment was  warn and diverse. the management was nice and fair and had great benefits for the employes."
good,"I learned SO much at my position as a production coordinator at Hautelook. Not recommended for a forever position, definitely a stepping stone. Unless you want to be poor forever."
good,If you came up through the stores you have better chance of success.  There is a lot of favoritism and pay bans are all over the board.  Company is very political.
good,Often found myself taking on others jobs simply to achieve my goals. Management often absent adding stress to other managers. The company is constantly growing and a great place to grow quickly and get some good experience the hard way.
good,"it was ok , until they started to cut budget and hired mgr. with no knowledge of what they were supposed to do.Manger had no clue what he was doing ,and place blame on everyone else"
good,"Nordstrom is definitely a high end, beautiful and luxurious place to work. Managment is very open and nice. Lots of competition within associates. But overall a great work enviroment"
good,"Ability to multi-task is absolutely necessary. Also transitions between management and coworkers occurs very frequently. Typically, the manager expects employees to jump right in without giving specific tasks at the beginning of the shift."
good,"The cafe was fun at first. Fast paced, can be lively and some fun people to work with. All that dwindles when you have managers who don't have a backbone. Managers who are passive aggressive and don't stick up for themselves or lay down the law really let things go. The workers here are catty and rude, and don't care because no one will say anything to them and they never get in trouble. Employees fight in the front over the smallest of things and start rumers about each other and management will do nothing."
good,"Working here is easy, however just slow majority of the time. People that have been working here longer then about 5 years take this job too seriously."
good,"Working here is a mixed bag. Lots of great benefits, and pretty fair with their hours. However their communication is below par. Often managers don’t talk to each other, or set unified expextions from staff."
good,"Needs to work on management who they hire inter-company as managers and developing them properly. They don't pay enough for the hard hours and life style sacrifice you make. Also, they cut hours of even full time employees, noted even at holiday times.  This is no way to treat an employee on your front line. How are you career oriented employees supposed to maintain their essential living, when a company folds on their commitment to you."
good,I was a counter manager in the cosmetic department- job was fast paced with high goal requirements and constant events within the department. First set of managers I started with were great with positivity and constructive criticism which helped me learn from mistakes without feeling devalued. Would like to expand outside of retail is why I left job.
good,good job good hours good pay good uniform good check good hour good boss good lunch good company good manager good supervisor good area good treatment everything was great
good,"There is a cut-throat, competitive selling environment but somehow circling the same department everyday was still slow-paced, uninspiring, and tested my patience."
good,Very political environment. Positions on the sales floor & sales opportunities are dependent upon seniority rather that product knowledge or customer compatibility.
good,Providing a high level of customer service.  Going above and beyond to ensure that customers left with a pleasant shopping experience and a reason to return.
good,"Fast paced work evironment and easy to get along co-workers."
good,"Good food, good recipes, decent pay, good hours, but there are a lot of shady corporate things happening.  The corporate P&L and GL  have formulas is within the documents that do not populate correctly. So all of your numbers and bonuses are based on Math that does not add up correctly. By the way… They do not like to talk about that, nor will they fix it."
good,"My favorite part about working for Nordstrom was the ability to help out in other departments within the company. Unfortunately, trying to land those great positions as a full-time job wasn't as easy."
good,"Pro---"
good,"This company offers good benefits to the employees; however, the management well does have favouritism and always favour the people who work with them before."
good,"I believe that working in retail is a dying industry. During my time at Nordstrom, my work environment was competitive with my colleagues and it would be a challenge to sell a large volume of product each day. The unfortunate policy of Nordstrom is anything that is purchased by customers can be returned at anytime, regardless of how long ago they purchased the item or have used the item. It was difficult to get ahead in sales when purchases by customers that I worked with could return their purchase at any time, docking me and my efforts to make a sale, which would put my salary base at risk."
good,Nordstorm can have a different vibes each day depending on how customers / mangers are doing that day . You learn a lot when dealing with customer and how to interact with them
good,"workplace culture is evolving in back of the house areas and not for the better due to misguided management. Typical day is flexible, but busy with evolving priorities."
good,"Grab your cash bag, stock your register, clean your department, restock any merchandise that is not on the salesfloor or needs filling, satisfy all customers with a smile."
good,"First job where I've excelled and was able to use my skills and gifts."
good,"Commission is very competitive, the return policy results in a lot of returns making you make up for your returns. If a customer returns a sale you have to make up for that or you will be in the negatives which is bad on your part."
good,"An experienced learned. Great pro, working from home. Culture is cool. A millennial fit environment. That is all I have to say about this job/company."
good,"Typical day is 8-5 though many days end up being 7-5, 7-6, 8-7 etc... work weekends and some nights. I learned a lot about style flexing and understanding different personalities and how to manage them. The hardest part of the job was work/life balance. Some times I wouldn't leave until 1 or 2 am if we're doing a floor move or inventory and would be expected to be back at 8 am the next morning. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people."
good,There is a warehouse electrician filling the role of tech 2. An assistant manager struggling with management skills that really fulfills the role of a tech 2 and micro manages because of this situation and there is no Tech 2 support.
good,"Nordstrom was a good place to work. Retail isn't my ideal job though. If you don't mind working nights, holidays, weekends, then it would be a good fit for you."
good,"I used to work in the EBAR in front of Nordstrom. The layover is high and the pay is minimum wage. Overall, lacks decent organization as the Espresso Bar is small, the stock is on the second story of the building, and the managers change shift schedules without notifying staff. Both my first and second manager didn't complete my training and yet expected me to be able to keep up. A good thing was that I was allowed two free specialty drinks a day and all the drip coffee I wanted after that. The store manager and the head of HR were both professional and good at their jobs. Some of the staff from inside Nordstrom were just as rude to us (if not worse) as some of the snooty customers. We had great patrons whom would visit us regularly and would put a smile on our faces. Overall, could have been a better work environment."
good,not the place to work if you have kids or need a set schedule. Everything is focused around the customer so you are just a number. Your breaks are different everyday and seniority means nothing.
good,"I would not suggest management.  There is money to be made, but if you are in management, you are taken off the floor, so you miss out on that.  It was not a good experience."
good,Ok place to work. You will be doing a lot of different jobs there. Good thing is that you will get a raise based on the accumulated hours you will work. It can get crazy in there with customers and demanding managers but if you are a quality worker they will appreciate it.
good,"Sales people are paid on commission. The competition to make sales is a bit stressful. Our dept. had enough staff, but they hired more. Too many people on the floor means fewer sales, lower paycheck. Also work a lot of closing shifts. Even after over a year, I close 3-4 times a week. Some dept. managers work with their team to balance it out, mine doesn't."
good,"Its been awhile since I worked here..it was great back then.  When I go into the stores now, the culture is very different.  It doesn't seem like customer service is a focus.  And I can't differentiate a customer from employee - everyone is so casual."
good,"Management is not understanding and difficult to work with depending on what department you are in. You will either be running around with mountains of clothing or standing around waiting for a customer to come in. The customers are hard to manage sometimes again, depending on your department. Most customers purchased clothing and returned them after they had been worn and Nordstrom has basically no return policy so you lose commission easily and can go home in the negatives after hitting a few thousands in sales. It's extremely common."
good,"I absolutely loved everyone I worked with.  I worked in the stock and replenishment department, and although the job was frustrating at the time due to terrible management towards the end of my career there, my co-workers made it easier to come to work everyday.  The only thing (which I didn't have to deal with personally) was there was also intense competition between sales associates, which is common in a retail setting where you work off commission. I also worked in the coffee shop for a few years, and had the same experience. Management was overbearing at times, but my co-workers were great! They also provide great benefits and you get a 30% discount! Compensation was necessarily the best, but I would say it was fair."
good,"Work life and Job culture was great, very friendly work environment. but the compensation wasn't good as far as scheduling, takes longer to get paid but overall it was a good experience because I learned a lot from the staff."
good,"Good discounts!  Lacking direction and leadership."
good,"Nordstrom focuses on customer service. the customer is always right even when they are wrong. if you are a student then working can be difficult, and they can sometimes be understanding."
good,Spent many years with this company. Loved it for many years...unfortunately if you have a baby and come back to work they cut your pay! What a disappointment.
good,Culture is very intense. You must adapt the Nordie vocabulary quickly. Great place to work. Pay could be better for the amount of work expected as an assistant.
good,"Some days, for the most part, there is laughter and one can feel they are a part of a team. Other days, you're not sure if you are coming or going. It is rare to find someone in a management role to go out of their way to coach or teach, which takes it that much longer, if one did decide they wanted to advance their career and be promoted. One great thing about Nordstrom is that they like to promote from within. With that being said, I worked in two locations within the company and have found that there is quite a bit of favoritism in promotions. "
good,"My time at Nordstrom was not well spent. I realized that the culture and environment that I had exposed myself to was just not worth the stress. Retail is bad enough as it is, working at Nordstrom did not make it any better."
good,"The company is not a tech company.  They are looking for change to compete with hi-tech company like Amazon.  But, currently, there is no big change happen.  Hope it will happen soon."
good,"Very competitive environment, and I learned that commission sales are not for everyone. The energy of working in the city and for one of the top retailers in the area is really exciting though."
good,It's ok but working for commission is the worst thing ever. Job life is really not that bad. Harder you work the more they pay. But it depends on department.
good,"This job requires a superb eye for detail in clothing and design. Though your job title is listed as one thing, you share all store roles. If an extra cashier is needed, you become the extra cashier. If a floor needs to be cleared, your will be advised to assist, even if the floor is not apart of your department. I improved my customer service skills, learned how to utilize a mobile check system, as well as utilize a cash register for credit and debit payments."
good,"Extensive Customer Service, quality clean store. People pleaser and helpful. Rewards and accompliments. Management is great. Fast pace and consistently dealing with public."
good,The job does offers part time & full time opening if you work hard enough. But 2/3 managers are not very fit for the work place. Very sneaky &  conniving to secretly switching your scheduling hours without your knowledge to randomly sending you home if work load my slow down. It is a great experience outside of management because you are often on the sales floor interacting with other employees & customers.
good,The managers and the assistant managers were never on the same page when it came to the assignments that the employees were supposed to do. The job was easy though
good,Had the pleasure of making some very good friends and making a few good memories in the nearly year and a half I worked there. Great benefits package and having sick days/vacation time each year is a great perk. Found kitchen management to be lacking in leadership and inexperienced.
good,"Nordstrom has not only given me a job during college but has taught me the true meaning of customer service, it also rewards those who work the hardest."
good,"Commission pay unsteady for heavy exhausting workload. Low customer retention. Return policy too lenient, allowing customer to our user, use and then return clothing which leads to loss of hard earned commission percentage. It was very draining to keep a grin on my face all day while spending hours with a single demanding customer. This would happen regularly. Commissions also created hostility and frequent fights between sales associates and floor employees."
good,It was okay not the greatest but I had to leave beacause I returned back to school full time. Store manager was not easy to work with and all the employees felt the same way.
good,Job stability possible but inconvenient scheduled hours. There are unrealistic expectations from each worker every day with little benefits to overall function.
good,"It was my duty to give the best customer service as possible. However, the culture of the department wasn't as comfortable. Wasn't introduced to other employees, you kind of figured things out on your own. The best part of the job was looking at the products."
good,"decent work environment, felt like management could communicate better with staff, high turn over rate.  Benefits and pay increases are great!"
good,"A great company and a horrible one based on location and department.  There is just as much truth to a 1 star review as a 5.  I know 4 different stores first hand.  Make sure you ask questions on your interview , ask to be introduced to some of your future teammates and ask for a quick look at the department before you accept an offer. No good interviewing manager will be bothered by any of this, infact they will most likely be enthusiastic at your interest."
good,"Lot of space to learn new latest technology"
good,"Pretty laid back job, good job for someone who doesn't like tot talk much, because you are to yourself, doing your own work on your own time while meeting the expectations of the time you have to fulfill for the orders as well."
good,"Definitely a lot of favoritism, kind of like high school, if you suck up you move up not because you are amazing at what you do.  A lot of discrimination based on race."
good,"It was a great job, I am just looking for a better experience that allows me to grow as a person and career wise. I learned a lot of new managing techniques that I will be able to use moving forward."
good,"i loved my management and i enjoyed the freedom i had, not the hardest job. it didnt have room to grow-good job through college as it was simple and flexible."
good,it's fun for the first two months but then it becomes a constant rat race to help everyone and make every goal because otherwise your paycheck will be awful.
good,It is a fun place to work. The people are nice and they do a lot of little things. They don't have the most ideal schedules but are somewhat flexible. Communication is fairly decent but can use improvement. The customers are loyal and it's a good environment.
good,"Hybrid job combining HR and Store Administration.  Supports 2 higher level managers. Duties include managing store level budget, reporting analytics, and supporting the store for all direct selling supplies."
good,This company would be okay to work for if they treated their employees fairly. Constant change in schedule with no communication skills or warning. Poor management
good,They pay well but management was not the best. I worked in the cosmetics department and the co-workers were easy going but ofcourse management didn't do a good job at running things. they were never on the same pages as the rest of the employees. I loved doing makeup there but management made me dislike working there.
good,"Management was a little overbearing. Co-workers had dog eat dog mentality and some of them weren't so friendly nor welcoming. The hours were great, flat rate was good, but with the return policy being so open would cause commission to be very low."
good,"I am having very great scope of learning in my current project,very good environment with positive attitude in every team member"
good,"if you love customer service this is the place for you. I enjoyed the interaction and customer first attitude. I really enjoyed moving up in the off price retail store. But once you make it so far there is no where else to go. They have an emphasis of going to the Full Line Nordstrom Store, where you would work on commission. If you don't have a drive to work on commission then it would be relatively hard for you to move up in the company."
good,"Nordstrom is a commission only job unless you're a member of management or in a department like cosmetics. Even though the company is down in profit and sales, we were each expected to exceed our sales goals. Management was difficult to speak to and when problems were escalated to HR, I encountered the same issues. The customers were as expected, some rude and some nice-but this was a given with any retail job. "
good,"I learned how to sell and be proactive, and work hard at all times. Culture was cool. Can be political and choose favorites. But overall get your experience and get out if commission checks are not your thing."
good,"- Mundane and repetitive work environment."
good,"Nordstrom is an overall good place to work retail. Management for the most part is flexible with important employee needs and the pay is good. It is retail so like all other retails sales jobs, the stress of performance and heavy interactions with customers and co-workers is a part of it."
good,"Like any mall job, it does not pay too well, especially in the small departments. Management could use some improvement and so could the overall culture of Nordstrom, sometimes they look down on their own employees."
good,Everyone at Nordstrom starts as a salesperson to properly learn the Nordstrom culture.  Promotional opportunities depend on your success in your current role and on your ability to relocate. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers. At Nordstrom you will receive on-the-job training in delivering exceptional customer service.
good,"Nice place to work Managers never listen to employees, can be frustrating at time. When the managers fail at a problem they blame employees who tried to talk to them about the situation."
good,"New to Canada, Nordstrom has carefully considered every detail in coming to a new demographic and marketplace. The retail side of the store is impeccable with beautiful displays, spacious areas for shopping, and knowledgeable sales staff available to each customer for assistance. "
good,"It's a fun place to work and I've met a lot of really great people through the company. Nordstrom as well as many retailers is going through major changes by eliminating positions and reallocating money to new stores. The work life balance isn't great, but it is retail so that can be expected. Management can be good, but there's a lot of favoritism, so be on upper managements good side or else it'll be difficult to get promoted. The pay for department managers and assistants is below average and after awhile it's hard to not be discouraged by low wages. It's an easy job to sell people nice things and you learn skills that can transfer into just about any other career."
good,"The culture is good, but the management is no good. It took me over 6 months to get badged. I wasn't able to have a lot of face time with my manager. They focus more of their time at the full line store instead of the rack."
good,"	Trained and instructed cashiers on Nordstrom cashier procedures"
good,Nordstrom wasa good place to get a start in the security industry. The only downfall is they don't work well with college schedules and they have a lot of red tape restricting the limits of loss prevention employees.
good,"Most coworkers were great. Gained lots of sales and customer service experience which I have definitely utilized in my new job. Discounts were great and store events were always fun. Life outside of work was hard to manage due to very unpredictable schedules which were always ""subject to change."""
good,More pressure to make goals and not as engaging as it use to be.I love the company but I think they need to treat employees better.
good,The people that work here are some of the most creative and amazing people i have ever met. I simply wish the higher ups would evaluate this and start paying people accordingly.
good,"The GM had too much power at this store. There were no checks and balances, whatever he said goes goes. If a department (or sales person) wasn't selling more training is a better way of approaching the problem...not hiring more sales personnel."
good,"The work is cutting edge. Nordstrom does not focus only on compliance but continuously asks ""How do we add value at the executive level."" I genuinely appreciate this. "
good,"Fast pace usually when the store is busy"
good,Nordstrom is a nice place to get your feet wet but after working there for along time. You start to get very stressed out about making your sale's goals. If you don't make your sale's goal you are at risk of getting fired
good,"Typical day of work consists of performing tasks much like I did at Starbucks. There is definitely a bit of disorientation as the management is open to handle the store in their way. I don't mind management, but Nordstrom is very intense when it comes to micromanagement. I learned that although I like retail, I didn't like retail in a high volume environment such as Northpark Mall. My coworkers were the best and always seemed more helpful than the managers themselves; again, they were always terrified of making mistakes as there was always fingers pointed in every direction of who or who didn't perform the task at hand. The hardest part of the job was dealing with not having breaks in between lunch and lunch breaks were delegated very late during the shift. The most enjoyable part of this job was the chance to work with real espresso machines and learning more intensively about coffee and customer service. The job is fine, however, there is a very cutthroat aura about high end retail jobs and the expectations they have for employees."
good,I've worked at Nordstrom for five years and counting. It's Very fun and exciting. You meet a lot of people and learn new things. The best thing is mobile check out. No waiting in lines. I've learned how to be a manger and team leader. Ive also learned how to disburse shipment and merchandised shipment on the sale floor.
good,"Being busy is the most enjoyable part of this job, aside from working with people. The hardest part of the job is facing new problems every day; however this is detrimental to learning about the departments/company."
good,"100% commission, the harder you work the more you make.  Goals are easy to achieve if you get to know your products and learn the physiological reasons people consume the things they do."
good,For the amount of responsibility held the compensation was unfair.  Most often the entire day the store was entirely run by two management members making lunches and breaks extremely difficult.
good,I have worked for Nordstrom for over 8 years. the company great for growth. Great deals at the rack. Work/life balance could be better for salary managers.
good,"As the economy has declined, so has the level of service provided as well as management in this company.  Every year becomes more of a challenge to maintain salary and service through a consistent decline of resources and stable management.  Relatively speaking, it is probably still one of the best retailers to work for, but I have a hard time feeling like I'm in a professional career anymore."
good,"Each day was fast paced work picking products for customer orders, send products in totes down conveyor lines to induction/packing. I learned the ins and outs of each department at Nordstrom. I also learned how to better personable skills and communication with employees and management. Co-workers were very friendly and helpful if I felt lost or unsure. Hardest part of the job was working the long overtime hours. Would work 70 hours a week. Most enjoyable was the compensation and the friendly co-workers; I made several friends."
good,Hundreds of shoes on the floor being tried on by women. Learned to use a lot of different technology. Management is and will always be a constant changing position as they evolve to find their core customers base in the city.
good,shifts vary. schedules not writen very well. Too many events. Great cleintelle system. Awesome discount! Hardest part is working with all women and dealing with customers that are high maintanence
good,"Salespersons work on commission. Good pay if you're there all the time (little work/life balance). You constantly have to sell to make up for your returns, which you will receive a lot of given the return policy. Benefits suck! Easy to get promoted and become a manager but positions are constantly getting restructured so your job is not safe. Good job for a young person in college trying to make a quick buck."
good,Nordstrom is a good company to work for and has a service based culture.  I enjoyed my time here at Nordstrom.  Nordstrom has a good amount of long time employees.
good,"Sales was a second career choice for me.  It was a career that I was not totally prepared for but I wanted to give it my all and tried different departments to find my niche--which just happened to be Women's Clothing.  However, I gained valuable experience in Handbags, Accessories, Shoes and Sportswear.  I found I was particularly good with outfitting professionals with a several outfits, including accessories and shoes. "
good,Nice place to meet people daily and build relationships. Leaving with great tips working weekends.
good,Tough to be in retail environment and on a retail schedule when you are used to a 9-5 office job.
good,"Once I get to work I check my emails, followup with customers that I helped from the previous week to make sure everything is satisfactory and a thanks for coming in. I make calls to customers I've helped before for replenishment and booking appointments for events. Maintain daily sales and business. Stock areas. Build new relationships. The team I'm part of, we really come together on a daily basis to make the daily and monthly business happen.  I really love the relationships that Ive built with customers. They appriciate what I do and put a value on my work."
good,I got hired a month into my Esthetics program. It was a nice job I had during school.
good,This was an awesome place to really experience working while going through school.  The competitive environment made it fun and energetic.
good,didnt like management.  Loved helping customers and clients find things.didnt like hours or some of the other sales team.
good,A typical day at work consist of multiple task in addition to helping customers. I've learned that by just being kind to a person can change their mood. The management varies. My co-workers are reliable people. They truly do invest in the client. They have definitely made me feel comfortable. The hardest part of my job is keeping a relationship with a customer outside the store. The most enjoyable part of my job is working closely with a customer and having genuine conversation with them.
good,Decent place to work. Knowledgeable staff. Good team of associates
good,I've learned style flexing when dealing with employees. I've learned the back end of retail and merchandising as well as visual.
good,"Must be a great sales person to  survive. Very cut throat."
good,I love my job. I am challenged every day to provide outstanding service to our business partners by identifying root cause and resolving issues and/or delivering technical solutions to business problems.
good,"Like with many jobs in any industry, no job is secure. Especially working as an LMT. I have worked as an LMT for Spa Nordstrom in NY. The salary and benefits are great but the work environment and management is horrible. On sundays, the massage therapists and estheticians were not given 1hr lunch breaks if they worked 8hrs, which is against the law, front desk management is not organized and very non-proficient with their work, selling products and hitting your sales goals daily is more important than your relationship and quality of treatments with clients. If you don't always has a smile on your face or if you address your concerns about the workflow, work environment, etc. The manager will address it with you and your job maybe in jeopardy because you have stood your ground against the unethical situations and your co-workers will turn on you to save their own jobs. Best thing for any employee of the spa to do is be quiet, keep your head down, and do whatever the manager says in order to keep your job, regardless...."
good,"Typical day at work in non-stop lines of hungry/tired/angry shoppers on your typical weekend. Weekdays could be just as busy, depending on the weather. If business is too slow you'd be sent home."
good,"When you are in management there is no work-life balance. However, it is fairly easy to get promoted if someone sees potential in you."
good,"Understaffed, so everyday is extremely busy. Be prepared to interact with 100+ customers a day."
good,Great company to grow with. Very Stable. Offer great benefits.
good,"Responsible for all art and textiles each season for Boys wear and Girls sleep. A daily workload would include designing, creating, approving art stike-offs from overseas vendors, approving color lab dips, communicating with international vendors, trending, meetings with design teams, production teams, and assisting in all buy meetings. Had some fantastic co-workers. A good, challenging job. It was a great learning experience for great things to come!"
good,"A typical day consisted of helping customers gain knowledge of a particular merchandise, helping them make the best decision in order to leave our store comfortable and happy with their purchase. I learned so much from my customers and their unique life experiences. My co-worker and management assisted and were team oriented daily. The hardest part of the job was being on a commission based pay scale. The most enjoyable part of the day was always watching a customer leave in a much better mood."
good,"A typical day for me is coming and working with customers, sales and maintaining the back stock room."
good,"It was your traditional call center. They were very determined to create a very personalized environment for all customers. The hardest part, and one of the best parts of the job, was helping escalated customers and de-escalating the situation. The most enjoyable part of the day was the ability for us to send flowers, gift cards, or just cards to customers if we wanted to on the company's account. I learned a lot about contact centers and how to help customers."
good,"Typical day: Stock up for the day, clean, make schedules for freelancers, check numbers for the day."
good,"Nordstroms was a face paced position that was very organized in it's way. The bad thing was that you worked when there was work. If it was slow, you were sent home. Not good for a new person."
good,Great place to work at regarding helpfulness of managers but purely commission based environment makes competition extremely stressful.
good,"Nordstrom was the first fashion forward company I had ever worked for since graduating college. I could not be happier with my decision to intern there and stay another year as a sales associate. I've grown and learned so much about the industry in general, how to build relationships with not only customers, but coworkers, and people above me in the company."
good,"This company has taught me many things along the way from how to be aggressive in a competitive selling environment, to giving me experience in recruiting and terminating employment.  I have also written and delivered annual performance reviews, opportunity checks, and coached new employees in the moment.  I have gained experience in handling multiple customer service situations and have helped open a new store."
good,"Nice place to work for students, graduates, part-timers who don't need single income. Climbing coporate ladder is available to all however, compensation is very very low. Most people in management are early 20's, single, not living on their own or married two household income. Retail work schedule is very unpredictable as all are expected to be available to work any time. Benefits are available for 32hrs. per week or more and must be for 3 consecutive months. So insurance can be canceled everyother month due to schedule changes. Not fun. Good for youngsters or partimers."
good,I would love to work there again do to unfortunate timing i would highly recommend people to apply there
good,"since they start everyone as a sales associate in this company, it becomes very frustrating to make it to the position you're opting for - simply because not everyone makes a good sales person and that's why not everyone is a sales person and in order for you to move up to ANY department other than sales you have to make high sales. "
good,This is a good place if you're looking to work full time in sales. A lot of hard work to compete with associates who have been there a long time. Your manager can really make or break your experience too. Overall most people are genuine and want to help you out. Very entrepreneurial - really take on a lot of responsibility for your job and department
good,"Nordstrom is like any large, 100+ year old company with lots of processes and politics. Roles are very targeted and specific. The focus is less on how to ""do the right thing"" and more ""avoiding the wrong thing."" This company has a lot of opportunity in the retail space if they can overcome some of their challenges."
good,slow on most days mainly regular workers on sales floor.....hardly any managers are ever on the floor they usually sit on the computer in the back...co workers are ok
good,Enjoyed every minute of working at Nordstrom and it was a tough decision for me to leave when I did but it was something I needed to do.
good,come in eat breakfast and clock in proceed to your station to start your duties.
good,"Overall, it's a great company to work for. However, it is still retail and if you dont mind working late and working every weekend then its a great place to work."
good,"Fun place to work, especially if you're into fashion. Everyone gets along."
good,Great company to advance with but takes a lot of hard work and hours.
good,Can be a great place to work just depends on who you work with and the managment.
good,"I loved the work environment! great people, and great help."
good,Nordstrom is like the devil wears Prada. Then again that's what they aim for. It's intimidating at first but you are not guaranteed any job security. Also they have such a high turn over rate. I felt like everyday someone was being fired or was quitting. In less than one year there were probably 100 new people to fill the old spots because they expect way to much in sales. Some are expected to sale 10 or 15 thousand a day. Unrealistic. On the up side it is a prestigious company and I have met the owners who are great and they have great benefits and amazing employee lounge with digital cable and it's a very nice atmosphere esthetically.
good,Co-workers great group of people. Upper management needs periodic reality check on expectations and what constitutes a balanced work and home life.
good,I feel that I am set up to fail everyday I good to work. Simple solutions are overlooked. Most of the cooks are very unhappy everyday which makes for an unpleasent work place.
good,"I worked as a sales person in Nordstrom women's shoes department for four years. The environment was extremely brutal, partially because everyone works on commission, and secondly because management are spineless jerks. My schedule was never set. The store manager, who has since been release, was crazy. She would write me up for things that were so outlandish that my department manager didn't agree. They never gave me raises are accolades when I went out of my way to stand up to the so-called Nordstrom values. I was a full-time student at Ohio State and a full-time employee, but that made no difference. I was disrespected daily and in the end they tried to force me out. I think the store manager realized that I wasn't stupid like she perceived and realized that I would have had a law suit, so she basically treated me poorly until I moved on. This is a cool place to work when the economy is up because if you are a good sales person, you make 10% commission, which is the highest in the store. But know, you will never get vacation and when you do it's usually unpaid. Your breaks are cut in half most days, unless you are a smoker, then you get limitless breaks. The discount is 20%, but that's not much when they low end shoes are $100. Just make sure you stay on managements good side and you will be able to work in a somewhat decent environment. Otherwise, they will make your life a living hells."
good,Its a good place to work and grow. Lots of contest with the ability to win great prizes.
good,"the sky is the limit to selling, as long as you have customers! people have to buy in order for you to get paid! I made a lot of money at nordstrom but in january and february, the slowest months of the year, i made less and 2 weeks ina row did not make my goal. granted i made my goal ALWAYS BEFORE THEN AND SOLD a lot for my department. they threatened to write me up for those slow months. I didnt like how they did not value my hard work and my skills and my clienteele. Its great for customers! but for it to be great for employees, yoiu have to make moeny money Always!"
good,"Nordstrom definitely sets the bar when it comes to customer service. Especially in their designer departments, associates are kept educated on trends making brand/product knowledge a must. Their attention to building personal clientele is comparable to no other high end retailer."
good,Culture dominates this workplace and is a place where favorites are chosen quickly.
good,Working in the shoe department for four years I got to see it all. I had the opportunity to grow a great regular customer base. I had plenty of customers come back time and time again and ask for me. I worked hard to earn a great paycheck. Working strictly on commission pushed me to strive to be the best I could be.
good,Working on commission is a thing of the past due to the online market. Returns come back out of your check. Your co-workers are your competitors and stolen sales are the norm.
good,"Wasn't necessarily a bad job, it could just be very stressful around the holidays or days with big sales, as you would be handling call after call, sometimes with very angry customers.  Even though it was work-from-home, I really didn't care for my team, they weren't very helpful."
good,Not much room to move up but learned good lessons there on how to deal with people and the coffee culture was very informative to learn about. Very difficult to keep up
good,"Pay is okay for the job I do. Management is held back due to the fact that company bends over backwards not to offend customers. Even if the customer does not so legal things as fraud, theft, etc."
good,"What stand out working with this company was to be able to see all the mice things that we got to shop out . Like clothes shoes , and jewelry. Also teamwork ."
good,"We are kept busy while working, while at busy time of course we are serving customers, while at not busy time, we should be doing cleaning, dusting, etc."
good,I have had a great time working at Nordstrom.  I am looking for something challenging at this time in my life.  The retail market has shifted to online shopping at this time therefore inside sales are down.
good,Management was Micromanagement at it's finest. Sold items to customers.  No return policy so a lot of items get returned. Which tends to effect your daily numbers.  A lot has changed since 2015 I am sure.
good,"Mostly, a fun and positive workplace of professionals.  Competitive in reaching goals so that became stressful. Management also was not willing to give time off when needed for family so I eventually quit."
good,Working at Nordstrom was a great experience. If looking for retail trade then it is an excellent company to work with. It provides great benefits. Employee stock purchase is a huge benefit.
good,"Picked and manage customer's orders that needs to go out, efficiently aced effectively.  Manage materials and equipment  to places  to better support and boost productivity throughout the plamt"
good,Well respected company you can be proud of and the job can be so much fun but choose your managers wisely because they control your future and 100% commission can be tough with constant returns. All in all a lot of great people.
good,"Managers don't care and are only seeking their own promotions. Also, due to the current changing of how customers are wanting to shop Nordstrom has struggled to keep its old brick-and-mortar stores at a competitive level with online businesses, such as amazon or even their own online website."
good,"The employees are generally friendly. My department is very different from the sales floor and I do not believe I'm being set up for success. I would love to continue working for Nordstrom, but in a different role."
good,Nordstrom has been a huge benefit in my life I would go back toom for opportunity room for growth can transfer to other departments flexible hrs shirt breaks pay raises every 1000 hrs PTO STO paid holidays
good,Great retail corporation. Great merchandising activities and merchandise. Upper-management is accessible to associates. Plenty of opportunity for over-time earnings
good,Well paying and I enjoy my job but sometimes feel there are more worried about how much gets done over quality work. In which I feel has lead to mistakes and poor quality for our costumers.
good,Goals are high but hours are flexible. Pay isn’t great. When the store was slow we got sent home. So paycheck amounts were not consistent. Helps if you have high end clients to balance commissions.
good,"Overall productive environment with very minimal opportunity to grow. Lack of professionalism and certain higher managers play favoritism."
good,Keeps you busy. Room for advancement. I worked at Nordstrom Rack and was kind of ghetto the younger crown can be obnoxious but if you just focus on your work you will be fine.
good,poor teamwork managers were rude and all about their selves .and will not refer to anyone there. just poor busy. they need to fair people and hire people who love what they are dong
good,My schedule was the best and my team was very supportive throughout every single project! My contract only lasted a total of 6 months but it was good.
good,"This company encourages co-workers to work against each other for commission...IT IS Cut throat and bad behaviour is rewarded as long as you are selling. Disrespecting your fellow co- workers is tolerated if you are bringing in sales while stealing them from other staff.....Drama, drama, drama....."
good,I enjoyed working at Nordstrom. The shift in management was difficult but otherwise had a great experience. The pace was very quick but the people and atmosphere make it enjoyable.
good,"Management is poor and provides little information to employees."
good,"My experience at Nordstrom has been very up and down. My training in my opinion was not adequate. I was expected to know everything upon my first week. My coworkers directly in customer service were nice. However, the rest of my employees were not so nice. I am still trying to find my place in the company."
good,"Not as diverse as you want it with the management team, really don’t understand life problems. Starting pay not that great with the amount of work in training that’s goes with getting the job."
good,this was an okay job with okay benefits.  you have to be willing to stand for long periods of time.  clean up after you just straightened up a lot.  the management was decent.  scheduling didn't take in to account your availability.
good,competitive and poorly managed. if you are an outside hire do not be expected to be trained in the proper managerial manner that is needed to successfully run a department.
good,"Very fast pace and competitive environment, with high daily quotas, depending on what department you work in. Room for growth, if meeting/exceeding quotas"
good,Employees at Nordstom Rack were great to work with. Loved being able to build relation ships with our store regulars. I had a great time learning new things.
good,"The commission structure is in favour of the top sellers, this encourages independent selling, confrontational situations with other staff and lots of grovelling."
good,There’s good and bad. It’s a great company to work for mainly other locations. Very fast paced and nice co workers. Getting on the schedule is a little difficult.
good,"Had work with some great leaders and Great team during this tenure."
good,"it was a fun experience to work here, I really enjoyed my time there and learned so much and the environment is generally pretty relaxed.Great company to grow in customer experience and knowledge."
good,Great company to learn and grow in management. Strong promote from within philosophy. Good benefits and relocation packages. Awesome employee discounts.
good,"it was a fun experience to work here, I worked in shoes and clothing. I learned different styles and how to put outfits together. This was a really fun and exciting time for me surrounded with nice people and customers"
good,I enjoyed working at the Nordstrom ebar and I loved most of my fellow employees but after we got some new management everyone left and I didn't feel comfortable working there anymore.
good,"Pretty good discount for employees including sales items, at all nordstrom locations. Great options for purchase although some are over priced. Descent pay for high school students"
good,Working was ok just do your job. Managers have favoritism but all an all it’s a decent job. Just come in and do your job an you should be fine they do ask to much tho a little to much an there equipment never works but they tell employees to use it constantly
good,"Nordstrom is a good place to work and you will be able to work with some good people.  They work with the latest technology and are on the cutting edge of retail.  "
good,"My team mates were great but management is no good.  Complaining to HR does nothing and only makes you look like someone that ""starts problems."" If you can just fake getting along with most people then you'll survive"
good,Nordstrom Canada has great salary and benefits for its staff! There is opportunity to switch departments and store locations while working for Nordstrom.
good,"Managers have favoritism, work drama like it’s high school. the pay is good and so are the hours (if the manager likes you) room for advancement. i would work back there but never retail again."
good,Stable hours per week in a fast paced work environment. Shifts can easily be switched with other team members to create work life balance. Excellent management.
good,I met a couple of good Friends there and was able to enjoy my time there. Some of the managers there rude and didn’t know how to talk to people or give as the proper assignment
good,Great place and environment for thise whk like a fast paced environment. Its a great stepping stone to get experience in customer service. Customer service is very important here.
good,The scale there is great for making money based on commision and bonus. The work environment was fine and i think it changes the different stoes that you work at.
good,"A nice place to start your career in retail! I feel that retail companies should offer hourly and commission base. Commission base alone in todays environment, is not enough."
good,The discount and benefits were always great. Could be better improvement with management and assistant managers throughout the store. Great place to learn new skills.
good,"I loved the people that I worked with at Nordstrom. I loved my job at first... then they began to cut hours, slow store. People stealing sales. It became a very stressful environment and I began to gain a love/hate relationship with this company. They will also cut your hours on purpose to purposely take your benefits away."
good,"A good employer overall, does offer options for employees to develop if they choose to stay with the company.  Their human resources department is very helpful and is willing to work with you to solve any work-related issues."
good,Its been and overall good process.  I like my job and I don't dread coming in. Overall nice staff and the environment is pretty cool as well. Recommendable.
good,Management was worse that then  work life balance and it took YEARS before they realized management was costing them dozens of long term employees before they fired the Beauty manager.
good,The culture is diverse offering a good salary being retail. Managers are like children always arguing and putting employees in the middle of discussions. Advancing is difficult since you need the approval of your manager at the time they usually do not help you and do not train you even if they tell you in the interview that they will do it. There is a lot of favoritism and when you complain to HR the way management is treating you they wont do anything to fix the employee situation.
good,I learned a lot here. I had a lot of fun attending the trainings and working to meet my sales goal. You aren’t micromanaged unless you have a high goal to make and aren’t making it happen.
good,No work life balance at all and inconsistent hours. If you’re good  at selling then you will make decent money but if you’re not good at it then it might not be the best job because you will make hourly.
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom ( depending on the area )"
good,"- Lots of busy work"
good,"There are a multitude of great things about working at Nordstrom. However, if you are planning on making a career out of it, prepare to battle every day for the sales you make. Each time a customer returns anything that they bought from you (for up to a year) everything you earned during that sale is taken out of your next paycheck. This wouldn't be so terrible if it were still the early 2000's and people had a sliver of shame about returns, but the culture today is to return everything, even when it has been worn. This should not effect the people who are breaking their backs to provide excellent service to customers."
good,"Nordstrom was a great place for me to propel my career forward. I started on the sales floor, moved into Service Experience, and then up to corporate as a Product Coordinator."
good,"Pay was good, but as a part timer, I would recommend working here as seasonal. During the off season, part timers get very few hours and you're lucky if you get the schedule for the next day 12 hours in advance. So planning ahead is impossible. I was flexed off for two weeks straight once with no advance notice or reason other than I was ""part time"". The managers are pretty nice, but there are so many employees they dont get to know you."
good,"Carefully read the job description of what the employer requires. Remain calm during both interviews, trust your abilities. Have the mindset that you can bring something “ to the table”."
good,Sometimes the sales goals take the worst of people out and the management proffered to turn blind eye as many other establishments. But the experience with customer and their happiness is amazing.
good,"fine and good company culture, great place to work and develope as an employee."
good,"It is a great place to work for. Co-workers are amazing and is a fun environment to work for. But Lots of working weekends, nights, and always on your feet."
good,"Loved it, but too little pay. Almost worth the perks. The people were great just wish there was more guests . Working on commission is hard when there are not customers."
good,"Even though the hours were kept with in the parameters of a 40 hour work week, the expectations were very demanding for the position.  The corporate culture has very high standards, but does not always give you the support that you need to meet those standards.  I did learn a lot working for them and they built my skill set for future advancement."
good,"Good place to work.Work 1st shift mon.-fri. 6am-2pm."
good,"pros- flexible hours, they work with your schedule, the manager brings employees food, incentives, and 10% discounts "
good,"-I worked for Nordstrom for a few years"
good,"its ok. its a basic job, you unload products and put them on the floor. its overnight so you may be tired during the day. Management was pk. co works were fine."
good,"Long hours and tough working environment. Not a team player atmosphere."
good,"Wonderful for expanding your leadership skills. Horrible for maintaining a proper work life balance. Employees are often treated as numbers with little disregard to their lives outside of work. Hard to advance, and store managers, executives, and VP’s only work to serve their own interest and WILL  fire people simply because they don’t like them. More than enough opportunity for overtime, I regularly worked well over 40 hours a week."
good,"The job was easy, management could be better but overall decent place to work. Learned picking and stocking, pulling replens was fun to do, and learning the order picker was fun."
good,This is a job that high school and college students can work at to earn an income.  I prefer working for a company where there are set hours where you can plan.  Retail is not something I enjoy.
good,Working at Nordstrom you will be asked to a great job in your role and that's about it.  Don't be too helpful - just stay in your lane.  You'll be fine.
good,"My time at Nordstrom was mixed at best. The holidays popped off and I grew close to my coworkers; we sold lots, got along wonderfully, and our managers loved us. Once things slowed down in the new year, the bureaucratic grip of the company tightened and we were given strict (and unrealistic) sales expectations. Some of us sold well, others didn't. Managers loved those who sold well and consistently harped on those who didn't. We were constantly monitored and micromanaged, rules were strict and arbitrary, etc, etc, etc. "
good,"Nordstrom is a great Job for college students, but not so much for the average adult. As more people move to online shopping the retail space is suffering due to lack of foot traffic. Major Holidays are best to gain commission otherwise the low hourly pay is not sustainable for life."
good,"The team of people was hardworking and genuine. The floors are usually understaffed and very overwhelming. Management stresses sales and credit cards constantly and doesn't prioritize company morale. "
good,"When I first started it was a great company to work for but because it was in a decline there were so many changes. I went through 3 department managers and two store managers, obviously, there was no structure."
good,well run company except when promising to transfer employees I was told I would still have my job after I moved across the country to another location and this was not the case.
good,"I worked here for a short period of time and their sales expectations are extremely high. It was commissioned based only, it was a stressful position, if you didn't sale you didn't get paid."
good,"It was a great place to work while I was in college but ultimately didn't fit my schedule or career goals long term. The company was great, however my location was not."
good,Nordstrom is an awesome place to work if your a teenager looking for a great summer job or a current college student looking to make some extra cash. The job is easy but the pay is poor.
good,A typical day is busy always moving and doing something to help customers. I improved my customer services skills working here and opened up more to talking and engaging with customers. My manager was really nice and understanding.
good,I really don't want to submit anything for this company. It really wans't that great and I definitely had awful management and no real support and I hope this is enough characters.
good,"I really like my co-workers at N and the challenges. Devs and teams are given a great deal of autonomy and in my case, local priorities were clear and up-to-date. Dev managers were generally very good but as you moved up the food chain, middle and upper tech management failed to coordinate priorities between all the teams.  Never saw a CTO, architect or guiding principles. No one steering the ship to coordinate system development. All knowledge is tribal. Illiteracy is high but tech skills are also high. Great CI/CD, use of AWS and some teams know how to scale. I learned a lot about scaling and real CI/CD. Release code many times a day and move fast. Testing and prototype environment almost does not work. Most teams do not maintain non-production environments."
good,"Working at Nordstrom is kind of what everyone says it is like. The customers are great and the team you work with is usually pretty awesome. Your income is based on your commission sales. Different departments have different percentages. The goals are usually pretty easy to meet but there are some months that are slower. Management is ok, I didn’t always feel like I knew what was going on with the company or new programs or events coming up. Also promoting within your department is hard, they will usually bring someone from a different store or department in for a job opening you may have your eye on. There’s a lot of sharking so beware if you’re more reserved. But if you can stand your ground, working sales at Nordstrom is great."
good,"Not as many benefits for workers like other companies provide. Bosses have been flexible with my schedule since I currently attend college. No bonuses for hitting sales target in department, completely commission based."
good,"Management is pretty bad (at least at my store), there is favoritism. People rather buy online so you are less busy as time goes by. A lot of the styling is extremely updated and tends to bring in a certain type of customer."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is that the coworkers in your department are people that you can talk to everyday and treat like family. The management on the other hand is not the same.
good,"Besides admitting that I am not good at sales, I know that I am very personable and customer focused.  Building positive customer relations was my ultimate goal while working at Nordstrom.  The more sales, the more commission you make."
good,There is too much decline in retail. Overall great company just retail isnt the place I would flock back to. If I had to choose a retail company to work for... it would be them.
good,"We had an device which we can go on the web site to see orders that’s been made online or orders that’s in layer way, and we had to go to different departments to find the correct purchase and take it to the back so that it can be ticketed and tooling down stairs to the delivery station."
good,"- Lots of issues with management"
good,"As a company, Nordstrom is a great place to work when you are fresh out of High School or college. Able to sell anywhere in the store and earn commission if you are good and dedicated."
good,"Good job, very rude coworkers and customers. It wasn't a friendly environment. I will admit I learned a lot about customer service and designer clothing."
good,"There are a lot of great things about working at Nordstrom, however there are things that can also be improved.  For example, the growth opportunities are unrealistic unless you are willing to move out of state.  Also the selling goals are not realistic to current selling and buying trends yet management refuses to make adequate adjustments."
good,Good first job as a service. They were very flexible with my schedule as I was also a full-time college student. I enjoyed the perks (employee discount 20%).
good,A typical day at work was fun but also difficult. I would have to make sure all of these shoes and clothing were nice and neat for the store to open. This job taught me how to be organized. The management at this job was okay and they did help a lot with training and showing me how to be a better worker and be dependable and reliable. The most difficult part of the job I would say was when it was time to go and we had to make sure everything was clean. The most enjoyable part of the job was just being there because it was a good work environment and they were very nice people that work there.
good,the company is making a lot of changes towards online customers. the workplace is easy and flexible with hours. the hardest part of the job is taking on multiple tasks at one while trying to service the customer.
good,"A good starter job. It will teach you how to deal with the public, understand various cultures. Helps you learn how to deal with the public on an different level."
good,"good benefits but sale a lot"
good,"Opportunities for growth and advancement within the company. Depending on the department, it is possible to make commission although not always guaranteed. Important to remember that Nordstrom is a sales job, therefore the employees and customers tend to reflect the values of mall culture. The company is mostly concerned with protecting its image. Not a terrible place to work but can be demanding due to the nature of the job. Required to work during the holiday season."
good,I worked for nordstrom for almost 8 years and it was very flexible. I made what I wanted to make based on my engaging sales technique and developing relationships
good,"Great company for while at school, thy have flexible hours, but require you to put in extra time. As in come in early and leave late. Depending on the department, there is a way to work up the chain of command."
good,"Cosmetics and fragrance are two of the best departments to work in. Fun and fast paced, and ample pay as long as you know what you are worth, if you don't they will pay you too little."
good,"fun, exciting, but competitive and people can be very catty. Took some time to adjust."
good,I do enjoy the culture and the associates I work with on a daily basis.  There are more and more online processes and advances in technology in the company.
good,Enjoyed working with great staff and providing excellent customer service to all employees. Great team leaders to assist  and train new employees. Amazing learning experience!
good,"Learned a lot about customer service, sales, and people while working here. Great company sponsored events as well as sales contests to give employees more incentives. Also recognized top sales people every morning."
good,"Commission breeds competition here. They train you to be the best salesperson according to their standards, then it is up to you to be successful. Performance is important."
good,Fast-paced customer service job in retail. Decent management. Pay does not come close to the expectations. Work-life balance is very hard to maintain with the hours. Coworkers were great.
good,Okay to work but they made you sell those credit cards and it was TOO competitive.  Pay was alright for retail and as a temporary job until I found something better.
good,"Loved the department where I worked.  It was an interesting and fun to work there. Enjoyed working on displays to make the merchandise  more appealing to our customers."
good,"A typical day would be:"
good,"everyday I went into work I was ready to do work, but my manager had worked me to the bone she had me doing parts of her job as well, and I was not getting paid enough for it, so I left."
good,"Nothing bad about it, I liked the job but it was just a job. They really push you to make your numbers or you get fired which isn't a bad thing at all."
good,"Its was nice to work here. good environment and great people with good vibe to work around. hardest part of my job looking for a web fulfillment that I wasn't familiar with.my manager always was able help me thing I didn't know or understand, and can give time to answer any questions. Not just me but our whole team."
good,"Wouldn't want to make this my career in the long run, but it's good for now. Enjoy the learning experience. The people I work with are mostly good. There are a few duds but that comes with any job."
good,The job can be repetitive but it is busy. Workplace culture has nice people and very helpful. I learned to work with people and I learned to communicate well with them.
good,"As someone who has always worked with fellow women I have never had an issue getting along with fellow co workers.  Working in the makeup department I experienced great pay, I was consistently in the top 5 for the make up department in sales, usually in the top 3. Was I ever commended for the sales I was putting up? No. I constantly was attacked by girls that I was ""stealing"" sales.  I'm sorry but if you're on your phone facing the corner and a customer comes up I will happily help the customer.  I reached out to a manager about the verbal attacks and childish bullying I was facing, and he did not want to deal with it.  No one should ever feel bad for working hard and paying attention to customers over gossiping and texting on their phone.  "
good,"I have developed valuable skills to provide extraordinary customer service on the sales floor: welcoming customers, understanding customers’ needs, offering suggestions to customers, providing support while demonstrating the products, cross-selling, and orienting customers to other departments if necessary."
good,"Nordstrom really only promotes from within, and they only want a certain type of personality. If you're not the bubbly social type, you won't fit in. They do a lot of ""rah-rah"" team building that isn't actually that helpful."
good,"I enjoyed working at Nordstrom, however my feet did not, I walked in heels a few miles a day and it really took a toll on my feet.   I liked the  fast pace and the environment"
good,"Nordstroms is a great company and I love the care and attention they give to their employees and customers, however their return policy hurts the commission sales a lot and at barely minimum wage its not a livable salary for someone living on their own."
good,"Competitve wages, good hours. More choices now from when I was there as to what shifts you can work. Easy work once you know what you are doing, Get in if you can."
good,"better communication with each and every customer. refilling on items near the registers, such as snacks and drinks. Sometimes able to assists the fitting room."
good,"working at Nordstrom can get very repetitive. As a logistics team member, I do the same exact things on a day to day basis. The hours are all over the place but at least I am guaranteed a job over the school brea"
good,"Was always on my feet, got lots of excerise. Kept people fully loaded.Worked an 8 hr shift. Work was easy and manageable. Fellow employee's were funnny and friendly."
good,"Greeted guests and asked them questions regarding their purchase. Offered three choices when bringing samples."
good,"Commission only, and you loose money if clients return items. Financially not the strongest especially if you have a family. If manamgment it isn’t good because they mandate overtime that you are not compensated for."
good,it's not like old Nordstrom ways. I will take the old ways of Nordstrom with me through my career. Somewhere alone trying to stay relevant employees have stopped being valued and it shows in  customer experience.
good,"I enjoyed being able to see the newest clothes come in and I was excited to learn about the latest trends before anyone else. Although challenging at times, I enjoyed managing my team and I was able to learn a lot about myself as a leader. The hardest part of the job was managing all of the different personalities and finding creative ways to solve problems between employees. Everyone at Nordstrom was incredibly friendly and willing to help. I made some very close friends there that I am grateful to still have in my life even though I am not currently working there."
good,Being able to make a difference in customers lives.  Able to juggle multiple projects individually and collaboratively.  A company that has remained a leader in the retail industry since 1901.
good,not enough communication with staff members. but over all a good company to work for. working for the company was good up to the changes that had happen where everything was flip and other was better for the company.
good,The manager struck me as ill tempered but again I was only there briefly so I can't really give a real review. My coworkers seemed pretty alright though
good,Nordstrom Rack was a very fast paced place to work so it always kept you busy. You get the chance to learn a lot obout fashion and meet a lot of great people.
good,its a productive working place but its not something that can handle my bills. and all so its a really hard job for the people who cant work fast with heavy equipment.
good,It has a been a very intersting experience working at this location.I would definitely recommend to work in an environment where management and employees have a good relaetionship..It is very important for the benefit of all parties involved.
good,"Not the right fit for me. Good management, friendly coworkers. Not alot of freetime outside of work. No flexible hours. Good pay, but was really worn down after overtime shifts."
good,"Retail work environment "
good,"The majority of the time i was there, the managers tried to keep everyone motivated with contests and other fun activities. It was a great work environment but the fellow employees did not get along very well."
good,You're really just a sales associate for their semi-annual sale. But a lot of future employers will know Nordstrom and because of their customer service reputation they will see that as a good thing.
good,I think that Nordstrom is great for people that need to have a flexible schedule. It's a great place to connect with all kinds of people for all type of events and even other job opportunities down the road. You can grow with the company and have the ability to relocate stores if needed.
good,"Set up station answer incoming calls from customers wanting purchase items online. I learned the ins and outs of online shopping as a retailer. The management team was the worst. It was a stressful workplace. The hardest part of the job was being nice when you got a unhappy customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was free snacks, breakfast, and lunches that were sometimes available in break room."
good,Good job of with the company full on not so good of a job if you are a temp treated like 2nd class. Management can be a bit more transparent in my opinion.
good,I was promoted twice in 3 years....however; the company should care more about their employees. No work life balance. I was well liked but didn't like the politics. Some managers played favorites.
good,"Enjoyed working with new customers and repeat customers which is really why I wanted to work with Nordstrom.... love interacting with people. It was fun to build new relationships."
good,"When I finished college, I wanted to be a fashion buyer; in order to do that I had to start by selling in a store. My manager was great, the people I worked with were great but it was a very competitive position. Our departments were all so close, so anytime someone walked in, everyone tried to help that customer. You get paid on what you sale and if the item gets returned then it hits you and comes out of your pay. I was living in the city at the time and was looking to come back home, so I started at Enterprise Rent a Car in order to do that."
good,"It's a high stress, good paying job that if you like physical/mobile work  environment would be a great place to work. Lots of overtime if that is  your cup of tea"
good,"I have been employed by Nordstrom for 11 years, it's a great place to work. There customer service is exceptionally great as well as the many perks you receive by working for Nordstrom. Unfortunately with Nordstrom many jobs are being eliminated such as mine."
good,Its kind of a fast paced enviroment it has a pretty good starting pay and the people there were good coworkers (at the place i worked) i can say if you want to work at a place that pretty relaxed environment you should consider it.
good,Great company to work for if you are just starting in the work industry. Flexible with school/ life schedule. The pay is better than most retailers. I would recommend to a friend.
good,"work there when I was going to school, my manager was very nice and understanding."
good,Nordstrom was in general a fun place to work at. With plenty opportunity to grow with in the company. Friendly people and excellent customer service for every sales associate
good,"Very productive . Nice people , but hard to have sick days off, company functions on point system for work days. Have to go with the hours assigned by management"
good,"If you don't reach your goals they cut your hours and is not important if you are a great salesperson and if you have a wonderful customer service!"
good,"Every store is different so be aware of that and also have a plan if this is not your dream career. You can make a lot of money if you hustle but if thats not your buy in then don't get caught up. "
good,"Management was okay, but there was always a new manger every few months. I was a seasonal worker so i did not receive any bxelifits or 401k. Pay was okay could have been better."
good,"worked as BP shoes sales associate. goal oriented environment which was nice. manager picked favorites and didn't listen to complaints which made the environment more difficult to work in. lots of earning potential around christmas time. be careful though - your coworkers will steal your sales (i.e if an exchange comes in, they will ring it up under their own number instead of ringing it up under your number)"
good,"I have been a commissioned sales associate for Nordstrom full line for several years, I have always enjoyed helping customers put together the perfect wardrobe. Now it has become very difficult to make money as you depend on commission sales to make your paycheck but now spend most of the day doing online returns instead. There is also a huge shortage of in store merchandise and customers notice all of the empty space. They are now pulling from the store to fill online orders. Also encouraging customers to buy online and utilize curbside pickup keeps them from coming in to see us. Management refuses to acknowledge and address  these issues leading to massive turnover."
good,Nordstrom is a good company who looks to take care of the employees although it's really up to who you report into and management in your area.    Very slow with making decisions and lots of confusion when trying to complete tasks.   Trust can be an issue depending on the group that you're in.  It's not a technology company trying to get into the technology space but there's a lot of confusion and problems going on in that space right now.
good,"I worked there for a month, and everything was fine, but they started giving us wrong times to show up for work, giving us wrong times for our shifts."
good,This company help me out when I did not have a job and was actively seeking employment. Good staff and work had to help me find work when needed. Thanks
good,A good place to work over all. Doesn't really promote the growth of it's employees. I think it might depend on who your manager is. Benefits are good.
good,"Nordstrom provides a suitable work environment especially for college students looking for a place to work in the summer. Corporate would be a better environment if you're looking for a career. Pay was decent and raises were few and far between depending on whether you're full-time or part-time. If you work full time there is very little work/life balance and managers will schedule you on days that you tell them you can't work but they will usually fix it unless they ""absolutely need you"". Management is also a mixed bag and some managers can be generally relaxed and will trust you to do your job and some will micromanage and scrutinize every little thing you do or don't do. Management is constantly changing things everyday without too much thought into how it affects our workflow or how we interact with customers."
good,"I was paid well and given lots of hours. It's well organized so you feel productive. Note that you are only given credit for the number of items that you pack. Workers will only pack items that make them look fast. If you take on support tasks such as applying shipping labels or preparing items for shipment,  you are not given credit. Playing games in order to one up your coworkers is encouraged. There are some hard workers but also a few show boaters who only work when the boss is around."
good,"A nice place to work if you don't like a faced paced "
good,"Very direct and organized management structure."
good,Must contact every night for work instructions. Picking orders and making sure that they are correct product. management communicated issues and resolutions quickly.
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work. I would  tell anyone about Nordstrom.  Nordstrom has some pros n cons just like most places that anyone works at. Most of the time it’s a laid back place to work unless we r on OT.
good,"Rewards for performance is unmatched, but u have to earn it. Not much management interaction to help improve results if not experienced. Discount is good."
good,"My work day was very productive it was never a time I wasn't doing anything , for the most park work was great I just didn't have good hours , but the people I worked with was very nice and caring"
good,"Part time job,basically just come in and restock the shelves.You just waited for the trucks to unload and them the stock was delivered to the area and put away."
good,"I only worked seasonally for Nordstrom for the anniversary sale and would not work in a retail position for the company ever again. Not only do you have to deal with customers looking for ways to get extra money or discounts because of Nordstrom's customer service policies but the other sales associates are only ever looking out for themselves because of commission based sales. It was difficult to have a positive relationship with coworkers because half the sales floor was only looking to land their next big sale or shark yours. When I asked one of the visual merchandising managers on how to work my way up to their position, they shrugged me off and condescended to me even though I was in college and looking to apply for the visual merchandising internship with Nordstrom. I still think this is a great company and its well run, but not on the retail side."
good,"The cosmetics department is very cutthroat, as you have several women all trying to get someone to buy their makeup as a lot of your salary is commission based."
good,"Was fun selling designer brands. But hated how, if you had one bad day in selling, you would quickly get pushed by your manager to sell more. Granted it is a commissioned environment, I was just starting and learning the ropes. I mostly had supportive coworkers who said I was doing just fine, but I knew my manager thought otherwise. Overall it’s a good job but I left feeling stressed and loom at my job as a cutthroat position thanks to the commission.."
good,"As far as retail goes, Nordstrom is pretty good. But at the end of the day, it's still a retail job. It's a commission based job so if you sell well and are in the right department and store location, you can get by. But when sales are slow, you do get stressed out about a smaller paycheck. Every store has its own culture and every department manager runs their department different, some are great some are not."
good,"Nordstrom was interesting. I came into contact with managers who I realized I would've enjoyed working for, but I did not have such a manager. Leadership was spotty."
good,"That is all, over it. The company wanted you to wear police style uniform, which does not represent loss prevention it represents a security guard.  it was not appropriate for the image that we want to represent people come to spend a lot of money yet when you're wearing a uniform in the store you look like that you're making them feel ike like that have committed a crime when they have just entered as a customers not as a guest."
good,If you are ok with working weekend and love that everyday is different Nordstrom is the place for you. The products are culture is great. Hardest part of the job for me was having to work holidays and not being able to go home. I loved my customers and being the go-to person for all fashion questions as well as making people's dream wedding
good,"At this time I do not wish to provide any further information on the company I have worked for. "
good,Nordstrom was a satisfactory company to work for. They made sure all of my working needs were met. I felt more comfortable serving our guests than co-workers.
good,"Tie in with 3rd shift material handlers. Check emails truck schedule to see what we have for incoming trucks and pallets. Replenish supplies, totes, trollies etc. Do a visual inspection of forklift and fill out proper paperwork before use. Unload and load trucks according to volume. Move and deliver pallets to various parts of the warehouse. Delivering supplies."
good,Nordstrom was a very flexible place to work. They allowed me to go to school as well as work part time. They also allowed me to work overtime if needed or wanted.
good,"Most enjoyable: working on a team"
good,"I started working here for experience with customer service and the company brand. The employee/coworker experience was about the only nice part about come back to work. Management was poor as well as lacking of motivation to do well in departments. Even though given the demographics of customers, it was fairly hard to reach your commission pay goal. wasn't worth it for me to work there 32+ hours a week and get payed minimum wage."
good,"Co-workers were like family! Horrible hours and pay was unpredictable because it's commission based. It's great when it's good, It's horrible when it's not. More demanding than your typical retail job. Overall a great company."
good,"Expect large chunks of time taken from your day in order to maximize working hours while working around a long meal break. Most days customer rush hour can feel never ending, leaving one exhausted and worn down especially during major sale events where customers attempt to push the limits of what the sale allows and many aspects of the sale must be inputted manually leading to additional frustration and stress."
good,"I was in highschool when I worked at Nordstrom.  It was a summer intern opportunity that I was glad to have.  This was a job I would have loved to get again, but when I applied again I wasn't hired."
good,"Came in once a month to learn about fashion and the fashion industry, hardly learned much. Perhaps an hour or so, person in charge had no idea what she was doing for the year."
good,"Good place to work, can work your way up. Not great pay, all salespeople are commission based. Returns come back. Can be alot of work for commission only. Work weekends and holidays. But good with time off."
good,Store managers are biased and does not help to promote employees.  The department environment is positive and customers make the days better. Human resources can be more reliable.
good,"Great for someone who enjoys engaging with public and likes fashion.  If you're social, you'll enjoy meeting new people and co-workers.  You will have to be ok  with commission pay for all sales positions.  There are opportunities for advancement within the company."
good,"Summer 2013 & Summer 2014 Nordstrom (Sales) Dallas, TX"
good,A friendly diverse atmosphere with great team members and understanding Human Resource office whom care about their employees and their customer if I chose work in Retail again I would be chose them.
good,Maintaining a clean and clutter free environment.Making sure the sales floor was sized and filled in. Providing customers a fast and friendly checkout
good,Feel of company can vary by department due to different managerial styles. Co-workers are either fantastic or difficult to work with since it is a commission based job.
good,I was a full time student while working there and they require quite a few hours from you. It is hard to do for a part time job. The people I worked with are great and for the most part is a friendly environment.
good,"The days differed, sometimes the day went smooth and some days we had rude customers. I have learned good communication skills and how to appropriately deal with certain situations."
good,"fast paced company."
good,Income based on Commissioned sales. Thorough training provided.  Company culture is supportive.  Discount and benefits are just average. Meeting every morning- recognize top sellers for day.
good,Met nice people.  It was fun and the clothes were amazing. It helped me develop my conversation skills.  I simply loved in when we got new styles in and had to go throught them.
good,Nothin special about working here..it was alright...Definitely a money hungry company. The employees discount is to low to me considering how big the company actually is.
good,The best part of working for Nordstrom was the management. The team was inspiring and always lifted up the sales team i was very sad when i left. I made a great family working there.
good,"It's a great place to learn how to develop great customer service skills. When it is a busy day, the sales are great but when it's a slow day it can be difficult to make sales to balance out the returns. The workplace is a very friendly environment from the store manager to the coworkers."
good,Nordstrom is overall a fun good place to work with strong leaders that allow you to succeed. The hours can be tiring considering its ever-changing but I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,"It feels legit because it's such a big and respected company, but generally I've never had an issue resolved when I felt I needed to address a problem."
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for at any age. They work extremely close with their customers making sure they are delivering the best customer service. Nordstrom puts customer service first which really makes this retail company stand out compared to others.
good,"I enjoyed helping customers find something for an occasion, and had a really supportive team. However I believe we have too many customers who are spoiled to believe our products from different companies are to last forever, and so they go on a buy and return binge. It's hard to help certain customers when you feel like your time is wasted after they acknowledge they WILL return these items, especially after years of being worn and eventually damaged. Customers can be horrible, I've witnessed co-workers even walking out after being treated so poorly."
good,a great experience lovely people i did not have a good work life balance as a manager so i took some time off to carre for my children.if you are single with  no kids it would work better. as a manager.
good,"Fast paced environment. Worked on commission, so the more work you put in, the more you benefit. Holidays are busier than the rest of the year, similar to most retail jobs. Be ready to work holidays and weekends."
good,"I enjoyed working at Nordstrom. My immediately manager was dedicated to providing a healthy work environment. Of course, meeting sales goals were important; however, your performance was only privy to management, and not your coworkers. Thus resulting in a more peaceful place to work. Advancement was offered when performance guidelines were met."
good,it’s okay just a typical retail job decent pay. managers do play favorites pay is okay. you get raised by how many hours you work. hours are inconsistent
good,"It was enjoyable working here for the holiday season. I thought that some of the pace and the ""pep"" system were a little bit unrealistic to meet. I know a lot of people just lied about the ""pep"" to meet the requirements!"
good,"Good place to work, good training provided. They have a good vibe for customers but don't treat the employees half as good. Also discount is so low you can barely afford anything."
good,"Your standard retail job sorting clothes, upselling and selling credit cards.  Cool atmosphere with good people.  Up beat and happy.  Your standard job."
good,"friendly people, comfortable environment. when I started working at one of nordstroms biggest competitors I really missed working at Nordstrom........"
good,how to work with other people and building more of a lasting relationship.  Was able to help others too as I have previous experience.  They were appreciative.
good,"Nordstrom provided me with necessary skills and room to grow.  I enjoyed my 8 years working as a salesperson, Assistant manager and department manager."
good,Store manager and HR representatives are very helpful and kind. Management for almost every department needs work. Days are very long and the scheduling is meh. Excellent workplace culture. Very fun environment. Job is easy. great exercise.
good,It is very back breaking work. short break times. expensive health benefits that require you to pay a very high deductible. No opportunity to advance off of the warehouse floor. managers play favoritism. Low wages and lots of lay offs at certain times of the year.  Their flexible schedule has kept me there so long. They will always try to accommodate your life outside of work if they can.
good,"Had a great experience"
good,"Overall, company is supportive of its employees, but there is so much growth within the company in recent years as well as with loss prevention technology that the there have been a lot of changes and challenges for loss prevention personnel, and not all are improvements."
good,Worked at Nordstrom for numerous years always overlooked when applied for management overall the customers were great and always thanked you for helping them
good,"Stocking and waiting on customers"
good,"Lots of meetings, not enough time to actually do work. It's a very collaborative culture, which is great, but that works against it in terms of who is the decision maker."
good,"Good management but the employees are not as friendly. Long shift hours and very competitive. Over all, it is a good place to work and grow. I would recommend working there."
good,Nordstrom is an awesome place to work if you're a competitive sales person. There's plenty of opportunity to move up the chain if you can prove your worth. I had a terrible manager and still enjoyed it.
good,Great if you like retail. Pays more than most retailers. Work can be fun some days and exhausting others. Discounts are amazing. Room for fast advancement if you're a determined individual
good,Lots to do with fair compensation. Very flexible with schedule. Being in departments allow you to focus on one task instead of being in charge of the whole store.
good,"I've learned a lot over the years in Nordstrom finance, but the lack of career growth opportunities is requiring me to seek employment elsewhere.  If you're comfortable where you are in your career and are seeking a lateral move, this is a great place to work.  Benefits are average, compensation is above average, and the workplace culture is good."
good,"Working at Nordstrom was okay. When it was slow at the store the days dragged on, but when it was busy your shift would go pretty fast. They have some pretty high expectations for you to open Nordstrom credit cards for customers. The management at the store I worked for was alright. I felt like they cared more about hitting numbers than providing a great experience for the customers."
good,"I only was hired for a one-day inventory count, but in that one day I noticed the other employees respected the company and their co-workers.  A generally pleasant atmosphere."
good,"Depending on who your coworkers are, it can be a fun, simple job to have! If you work with people you enjoy to be around, work can be super enjoyable. You get a lot of customer interaction, which i enjoy. But management can be a bit unnecessarily strict."
good,Great place to work.  It is a great place to start your career in retail.  Management was average.  Culture was great in certain departments. Hardest part of the job was inconsistent schedule.
good,My co-workers got weird about who's sale was who's because it's 100% commission based. It was also a very catty environment. If there were ever any issues I felt like they went in one ear and out the other. It wasn't the right fit for me.
good,"Working for nordstrom had it's ups and downs. Definitely worth it for the pay and benefits. A little unrealistic for expectations of employees and management has more of a tendency to break you down instead of build you up. The events are fun but stressful and happen more often than not. The downside was having to contact customers in and outside of work almost as often as bi-weekly to replenish products or invite to events, which can be difficult in the beauty world to get people to come back that often. Nordstrom is a great company to work for if you are able to separate work life balance well and have a go-getter competitive personality."
good,It's alright.  The customer's are generally very entitled and the company will always side with them and being a middle-manager is a practice in servitude.
good,"The pay is excellent but the schedule is physically demanding. It is extremely fast paced, every weekend is mandatory, and you have to be comfortable being on your feet for the entire shift"
good,A typical day depending on which department I worked in could vary and also depending on which store and region I worked in could also vary. There was lots of turn over for different reasons. A very structured workplace.
good,"It was pretty stressful job for me because you never know what would your paycheck look like.  But thats what you get for  commission based work. Also it was very competitive, you can never relax, because you need to watch out for your customer not to be 'stollen'y one of your colleges."
good,"a typical day at work was stressful , but it went by fast for the most part the co workers are very nice and easy to get along with . the only peoblems you might have is with management."
good,"All sales employees are commission based at Nordstrom, depending on the department you work in, the rate varies from from 3% up to 10%. As management in retail we were responsible for daily, monthly and yearly sales targets within each of our departments. The day to day operation of our department can be streamlined very easily, but does vary from month to month depending on events that were going on within the company. Having worked up and down the West Coast in multiple stores, I was able to see and experience different styles of management and truly become submerged in the culture of the brand. As of late, the direction of the company has begun to shift from being a tried and true person to person brand that catered to a family unit from top to bottom to playing catch up with the ever changing demand of a digital market place. With programs designed for the millennial customers, and hard metrics to be met using such programs (apps) it began to alienate the very customers that made the company what it is today. Nordstrom continues to be a leader in fashion and a pillar of the communities that they are located in, and I don't ever see that changing."
good,Must be dedicated to the job very time consuming but wirth the pay . Very nice employees and manager will work with you schedule for sure.some crazy rules but very understandable
good,"I was excited to work for Nordstrom when I first was hired a few years ago. It was a fun and exciting place to work, but due to the recent shift in customers buying more online, the company has made changes that no longer make working here as exciting as it used to be. "
good,"Times change, management changes you have to be to be flexible.  "
good,"After working for so long in retail, recent  decisions  in the company has made it to where I can no longer stand working here. It’s a good company if you like retail, I am not one of them."
good,i have workerd for them for only 4 months and the mangers really dont care for their employees. they will work you until you cant work anymore.. They scheduling isnt great and they are always having you stay late
good,This job although taught alot about customer service is still not something that has long term potential. Highly recommend this job to someone wanting work during the summer time or even during high volumes like season.
good,"wonderful store to work for"
good,Liked working  in the makeup department. Enjoyed the clients and most of the employees. Schedule was a little gruesome but bearable. Some employees were not that friendly.
good,This is one of those companies that the customer is your boss. The customer takes complete advantage and is waited on hand and foot. The pay is not great and advancement can be difficult.
good,It was an alright experience. Many ups and downs. Some managers were better than others. Lots of disorganization within the company. Company could improve on many things.
good,"Dept. Manager was the worst ever stealing employees sells, hides the schedule book so that employees cant use their paid time off days off. Grest discounts"
good,One of the leading retail employers that provides excellent customer service and sales practices. They provide flexible hours for staff and have maintained long term employees.
good,I enjoyed working on a daily basis in an environment where I could do whatever needed to make a customer happy.  A lot of it was simple stuff that made the customers experience that much better than the competition.
good,Extremely high pace work. Management was rude and the position was in no way rewarding. There are not enough hours nor are there any opportunities for growth
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for with lots of potential to grow, good pay and benefit and they love to promote and hire from within. the culture changes from one store to another according to management. Very fast paced environment , so put you comfortable shoes on. The rack is a great place to grow in inventory management and merchandising."
good,"My typical day involves helping to keep inventory stocked for the pickers.  It isn't a hard job, but I wish I could have more hours.  I think that this job is good."
good,"i'd rather not say the reasons of why i am not working here anymore, but if you're trendy in fashion and love working with customers on a daily basis this is the job for you."
good,"Ok  place to work, if you already have another job. That pays weekly or biweekly.They provide an Open door policy. Which making it easy,to speak to your manager.And Human Resources which is awesome."
good,This job was a very easy task to do on a daily basis. I've managed all merchandise through out the facility and satisfied our customers with great customer service on my behalf.
good,"It was fun for a first job. You have busy and slow days. I would recommend if you are really passionate about being a sales person. Managers are the problem, most of them are unprofessional and lazy."
good,I liked the people that I worked with as everyone was very nice and helpful when I needed help or questions. I worked there over the holidays and the hours were awful. My shift started at 4am and went until 2pm.
good,Managers clearly dont receive much training in actual management. They are just promoted sales people. Favoritism is apparent within stores and for promotion opportunities.
good,The clients are great but management needs a lot of work.  Schedule is not regular due to the fact that it is normally understaffed.  It is normally understaffed because there is a high turn around.
good,the most relaxed job ive had. Great team leaders everyone is always positive and helps to motivate to get the job done. The warehouse is big and mostly all the department's are fast paced so you are always on your feet and on the move.
good,"Create merchandise presentations to standards, team building, teaching selling, organization of the stock room, excellent customer service, excellent communication "
good,I worked there during start up of this facility so it was hard for me to fully judge. home work life is not the best. overtime is forced without ample warning.
good,"Working at Nordstrom taught me a lot. While it was a temporary job out of college, it just wasn't the place where I felt there was much opportunity for advancement in the company. You work long hours with sometimes very rude customers or employees and are not compensated nearly enough."
good,"Nordstrom is very progressive and welcoming towards every identity. HR is frequently busy but WILL take care of you. I learned a lot about self-management, inventory orders/adjustments, merchandise transferring, and above all doing more than just ""clerking"" with my customer. When I say that it means you follow up, you style people, you go above and beyond for your customers and make real relationships with them. It's amazing, everyone is basically there own business. The hardest part of the job is the cutthroat competition between newbies and veteran salespeople and the lack of job advancement. If you're in a department you don't like, you can't just switch to another as easily as one would think. You really have to fight for salary raises, full-time status--anything. It can be frustrating. If it wasn't for that I would have gladly stayed."
good,"As far as retail sales are concerned, Nordstrom is better than most because of their commission based compensation structure. If you work hard and develop your client base, you can earn a decent living as far as this industry is concerned."
good,"Commission based. Fun environment and I love my customers! But for those of you looking for steady pay- don't count on it. You have to put in the effort to be on a ""calling campaign"" to ensure a decent paycheck. It can be quite competitive. If you are a ""people's person""you'll do just fine!"
good,Nordstrom used to be a promote from within place but that changed.  Mass layoffs of people who had been there for 10 plus years. Also trying to apply agile where it wasn't really applicable
good,Nordstrom is not what it used to be. Very stressful and managers do not teach you anything. Customer traffic is slow but very high goals. i do not recommend
good,"When I expressed interest in taking on new roles I was denied HR gave me ""the run around"" I wanted to grow with this company but i am now discouraged."
good,"If you are a competitive person, this job is for you. Managers really try to help and encourage you to meet your goal. Work place is fun and energetic. There is always something entertaining going on."
good,If in the right department there is a lot of opportunity to make a good amount of money. In the department I was in a lot of the time people would return a good amount. In the store I was in there was also a new store manager and she lost a lot of good brands. Nordstrom at Beachwood lost that certain spark that led to a lot of the appeal it brought for a lot of customers.
good,Running after customers all day and then get a large amount of returns.... no win. I would recommend only being seasonal because the money is so up and down
good,"-Amazing place to work if you have a love for fashion. They always keep you up to date with fashion trends. "
good,I do enjoy what I do &  glad to take responsibility . love the sales to make happy customers and make my goals for the staff and Nordstrom's. Always trying to improve myself
good,Nordstrom is really laid back. You're at a booth with people in a line. You pack orders that come through a shoot. You take back missed placed items. =
good,"a typical day at work, you are always busy. Customers are the priority, but in off time you will spend countless hours picking up piles of clothes from fitting rooms, making sure everything is pristine and dust-free, sizing fixtures, doing markdowns, etc. This is not a good place for lazy people, as if you do not make effort you will not build relationships with customers which is the environment Nordstrom has tried to create with it's employees. You will also call your customers to set up appointments with them for upcoming events, help customers get alterations, do orders for customers online if the item they want is not available in the store and more. It has a great culture where there are no rules besides ""use your best judgement"" but the managers are pretty strict there, always looking for more even if you're the one giving the most out of the team."
good,Loved the people i worked with and the customers but needed to make more $. Also enjoyed selling the products at nordstroms. Too many hours for the pay
good,"Growth potential is for the younger generation.  Compensation needs to be seriously looked at and worked on, especially in the Pacific Northwest region.  Serving in the brick and mortar stores, as a long term employee, that is not the case.  We are the heartbeat (and face) of Nordstrom and should be compensated as such. Without the heart, the company could not survive!!!  The benefits are decent!  Glad to have what I have. It seems there are take a-ways each year, although the company seems to be growing leaps and bounds...."
good,"very friendly nature of work .and team is help full and good administration ."
good,"Work experience is essential for getting a job. Whether it's a short work placement or a longer internship, work experience is always viewed favorably by employers and can help you decide your future career.f"
good,The benefits and pay was good but the hours and work were grueling. Some of the coworkers were amazing to be around and some of them were grating to be around.
good,"Nordstrom is going through a lot of changes, especially at the rack. This caused a lot of drama and stress on most of the employees. I would say the management is not top notch because they only promote from within. A lot of the managers play favorites too. How friendly and likable the employees are changes from store to store. All of the employees at my store were great and everyone got along. The hardest part of the job was trying to merchandise according to the guide. A lot of the times we didn't have the product that they wanted featured. Honestly the most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with. Overall, I would only recommend this job to those that love retail and want to have that as a career."
good,Productive and Friendly Workplace.  Goals were clearly established at beginning with sales targets. I would recommend anybody to work here. Management is great.
good,"Fun place to work, smart people who generally care about the work they perform on a daily basis.  Leadership empowers employees to make pertinent decisions."
good,"The days at work were fine, at least when i was there. I expected way more days and hours and it would've been perfect.I learned much more things that i didn't know while i was working there. It really wasn't anything hard about the job everything was understanding and easy. I love that i worked with customers. The job was fine its just the hours and time you have working there, not enough."
good,Although I didn't stay at this job for very long it was a fun work environment and I enjoyed the time I spent with this company. The only issue I  encountered was miscommunication within different departments.
good,"If you love the retail world, Nordstrom is for you.  It is a very demanding job- long hours, a lot of work on and off the floor, however the culture is very family oriented and allows for job advancements."
good,"productive days, long hours, you have to work hard to grow with the company. You have to be outgoing and team work is priority. A good job for the time being."
good,"good food, good management, nice clientele, good location, fellow employees are all nice. Easy job if you are organized and a respectful person that can communicate with others."
good,"As amazing as the retail division is, the restaurant division fails to grasp key concepts of the food and beverage industry. They suffer from a lack of clear vision in their execution, mostly due to having too many concepts and too many upper managers throwing their ideas around."
good,"-learned time management "
good,"From when you clock in till you clock out, you are on your feet. very competitive and high pace. Managers are cool when they are being competitive. Good place to start a career"
good,I worked here so long ago it is very difficult to rate how it is ran now. I know people who have stuck with Nordstrom and enjoy working for the company. I do miss that 20% discount!
good,"Nordstrom is great place to work; however, they are still new to Canada so they are still organizing the system, but they are getting better because they are listening the ideas from the team."
good,The hours are flexible and my co workers were great to work with. Management could use a little work in treating employees like human beings and not robots.
good,Friendly work environment.  Management available when needed to settle disputes and customer complaints. Appreciated direct customer interaction. The work hours were not always consistent.
good,"typical day at work is taking care of fitting rooms, greeting customers, cashier. Managers play favorites, they give little hours for those who dont get favored."
good,I like the atmosphere here but the pay and the mangement could of been much better. I felt fortunate to be liked by the management but a lot of other people weren't. Fast paced at lunch time. Great learning opportunity though
good,a pleasant atmosphere to work in with a very professional friendly management team. commission based job makes pay very inconsistent. slow going job outside of the holiday season.
good,"What I enjoyed most about working for Nordstrom was giving people an opportunity. I loved training my team. Seeing my team trust me, win by making money and develop was fulfilling. Empowering others and showing them opportunities for sales and growth brought enjoyment. Creating a fun and friendly, yet competitive workplace. The hardest part about my job was the turnover."
good,Good company to work for. It is however extremely competitive and cut-throat. they offer benefits and paid time off if you work there long enough. overall a good experience.
good,"This is a great opportunity to make good money of you can move in a fast paced environment where the hustle is constant and competition is high. Great flexibility with schedules, perfect while attending school. But there is a lot of favoritism and management can be unfair."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time at Nordstrom. I will say the work/life balance was horrible. this job consumed my entire life and it was very thankless. On at least 2 occasions I was forced to work an entire shift without a break.I can't and won't complain about compensation. I will say, there were a few instances were I felt people got promoted more because of connections and who they knew rather than merit or ability."
good,I worked in the Call Center in Seattle.  The stats were constantly changing every month as to what the bonus/incentive was based on.  the matrix eventually became to difficult to bonus.  Management was stressed out and we all know which way the snowball rolls!  Started as fun.. ended as stressfull
good,"Nordstrom is a good sales environment for those who want earn based on individual commissions. (at least it did at the time I worked there)  There was definitely an opportunity to make some money, but you had to be really aggressive. The object was to get to the suit department where the big commissions were, but not easy."
good,Nordstrom is super fun! I just often wonder how much different it is on the West coast than her on the East coast. I really wanted to continue with the company but another opportunity opened up.
good,As a sales/ makeup artist I was really able to build my skills in the cosmetics department. It is a great way to connect with many different types of people.
good,"Because of the commission-based sales environment, it is best to work in a busy location if you actually want to make money. Manager ratings can vary, I've had great experiences, but I've heard horror stores about other department managers."
good,Everything was clean. Besides some rich customers who would act a little stuck up. Watching them change their mood with good customer service skills is fun.
good,Nordstrom is a fun job and a chance to make great money only if you know how to sell if not then its not the job for you because they do fire you if your not meeting sales numbers.
good,"Retail management internship"
good,The only complaint about working for this company is how my manager treated me unfairly. I rarely called out and have been very transparent that I have a medical condition and am trying to get FMLA in order to not be penalized. I have been the only person who has been threatened with a write up (to my knowledge). Even though others call out much more often than I ever have.
good,"Nordstrom promotes from within, which is great if you're the fan favorite. If you're not you are subject to quite a bit of ridicule from management and fellow staff. I love the people I get to help on a day to day basis it is just difficult when you want to move up. Also, there are multiple events you must reach pre sell goals for and if not met your hours will be effected."
good,I am timed picking up and searching for online orders. it is stressful when the number of orders out number the time I have to find them. we need more help
good,"fast pace"
good,"meet and help new people everyday with fashion. create your own pay check the more you sell the more you make. great employee discounts, you can go into the management program but positions are given to favorites in the company."
good,"Working at Nordstrom wasn't bad at all. They take care of their employees and try to make it fun for everyone. However, the environment is very clique based all the way up to the store manager who was completely biased towards certain people and dept managers. It's an amazing start for people that want to pursue retail as a career. If that's not what you want, it's hard to go everyday and constantly try and make your numbers etc."
good,I very much enjoyed my time at Nordstrom and look back on long shifts with the sales team fondly. It was a fun and professional environment where everyone was often helping one another. Changes in management unfortunately caused me to seek other employment.
good,"Some days I would have great sales and during slow times the job became boring and tedious.  Co-workers were a bit difficult to deal with when it came to being fair with sales. Great job while you are in college, as I worked seasonally and full time for a year once I graduated college."
good,I have worked here for over five years. The location is great. Business has slowed down. This is a good company. This particular store has seen better times three years ago.
good,I only did this job for quick money. I learned a lot from the many different personalities i came in contact with. This job took a toll on my body; but I did learn a ton about women's shoes. I would not recommend this job to anyone of my peers.
good,I had an enjoyable experience at Nordstrom meeting the different types and cultures that the customers came in with. It made my day to make someone smile when they came into the Bistro.
good,"This is a good entry point into working for Nordstrom corporate. You learn a variety of tools and partner with numerous internal counterparts as well as external business partners, however opportunities for advancement are few and far between."
good,If you can get passed a culture of nepotism and inconsistency than this is the place for you! There is enough business to go around and while making money isn't particularly difficult the company has so many business pilots that it's hard to find a niche in how you sell and ultimately make your own paycheck.
good,"Good 401K."
good,It was fun dealing with the customers and some colleagues. The down fall was the micro-managing managers at the time. They made it seem as if you had the authority to make decisions within your position but you really never did.
good,It was so fun to work at nordstrom  .unfortunately the pay was bad . if you weren't making commission/draw pay was only 10 an hour and you got paid every two weeks like 500. alot to be done at work. customers were awesome. just wish the company would appreciate the employees more !
good,"Pros of working at Nordstrom:"
good,Its a great company to work for... Great benefits... Growth... You are given the opportunity to use your best judgement... Great Culture... A family environment
good,Nordstrom is a fun place to work. You can wear almost whatever you want as long as it's appropriate and you can listen to your music while you are working.
good,"Good for a part-time job, stable money. "
good,Very good and high paying job if you know how to work with commission.  The only problem with the job is they are not flexible with your schedule and you have no choice to work there sales.
good,I've loved working for Nordstrom but it's getting tough in the retail world. I've been awarded pacesetter a few years but now it's not even obtainable to make. This means I have lost my raise which doesn't help the commission I'm losing in general due to retail going downhill. It's hard to compete with online when they actually offer incentives.
good,work culture was good friendly environment get to pick your lunch duration and typically get feed free food for lunch.  Hardest part was not having a manager for the majority of my tenure.
good,"As a general laborer I went to work and did the same thing everyday. I took the bus in the morning. Next, I got my daily department assignment went to said department and had to meet a quota at the end of every hour. Since I was temporary I din't get a real feel for the company culture."
good,"In this day and age call center reps have the right to disconnect a call, if the customer is extremely rude, mean, or if they are cussing; not at this particular credit center. You take the call, and then after you report the customer, though all calls are recorded. Most customers are extremely nice and understanding, but there is always that one, you may get it during that day, or that week, but you always get at least one. I liked it, but would rather a customer scream in my face, instead of over the phone."
good,"all about customers helping them to find their needs making connection with them to help them meet their need, leraning about working under stress and problem solving"
good,"Can be very competitive"
good,"Multitude of companies that provide exceptional customer service. Jobs included high volume of customer support, resolving customer issues, store clerk duties. Developed highly empathetic client relationships and earned reputation for exceeding service standard goals. Trained new staff on operating procedures and company services."
good,"Great job, just the hours aren't amazing with school, love their brand, items, etc. The hardest part of the job is staying busy"
good,"This was my first job which showed me what the world of being in the business entails, the competitiveness, hard work type environment, drive, and focus, and excellent customer service was always the priority."
good,"Nordstrom is a major retail merchandiser with a successful presence in the North American market.  It is well designed and very well managed, as you would expect."
good,"People in the company were great to work with and work for."
good,The job was easy and the pay was okay. Management needs to help out more besides sitting in the back. The discount should be more than 20%. For the amout of work that we do we should get a raise.
good,"My store didn't hire new people for months after many people left putting the work load on who ever was there. Can be a lot of work with massive amounts of go backs, but pay is better than most places. Pay increases with number of hours worked. It all depends on store manger and department mangers personality."
good,"Great place to work, depending on what job you're doing. "
good,"always something to tidy up"
good,It  does not create promotional opportunities and the money is less than satisfactory.  Hours are also not always available or shifts to pick up.
good,Favoritism is a big thing. You can learn a lot but if not a favorite you won't make it far. You come across some wonderful people there. Management not on the same page.
good,"Horrible management and poor hiring process. Have now had 3 different managers, none which appear qualified for the job. People are hired based off of likeability, not skill (which is apparent)."
good,"This restaurant serves all fresh, organic and scratch American-Bistro style dishes ranging from salad, soup, risotto, house grind burgers, seafood, to homemade desserts. All ingredients used to prepare these dishes are organic, come from local produce providers, and some vary for seasonal reasons (ex:weekly specials).  I started at this restaurant as a Saute cook and from there on learned all aspects of the restaurant from Pizza/Sandwich, Salad, Cold App’s/Deserts, and Prep. Afterwards I started taking on inventory/orders from Sysco, Worldwide produce(recently switched to Nature's produce), and Premier meats. During my shift I run dinner service with a team on average of 3 to 6 other chef’s depending on the day and will run Saute/BOH Expediter unless other circumstances arise and must cover a shift. Corporate visits are common so I help guide and work with the kitchen staff to clean, organize, F.I.F.O all product etc. on a daily basis to ensure a clean and efficient kitchen at all times."
good,"If you love being helpful and pulling together looks for others, than this is the place to be. Often times you gain loyal customers who rely and hang onto your every  word regarding their wardrobe choice."
good,Prepared to work holidays and the night before and after holidays. This company is all about who you know and not about what you know and your skills.
good,"Nordstrom is a great corporation because they are committed to promoting talent from within and ensuring career advancement to top performers. Retail commission based sales positions are great for college students who need part time jobs that offer autonomy, flexible schedules, and a competitive and fast paced work environment, and Nordstrom is no exception!"
good,"In my 20+ years at Nordstrom, I learned many varied skills and appreciate the opportunities I was given, but the culture change of late is unfortunately taking its toll on those that have been there for a long time. Technology has come a long way- which is good, but it seems Nordstrom is trying to emulate Amazon, Microsoft, etc. which isn't conducive to a Retail company."
good,"Nordstrom certainly knows how to paint a pretty picture with smiles and perfect framing, but after a few days you begin to see the ugly side of the company culture. A typical day consists of standing on your feet like any retail job having to schmooze with customers in hopes of making a sale. Now this wouldn't be such a problem if the hourly rate was better (ATLEAST $10-12) thus not having to 'rely' so heavily on commission. This structure also creates a competitive atmosphere with your colleagues making it difficult to trust your ""team"" or formulate any real bonds. I hated this aspect for both reasons. "
good,"Would not recommend work from home. Micromanaging, work all holidays, isolating. Pay is good for the work. If you want meaningful work, dont do this job. If you're okay with snooty customers being upset about frivolous problems, go ahead."
good,Typical retail position. Working on commission is fair as you get paid for the efforts that you put in. Minimal opportunity for advancement.
good,"had fun working with others, always had group projects, and got along well with customers. managers did not give credit when it was do."
good,There are a few things that need to be improved but overall a good place to work.  Management needs improvement.  The staff are awesome to work with.
good,"Day to day responsibilities included managing the department staffing, budget and inventory. Managing department to meet daily/monthly sales goals."
good,"You have great potential to make lots of money here, like 20 years ago. The buyers pulled so many vendors from the stores, salespeople can't meet the sales expectation. The merchandise selection is no longer great. Management team is not supportive. All they care about is numbers. Meet your goals or you are cut. The location I worked at had great people, but bad management. Managers not approachable whatsoever. Retail life is working weekends. Schedule doesn't allow for flexibility. Requests must be put in a month in advance. Customers were different on a day-to-day basis. Some days you would get great sales, other days you end up owing money to Nordstrom. Commission based. Unreliable paycheck. Returns came out of your paycheck. Petty salespeople taking your sales. Computer system makes schedule. Petty shifts - I'm talking 4 hour shifts… what's the point of coming in for only 4 hours to sell? You can't make your sales goal at all. Young people always have to close. The ""veterans"" never closed or opened. They had the midday shifts. Otherwise known as the ""sell and leave"" shift.  The only pro was the trust Nordstrom gave to all its employees. The only rule is ""Use your best judgement."" You were in control of your actions. But that's it. They never treated you to free lunch or parties. You'll feel under-appreciated here. Oh, and the discount is a measly 20 percent. If you take tax into account, it's basically just a 10% discount. Petty."
good,As a Beauty Stylist you are well versed in every brand. A great way to show your customers how to mix and match their products. My favorite part about being a beauty stylist is making someone fill good through products.
good,"Fun and enjoyable place to work but retail hours are hard to have a work/life balance. Good management is hard to come by but if you have a good manager than its fun,"
good,"A typical day is servicing customers. Our number one goal is to satisfy our customers they come first. Fast paced environment, with great customer service. Equal opportunity company. I love to help customers and reward them."
good,"Pas trop d'esprit d'équipe, c'est dommage. Préparation de café et autres commandes, afin de satisfaire au mieux nos clients."
good,Everyone was great to work with it was just time to move on..... The consumer really stopped buying highend items all that often....
good,"Great place to work."
good,"Work days would be either slow or hectic. Being commission based was challenging in a good and bad way. A good way because it made you set goals and standards to out-do not only yourself, but your coworkers, as well. Competing with coworkers isn't as intimidating as much as it is supporting and pushing each other everyday. However, it could also be bad because during the slow days of work (months after holidays and weekdays) we, employees, wouldn't get paid commission because business would be slow. Overall, working with others, coworkers and customers, was enjoyable because it allowed me to assist, interact, and meet new people everyday."
good,"I loved the feeling of coming to work and it feeling like being around family, Nordstrom prides their selves on pleasing not only the customer but the employees."
good,Started off very promising but they have placed too many leaders in their positions not being prepared enough to handle their roles. Promotion from within isn't always the best for a company.
good,"Competitive"
good,"Cool job. Management sucks though. My manager was never there and when she was, she was extremely strict and made work uncomfortable"
good,Great company that really cares for its customers. At the end of the day however it is just retail so the work might not be stellar.
good,"Assisting customers, store and credit employees with orders, purchases and customer complaints. There are multiple reasons for the job but the fulfillment centers and stores messing up orders make it hard. There are some very good people that work here but there are the special few who make your job hard. The most enjoyable part of the day is shopping with the customer."
good,Fine job for those who enjoy customer service. The environment and coworkers were friendly and location was incredibly convenient.
good,it wasnt for me i didnt feel appeciated it was my first job never working fast foor again. i dont like how this review is mandatory.
good,Everyone for themselves. Commissioned based and there is no structure. Sometimes people take on two and three customers when other employees have none and our standing around. LOTS OF SHARKS. Favoritism is definitely in play. My manager at the time had no prior experience managing. Hardest part of the job was upselling. Most enjoyable part were the understanding customers.
good,typical day would be receiving shipment of shoes and having to place them onto sales floor and in stock room. Management and coworkers were nice and helpful.Hardest part of the job is having to place new product out when customers are trying out shoes in the same place.
good,"Working at Nordstrom was in fact, a challenged although it was not a terrible place to work. The coworkers were really upbeat and they continue to be at all times. I believe it was more so the hours of working that didn't meet the quilfications."
good,"Comfortable Nordstrom retail enviroment. Friendly people, friendly management. Very safe place to work and clean. Room for growth within the company, depending on your work ethics."
good,"Not many hours. Working environment is good. I was a part time employee, so not many benefits were given. Couldn't work around my school schedule."
good,"On a typical work day you are balancing running go backs, keeping your area clean, and ringing up a customer on the spot. There are a good hand few of coworkers that you'll actually like and then there are the ones you really just don't care for. There is no hard part just manage your time. Most enjoyable for me was opening new accounts."
good,"It's probably the best retail job you will ever land. The services are great and you have a lot of flexibility to say YES to your customer. Your environment is very elegant and it is in the heart of downtown Vancouver. "
good,"The people I worked with were nice. However, the company would cut hours and eventually move me out of position without a moments notice. Even after I exhibited amazing flexibility and serviced them any time of day and worked any position I could to help them. Just to be thrown to the wind... I feel used."
good,"coworkers in my department were really helpful and engaging with one another. I learned that no matter how hard of a worker you are, if someone higher than you doesn't appreciate it then you just have to continue to work and continue doing the best you can."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job for me was crisis management with the customers needs and my ability to show my level of experienced professionalism and customer service skills.
good,"you learn alot of sales and customer service which helps you gain more experience in the long run. "
good,"I learned great deal about coaching and leading a team, driving a successful business and product development. I was promoted into several different positions and learned from all areas of the business. A lot of great tools to help you develop and teach your team."
good,"I worked in the customer service department, we assisted sales employees, helped with returns, opened reward accounts, did credit card lookups and sometimes worked in the operators booth. Nordstrom employees and management can change a lot so I've experience some good times and not so good times there, but all in all Nordstrom is a high quality retail job if you work at the retail store and not the rack location. Retail just wasn't for me because I wasn't a fan of the ever-changing schedule but a lot of people enjoyed the unpredictability of the scheduling."
good,"At Nordstrom, as an employee, we are required to clean and maintain the appearance of the sales floor. "
good,"It's a great company to work for and the benefits were really good. The frustrating part was working on commission  - if it was slow it was hard to make money. Also, the customer returns affecting your paychecks was ultimately why I could no longer stay there."
good,"very nice place to work, awesome people, wonderful atmosphere. Would highly recommend a friend to work there.  I have made a lot of great connections and lifelong friends."
good,"Building meaningful relationships with customers. Providing"
good,"Working at KFC was good, it was my first job and I had the opportunity to work with some nice people. Management was good and the were very understanding when it came to my school schedule."
good,I enjoyed working here and gained good experience in sales and customer service.  There is great opportunity for growth here as well.
good,Fun place to work.  great customers to shop with.  could have a better discount.  good team moral. beautiful store. good location.
good,"not a bad place to work improved sales by maintaining customer relationships, provided excellent customer service. ensure that merchandising meets brand's image standards educated team on brand history and managed brand promotions and events."
good,"Management at this company prides themselves on how we as a company should work as a team. however, we have no team building exercises. On the selling floor it can be very hostile and a very uncomfortable environment. The one thing that they do pay attention to is that we are making our selling goals. We do not get compensated well if business is slow. The company is also unorganized and says they promote from within, but management makes it really hard to grow in the company."
good,Good opportunity to start your career and learn hands on skills. I would recommend this company to new graduates. Great management.
good,Fun fashionable people b.ut sales has been very hard in the small dept I work in. I like to feel more challenged and acclomplished in my job
good,"Good company but very clicky.  It is defiantly a ""drink the cool-aid"" structure.  If they like you they will move you up quick but if you question anything or have ideas that aren't the norm,  you will be demoted just as fast.  I was lucky and had a great team and our department was actually used as an example to others on how to work as a team."
good,"Nordstrom was a great place to work for the first 3 years, after that the company started making too many changes. I felt the changes drove many employees away from the company. The only way you will get promoted or even considered for a promotion is if you had a relationship with your manager and store manager, your productivity did not matter. It was very political."
good,"I was moving from NY to SD first JOB"
good,"great company to work for but lack in training employees, and use discrimination I feel against certain minorites especially with customers"
good,"What I liked about NORDSTOM was its inverted pyramid which suggested that customers came first and then employees followed by management. They like to cater to their own, hiring from within and going above and beyond for their customers."
good,"Pay is great, but there's no engagement or cooperation between employees. The hardest part is doing everything without proper training. The most enjoyable part is you're not constantly pressured by your manager."
good,"Promote from within and everything is based on your sales. So if you want to move up with the company, which is quite possible and even encouraged, any other attributes will be over looked if you're not meeting sales goals."
good,its a nice retail job to work I recommend it to someone who likes to work for retail its a friendly company everybody works hard and is friends
good,If you have your own clientele and live doing hair then this is the place for you. Its pretty cool and the manager was pretty awesome and understanding.
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom is greeting and working with customers. preparing boxes for gift wrap, calling customers for upcoming events, sales and unused fashion rewards. Also maintaining the the department making sure it's presentation is attractive to customers. A plus to working at Nordstrom is you get an hour lunch during 8 hour shifts. Also you have a 20% discount. A con to working at Nordstrom is making sure you reach your sales per hour which can be difficult when working part-time or during slower seasons. Returns are cons as well for the same reasons. Nordstrom is a great overall company. The environment is very diverse. Given the proper guidance and support Nordstrom provides opportunities to advance."
good,Is a great company to work for if you enjoy fashion. Base pay + commission is good and all but it is hard to always meet targets. Especially working in a city like Ottawa that is new to Nordstrom. Im sure you would make a killing working and the future locations in Toronto.
good,"It was a good place to work for me to build experience in the kitchen. The shifts were short and easy. They have great management and a colorful staff i never had a doll day at work. The hardest part of the day is just only the cleanig, preping, and stoking before the place opens and also work at a busy hour in a tight place. I enjoyed learnig how to make a number of dishes from scatch,"
good,Nordstrom is great as a starter job. It teaches you how to adapt to the world of commision and how to expad your customer service skills but it is hard to find a work/life balance in ANY type of retail - and that is true for Nordstrom as well. Plus your pay check is constantly changing. If you want stability in your hours or pay check... this is the WRONG place for you.
good,"Great company in relation to their philanthropic nature and their genuine care to provide the very best customer service to their customers."
good,Enjoyed working with the public as well as in different departments. Loved team building and being a team player. Meeting customers needs and being able to give them the top quality customer service.
good,"Routine work of staying at the cash registers, returning merchandise, transferring phone calls to departments, opening credit accounts, and managers always expecting credit accounts."
good,"Great Company"
good,"If you're going to make a career in retail, do it at Nordstrom.  They have a sales-is-king culture and reward those who sell a lot.  As a makeup artist working for them and not a sales-minded individual, it was not a perfect fit for me.  I enjoyed my days and my coworkers, but the pressure of sales goals is not something that has ever appealed to me, nevermind the ""shark""-like attributes of some of the other employees, seeking to do no more than make their commission and go home.  That being said, I gave it a lot of my life and I've learned a lot from them and made a lot of great memories."
good,Great place to advance in if you love fashion. Co-workers are great people. Young people looking to work great place for them to start.
good,the most enjoying time i have at Macy's is working with my co working being able to do stuff that i love which is customer service. I've learned so much at this job being a cashier. just being able to enjoy with you love to do is great.
good,A very organized work place logistically. Overall the environment of a retail store. Email and Account opening percentage expectations for all departments. Staff does not truly reflect customer traffic.
good,"There is not enough time to complete the work, and no matter how many hours you put in you are not doing enough.  Leaving the company with almost a month of Vacation pay, could not get time off to use it."
good,good for the person who is looking to gain sales experience. Great for youth and those trying to establish a career and those who are looking for fast advancement.
good,"Hired as a full-time employee with a base rate of $9.00 an hour.  Pros:"
good,Nordstrom has good benifits for their employees but there are some manegers that dont care about the production and performance that their employees do for them and to be honest alot of them only care for them selfs and most of the time they always turndown the employee that deos the best and the most for them.
good,"Typical day included sales of clothing and merchandise, greeting customers, handling transactions/returns, promotional events"
good,"A typical day at work starts off with warm greeting from peers and employees, which creates a comfortable setting as you enter into the processing and high paced work of shipping product out to the stores. This facility has helped me hone skills communicating and treating people as they would want to treated. And has taught me how take ownership, providing a service approach in assisting other departments be successful. The hardest part of my job is having to call it quits for the day. But the most enjoyable is looking forward to what projects I can create to better the building."
good,"Provided seasonal support during Thanksgiving and Christmas Holidays to head chef.  Prepared customer café orders, ensured food items and spices were properly stocked and cleaned the kitchen."
good,"Cashier, Merchandise, customer service, in charge of stocking all supplies and gift wrapping.  Really enjoyed the job!"
good,"Nordstrom, overall is a good company to work for. The only drawback is sometimes the employees are about themselves instead of the overall development of the team. Also, some managers are egotistic and forget about the employees being human and people."
good,"setting up appointments for clients "
good,"selling and coaching was a big focus. i learned how to build a productive team and train them to embrace the nordstrom sales strategy. although Nordstrom has streamlined their management system, they are still a pillar of smart business decisions. My co-workers are great. the hardest part of the job was the adapting and accepting the changes Nordstrom continues to go through. my most enjoyable part of the job was learning from predecessors and mentors of the business."
good,"The management here, sucked! Well in my department. It is a good place overall to work at, the money is good. You will experience a dead season, but it does pick back up by summer. HR, does not support you like you think. You receive hour lunches. It is majority commission based, so not fit for shy, timid people."
good,"Work is fun, if there's customers around. Location of this store was bad and no customers were around. People had money, but none were willing to spend it on such expensive fashion items."
good,"I personally enjoyed my days working a Nordstrom I enjoyed the amazing people and management I worked with. we had a strong staff that was very committed and motivated to sell on the other hand it was a little difficult to balance work and life. they do require you to work all holidays and events therefore if you have a family you wish to be with every holiday and weekends this wouldn't be the job for you although Nordstrom did have a lot of benefits for example, they paid very well, they pay for over time also pay you double during holidays witch is a plus and better yet you even get commission so if you enjoy sales and are good at it this is the place for you.  you also get to work with so many different types of people with so many amazing personalities."
good,"Typical day on the job consisted of cleaning, hourly reads, clientele calls and meeting customers needs. I learned how to communicate with customers on a more experienced level. Did not find anything hard about the job, most enjoyable was the genuine smiles I received after helping customers."
good,I had so much fun working with this company. Learn to do fast pace in the department.  Gives recognitions on employees hard work.
good,Great place to express the fashion trends of the season. Employees are overall willing to work as a team. This job requires patient and a bubbly personality.
good,"This place wants you to work very hard. Breaks are short. I learned how to strip, zip tie, and sensor shoes. You are not allowed to talk to co workers while working"
good,"Nordstrom has many avenues an employee can choose to take if they wish to further their career with the company. Everything is performance based, and most jobs are commission pay. Management could use some work, depending on the store and department, to continue to train employees so that the entire team is well informed. This is especially important considering most employees/associates are full time, so there should be no reason that the team is not very strong and aware of the company standards."
good,"It was great working at Nordstrom. I just didn't  like that it was commission. The Co-Workers were Great, Friendly and Helpful. The Manager was very great."
good,"staff was good to work with, not the most personal people to work around but had really good trainers.alot of temp to hire employees that hurt our over all routine to stay above quota."
good,you can make as much as you want depending on how hard you work
good,Greet customers and assist them with finding items. Make sure that all items are on the floor and make sure that the sales floors in constantly clean. All employees must learn to work the cash registers and open rewards cards form customers. Employees also assist with inventory and rearranging sales floor.
good,"I liked working at Nordstrom, the company treats their employees very well and the work environment is relaxing and enjoyable."
good,its a very good retail company with plenty of growth .......
good,"I loved being able to work and get to know designer products "
good,Like working here besides coworkers of mine bringing outside drama. Some of management is good most are not. I just love to be involve with people
good,"Fun Fast paced job, worked on the shoes floor, a lot of competition. I enjoyed working here for the time that i did. Hardest part of the job was putting up with 6 different managers."
good,There is no work/life balance. High demands of constant events with unrealistic goals. Management inconsistent  and unprofessional.
good,just have to sell and gain clientele. NO limit to how much you can sell.
good,"Working at Nordstrom is great in that they provide excellent training.  However, depending upon your department, you will be faced with times where generating income is hard to come by as you are getting paid solely from commissioned sales."
good,this location has the best SUPERVISORS ever.... and my co-workers are the best
good,customer service is the key in retail industry. meeting new people daily and cared for each ones needs in the work place.
good,"A typical day at work includes greeting customers at a timely manner and providing the best customer service possible.  Merchandising your floor according to what is new, and what sells the best at your location.  "
good,Nordstrom return policy is bad for employee and too many sales personal is changing so often.
good,"There is no typical day for a selling manager at Nordstrom, but most days include: merchandising within your department, scheduling, teaching selling, selling yourself and business planning/ event execution. The learnings have been invaluable. Although the company is consistently adapting the training model to best equip their employees to serve their customers, most teaching happens organically and is fostered by the store leadership teams. The environment is pleasant most days, but working in a competitive sales environment does open the door to some minor disagreements between co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the emotional investments, i.e. working so hard to earn a pat on the back rather than the appropriate monetary compensation. The most enjoyable part of the job is teaching people to be great service providers and seeing their customers leave happy."
good,"great first job"
good,"Your base salary is more than any restaurants I've heard of. The clientele tip pretty well on top of that. If you like bistro-style food with a slightly elegant edge, this is the company for you. The hardest part of the job is the ""mall rush"" and holiday times. The most enjoyable part of the job is the food."
good,"Began as a Retail Management Intern where we began in different departments which was not enjoyable for those who felt they would work better in a different stylized department."
good,As a salesperson come ready to compete with your colleagues.
good,loved making your own paychecks. the more sales you made the better your check. Hated the catty-ness with other co workers and fighting for sales. management was a bit overbearing pushing you to reach sales goals that sometimes weren't even realistic.
good,"In the Cafe department of Nordstrom, at Somerset Mall, I worked as cashier, waitressed, bused tables, worked in the back/ kitchen area (to ensure the flow of service via the waiters/waitresses), and also dressed the plates (making sure the meals were presentable for service)"
good,A typical day is one involving a lot of hard work and patience
good,Overall great company if fashion is your path. Competitive environment in sales. Ability to build a flexible schedule.
good,"Assess tasks as needed, execute objectives in a timely manner and be as efficient as possible."
good,Good place to start and grow within the company for a retail career.
good,I learned a lot working at Nordstrom.  I spent my entire management career there.  Great people!
good,Worked with Children shoes and Women's shoes as a manager- developed and coached to selling behaviors
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom would consist of opening/closing of the registers at the beginning of the day and throughout the day I would assist clients or potential clients that require service. During my two years of commitment at Nordstrom I learned how to juggle multiple clients at once, be a customer service representative, meet and exceed goals that were expected of me by management, as well learning how to be a team leader or product specialist.The hardest and the most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with the clients."
good,With Nordstrom return policy being commission based hurts your sales per hour.
good,"The people I worked with seemed nice and caring"
good,My time overall here was beneficial for the fact that I learned a lot about sales and how to talk to customers and keep them coming back to us. I also gained product knowledge from numerous high end cosmetic brands. A typical day if I had to open it would be going to customer service and checkout the money bags and then opening the registers in the bay I was assigned to that day. Next putting the cash in the cash only registers. Then we brief for the day with the store and department managers. Then we open for business and I would sell people the products that were new and the events or deals we had going on that week/month. I would checkout people and handle cash and credit cards. I had to also mention during the checkout process that we have a rewards program and store credit cards if they wanted to apply.
good,"I love the professionalism and how fashion forward this company is. I also found joy in wardrobing people that don't have an idea what real fashion is. I gained a lot of friends from co-workers and customers combined. You need a lot of patience when it comes to rude customers which you will experience once in a while. Try giving enough time to train newly hired co-workers to learn the industry to keep the harmony of your team. I learned that each individual (customers/ co-workers) is unique and are entitled for their right to be respected and that through open communication, everything will be in placed."
good,Highly recommend to work for. Treat their employees great.
good,everyday at Nordstrom was very typical of any other retail stores. Customer service and fast sales are the usual day in and outs
good,Very interactive job where you get to help customers and go above and beyond.
good,Its is a very fast pace work environment with room for growth and options to move to different departments.
good,Fun I could work and shop at the store when I am done working.And takes breaks when I got ready as long as my work was done on time.
good,"Great Customer Service, Company Goal is to please every customer."
good,"I didn't really enjoy working at the Rack, a typical work day always consisted of being in the fitting room or putting away the stuff in the fitting room."
good,Fabulous place to work with great benefits and compensation. Promote from within and can be easy to advance if you work hard.
good,"Interesting work environment, challenging, but rewarding"
good,its easy and simple. don't stress over the little things.keep going
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for, the benefits are great and the people are nice, but it is definitely hard to advance and this is not the most innovative workplace. Pay is not comparable to market rate, but the perks make up for it. The passive leadership can be hard to work with if you're a direct individual. In entry-mid level positions it is hard to continue to be challenged and there is much busy work due to the terrible technology at the company."
good,Customers take advantage of hard working sales associates.
good,This is a great place to work for someone looking to get their feet wet in Loss Prevention. they provide an experience that encompasses all aspects of loss prevention
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working with customers to pick out outfits, changing mannequins, order merchandise, and display merchandise. I learned a lot about the fashion world which is what I love more than anything. I worked closely with my manager and enjoyed having the ability to switch my schedule around for school purposes."
good,Great Benefits and management. Skills that you acquire can be applied at future jobs.
good,Working for Nordstrom is very fun. There's always new people you meet and get to interact with on a day to day bases.  There's music and a great work vibe which makes the work day go by fast.  I love having the rally's that we have in the morning because it pumps you up for the day.
good,At Nordstrom Rack I'm a Rover. A Rover basically covers the shifts of their co-workers. Everyone for the most part does their job effectively. Management has been friendly and so has co workers. A typical day is fast paced. One day you may work in the shoe department and the next day you might work stock. You have to be a quick study and learn to adapt.
good,"Stressful shark tank style sales that doesn't reward you for your good customer service, only rewards go to high sales numbers."
good,Nordstrom is a good company to work for.  I needed to advance my career.
good,very good people and benefits. logistics department is the hardest part of the job
good,"Great People, High end fashion, great co-workers, commission base , able to move up in the company"
good,"I take a lot of pride in my job and strive to be the best I can be everyday in every way. I have built almost a whole new team, and they have been very successful. Everyday I get to go into work and work with an amazing group of women who love their job. I get to help women feel beautiful and confident with themselves. I have to balance my time with helping customers/selling, coaching my team, doing paperwork and reports, merchandising my department, and doing other managerial duties. I feel good communication with my team, my store manager, buyers, vendor representatives, and regional merchandisers is very important to being successful. Retail doesn't have the best hours and schedule, but everyday is different, and to work in my department, you really have to love and be passionate about what you do."
good,"This is a great place to work as a side job, but it is a little harder to growth within this company since they are based in Canada."
good,"I enjoyed working with customers and dressing them head to toe. I learned how to listen to the customer and cater to their individual needs. Putting together entire outfits was always fun and kept me busy. Creating unique relationships with customers and building my clientele, so they would want to shop with me on a regular basis, was a big part of the job. I would recommend working for Nordstrom, if you have flexible hours"
good,"worked in the bp dept with 14 other girls. nordstrom is a a great company, bp on the other hand is a horrible dept. a lot of catty girls, money hungry. teaches you to be a go getter."
good,"Fun atmosphere "
good,"Worked primarily in picking department, though I was cross trained across multiple departments, including packing, receiving, and returns inspection."
good,"It is a good company if you want to advance to management, buyers, etc. The turnover rate is extremely high, the management is poor. It is a fun work environment and I learned a lot about the fashion industry."
good,"Great co-workers, fun environment, can be dangerous because your whole paycheck can go right back to the company."
good,Awesome company to work for. Customers are the best part. I learned a ton about working in retail and handling customers.
good,I loved working for Nordstrom. Good hours but a lot of the times there was slow traffic.
good,Very good company to work for. Lots of opportunity. Management can be good.  Hardest part of the job is the hours.  It can be stressful at times and they expect a lot out of their employees.
good,I've wanted to work for them for 2 years and it a great COMPANY TO GROW WITH
good,"My day is filled with one on one interaction with customers and coworkers from all walks of life, ethnicities, education, work experience, life experience, socio economic status and age. "
good,"Working for Nordstrom is an amazing experience, the company itself allows you to grow with them, so you may start off as a sales associate but end up a manager or a regional."
good,It was a very customer service driven role with a lot of hands or experience working with people and deciphering what people might want or what they need. It was also a lot of memorization of different formulas for different coffee drinks. The hardest part was keep under pressure despite people giving you a hard time about a drink. The most enjoyable part was the customer service.
good,"nordstrom is great because you can make a lot of money working in retail, BUT because it is commission based, when it is slow your paycheck suffers dramatically."
good,The company culture has changed for the worse in recent years.  Lack of focus and that changes frequently.
good,"I  worked for Mac cosmetics which was my dream job, a typical day, was giving customers the ""makeup expeirence"" showing customers new products, nordstrom rewards, show and teach demonstrations, all to ensure a positive customer experience and to gain customer trust. Unfortunantly, I was put on call, which meant any time avaiilable, I may come to work,  or have limited set hours, which ran about 17-20 hours a month. With that being said, with no hours available i was forced to resign from the position."
good,"At Nordstrom you truly become a sales expert throughout all departments in the store to better serve your customers.  We take care of the customer in any situation.  Customer connections, building relationships, and reconnect is essential to maintain repeat customers and gain personal business.  The most enjoyable part of the job was giving customer satisfaction everyday and taking on new challenges daily; including sales goals, department goals, etc. If you are eager to get promoted, the company promtes within.  The company also has great benefits includign 401K, PTO, Health, Dental.  The hardest part about the job was long hours, holidays worked, straight commission (uncosistent pay), quick turn around with employees and managers."
good,"A typical day at work: "
good,"I learned to work qucickly without sacrificing quality to much."
good,"Intense High energy, high volume work environment.  I love the people I work with, however I would like a more rewarding and productive career for my life.  My favorite part of this job is getting to do full makeovers!  The most difficult part is being encouraged to sell at any cost and consistently meeting the expectations as a business manager."
good,Employees at Nordstrom Rack are all unique. Everyone has their own sense of style.
good,Customer service ranks #1 and is your priority. The most difficult part of the job is taking in all the returns that people bring back after they have used the items.
good,It was a very fast quick busy work place. Learn lots of tips for labor ( warehouse) jobs.
good,It is a great job to have right out of college. Can be a great place to have a career if you are pursuing a career in management.
good,"Each day is started by following up with my most recent customers to guarantee that they are satisfied with their product.  From there I reach out to customers that I have not heard from recently in order to maintain the customer relationship."
good,This company is great and creates a trusting and friendly to enviroment to work. It can be extrememly competitive and the hours and the bormal retail hours which aren't desireable. Not a lot of room for movement.
good,A typical day at work would be providing excellent customer service. I've learned to excel in familiarizing with products and the application applied to get the job done. My coworkers were fairly helpful with any questions that I had. The hardest part of the job was not satisfying the customer's needs because of the availability of the products. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction the customers receive when they are provided with great service.
good,Great retailer to work for. High profile and great return policy.
good,"Fast paced environment with plenty of money to be made. Well known for leaving an empression on customers, and that is why they always return."
good,What I love about working in Nordstrom are the customer service and the clothes. It made me interested in fashion.
good,great at providing learning tools and encouraging product knowledge.
good,"Provide a quick, friendly and efficient register checkout, including purchase, returns and exchanges.Communicate with customers regarding upcoming events, and Invite each customer to open a Nordstrom credit/debit account .Maintain register desk area in a clean and organized manner. Answer telephones and direct calls as needed and assist in inventory control efforts."
good,"I am new to the company so it is not much I can say, other than I am aquiring some good skills that will ready me for the next stages in my career."
good,"A typical day at work can be anywhere from non-stop busy work to very slow day. All depending on location, time of day, and season. I've learned how much customer service truly matters. I had great management in my first location and my second location I felt a little more improvement on leadership would not have hurt. I don't really feel like there is anything to hard. The most enjoyable part at work is when everyone is working as a team."
good,"Loved the job, but my co-workers were very lazy and very unprofessional."
good,Although management in Cosmetics was immature at the time of my employment. I really enjoyed working at Nordstrom. The majority of my co-workers were awesome!
good,"Working at Nordstrom had its pros and cons. The fact is that it is still a family based company that has been on ""Fortune Magazine's top 100 Companies to Work For"" for a while now. Keeping sales up is very crucial, you are observed at a local, regional, and corporate level. Full time employees have great benefits but according to the season, many hours. A little difficult to balance your life with only one or two days off a week but you are trained to manage and service customers at a higher level than any other retail company because at Nordstrom they are all about the customer service, (so being a people person is a must!) Commission based environment is an incentive to sell more, (but may be difficult due to low foot traffic in store) Reguardless, high sales=high pay. Higher chance of getting promoted because they only promote from within after going through the FNL (future nordstrom leaders) management program."
good,I learned the importance of being a team player and knowledge of Nordstrom's target consumers
good,"Nordstrom is a great company, but you have to have a great work ethic and tough skin."
good,"always busy no matter what time of day it is . trust each other’s integrity and ability. Our only rule: Use good judgment in all situations. we are always family We trust each other’s integrity and ability. Our only rule: Use good judgment in all situations. And we set ours high. At Nordstrom, you can determine your own success and make a real difference by accomplishing the goals you set."
good,"Nordstrom offers a lot of training and has high expectations for your productivity, however they do provide you with the tools to achieve those goals. There is more opportunity for advancement within the company if you are relocatable."
good,Can get really busy during winter and summer seasons. Hours can tend to get cut without any explanation. Customers can be stressful at times.
good,"Strongly encouraged to build your own business by consistently assisting customers needs and maximizing sales. Building strong relationships by following up on all aspects of the sale (i.e thank you notes, making sure alterations were completed, and orders were fulfilled)"
good,"I started at Nordstrom after college as a sales associate. I was asked to attend the management program 8 months into working there. I was promoted to manage the Women's Designer Department. It was an $800,000 department and the year that I was managing, I brought it up to 1.3 million dollar department. I was number one in my region and number 4 in the company. I moved to Florida for personal reasons and took the Assistant Manager position of Men's Sportswear. We did 2.5 million last year and our goal is to be at 3 million this year. We have had an increase every month since the begininng of the year. A typical day is 8-5 or 1-cl. I hire people and train them, and let people go when necessary. I write the schedule of a staff of up to 10 sales associates. I merchandise the floor weekly, pull and read reports and have a sales expecation so I sell every day. I enjoy working with customers and helping them build their wardrobe and feel good about what they are buying. I have learned so much over the last 3 years. Working with different kinds of people and adjusting to different personalities. Being a good manager is leading by example, but respecting the people that work for you. You cannot ask your people to do things that you yourself would not do."
good,"Nordstrom is a good place for someone in school, or someone who wants to make a career out of retail."
good,It's mediocre...not bad...not good...just mediocre. The discount is a good perk though.
good,"I received commissions on everything I sold. It was a very competitive job. I worked long hours, but the rewards were worth the struggle and the competition amongst the crew members."
good,"sale, sale, sale, competition is big among the sales represetative. learned how to put customer service and satisfaction first. management"
good,Prescriptives product line: cosmetics is always a fun like to work with.
good,"working hard and making customers happy, ive learned the customers is always right."
good,I enjoy working here and the benefits are great. The only problem is that unless you are mobile the opportunities for advancement are slim.
good,"enjoyed this professional atmopshere, its a place that also educated you on selling and merchandising .able to present mdse to customers and explain proper care and treatment of article"
good,"Learned time management, the importance of follow-up and putting the customer first, and about customer relationships. I had to learn how to coach a large team of sales associates, which was challenging but rewarding."
good,nordstroms was a nice place to work with respect and good treatment.
good,Company believes in making goals and client associate relations. A lot of pressure surrounds delivering sales goals and statistics.
good,Great Store Manager
good,Good place to work in sales. Great products and staff. Hard to have hours that you would want when a new employee
good,Good customer service and professional sales people. You will find a good shopping experience at Nordstrom.
good,Advancement based on sales  the culture of the company is decent. Expectations were reasonable. Overall in-store sales goals still set the same regardless of the downward spiral of sales oompany-wifde. If you are sales driven and self motivated you will succeed here.
good,Good place to develop skills and with advancement opportunities. If interested you are able to relocate to any of there facilities in the U.S. They have some decent benefits as well.
good,"It is a good company to grow your career. Its a great opportunity"
good,I  liked my time working at nordstrom but management lacks of support. The benefits are not the best. The work schedule doesn't balance work with personal life
good,"Everyone there was nice. The managers were very understanding and gave everyone attention. Did not interact much with people from other departments, therefore everyone is pretty segregated. General good experience."
good,I  liked my time working at nordstrom but management lacks of support. The benefits are not the best. The work schedule doesn't balance work with personal life
good,"Everyone there was nice. The managers were very understanding and gave everyone attention. Did not interact much with people from other departments, therefore everyone is pretty segregated. General good experience."
good,The good thing about Nordstrom is the benefits and the department I worked in. The bad part was the unfair scheduling especially if you were a college student.
good,"Very competitive environment- if you want to work here YOU MUST have thick skin and be ready for a cliquey, hostile environment. Do not let the employees get to you- and you’ll enjoy your time here. Clientele is great!"
good,"The location I worked at wasn't built off of a positive team environment. It was a dog eat dog mentality and it seemed as though most people didn't even want to be there. I like retail, however the culture needs work!"
good,I worked in lingerie/leg wear for around 9 months and I enjoyed it. Very positive female empowering environment with great coworkers. Only downside is that I had NO time to see my family/friends and barely any time off. Very stressful and the customers were very demanding. Nordstrom treats their employees well and there’s room for advancement.
good,"Downtown Nordstrom is a company with many ways to move up in the company as long as you are a salesperson or the management takes a liking to you. They constantly seek to change their approach to meet the changing selling environment which can be a bit chaotic. Problems can arise though if you are in a position where management rarely sees you. They change the criteria of the job with little notification and any criticism is treated as 'you don't like it then quit'. Initially, the expectations of the job had some leeway as they understood that they couldn't be met always like the situation might not accommodate for them to be met but recently they have got really strict and started terminating people after they couldn't meet the new higher expectations even when the people asked for help and explained their situation."
good,"The hardest part about this job is that there is absolutely no flexibility. It is difficult to get reasonable time off and to change availability. Other than that, it is compensated fairly, regular customers are a delight, and it's barely a commute to get there."
good,"Most importantly, I learned to deal with a wide variety of people.  That was probably the hardest part because of the location in West Oakland; however, that experience was invaluable.  Everyone deserves the highest caliber of respect.  "
good,"Depending on the department, not many promises are given if you want to move up the chain. Good teaching structure but income-wise, varies and is not steady."
good,"its fun and exciting in the beginning but then it really sucks. the customers are the worst and will return everything even if its worn or altered and the company lets them, which goes against your sales. Yet management still expects you to make your sales. the worst."
good,"Nordstrom has a great setup, pay is Commission vs Draw, so if you're good at selling you make your paycheck. They are very lenient with returns which can hurt but have a great system to even remotely sell to clients. Managers are almost always available. It's a very independent and competitive environment, a race to pull customers to the fitting room. How much you can make also depends on where they place you - juniors, for instance, is terrible as most customers only need a shirt or two and are not the type to be upsold. Some days to help your sales/hr they may send you home early or have you come in late, which makes the hours even more unpredictable. They also told me I was part time, then later told me I was full time, which is why I left."
good,"It is a very competitive work environment. It is great for people who enjoy fast paced days and are driven by commission sales. If you are on a good team, then the work days are much more enjoyable."
good,A very easy job that challenges you to deal with customers. I learned how to have excellent customer service and learn to have product knowledge. the hardest part was dealing with difficult customers.
good,"In my earlier experiences at Nordstrom, I have found it quite rewarding to build strong client-based relationships. However, changes in the company has made me want to pursue a different path."
good,I would start my day at 7am every morning get the sales working for put together assemble any new stand or Manikin that need to be dressed for the season one that was together then it was time to great customer and make sales and answering questions that they had.
good,The job itself was alright it could be at times boring for what i was doing i was a processor in receiving so at times the job would fly by other it was boring and dragged out. You just stand there and verify product to make sure you have to correct thing if not you check your paper you print and print out the correct SKU. Slap it on and scan the product. or sometimes you would have to fold cloths which was the most boring part of the job. but all in all it was not to bad breaks were odd no lunch break two 10 min breaks and thats it.
good,I tried growing with the company but they really don’t give you much opportunity unless you’re a favorite. It was very disillusioning and led me to leave the company.
good,"This has been a great job to have over breaks during college. It pays great for a pretty simple job. A typical day at work involved walking around the store searching for a customer's online order, as well as fulfilling buy online pickup in store orders. I learned a lot about working in retail and many different brands that are available in the store. It is a very clean work environment with a lot of friendly employees. The hardest part of the job is definitely the hours, especially during peak times of the year. These include the holiday months of November to December, and then the month of July for their annual Anniversary Sale. You could be working as early as 5 AM and as late as 12 AM during these times, so it is a big commitment."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company that gives you the tools to be as successful as you want to be. However, the store i worked with was still new and management was lacking. Constant scheduling issues and no leadership."
good,"very understanding, great work environment, great discounts, great co workers some at least, great break times, and I would love the new styles coming in all the time."
good,"If you love being ""in the know"" about all of the latest brands, trends, and designers this is the perfect place to work. It is an even balance between challenging and fun."
good,"no comment but friendly workers in the store. I did have some fun in that. the management could be a bit better but not all managers were the same , friendly work environment"
good,This year we have less coverage of the floors and corporate ask why we are dropping sales. Sales people should focus more on sales and less on merchandising and operational stuff. Managers should be there to help fix problems and less of them selling. Sales floors are more messy 1 employee on a 3 million dollar Department alone for hours. Less attention for the customers in the store. More focus on online sales. Stores are now becoming warehouses for online buying.
good,Great place to work on if you want to start in high-end retail but just needs help with helping employees become better and giving them actual hours and medical benefits. There are hidden agendas for sure but rise above it and you will be good.
good,"This is a good company to work for if you are willing to invest your time to make it work for you or if you are career driven. This is also a good place to work if you are a student and/or need a flexible schedule."
good,It’s like being told repeatedly how to do a job that’s so simple. They put coworkers against each other by playin favoritism. The same people get awarded employee of the month. They do have good benefits though. They have better pay than most retail stores as well.
good,"I worked in the kid's department in the Nashville location, and while the pay can be very good for a retail job, it is unpredictable and quite a lot of work. "
good,"Hired for a seasonal job, would liked to of stayed on permanently but very little openings for that vs # of employees hired.  All based on your Stats and even within the desired margins."
good,the environment wasn't bad at all. most of everyone was friendly especially the customers so I had fun times. Only part I don't like is when the management not cooperating.
good,They are really strict about production numbers. Pretty strict on talking while you're working. I liked Management for the most part but sometimes they treat you like children
good,they focus too much on their customers and not enough on their employees. Employees matter too and the returns are insane be aware of you don’t have a good manger you will hate going to work
good,"I like the people I work with. Some of the hardest working people I know. Speaking for myself, I am doing things I did not know was part of logistics. In my interview, I told the manager exactly why I wanted to try logistics. If she mentioned the physical demands of the job I wouldn't have taken it. The job description was not fully explained to me."
good,"I worked overnight unloading trucks and processing clothes and returns. The job itself was great. "
good,"Nordstrom has helped me excel my customer service. Becomes really busy during the warm weather and will not slow down until after the winter holidays, this is great to maximize your sales and make money!"
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for but I no longer have the sense of job security I once did 3-4 years ago. The one trait I admired most was the philosophy of promoting within their farm system rather than hiring someone from outside the company. Many things have changed as e-commerce continues to dominate and I completely understand that change must happen in order to survive but the way the company goes about change isn't fair to their folks. Many jobs have been eliminated over the course of... 5 years now, give or take. The folks affected by these company decisions aren't given enough notice so that they can prepare and plan for their next move. The most notice I've seen given to folks losing their job was a month and other times up to 2 weeks. Employees have expressed this in the company's annual surveys year in and year our and nothing has changed. Realistically, 3-6 months is enough time to prepare and that is what we're asking but folks continue to be blindsided with the 1 week to 1 month notice and that isn't fair. Some employees have worked for the company for over 10 years and I've seen them separated without even a severance package after being given a 2 week notice. Aside that, you'll learn a lot, meet great people and you'll also meet bad people but this isn't a company to decide you want a career with."
good,"a typical day at work focused on making sure the store looked clean and most importantly, servicing customers with respect. the culture of Nordstrom was customer service. the ability to make sure any customer was satisfied whenever they left the store."
good,"Nice working atmosphere, give you the chance to move up in the company, flexible work hours, have great work benefits for employees. Management could be a little better be overall great place to work"
good,"When I first began my employment at Nordstroms I was placed in a womens department. Unfortunately, to improve sales and ensure that I would advance in that department I had to have a presence in the fitting room. Now I clearly found myself at a disadvantage when compared to the women in that department because female clientele weren't as open to have a male in the fitting room when undressing and awaiting a new size they had wanted from the sales floor. So clearly I was at a disadvantage from day one and soon realized I would not be able to increase my sales in that position."
good,It was fine. The people were nice and the managers didn’t all act terribly just a few and a lot of people picked sides it was weird at first but it turned out fine.
good,"It started out great and then went downhill. I was moved from one area of the company to another and struggled. I was set up for failure and then blamed by management. I was overwhelmed with the amount of work I had on my plate. I reported into 2 different managers, both who were extreme opposites. Once I left the role, they hired 2 people to do my job."
good,"This was a great job for me to have that i have no regrets about working here.  They have decided to outsource this job to a 3rd party vendor to save money inside the company.  This job had a wide variety of equipment and tasks that we had to support.  there was a lot asked of us, which gave me a great opportunity to learn many different things from an IT standpoint.  My direct Manager was great, even my assistant manager and mentor were also great.  Had no problems working here other than the long commute, and now the fact that this job will no longer exist in a few months."
good,"Nordstrom is one of the most, highly competitive work places. Be prepared to hit demanding sales goals, event pre-sale objectives, and work against steady returns which hit your #s on a daily basis. Customer service is one of the most important company policies, and the liberal return policy allow for commission losses. It is a great learning lesson in sales, clienteling, and working amongst competitive co-workers."
good,"Many of the managers were temporary as they were frequently sent to the major store located downtown. This was in line with their promotion process. The team environment was positive as no one department felt isolated from the others. There was frequent collaboration between departments throughout the workday. Breaks were short, workplace culture felt unrealistically optimistic and slightly disconnected. The priorities for the employees were not focused on customer service, more so on sales, however, providing efficient service was emphasized."
good,"I always felt like I was putting in more effort than I was getting paid for, and I always had to pick up other employees slack without getting recognition."
good,"Provided excellent customer service skills to 50+ shoppers every day. Keep sales floor neat and orderly, rearrange and organize shelves and racks, lay out new products, and build merchandise displays."
good,"It was laid back, but they were really on the rate. They had cool programs like concerts and talent shows within the company. lots of benefits as well."
good,"This company is cool as an in between job or if you are a college student. It starts with $11.25 but will pay you more if you have more experience in a retail environment. It can get physically demanding and mentally exhausting so my advice would be to pace yourself and to not push yourself to the point where you are no longer enjoying what you are doing. Always put yourself first. Management tends to guilt trip their employees into staying for longer shifts, so if you aren't feeling up to it, don't let them bully you into staying because it will become a cycle. They may also switch up your schedule without your knowledge and get upset with you for not coming in for your updated shift, as communication doesn't seem to be a huge factor with them. A typical day at work is pretty steady. If you aren't assisting a customer, you will be doing projects or put-backs. The hardest part of the job would honestly be markdowns, as they typically start at 5am. The most enjoyable part of the job would honestly have to be the customers. You will have some really cool customers who you can joke around with and have conversations with while you assist them in their shopping journey (this coming from someone who really detests being around people). All in all, it's not a bad place to work, I would just say that management could be a bit more catering to their employees needs, especially when it involves their well being."
good,Culture completely changed when new management stepped in. Most counter managers unhappy and expected too much of them at event time. A lot of staff had stress leave & left when things didn't change. Unmotivating atmosphere. Hard to have a work life balance when there are so many beauty events and you cannot have leave leading up to them.
good,This review is for the Nordsron rack and not the actual full line. Poor management but potential growth was encouraged. I had managers that were very deceiving. They threw you under the bus rather quickly instead of initially taking blame. We had a store manager that completely wrecked your nerves and mood daily. I was not the only person that felt that way. I was with Nordstrom Rack Friendship heights 2011-2013
good,Working for Nordstrom was a challenge as I helped them open the restaurant.  I had 2 different bosses - and they frequently had different thoughts on the workplace culture.  The food and beverage manager spoke of the restaurant and store manager (who had never been in the restaurant business) focused on the store and would often change the thoughts of the F & B manager.  The hardest part of the job was balancing what I needed to do in the restaurant with what the store manager wanted me to do.  The most enjoyable part of the job was hiring and training a new crew and creating a positive work environment.
good,It was what you made it and your supervisor definitely played in a role in whether you excelled or not. A pro was the pay a con was if you weren't the personality they were looking for then you wouldn't be able to move up. it was almost like a popularity contest
good,"Friendly place good benefits, clean structured "
good,"The company have amazing opportunities, but in my 2 year and half with the company if the manager do not like you you will not have the opportunity to grow. you could be and outstanding  lider have all the qualities to grow. but they won't give you the opportunity to grow"
good,"I loved my coworkers, they were the best. My department manager was not the most supportive and my department it's self was the worst. Unless you can handle being around females all the time, do not apply to women's department."
good,"Fast paced, great benefits, great discount, paid overtime. Safe and comfortable environment. Peers are faur. Great management staff. Referred two people to company."
good,"I was in the production office in Culver City, it was very quiet and dark but had the same luxuries (coffee machine etc) as the nicer DTLA office. Worked a very menial job with not a lot of room for growth and observed a fairly high turnover rate. Company culture was good, lots of options for activities outside the office etc."
good,not a bad company although I think its going downhill in terms of some of the quality of the merchandise they sell. they do promote from within which is excellent.

good,not a bad company although I think its going downhill in terms of some of the quality of the merchandise they sell. they do promote from within which is excellent.
good,Working in a commission only environment at a place where they sell affordable luxury can be a benefit or could be a problem. There are great fashion benefits for working with the company. You will need another source of income working in women's shoes
good,"pro: Great benefits, Company Culture, Not as stressful as ypur normal call center con: management not very understanding or flexible when needing a temporary schedule change. leadership"
good,"Sad to say but the retail culture is coming to a halt as the online business are booming. Big department stores just aren’t making it today. Commission sounds handsome, but the reality of it all is that you will hardly make commission considering there is hardly any foot traffic in the store in the first place. Unrealistic sales goals for employees considering the small amount of foot traffic coming into the store. They expect you to just make customers appear by constant emailing and phone calls (which realistically speaking, customers hate and complain about). Working here means, if you don’t meet your sales goals, it’s entirely your fault. The store never takes any blame. They need to wake up and realize that the merchandise they carry just isn’t whay customers want anymore. They need to update their strategies, update their buyers, update their sense of fashion, update their respect for employees, and update their common sense. The 21st century is a whole new ball game and just stocking a store with clothing isn’t going to cut it. Many of their brands and styles are outdated and it’s hard to tell who exactly they are catering to and what their target market is. It’s a set up for failure to begin with in my eyes and I would’ve done differently. Great place to work for students though I’d tou have difficult scheduling and weird hours to work. I cannot see myself whisky hukding a career here as a sales associate, unless I am in HR, customer service, or an administration position."
good,"It was good for the most part. I was able to go on ""loans"" in other departments, as long as you met the expectations of the company. I would love working in the NPG, or Nordstrom Product Group; design department."
good,"In my dept., the mgmt. was a bit flustered while seeking a replacement for the dept. Manager. Very disorganized. Hours are unreasonable. Highly competitive environment."
good,"My experience with Nordstrom was fantastic.  While work expectations are high, so are the pay-offs and advancement for career.  It was awesome to be in the forefront of the industry working for a company that is still family owned."
good,"If you're eager to get into fashion retail, Nordstrom is the place to be at. Retail is a hard market to be in and Nordstrom is making the steps to be one of the few survivors of the internet commerce age."
good,"If you are looking for a future in retail it does not get much better than Nordstrom. It is a nice environment to work in. There is some favoritism though so beware of that, and it can take over your life if you let it."
good,"It was a good job, but I just wish that I could have been working full-time. I quit so I could step out of my comfort zone and find a better opportunity."
good,"Nordstrom is typically a great place to work for. There has been a restructuring that has left a lot of people and families behind, For jobs, it is typically about hwo you know rather than your actual ability. It can get very ""clique-y"" and if you do not fit within that clique, your career will not survive within the company."
good,"I work in stocking especially mailing the materials, but it can be busy so it can be hard to ask for a schedule change. At the same time, it can be tiring."
good,"Worked in beauty dept. Pros: Everyday was pretty steady, not much stress or overload. Got to pretty much have control of my own working day/lunches/planning etc.. Nice to get 2 paid 15 min. breaks on top of additional lunch period everyday. Nice incentives - get a cash payment on the spot when you open a line of credit for a customer. Overall easy going. Nice co-workers. Decent employee product discount. Pay is decent. If your good at selling the extra commission $ ON TOP of your hourly rate (cosmetics department only) can be a pretty nice check."
good,"The department I worked in was rather slow, with rushes here and there throughout the day. It was a fun department to work in. I met a lot of customers that I enjoyed my time with helping; finding the right product for them to work with. My most enjoyable part about the job was building relationships with my customers and communicating with them about their needs/wants."
good,"If you like the retail lifestyle this would be a great place to work. They offer excellent benefits, however sometimes it would be hard to live a a job work/life balance. Management is sometimes could be a little sketchy sometimes, but it's a business and they care about results not hard work and long hours. You also need to play the politics card, but that comes with any company."
good,"my department was managed by one of the worst people I have met in my life. "
good,"It was good to experience the ""behind the scenes"" operations of Nordstrom prior to merchandise deliveries to retail stores. Formerly, I worked at the Nordstrom Rack so it afforded me an advantage to understand the retail side of operations."
good,"Stressful "
good,"I did like working there but management was to concentrated on there own image and sales, forgot about their  team and what really mattered.  Team building did not start at ground level but at GM  level and tricked down which was not a good feeling."
good,"nordstrom is a great company to work for with nice benefits just hope you get a good manager. it is pretty diverse, just do not trust anyone! they are very competitive!"
good,Muy buena compañía pero no hay trabajo diario dan 2 breaks un lonche y puedes ir al baño cuando quieras no te están checando a cada rato
good,"Nordstrom does care for their employees. It depends on what team you are on however. There is a lot of difference from team to team. If you ask for extra work you will get it with no compensation, If you ask for career advancement you will not get anywhere."
good,"Help customer to make the right decision on their purchase. Learned how to  served customers 110% satisfactory. The workplace culture was pleasant and workers were very respectful to each other, the hardest part of the job is standing for a long time. It was fun working there and the paid was good."
good,Great company but compensation doesn't line up with the amount of work and dedication need for this job. very inconsistent. other  that great company.
good,it's okay job to have but your paychecks vary so much. its a commission based job so you make as much as you want but it just depends. depending what department you are in experiences are different
good,"You have to be a very active person, to keep up with the work at Nordstrom Rack since you walk and stand during the whole shift. Team work is important due to busy days. I have learned to do my job even I sew other people not doing their job. Management support was there when I requested. They are very accessible. It's a place "
good,"Working for the credit center was great, however scheduling is a bit of a disaster."
good,"Great people, a normal day can  start stressful and end up very productive if you have a positive set of mind. Nordstrom thought me to come out of my  comfort zone,the best and hardest part of the job is pleasing a customer."
good,After working here for a while I did love the environment because it was quick and fast paced. The management had an open door policy which I loved. I would work here if you want to further a career in retail sales.
good,Enjoyed working at Nordstrom's when I first started.  There have been a lot of changes in the last 6 months that have left me very unsettled.  Many managers and assistant managers have stepped down.  Employees suddenly retiring because of the changes that are happening.  These things just make me wonder what is really going on and what will be happening in the future.
good,decent place to work. You will be doing a lot of different tasks there. Good thing is that you will get a raise based on the accumulated hours you will work about every 1000 hours or so.. It can get a little hectic in there with customers and demanding managers but if you are a quality worker they appreciate it.
good,"I worked for 7 months as a Service Experience Specialist. Allot of responsibility and accountability in this position as it supported the customer and educational training of staff. Highly technical apptitued and experience required. They have great training and team support to help you along, however the hours are long and you must be entirely flexible to work evenings until 12 am or later, then back to work at 8:30 am. It can be grueling and difficult to maintain a happy life and work balance."
good,"The sales floor is a shark infested classroom, your either going to sell and succeed or watch every one else and fail. "
good,Management  is the downfall of the company.  Great place to work if you have a vision and already know a little about warehousing and its procedures.  S
good,"It's a retail job so expect all the horror that comes with that. What sets Nordstrom aside from the rest is the benifits and they invest in your 401k, profit sharing in so on. Inconsistency in hours is the downfall like any other retail job for that matter.... management could be better with making the job less stressful but all they care about is the number and making goals. Nordstrom's is still the best retail job for someone looking for benefits."
good,"It is a good place and typically things are dealt with by the book. Compensation is difficult since most of it is directly impacted by foot traffic and you are paid by commission. If you do not make quota, your job is not guaranteed."
good,"Culture is great. Employers are young and fun to work with.  However, retention is low due to low pay and compensation.  The best thing about working here would have to be the Nordstrom Discount."
good,Big box retail is ever changing and and the traffic into the store is dropping. Its a great place to make friends amongst coworkers. The management is out of touch with tenured employees and the feedback we give from our customer base and ourselves. The lack of merchandise in store to service your customer in the best way possible is the biggest obstacle.The best part is the relationships you make from amazing customers that stick with you for years.
good,"Excellent company culture with great growth opportunities, every day is a different challenge, fast paced, great co workers, learned superior management skills"
good,I really didn't like working here but that is just because I don't really like working in restaurants. My coworkers were great but management is pretty iffy. I learned a lot and I do not regret my time working there.
good,"Alot of walking and stairs, if you cant handle bending and climbing stairs, pushing carts around that can be heavy at times then I wouldnt recommend picking."
good,Wonderful job but my main issue was management. It's a great environment coworker wise. There was always room for employees to move up if their dedication was put forward.
good,great company to work for. selling can get competitive and returns hurt selling ratio as well. management varies between department. discounts could be a little better but still nice to have none the less. customer service is always expected to be 100 percent amazing. fun environment to work in!
good,"Goals and selling is a huge factor, "
good,"Work can be pretty rough some times, with some of the coworkers not doing their jobs. Its great putting a smile on the customer's faces though. Doing web orders was fun. It was like doing a hunt for what the customer is wanting to by. The hardest part of the job is when it starts getting busy and having to do five things at once."
good,"For managers you get plenty of perks and depending on which department you work for you will seem the company is amazing.  At the end of the day it is a business, they do not care about what is going on in your personal life.  Make money for them and they will forever love you and that is it."
good,"For the most part everyone loved working there except for the department I was in. I went in with a certain expectation and it was completely the opposite of what I expected. I absolutely hated the culture I was in, and everyone there was lazy and would put everything on the new hires.Also, everyone spoke bad about each other and people would gossip a lot.  Everyone in the management team had a lot of favoritism and they would make it very obvious."
good,"Overall, it is an okay company to work for. It can be challenging at times to motivate employees whose pay is strictly commission, and returns are subtracted from their paychecks. "
good,"They pay well, but the hours are never guaranteed. During the busy season, it's minimum 50 hours a week, but during down times, you may get laid off. (I did) "
good,"All my friends and coworkers who were on the stock team were nice and reasonable, but when the stock manager made you disposable to all the other store managers it was a nightmare. Some of the sales people were very friendly but all the rest looked down on us like we were always in their way and were  very ungrateful for the work we put in. Some would go out of the way to accuse us of things and rudely question how we were doing our jobs. All the females managers showed up late (we worked 4am shifts, they would show up around 8 or 9) and we were CONSTANTLY running out off supplies. Would get yelled at for really trivial things and overall the conditions they had us in were unsatisfactory. The pay was good but the discounts were very small..."
good,The people are amazing and makes you excited to work each day. Overall a great company to work for and it great to get the corporate experience.
good,It was nice working there steady flow throughout the day really friendly people to work with. Days fly when you keep yourself busy
good,Its really not a bad place to work but the retail environment is not for me.  Its a very structured corporate environment. I received very little training and was told this was the norm.  The pay is great and the discount is pretty ok too.
good,"great customer service based, employees get free money every time they open a card, free clothes products depending on what department they work in, room for growth, training &internships available"
good,"Nordstrom is good if you can stick thru all the ups and downs and rude customers."
good,"Each day I would review my stock,organize my work space, review my customer replenishment list, send notes to customers and identify focus items for the day. Talk with customers about their needs, offer appropriate recommendations, provide demonstration and complete the sale."
good,"Great hours and benefits, good pay if you are hired into the desired position, but once hired, it is difficult to attain significant positional or monetary advancement, regardless of additional duties performed."
good,"A typical day at work is surrounded with customer facing interactions. You get in and receive any updates to the sales floor including new product and any promotions, then you hit the ground running and immediately start helping and greeting customers. The majority of your day is customer facing, but you're expected to do phone call follow up's on customer orders, and put tried on product back out on the floor throughout the day as well. "
good,"Nordstrom treats its employees well, and can be a great place to work for most. If you are an executive assistant, you'll find that advancement into other positions is very difficult if not impossible, but if you aren't interested in exploring other roles, there are lots of fun and secure positions as an assistant."
good,"A typical day at work would be fulfilling any orders from other stores and shipping them out. As well as greeting customers, fulfilling their needs. At Nordstrom, I learned how to better communicate and gain patience with co-workers and customers. The hardest part of the job was telling my customers that we did not have an item they wanted in store. I try to order the item from another store or from nordstrom online, but a lot of people do not like ordering from online. The most enjoyable part of the job, was the connections I made with co-workers but more importantly the connections I made with customers that loved my customer service. It made me feel good that I was doing my job well."
good,Strong emphasis on customer service. Fun environment.  Great product to sell. Work very hard all through your shift. Customers generally friendly and enjoyable to help.  Good health benefits.  Manager cares.
good,"Employees are encouraged to be creative and take the initiative to learn new things, develop new skills, and work on different projects. Building relationships with other teams and managers is encouraged to help create opportunity for one's career growth."
good,Working for Nordstrom is fun and exciting but the managers don't know what they are doing. Some managers want you to grow with the company and others want to hold you back.
good,"Some of the associates were a little stuck up, and the overall work environment was a little mean/competitive.  There was some hostility and drama between associates, but good pay."
good,Overall progressive work environment with teachable progression. Potential for growth based on action and work ethic. Customer service is above all else.
good,I started off as a cashier worked my way up to a assistant store support manager it was all new to me never worked retail so i gave it my all and i advanced pretty fast its a pretty fast paced environment but i was able to adjust and show that I could handle anything that came my way. I learned how to work a register and do our cash room which kind of terrified me but i didn't let it get the best of me at all. I really learned a lot from the management that was there kept me on my toes and soaked in as much information as i could to be able to move up in the company and be successful at my job. Loved my co-workers but made my job hard some times but that comes with being a manager just have to adjust fire and keep moving as my Sargent would say. Hardest part of the job was making sure that the customers were always happy and taken care of but the most enjoyable part was knowing that the customers were happy and that my employees were happy as well.
good,"Typical day at work begins after a quick daily schedule check. If you're opening be prepared to place the new merchandise (shipped almost daily) onto the sales floor. The doors open at a certain time every day whether you're the floor is finished or not. From then every thing is typical, size clothes, help customers with questions, talk about sales or promotions, and do checkout. Hardest part of the job is dealing with very rude customers and your hours being snatched if although 40 hours is ""promised"". The most enjoyable part was probably helping a clueless customer come up with an outfit for an event."
good,"It has it moments working there, sometimes its fun fast pace while other times it can be very slow. Also I have learn that depending what area you are in you are in the position to make more money then others."
good,Overall great company. Sales in brick and mortar stores is down which makes employee happiness levels a bit low at the moment.
good,Nordstrom's strives and supports promoting with in. Sad part is moving into positions that you're promoted into you have to learn most things on the fly.
good,"Nordstrom has the potential to be the greatest department store anyone can work for. Just a little attention to detail when it comes to management, and all will be fine! "
good,"Nordstrom believes in amazing customer service. While that absolutely benefits the customer, it made providing excellent service difficult in a full time position when the cosmetics price points aren't huge and when the company offers free returns, no questions asked, which affects an employee's commission. I couldn't justify selling makeup, which I care a lot about, to customers who didn't have the same respect for the products and could easily return unsellable product back at any time. No boundaries with customers meant, in some cases, unreasonable expectations for service. In addition, cosmetics customers could expect a full makeup service without any fee, using up employee's time without fair compensation, unlike in a salon setting. My coworkers all had great attitudes and served the customer on their terms, empowered to use good judgement at all times. I acknowledge my management team's persistence, ability to provide feedback in the moment, and focused attitudes."
good,I love the customers and the job helps me to help others and the excitement to do more in life. What I learned as a worker is to continue to do the job at my best.
good,The work environment is very well.it is very fast paced job were I have to meet my quarter for the day. I've learned how to do inventory and basically all the skills needed to work in a warehouse. I thought the management did there jobs well giving us assignments and always keeping the coworkers busy. everything is good besides me not getting enough hours.
good,"I managed a team of 11 people including one assistant.  A typical day would require me distributing goals to everyone according to department's LY or How much can you sell Goal.  Their given goals are what they have to make so we could make our department goal.  I usually use the iPad given to us which has apps to tell us our results, what we are selling, stagnant items, and ways to communicate replenishment items to our buyers.  The app they had was fairly new (about 2years now) and its the best thing they ever had! I also floor watched (observe team) to see their pain point (opportunities) and what they were good at.  My job is to make sure my team are great sales people so they can make money and give great service."
good,"Nordstrom is a very demanding company because it requires many hours of overtime that are mandatory.  Example: 7 ten hour days per week, no lunch break and only 3 fifteen minute breaks."
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for. Now the management needs to be better.Managers needs to work on professionalism and respectful communication with co workers. Needs more organization. You can grow fast with the company. The co workers are awesome and very supportive. Fun work place. For this to be a flagship store the standards is not there. If you love fashion this is the great place. You will learn business and products.
good,"great benefits, below industry average compensation for management, promotion from within but only if you are mobile."
good,"On a typical day of work at Nordstrom."
good,"This job is highly demanding but overall worth it if you enjoy a little green in your eye on your paycheck. Nordstrom is commission based, it started off as a shoe company so the shoe department gets most commission FYI, work shoes its demanding fun, you'll hate the world throughout the day but love it once its over. Nordstrom Racks is hourly pay FYI same thing just cheaper clothes and more sales thus more mess but more security with a pay check"
good,"In overall this is a good company(They make billions) but Management sucks due to the fact that they are under pressure to make money no matter what. Its all about numbers. Their main goal is to make the day so if you ended up leaving late on a particular night because the store is full of customers, they will cut your hours the next day to make for the time that you worked over the previous night.. No Overtime at all. Crazy hours. Co-Workers were great and always there to help all customers. I enjoyed meeting new people every day that they  visited the store from different parts of the US and the World."
good,Working at Nordstrom can be a lot of fun when there is a lot of foot traffic on your floor. It is commission based so it makes the environment very competitive and hostile at times. Keeping busy by cleaning and putting away lose items found around the floor or fitting room helps a lot when it is slow and there isn't much to do.  A great company to work for especially for students because of the flexible hours.
good,"Opportunity for advancement is great"
good,"Nordstrom was very well with flexible schedules, standards very high work was always busy always had to be on your toes doing something productive, Managers are very easy going but at times very hard to cope with."
good,a work place filled with the stress of typical retail customer service. Their are a lot of services for customers and to learn everything is relatively easy. Good workplace for high energy people. Co workers are good people and can be lifelong friends. Hardest part of job is always the holidays as usual. Enjoyable part is that you are paid for the work you do.
good,"I was able to exercise my leadership abilities because there was such a high turnover in management. I was very influential in building the rapport between the department and the store employees. I didn't get a chance to have a relationship with my direct manager because I had 3 within the 10 months I was employed. The job was not hard at all because I come from a management role in the same field, but the most enjoyable part was making apprehensions and getting to know the employees, learning from them and gaining Intel."
good,"Fast paced, very fun environment, coworkers was easily to get along with. Management was not completely professional. Cared too much about opening credit awards. Much favoritism."
good,"Direct Manager was extremely unprofessional and consistently tried to hit on me. I should have filed harassment, my fault. The company structure is great, if only they ensure the managers were capable of executing this awesome strategy. Prices were great. It was organized. I think its safe to say a proper management team could really boost this company."
good,"keep store stocked with merchandise, clean store. help customers locate merchandise, ring customers out. Co workers are mostly nice and cool to work with but management is a different story . Most enjoyable is being able to help customers shop \."
good,"Fun place to be at for a person just getting out high school, the hours are long and you must work the weekends to earn a good paycheck .One thing that i didnt like was that they mandated employees to attend staff meetings on there day off early in the morning"
good,"Nordstrom is a fast paced work environment with a lot of potential growth. There is good benefits that employees can be a part of if they just research and do the paperwork. I learned a lot about fashion merchandising and general retail. The management varies there are many very interested and helpful managers as well as very distant and impatient ones. The hardest part of the job is the inconsistent pay and volatile income, I really enjoy meeting new customers and employees and interacting with them on a normal basis."
good,"Nordstrom can be a very rewarding company if you dedicate your whole being to it. You are never board working at Nordstrom, there are always tasks that need to be completed. Management is good, they listen to your concerns and do their best to resolve the issues in a professional manor. My co-workers for the most part are respectful, professional and enjoyable to be around. The hardest part of my job is balancing the back of house tasks with selling. The most enjoyable part about my position with Nordstrom is consistently dealing with people!"
good,"Nordstrom has a good culture and nice folks, however at times quite political. The Item Analyst role was not the ideal role for me.. The job description entailed a lot of data entry and carpal tunnel."
good,management was ok i learned thata you just have to stay out the managers way and stay on your feet at all times my co-workers i didnt associate with them so much
good,"Good place to shop not the greatest for for working at."
good,Dress code very fun. Salary competitive. Scheduling reasonable.
good,"Great to work for"
good,Lots of work to up sell with low security you wont get returns. Competing with your own team as well as the other departments can be tiring. I loved my department so work usually wet by fast but its hard to be as cut throat as you need to be to make the good money when you like the girls youre working with.
good,"Typical day at work would be assisting customers daily with what ever they needed. Number one priority was to make sure my customer was happy. Co-workers where some great individuals, very competitive workplace, since we where paid off commission. Management honestly wasn't great at all. No one in higher positions looked for the best interest of the sales employees. Most enjoyable part about my job was making my customers happy, and knowing that i provided the best service possible based off there letters, and graditude towards me."
good,"The Majority of my co workers liked to work as a team, thats how i like to work as a team.  I Feel you get more down and accomplished when you work as a team"
good,"A true company that promotes from within, you move up fast if mobile."
good,a typical day was pretty busy but very enjoyable. My co-workers were a joy to be around and really made work fun. The hardest part of the job was the few difficult customers but after awhile it became easier to handle.
good,The return policy is really killing the emplyees.  I feel that every employee deserves a weekend a month.  The events are getting a little out of hand and not as special anymore.  I did enjoy holidays and just the freedom to be a leader.
good,I'm not a fan of retail hours so that gets annoying. I don't like our lack of return policy. I love the people I work with but that isn't an incentive enough for me to want to stay.
good,"nice customers"
good,"Nordstrom is a good company to work for. Nordstrom is generous with pay and benefits even to part time positions. "
good,"Summary above says it all. I met some really great people while working there, but the management was just bad. There are managers that dislike the departments they are working in and don't do their part on the team. I didn't learn anything here."
good,etc.....i really was not there too long because of school but it was alright
good,"nothing special, you come in and do what you have to do and go home. it's not a bad job, but it's not the greatest either, it gets you by or for experience."
good,"The Customer Service Manager at Nordstrom (AKA the Service Experience Manager) is one of the most difficult jobs in the company. The CSM is responsible for two or three different teams of employees (the customer service team, the cash room team, and the communications/operators team depending on the store), educating the entire store on best practices, the creation of new Nordstrom Fashion Rewards accounts, the use of Mobile POS, the percentage of E-Receipts sent, mimizing bad debt and fraud, solving employee issues with POS or transaction errors, and of course keeping customers happy. I really enjoyed my job - there was something new every day and I worked with a lot of great people - but there was almost no work/life balance. I managed about 10 employees total, and unlike selling departments, the customer service departments cannot go without a closer or opener - there must be an employee all the time. That means, if someone calls out, I'm stuck with the shift 9 times out of 10. I worked from open to close on multiple occasions, I came in on off days, and always stayed late. If you want to take time off, good luck. Your superiors will always ask if you're ""owning your business"" if you're taking time away. I liked my managers overall and the company does a great job with recognizing good performances, but it's almost impossible to have a life outside of the store."
good,"The company promotes quickly to retain employees, but not every good sales associate can manage."
good,"fast paced, good people to work with, management needs improvement"
good,It's not hard to pick up on the sales beat and make a pretty good paycheck for entry level. It's based on commission but if you can't make the commission you are guaranteed a base pay - something I have never needed because it's really not that hard. Benefits include all the usual suspects plus 401K and stock options at a discount. The insurance is great but can be expensive. Different stores have different management issues. They have a promote-from-within policy that can make it hard for those who are ready to advance but haven't been there very long. I've attempted several promotions and the candidate they went with was someone who had already worked in the company for a long period of time or had some management experience within the company. Any outside accomplishments are not really taken into account.
good,"retail is retail.  But Nordstrom is a step above.  It is definitely a different culture, priding itself on customer service.  Which is why they are always in the Fortune 500 list."
good,Nordstrom is one of the greatest companies i've ever worked for. the employees are great to work with and are really nice.
good,"I would assist customers with retail sales, returns, phone and online orders.  I also had a good rapport with certain clients that shopped with me.  I would merchandise and mark down items, also."
good,"A typical day involved greeting and engaging customers, finding out their needs, and using directive selling wardrobe for their body and give them new ideas. Also general cleaning tasks, answering the phones, and taking time to follow up with previous customers. "
good,"A typical day consists of:"
good,In Nordstrom warehouse I have learned different ways to keep a steady productive day. managers frequently come pass and make sure nothing is needed.  Team members are dedicated and very hard working. the hardest part is going home. the most enjoyable part is clocking in.
good,"good company, intense work environment for the kitchen staff, i received a great amount of knowledge and enjoyed my time there."
good,"A typical day at work involved assisting customers with their styling needs, corresponding with the alterations team to ensure the best fit of clothing for our customers. Though I consider myself a people person, I learned how to effectively communicate with people, sell them things, and ensure their confidence in our products. I developed strong friendships with my co-workers, even though we were technically each others' competition. Management was generally supportive, but they had a tendency to pick favorites in regard to scheduling. The hardest part of the job was the work/ life balance. I enjoyed being able to use my best judgement without having to constantly seek managerial approval."
good,"work days were stressful to meet daily sales goal, learned to be efficient in work ethic, management was a pleasure to work with show that they cared that you succeeded in the job, co-worker were caring and friendly. Hardest part was meeting sales goals when customers weren't buying. most enjoyable was that Nordstrom was family oriented and customer service driven."
good,Greet each customer with a smile on your face. Customer Service is key to any organizational but especially with Nordstrom. Meet department sales goal as well as individual sales goal.
good,Start the day off with opening tasks such as cleaning and stock. The rest of the day just sell. Fun people to work with and great managers. The hardest part of the job is taking customer returns on yourself because it's money out of your pocket. I've learned how to sell in a commission only salaried store.
good,If you have a great team work is fun to go to. The customers really appreciate the help from the sale people. Managers really want to see you succeed and are willing to get you promoted fast!
good,over all Nordstrom is a good company to work for as long as you meet your sales goals .
good,"A great deal of mediation, training, handling confidential information, subjects and topics as well as overall administrative support for the entire store. I dealt with a lot of recruiting as well due to the fact that I was recruited to HR from sales in order to recruit for the new store that was opening--we needed around 200 people and I recruited more than half of them myself."
good,"A typical day consists of checking your personal book, following up with customers, with a phone call or email etc. Making sure we are always the expert, this means greeting and engaging each and every customer, floor awareness, knowing the product of the day, being well aware of your personal, counter and department goals for the day and making business happen. Building customer relationships through customer rewards, utilizing personal book to always increase our customer trade. To always make sure every customer receives the best overall experience every time."
good,I loved working at Nordstrom for a very long time. I was a manager there and moved rather quickly up in the company. They seemed to want you to have a work life balance as well as feel secure in you position. They also had an open door policy that allowed anyone to talk to anyone in management at any time. This made it easy to talk to someone when you had a problem even if it was with your direct supervisor.
good,"Typical day at work was to serve the customer. To attend to any questions he or she had and help them in any way possible. Working at Nordstrom was a great experiences, because I met a lot of great people and made lots of new friends. The job itself is very hype but I loved it. I always had something to do and making my goal was not only to provide the best customer service but to excced my weekly goal every week."
good,"Typical Day: Day-to-day workflow and task allotment was reasonable, clear, and fulfilling."
good,The pay is awesome. Working there sucks. Management doesn't care about you at all. They always mess up your hours. Much more is expected of you than you get paid for. Good enough for money though.
good,"I love Nordstrom as a customer. That is why I wanted to work here. In order to succeed here you have to 1. Drink the look aid, 2. Be willing to relocate.3. Dedicate your first born to the store And 4. Know that the customer comes first. You go far with company doing those 4 things."
good,Nordstrom taught me high level customer service skills and superior business ethics.

good,Nordstrom taught me high level customer service skills and superior business ethics.
good,"It used to be a good place to work and to build selling experience, but now that online shopping has almost completely taken over, it is much harder to make commission goals. There is nothing wrong with Nordstrom as a company, there is room to grow within and there are many benefits and good people. I would recommend working there during the summer until the holidays are over, because for the first 3-4 months of the year, it is brutal."
good,"Great opportunities for advancement if you position yourself well, however like any corporation, there is a high level of politics to be played. How great you role is or is not is often determined by your direct manager."
good,"I worked for the company for just about 10 years, and worked in a lot of areas, and positions. They fire fast, work hours are cut a lot, management is not supportive. It’s bssovslly every man or woman for their self."
good,"Pick a department that you are interested in selling that way you enjoy it more. "
good,"Nordstrom at first was a wonderful place to work. I learned so much about the inner workings of the clothing and fashion industry and had so many opportunities to engage with multiple departments. My overall pay was satisfactory. My hours were reasonable at most. However, as the turnover rate was so high, company culture was not at its best. We had cheating and sales stealing and even aggressive behavior from other coworkers."
good,"It was a fun work environment, but at the same time stressful. It was commission based, so on the days with less traffic, it was difficult to make a decent amount."
good,"too long ago to accurately describe it now. "
good,Great company with good benefits. If you have a management position  you have a descent discount in merchandiser. The management leadership is not the best.
good,"Most enjoyed helping customers, disliked tagging and preparing garments for sales floor. I learned how to give excellent customer service. The hours were as expected for a new person--nights, weekends and holidays since I was the new person."
good,Always dress formal & have a great attitude.  Costumer always comes first.  You would personally sit down with the costumer to see what shoe fits him right.
good,"I originally wanted to work 30 hours per week but ended up working 40 hours per week. My teammates and manager were friendly, helpful, and a LOT of fun to be around. Their kindness helped me get through the long hours on my feet. My hours were inconsistent so there was little work life balance. There's no return only line so, ringing up customers, reticketing items and processing returns felt chaotic."
good,"I loved the idea of Nordstrom but I just don’t think it’s worth being full time. You only get commission so when it’s good it’s good, but when it’s bad it’s bad. Sometimes you won’t have enough money on your check to get by. I would suggest doing it as a part time job."
good,"If you’re looking for an easy retail job, this isn’t it. Known for their customer service, you’re “on” from the moment you step on the floor. If you’re not hustling, you’ll be eaten alive. Even if you put everything into your job, you still may not succeed. It pays to play nice with some, but definitely not all because your coworkers probably won’t play fair. If you want to make enough to live on, be prepared to be savage."
good,"Was really nice in the beginning, but slowly started to decline because of management changing. Some of the customers that we interacted with were not the best."
good,I learned ALOT about fashion at Nordstrom a really great place to work. I met lots of interesting people and learned the true meaning of the hard work and hustling
good,"Nordstrom Rack was a nice place to jumpstart my sales career in the retail industry. Retail hours are tough because stores try to stay open as long as possible, but overall it was a good experience."
good,"I’ve been at Nordstrom for some time, overall Nordstrom is a good place to work at they give benefits, discounts, pto, bereavement time, and sick time."
good,"I enjoyed working for Nordstrom’s, I just didn’t like the pay structure.. "
good,"Working here was fun, and we got paid well but management was very domineering, expected a lot but did not support or reward its employees for hard work. Not much of a voice being heard. Also lots of favoritism from management, making it hard to work with trust that management cares for our benefits or wellbeing or has our back. Overall, it paid my bills and I learned good people skills and sale skills."
good,It has slowed down immensely but is still a good job if you're willing to put in the effort with every single customer and opportunity. It has taught me great customer service skills. The management I've had is mixed. There is somewhat of a high turnover. It's most difficult when it's slow or you have a really aggressive coworker who takes sales. I really do enjoy the people I've worked with but it's not easy to sell unless you step on other people's toes.
good,Lovely work environment great employees and great management I learned a lot of of wonderful experiences while working for the company. The work environment was really nice and everyone was friendly I loved when I was able to satisfy a customer with whatever issue or questions they had
good,"Unless you are passionate about the retail industry, or are content maintaining positions strictly in the store-level retail industry, I wouldn't suggest working here. There wasn't a whole lot of room for advancement and I was paid unfairly compared to most other employees in my department."
good,I liked working here because it balanced out a lot of difficulties I had in life. The company helped out my personal life by creating a safe place for me to go when I came to work. They also helped with my self confidence my building my self esteem by rewarding my hard work with additional discounts.
good,I really didn’t get much training.  The first week I felt overwhelmed.  I don’t have any problems with Nordstrom except I am not getting many hours while it is slow.
good,Nordstrom was my first job. I was taught a lot about the work environment and culture. I was given skills that cannot be taken away from me. I found that I became unhappy after working there for 5 years. I worked every weekend and could not spend time with my friends and family. I made the decision that it was time for me to move on because of this.
good,The ratio of Traffic in the store versus the amount of money that one should make in one day is not realistic even though the department manager strongly enforces the goal.
good,"Faced paced environment  using multi tasking and constantly  staying busy .management is reasonable,  giving time off when needed . Limited room for advancement.  Overall a nice place to work , staff is friendly and use teamwork skills ."
good,"Overall, I've enjoyed working for Nordstrom, however my experience had its challenges with Management & Support. Ultimately, these situations worked out for the best."
good,I found it very easy to make a name for myself and be recognized within the company. I was drafted into a better department after my work drive was recognized and i started getting more hours and being paid more per hour. There were complications involved with running a restaurant inside a department store. I found myself better suited working in Building Services.
good,"Nordstrom is an okay company to work with. I started out as an Intern and worked my way up to management level. Nordstrom is a great company that promotes its own people to higher positions down its company pyramid, however the work culture is not the same throughout each store. Since Nordstrom is a retail company you have to be willing to sacrifice having a consistent work schedule and be will to be standing on your feet all day."
good,"Pros:"
good,"The sales goals are really motivating, but can also breed competitivity amongst fellow employees. The HR and management was really involved in sales floor goings on."
good,Job posting said it was an administrative assistant job and what it really was was just me taking clothes back to the floor and clearing out dressing rooms. Thought I would be doing admin work.
good,"It is a good company to work for, There are many different routes you can take within the company. You get health benefits and can save for retirement."
good,It started out as a cool place to work until it became cut throat. The management was not professional and showed a lot of favoritism. No one follows the rules and the new people catch all the slack
good,At the beginning of my employment they were very employee focused. Towards the end they were more focused on numbers. I know that the salary is top notch for the area.
good,I really like working at Nordstrom Rack because my co-workers are very friendly and they make work more fun. The management was alright but there is no advancement for future career.
good,The company is great for growth and opportunity. The only bad thing was some of the employees were bad people and some managers. They worried mostly about being buddy buddies than co workers. The company overall is a great place to work at.
good,"Really enjoyed the majority of my time at Nordstrom. The only problem is it’s having a hard time competing with online retailers, and thus can sometimes be pretty aggressive in its sales goals."
good,I don't have much to say about them I feel like they're working people a whole lot of hours way too much you don't even get to have fun with the money that you're making so it's useless
good,"Hour Lunch, Hourly OR commission. No one cares too much about your department unless you sell designer. Tax bracket you fall in depends on the department you work in. They hire from within but will fire you just as easily. Don't be late.  $11/hr as a salesperson non-negotiable. Hours are very consistent 35- 39 a week but pay sure isn't.  After taxes, your average check in Topshop/ BP / Active is gonna be 600-750. So no rent getting paid for you."
good,It was a temporary position. I was involved with the web team which meant we handled the orders ordered on line and the pick up in store orders. Customer service is what Nordstrom abides by so that’s always a good skill to have.
good,It's retail so it was busy.  You had to sell a certain amount.  Promotions were tough to get though they did promote from within.  People were nice enough.
good,Fairly laid back environment. You have your own space when working. However favoritism plays a part. Some floor managers need to pay just a little more attention to the work ethic.
good,Manager is awesome and understanding. Very flexible with hours. They make you feel comfortable and don't tolerate disrespect. Meaning everyone is respected from management down to coworkers.
good,"My manager seemed to give up on me after week 2 into the internship. Didn't seem to really want me there. The other interns were getting to learn so much more than me. It was a bummer, because it was my dream company to work for, but I just had a bad experience."
good,Working at Nordstrom Rack is a family orientated place. Co- workers are really sweet there. The hardest part of the job is hours may lack on some weeks.
good,"I believe that nordstrom treats it's employees fairly, and shows appreciation for all that you do. The only reason why I want to leave is because Retail in general is becoming stale to me personally, and I just need something new."
good,more understanding between being sick and having a simple headache would be nice because i was let go do to hydration. it should be more understanding.
good,This job requires your full attention. Do not recommend if you are a working student. They do pay well and provide benefits for their employees. You learn a lot about sales techniques which can be useful for later careers and you do get a lot of hours but I do not recommend for people who may have other responsibilities besides work.

good,"At Nordstrom they promised us that they would expect us to be like the bay or eatons where they bug customers everywhere in the aisles and it would be more relaxed."
good,"Great and fun work environment, great people, needs better management. Nordstrom Rack is much less stressful and competitive  then the full line Nordstrom."
good,"When I worked in the Special Occasions Dept it was very stressful. Our popular times were wedding season and Prom season. Other than that people are not shopping that section too much, which is very stressful because you're working off commission"
good,"Nordstrom pays on commission.  It is unfortunate that in today's day so many people return items.  These returns are deducted from your salary.  Some days you may be in the negative even though you sold $2000 in clothes.  I enjoyed the people and Managers that I had.  it was stressful for me to have an uncertain paycheck.  I really enjoyed being a Personal Stylist!  If you need a job for fun, do that!  I had bills to pay and the fluctuating paycheck was stressful."
good,Nordstrom is a good company but a lot of overtime. Feeling worn out during the time you should be spending with family (summer and winter) great benefits though.
good,"Commission environment, cut throat sales at times there are more sales people than customers and long time sales people are very possessive of ""Their"" customers."
good,Have had amazing managers and some great coworkers while generally enjoying the work atmosphere but the turnover rate is excessively high due to the pay structure. Plus the return policy that Nordstrom is so praised for typically really hurts the employees themselves.
good,"Working at Nordstrom Rack was a great experience. I met lots of great new people & got to service a variety of different people. The cons were management and scheduling. Lots of people get hired and are only trained in one department of the store because managers won’t train them else where . Anyone is eligible for management positions m, they say you have to have experience but you do not. Scheduling is awful , you tell your manager what you can work and they schedule you the opposite."
good,"The company is a little hard to advance in. Overall the culture is a good, friendly and flexible environment. If you are able to be hired focus on your sales and get to know all the departments not just the one you are working in."
good,commision based. good place to work depeing on your department and the season. It gets really slow after christmas. there will be a lot of returns. great place to be seasonal.
good,"Having to deal with retail and food at the same was challenging. Although, you work for the same company,  different rules apply to both.  The job itself was very easy, the only problem that I had was sometimes dealing with the employees that works in the store itself"
good,"Too much work for too much stress. They don't keep you schedule steady they are always changing it up with no warning. Its all about mean politics and sucking up to stuck up managers. Mangers don't acknowledge you unless your some favorite. No credibility towards employees. They are not even considerate about your sales, if a customer comes returns on you that comes out your pay check, it not a problem we can always make that up but every manager will take anything even if its in really bad condition. Thats crazy because then they come to you and have the audacity to say you have so many returns, you're not making your goals. Like what! But overall other then managers sales associates are great."
good,"Fun place to work, if you surround yourself with successful salespeople you will be successful too. Make sure that if you want to advance with the company you let it be known, and take full advantage of the awesome discount!"
good,"Many opportunities to grow within the company. Great benefits including extended health plan and dental plan"
good,"My time in the company Nordstrom was both exciting and challenging. I appreciate my time spent there because it allowed me to grow as a individual. The job teaches you patience, perseverance and consistency."
good,"good company to work for if you like a commission based environment. good people to work with, opportunities to advance or transfer and stable job. its good experience but may not be conducive financially for the long term."
good,"Company benefits are great. This is the one company that says they have an open door policy and they actually mean it. Just let your leaders know where you wanna go and they will happily guide you. But this is not a job for an introvert. If you are not a strong seller, or people person, depending on what department you work in, you may not make any money. And if you feel like you would do better in a different department they try to make you stay where you are for 6 months before letting you transfer. So make sure whatever department you apply for is the one that you plan on staying in. You can grow and learn if you have the patience. But if you aren't a strong seller than don't come in expecting to make a good pay check. It will take you some time to build."
good,"Very fun place to work, but the politics are a drag. Hard to advance unless you have friends in upper management. It is very sales driven, so not fun when having to sell people things they don't need to hit targets."
good,overall it was a step back for me to gain further information on back of house duties. The atmosphere is balanced and laid back. Managers are well informed and give you the adequate tools needed to succeed.
good,I really enjoyed working here..excellent for a realistic course in customer service. Call center environment and everyone there is very warm/friendly.
good,The position I held at Nordstrom was in retail sales.  Your salary is  commission based ;contingent on your individual sales. Nordstrom does teach strong customer relations skills. The most stressful part was the customer's ability to return product without  a time restrictions which means that the sale commission is deducted from sales associates salary .
good,"Nordstrom was a great place to work but it gets to you. There are too many blackout dated making it almost impossible to take time off for vacation. They do sometime work around scheduling. But retail right now is tough, with it being a commission based company you have to figure out a way to bring that income in."
good,"Staff is very friendly, there were a few things I didn't agree with but eventually that changed. there was bad management for a while before that finally changed. I'm glad it did."
good,"Since leaving Laura Mercier they have been acquired by Estee Lauder, so things may be significantly different now.  When I was there the biggest challenge we faced was lack of organization regarding training, inventory and coaching.  The products are great and attract a lovely demographic.  The day to day experience of working with the Laura Mercier line were rewarding.  Brand awareness could be much better and would help to drive business to individual counters.  Also corporate support for counters could be much improved, however, for someone who loves cosmetics sales it is a beautiful line to work for."
good,"Faced paced and friendly, yet competitive work environment. "
good,"The company is great about promoting people within and trying to create a benchmark for future leaders. However, with that being said, some people get promoted too fast."
good,tpyical day dishes preping food learned more on time managment hardest part unloading the stock truck best part the food was great a very fun work place
good,"Nordstrom is a company with very humanitarian and philanthropy based values that make you inspired to work there. This work place will teach you a lot about the importance of follow ups, how to work and manage your own business, drive your own sales,and how to multi task. It will help you advance your problem solving skills, and in certain positions, it will teach you how to work with multiple systems, and how to trouble shoot tech errors. The company is fast paced, so you need to be flexible with changes that may occur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. However, on the same note, the company does not provide a very good work life balance. Getting time off is difficult and the company is no longer flexible with schooling schedules, and regular scheduling is subject to change at any time. There are many opportunities for growth, however, it is very difficult to move to different departments and gain other opportunities. Overall the company can teach some good skills, but if you need a consistent schedule, or more opportunity for growth I would keep looking."
good,"I think depending on your manager it can be a fun place to work, but some managers can be kinda harsh. I know Nordstrom has commission sales, but working at the shoe department is tough."
good,This is such a high pressure work environment no matter what level of the food chain you are in. There is very little work life balance when it comes to sale/event time frames. The pay is alright but the support work is much more challenging than seems from the outside.
good,"If you are not a person who wants to see someone else take your money then this is not the place for you. Some people will see you talking to a customer and wait to steal then from you. Also when someone returns some clothes, it comes out of you check. so if someone buys $1000 worth of stuff and then they return it, that $1000 come out regardless how long ago the purchase was."
good,"The overall day at Nordstrom is productive, but depending on the season the work and fluctuate. The company itself has great benefits and pay. If you nave any problems at this company it'll most likely be with other employees."
good,it was a great place to work but of course to many managers contradicting each other on the work and how it has to be done. Also Dm for NE Region has no clue how to do the job.
good,"I enjoyed working here. I enjoyed the opportunity to grow your business by creating professional relationships with customers. One of the draw backs is that it is retail and working weekends and holidays are a must. Also, management turnover is very high. I experienced a new manager every 3 months."
good,"Tough job with minimal support and training. Plenty of opportunities in a very competitive environment. The people are mostly great, as with any company you there are some challenging personalities."
good,"can be stressful. paychecks are inconsistent since its commission. If you're looking for a place where you can advance, then this company would be good for you. You have to know how to sell if you want to be a salesperson"
good,"a great luxury place to be in, working with craft leather goods, and amazing clients, a dedicated and motivated company with great advancement in the company"
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work as a young adult.  The skills I developed and the relationships I built will last me a lifetime.  The scheduling can be flexible depending on department and the work is fun and exciting.  Unfortunately, I did not find the pay to be worthy of a career.  If I were able to earn what I would like to, I may have never left.  I have many friends that still work there."
good,"Nordstrom is a very cultured environment and can be rewarding in som aspects.  You are able to grow with the company, they strive on promoting within. Nordstrom offers many benefits that can be extremely helpful to their employees.  I've learned to treat every opportunity as if it's my last and take pride in my work. I have become a better verbal and written communicator. I've learned how to be a supportive manager and open to my employees. I've become a great active listener, and focus on the needs of others in the workplace and not just my own."
good,"A great company, but not for everyone. I was given the opportunity to grow, create and learn. But at the end of the day take the corporate culture into consideration, it is very apparent."
good,"Nordstrom is an amazing place to shop. Their customer service is un-paralleled. You can return anything you buy, at any time. Unfortunately, those returns are taken out of the Sales associate's pay when they are processed."
good,This is a company that will help you grow and gain a lot of knowledge!!!! You should definitely work at the full line store and the RACK for growth!!!
good,"Nordstrom is a great brand. The people are great, the team I worked on was wonderful. Work life balance was very supportive and I really loved the culture. It felt like a family!"
good,great company to work for but retail hours just don't work. i sell men's clothes. the managers are great and so are all the employees.
good,"On a typical work day everything is busy and there is always something to do. You can learn a lot and its a very diverse work area. The benefits are good, you get the 401K and be able to manage how much you want to receive."
good,"You have to make your commission, hardest part of the job is dealing with picky customers and returns, you co workers can be your enemies too."
good,"My job as a shoe salesman consist of reaching out to my customers, and letting them know about any of our new products. I would often have to compete for sales as well beacuse we all shared one floor, this taught me how too really be patient , persistant , and consistant. The work environment was really great, everyone was really motivated on making top dollar sales in there given department. Management however is shaky, there are constant managerial changes throughout the company which lead workers in the black as far as long future career oppurtonities go."
good,"I enjoyed working at Nordstrom but it does consume your time, not the place for you if you are in school! the goals are high and could be very stressful if you dont make them. Management is all young people and very immature."
good,"Good environment, with amazing management and coworkers. Typical work day involves meeting many different people, and being understanding that everyone comes in different shape and size."
good,"Usually as a lingerie specialist we would have many clients that make appointments are walk-in for a bra fitting. An appointment could take up to 30 minutes to 3 hours, depending on what the customer wanted. We would shop around the entire store, looking at different departments, to allow the customer to ""shop the store"" with us and purchase everything and anything they wanted. Depending on the department you worked in, there was excellent and professional managers and, some were not. My managers were very knowledgeable and allowed my skills and experience increase significantly as well as, enjoy the company I worked for. The hardest part of my job was leaving it. I became very attached and became a ""work-aholic"" you may say, I really did love my job. The customers and my clients were the most enjoyable part. Having the satisfaction of making someone's day with just a purchase or offering help made it worthwhile."
good,"It was a very self motivating environment. Being a sales associates was quite rewarding because we would receive special gifts based upon sales and effort. A typical day at work would be making appointments, and helping every customer that comes your way as best as possible. I learned to be independent and how to control my sales and maintain my sales above my expected quota. Management could be a little more hands on. The hardest part of the job was trying to avoid returns. The most enjoyable part of the job was that iwas able to control my own check"
good,"Nordstrom Inc has taught me a lot about having great customer service. As a sales representative we thrive off of how we treat our customers. I can tell first hand that it makes a difference in the way business in conducted. "
good,"Management is pretty horrible overall. They require you to call in everyday to check your own schedule to see if any changes, it should be the other way around the employer calling the employee. They don't know what to do when conveyors jam up or stall. Expect to hit minimum goal when they don't provide the work. To get promoted you have to be their favorite don't matter how hard you work, its how well you appeal to them. Don't let some late arrivals some breaks even with some reasonable excuses even with proof. Overall the warehouse its like high school with teachers pets and getting punished for been late just a few minutes and expecting the employee to know when their scheduled to work."
good,"Really awesome company to work for and good system for employees, great sales, deserve a bigger discount. The managers I worked with were unqualified and messy. The was a lot of drama in the workplace, people on my team dropped like flies."
good,"AT&T has very nice benefits such as they give you a free cell phone and if you need more phones then you can get employee rate plan. The pay is also good but if you are trying to advance with the company, it might not be so easy."
good,"Really awesome company to work for and good system for employees, great sales, deserve a bigger discount. The managers I worked with were unqualified and messy. The was a lot of drama in the workplace, people on my team dropped like flies."
good,"AT&T has very nice benefits such as they give you a free cell phone and if you need more phones then you can get employee rate plan. The pay is also good but if you are trying to advance with the company, it might not be so easy."
good,"Employees were extremely friendly."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for with wonderful people who genuinely care about you and are always wanting to hear your new ideas. I love helping people and knowing that when I walk into work that everyday is different. I do a variety of tasks but some of them include assisting customers, booking appointments, styling, answering phone calls, taking payments and processing orders."
good,"Great starter job but if you're looking for something to pay the bill, I'd recommend something else. Management is poor. Pay is poor. No one communicates with anyone else besides their clique"
good,There is a lot of opportunity for learning and career advancement. If upper management is what you are looking for then mobility has become a huge priority.
good,"I word in a high-end and trendy store environments, had to remain up-to-date. i also provided excellent customer service skills to hundreds of shoppers every day. I also had to make sure all sales floors where neat and orderly, sometimes i often rearrange and organize shelves and racks, lay out new products, and build merchandise displays."
good,"Nordstrom is constantly hiring because employees are constantly quitting. Nordstrom only offers commission based work, with the exception of about two departments, without base pay. If you feel comfortable with high competition between coworkers and being a salesperson, this job is for you. The store also offers benefits for full-timers. Management quality varies by department, as each department has their own manager and managing styles vary."
good,"Good place to work, however I am looking to transition out of retail"
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for with great benefits. A typical day at Nordstrom you are basically merchandising an assisting customers.Patience is the key because here at nordstrom we basically make our checks ""commission"". We have to do any and everything to please our customers. Management is okay. The hardest part of the job is doing a task and helping customers at the same time. You would really have to know how to multitask."
good,The best thing I learned in Nordstrom was customer service and how to create a strong relationship with customers.
good,"Nordstrom was a great learning experience for me. From the customer always being right, I learned a great deal about customer service and how important it is. A vital component to the business."
good,Overall great company to work for. Constantly meeting new people and working with friendly people. Wish it was hourly.
good,"Very competitive work environment. I applied for the internship and did not receive a call nor email regarding my status for the internship. I worked there for about 3 months of the summer. It was fun, great money, competitive, and you have to work at least 8 hours a day so wear good shoes."
good,"fun work place"
good,Nordstrom pushes all of its employees to work very hard to please the customer. It is part of the culture of Nordstrom.
good,"The day starts off with grabbing all the materials you will need for the day.  Tape gun, RF gun, radio, and markers are a few of the items needed.  I check the dry erase board for the department I am going to be working in and then head to it.  I pack of the clothes from the department i work in that need to be shipped out to the stores."
good,Nordstrom is a huge company and still growing. I work at of the smallest store and haven't got the full experience (in my opinion). It's also really hard to move up at smaller stores which can be a drag.
good,To work for this company was amazing and I actually learned a lot more about cooking and preparing food then washing dishes. Every minute of working at Nordstrom's was great; from the fellow co-workers around the store to the customers that you actually meet. The management staff was very understanding and down to earth ordinary people who loved to help and enjoyed everyday working at Nordstrom. Some of the Hard parts when it came to being a dishwasher was maintaining a complete work station own your own and helping prep food for later and the next day.
good,"Did not like the commission aspect, but it was fun, quiet, slow-paced.  Styling customers was my favorite part"
good,"Nordstrom is known for their strong customer service, but the employees achievements are often over looked. They offer good benefits and room for growth within the company. On the other hand, since most of their positions are completely commission based financial stability can be inconsistent at times. Management quality varies as in most jobs, but there is a great deal of pressure to sell and make goals, which is not an issue if you are goal oriented and have no problem making the numbers."
good,They staff on a daily basis based on business needs so towards the end of the month there are a lot of days off. If you are not the head of household this is a great place to work.
good,Great with working around school or other job schedule. management can be a bit harder to get into there. advancement is harder since there you have to know someone to get promoted.
good,"Working at Nordstrom is a handful. You make your own pay check and you really have to be competitive to work there. The management for the most part is present, in some cases strong while in others not so much. Since it is commission based, my co-workers including myself  are pretty much their own bosses. The hardest part about the job in some cases is the commission but as of now our biggest hard ship is that we are under reconstruction, which has really pushed our customers away and has taken a huge toll on our stores sales. The most enjoyable thing about this job, is the benefits. "
good,"Overall a great business in the retail section. As far as the café (not mistaken for the e-bar) manager skills lack due to new management."
good,The Metro Pointe Rack is the flagship Rack location for the company. It is right across from South Coast Plaza and receives heavy foot traffic. My department (shoes) is always destroyed by the end of the day and it is our duty to attempt to clean everything before we are told to leave. Other parts of my job include assisting customers and climbing all over ladders to find a matching left shoe to the one the customer brought to the Shoe Mate window.
good,This is a great job if you're introverted and don't like working around the public and would rather work alone (while still supporting a team). You punch in and go right to work with minimal supervision.
good,"The possibility of advancement, especially for young professionals is exciting to a new hiree. However, department managers are either great managers or not."
good,I enjoy working in customer relations and get great satisfaction when my customers leave excited with their new purchase.
good,"A good company, as is usually the case how you find it will depend a lot on your management team."
good,Nordstrom is a great company with great benefits. The commission only status can become stressful as it is very competitive with your co-workers. The customers are wonderful and it was fun to help them find the right item for an event. The hardest part of the job was keeping the department neat and the dressing rooms clean.
good,Come in count cash from previous day. Get the cash/register ready for the day. participate in daily rally/meetings. Open the store at 10am ring up customers. Help the sales floor team. Open accounts. With this job I learned how to bevome more of a leader. I lead the team and made sure everyone was on task. I grew with the company to becoming customer service assistant. The hardest part of the job was when employees are not doing what is asked and having to deal with them as to either let the manager know if not giving another chance and watching them lie about what is the reality. The most enjoyable part of the job is when my employees open a great amount of accounts i like to reward them with pizza parties.
good,Nordstrom was a good place to work. I met a lot of people and learned new things on the go. I learned how to work in a fast paced business and how to deal with customers both good and bad. On a typical day of work i would do stock assignments then assists customers with great customer service for the rest of the day.
good,"Working at Nordstrom has taught me a lot, like creative approaches when starting conversation with customers, and how to establish a sold relationship with them. I also had to opportunity to work on visual merchandising, that to me was the most enjoyable part, whenever we received new merchandise or a case needed some revising, i took the initiative and re-merch. Since working at Nordstrom I’ve had the experience of 2 department managers and 4 assistant managers, I’ve learned to deal with various forms of management, the most recent department manager has been the most stressful. Though Nordstrom says they work with school schedule, having a manager honor that can be difficult. The people I’ve had the opportunity to work with have been friendly and helpful, because the department I’ve worked in was high volume, high commission rate co-workers are a bit aggressive, but that was another motive to stay on my feet."
good,A very fashion forward company. Allows you to be creative with is acceptable to wear to work. Managers are pretty young and they were very accommodating to my school schedule.
good,"Nordstrom was a great place to gain industry experience and challenge your skills. Management at the time wasn't the best, nor did they truly believe in all of their employees. My time there was something I wouldn't change."
good,"Build genuine relationships with customers, work with head on a swivel, always suggest something else, take care of the customer and utilize your resources."
good,"Great pay, swing/second shift only, opportunity to become permanent based on performance. Little chance of opportunity to get first shift regardless of performance."
good,"First and most importantly...there is a huge difference between Nordstrom full line store and the Nordstrom Rack...2 seperate job experiences. I loved working at the Rack. I had great co-workers and it was fun. The old Nordstrom values (customer service) and no red tape (simplicity getting things done) are gone. They complicate everything way more than necessary. My problem was the low pay with no chance of a raise (if you are already making the top sales associate pay) or promotion (management positions constantly being cut) and doing the work of 3 people. You don't stop for a second. The manager's are frantic, although I really liked them all. Even if the store makes it's goal, they will cut hours for no reason (or should I say, you won't be told the reason). It's a great job if you are not counting on your paycheck to pay bills. I would go back, but I can't afford to. There is huge turnover because employees don't feel valued. Overall, I loved working hard, loved the managers, but just needed more."
good,there is little to no work/life balance. it was a fun job besides that. a lot of tiring hours but it seemed that it was okay for some people. I don't think i could do it anymore.
good,"no comment. Though I worked for Nordstrom for 5 years, i don't wish to comment about my work experience, there. I appreciate the relationships made and am thankful for all opportunities, while employed."
good,"Growth opportunities in agile transformation.  Initial excitement across group when first exposed to the potential of agile adoption.  Some resistance, though, to transition due to historical practices."
good,I really appreciated the environment and the people I worked with. My position just didnt pay enough for the work I did. Also there weren't enough hours.
good,"Well compensated compared to other retail jobs but that's because the company expects more from you. If you like the opportunity to operate as if you are running your own business (but with the resources and support of multiple leaders in a large company), want lots of growth opportunity in retail sales, and enjoy working closely with customers and your team, then this could be the place for you."
good,"There were always either WAY too many people staffed for the number of people calling in, or they'd let WAY too many people stay home and then the people left on the phone would be absolutely swamped. It's like there is no one upstairs that has any skill in projecting staffing need. The annual sale had technical issues for the second year in a row because the inventory system wasn't as up to date as the website. If Nordstrom doesn't catch up with the times, they're going to get smothered in these modern times. Seasonal people were only given about 2 weeks notice of when their last day of employment would be. And then they started hiring for the exact positions only 2 weeks after letting us go, despite cutting the pay of full-time permanent employees. This company has always been so respectful to its customers and employees. It's a shame to see them compromise that reputation."
good,Retail has slowed down immensely in the last few years. The benefits this company is offering in these tougher times for brick and mortar just do not add up.
good,"Overall good company to work for after you put your work in. Commuter benefits, dental, medical, etc. 401k"
good,General okay experience. Learned a lot worked a lot. Met good people. Advanced some skills and gained a lot of confidence. However management wasn’t the best and team meshing was weak.
good,Always had overtime available. It was a job in between jobs. It’s an exceptional company but the store manager was very demeaning and would constantly belittle my department manager
good,"Good place to work for sales. Highly competitive. Can be compensated well if you sell. Support staff is getting cut company-wide, more work to do and no increase in pay."
good,"Going to work use to be fun. Now it seems there is event after event, having to call customers to often. There definitely is not as much foot traffic as there use to be. A lot more down down on the sales floor.  Shoplift hours being cut because sales are down."
good,"Rack stores are typical retail. Must show aptitude for the job and store culture for advancement along with demonstration of product knowledge. "
good,"get two 15 minute breaks.  walking to & from the break area count as part of the breaks.  don't get a lunch break - have to eat super fast at second 15 minute break.  spend 7.5 hours a day on your feet.  expected to work at a very brisk pace the entire shift.  there is lots of voluntary overtime available throughout the year.  during the weeks leading up to christmas, there is lots of mandatory overtime.  we worked seven days a week, nine to ten hours a day, for about six weeks."
good,"The job at Nordstrom Rack was pretty run of the mill. Management never overworked employees, but the job could become unnecessarily hectic at times. Workplace culture was mostly non-existent. Sales targets were achievable. The job can help provide basic retail and customer service skills. Starting pay was reasonable."
good,The people I met there have become lifelong friends for sure! I would definitely recommend this job to any young individual wanting to meet new people. As well as any older people who want something job wise to do on the side.
good,Repetitive they only change things if they lose money not if affects customers or employees. Easy going offices no real dress code. Not the place for advancement.
good,"i have been working for Nordstrom for four years now and even though it has changed through the years it is a cool place to work. But don't have to much fun, the main focus needs to be get in and get out. clocking in do your job and then clock out"
good,Unfortunately I’m very qualified for the position or even the one above me. And due to my lack of Nordstrom experience I’m working for a department manager far below the expectations of a department manager. Due to her working for the company longer then me which I completely understand. It’s a build from within company. But her set of soft and hard skills are just subpar. So it is a disappointment. But if your starting from the bottom and have no experience it is a great place to work.
good,If you aren’t comfortable with people this is not the company for you. Hours aren’t set. You must have open availability. The diversity of the company is a plus and there is opportunity to grow if it’s your area of study.
good,"Nordstorm is a good place for a retail environment.  There is job security for the most part.  Company culture is good; customer service is #1 goal.  Opportunity to move up"
good,"Working in the shoes department of Nordstrom Rack was demanding, quick-paced, tiring and annoying to say the least. This position is tailored to an individual that does not mind being on their feet all day, cleaning up after customers throughout your entire work day, and having little to no break time."
good,Because of how big the company and store volume. People are hired based on need rather than skill. I found it difficult to work with people who aren't always professional in the work space. Due to high turn over rates it was hard to keep a good team for long.
good,worked in a retail store. didn't really care for this one. cleaning up after every person who can't put the shoes they were just using away is disgusting to me
good,"As a Rover at Nordstrom rack, I've been able to see many different sides of a larger company and I enjoy that diversity.  One day I'm on the floor helping customers, the next i'm doing markdowns before the store opens.  I've even helped out at the full-line store downtown."
good,"It is a great place to work and learn the ethics of business owners. Luckily I had cool management and a few cool co-workers but the pay was not enough. It is commission based and usually, traffic is slow. You work and sell how you want to but if you're looking to go in and make a lot of money from doing nothing, that's incorrect. You have to be able to grind, have a lot of patience, and have great interpersonal skills for you to make a career out of this."
good,"My work day would begin with making sure everything is in its place and beginning opening management procedures. I have learned to hone my management skills on my employees. I.e. coaching conversations, help when needed and office work. The workplace environment is friendly with upbeat cooks and managers willing to jump in and help whenever needed. The hardest part of the job is working with a small staff so every manager has to help out doing every aspect of the job. Finally, I really enjoy cooking and being able to interact with the guest when they need something. We are an open kitchen so we're always on display for the guest."
good,Great fast pack work; rewarding. Wonderful work environment with room for growth.  Enjoy working in different departments and a variety of managers. Great Benefits for all employees.
good,"The management was confusing, sometimes giving different orders."
good,Good company to work for during the holidays but the the first 3 months of the year it gets really slow and the cut the full time hours to part time..
good,"Poorly managed at the specific location I was at. Went through 3 department managers during my time spent there with the company. Not steady enough hours and HR never helped solve any of the employees issues,"
good,"Nordstrom was a great company to work for, overall. My biggest issue came with the huge reduction in foot traffic that has taken place in recent years. That makes selling on commission very hard and stressful. Unfortunately, if sales are slow on the day, your hours may get cut."
good,I enjoyed every minute of my time at Nordstrom and still maintain friendships with my co-workers.    Great culture.    Great out of the box approaches to retail.
good,"I would clean and put away clothes from the fitting room. Acknowledge all customers. Helped other departments when job was finished. Customer service all day. Help with the cashiers. Helped yearly inventory. Helped with price checks. Organized floors by resizing and by brand. When I moved to kids department, I was helping with the appearance of the kids department for better sales. "
good,"Nordstroms was fun and hard, management was... an issue to be honest.I was threatened now and then about job loss because we werent meeting sale quotas."
good,"Nordstrom is over all a good company to work for but it is a good company for someone who is just graduating high school. It is very competitive, commission only. Long hours. You do meet alot of people and really get to know about fashion trends but the money isn't the best."
good,"I was in management for 4 out of my 5 years with Nordstrom. GREAT company but with the growth of Nordstrom Rack stores, the decisions in who they choose to be store manager is getting worse."
good,no overtime easy work easy to do numbers and only over time in holidays somewhat manger are good they only hired worker upper position if you get alone with them don't care about your work hard or not.
good,Nordstrom can be a great place to work. Just try and stay away from all the drama. I love the physical aspect of the job and the camaraderie. When its busy its really busy but when its not you have to find things to do in order to maintain a 70 percent PEP score.
good,"I've been working at Nordstrom Yorkdale for a year now, and have been through it all basically."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for. They are diverse and they are very selective so you get to work with motivated people who like to thrive to achieve goals. In addition, they are very flexible with your hours as long as you let them know in advance."
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I have grown within the company and learned a lot from being in multiple different departments within the company in the last five years.
good,"fun for college student not enough hours someone trying to pay bills,but they do pay great. Great discounts on name brand items. Plus you get extra discounts during peek season."
good,Nordstrom is a great company. Our location however did not receive a lot of business. Most days were slow ad t was hard to reach our daily goals. The Location ended up closing shortly after i started working there.
good,It is hard to have a work life balance if you work in the stores because they are open late and on the weekends. It can also be hard to have a work life balance in corporate but this mostly depends on your team and manager and how good they are at their job. They do have good benefits though.
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work where you can get promoted from within rather quickly based on your results."
good,Just work with the old workers nicely. Do everything that your manager says.. work with your best.. if you are going for the sales floor  deal with the costumer nice and give them all your best to assist them
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work but the management and business aspect of it lacks thereof. the company has changed for the worse and is no longer in the corner of the employee.
good,Great energy to be around and such an amazing team to work with! Dept Managers are great people to work with and help you get to where you want in the company.
good,"A good place to work and grow with good benefits.Good environment, with a lot of friendly faces to grow accustom to. Fast pace but at your own pace as well very cultured warehouse."
good,"The store I work at is understaffed, and the employees are inconsistent. A few will pick up the slack of the many. There is the lack of any real training, and one is left to either ask questions, provided they know what to ask, or to fend for themselves. Asking for help is a huge no-no. The managers are never on the same page. One day they will say one thing, and another they will say something entirely different.  The kool-aid drinking is also extreme in this store, and if you are not living and breathing Nordstrom than you don't fit in. "
good,"Working at Nordstrom was a great environment to work. The customers were always patient, tons of promotions, specials, and great product. The managers were caring, knowledgeable, and supportive. I had a great experience for Nordstrom and learned so much in my short time."
good,"Fast pace. Fun. Worked from home. However, this division of the company is still new and as a lot of kinks to work out as far as managerial support, customer complaint resolution, response times."
good,"Nordstrom will take you through a series of lessons and education about the position. Management is pretty encouraging & respectful. However, being that everyone is on high commission, its a pretty competitive environment. There are certain employees who will be very competitive and will do anything to sell the most. Retail is long hours, and what is frustrating is the fact that Nordstrom's policy allows basically anything to be returned no questions asked, so your sales numbers go up and down frequently. The sales goals are also very high. The employee discount is alright but nothing great. It really comes down to how competitive of a sales person you are and if you enjoy the retail commission atmosphere."
good,"I learned a lot in depth on how to give great customer service, they allowed me to express individual ideas when it comes to merchandise. Over all great to learn from in regards to selling and aiding people to have fashion."
good,This is an amazing place to work management is a little over the top sometimes but it was definitely a great experience that I will never forget . Loved my co workers !
good,"Nordstrom was initially a great place to work, however, the culture has changed drastically along with the new upper management. Sever layoffs and a complete change of the way technology runs has made working in Nordstrom Technology difficult."
good,"The co-workers here make coming to work a lot easier. Some managers aren't the best, but I've had a good experience with most. It's a great work place when it comes to benefit, and pay check. Not recommended for full-time students"
good,"At Nordstrom we are about service. The company prides itself as the premier clothing retailer, not only because of product, but because of the customer service our clients receive. At work, we outfit clients to the best of our abilities, and make sure they are satisfied with their experience."

good,"Continue to set the bar, wow our customers, while showing genuine appreciation for their continued support and loyalty, and always remember to continue to outpace our last ""win""."
good,You are in control of your own pay check when working but you commission sales also rely on the traffic of the store which isnt very busy in off seasons.
good,"you have to work and sell a lot in order to break even on your commission. If you like having non steady checks. if you don't have bills that need to be paid regularly, go and work for them."
good,"A typical day at work filling in the fixtures with product, locating product for customers, offering great service, helping the customer find a size, giving my opinion on an item, ringing up the customers, cleaning, creating customer loyalty by selling credit cards or debit cards. Management at this job was not so helpful, but thats only because they were inexperienced. Most of them were young and just became a manger 1 or 2 years ago. Co-workers were awesome, we all worked as a team. Hardest part of the job trying to merchandise what product would sell more. Most enjoyable part seeing the customer with a smile on their face."
good,"Its a place where a high level of professionalism is exhibited, I improved in all areas of my sales profession and my team work skills improved"
good,A typical day a work is essentially long and drawn out with the same tedious task. The sales are commission based and sometimes yields for a harsh and tense work environment between employees. The most enjoyable part is working with the vey diverse crowd drawn into our store.
good,"nice place to work with supportive co-workers. even though (sometimes) its all about the numbers i still enjoyed my time working. I built nice relationships with both co-workers and my clients."
good,Learned a lot within a comfortable environment. Nordstrom almost always promotes from within so it is a great place if you want to work up the retail ladder.
good,"Overall the culture is good, but work/life balance is missing.  It has changed a lot though out the years."
good,"This job was located in one of the corporate buildings so that was nice. Beautiful view to look at with the tough days ahead. What they don't tell you is that when on the  phone's they have many high expectations of you. They want you to have high scores on the phone minimum of 95% a month with customer service. call times need to be low.. (This is very hard to do with all the notes and emailing you'll have to do they don't want you logging out to do these things). They count if you're stating what the call is about in your tool( is called a disposition tool) this goes in account with your customer service sadly, your reliance, (you can be sick and gone 10 min they'll report you missing and point you, get six you're fired.)          they nag about every Minor mistake in these spreadsheet's when they train for 2,weeks but forget the most important stuff (like proper ways to keep your call time low, managing all the screens they want you to utilize, how to properly search for these aids they have but are worded improperly etc..) . I was way over qualified for this job but applied because of how they sold how( within direct) easy it was to move up. Realistically there was allot of favoritism with the online beauty people/specialist they didn't work as hard as basic customer service but got high praise all the time during large meetings. This part of Nordstrom has such high turnover rates its pretty bad they higher twice a year at least 75-200 people. As I said there requirements are ridiculous    This job will work for anyone who just needs money, good hours, and does not plan"
good,I love working at nordstroms I enjoy all the people that work there as well. My gripe is being a receiver the product demand gets low and we get called off at least 2 or 3 times a pay period.  They barely ever find hours for me to make up and when I got hired it was for full time.
good,Nordstrom is a great place to start any career in fashion. You get to really learn the business of selling and merchandising from every aspect.
good,"always meeting new people, build long lasting customer relationship, your able to make a tremendous amount of money around  Christmas time."
good,"Working at this job is pretty chill. On a day to day basis all we do is greet customers, talk to them about our products and try to connect with them on a personal level to give them the Nordstrom experience. I have good co-workers and the hardest part of the job is probably getting someone to sign up for a Nordstrom credit card."
good,It was a great job until the management changed. And the management constantly changes
good,"A typical day at work is me ensuring all guests' questions and needs are being answered and met.  I've learned to anticipate many different types of needs, whether they are potential dietary restrictions because of the way an item is ordered, to offering manageable cup options for moms with strollers, to knowing I should offer a glass of water with a coffee or an alcoholic beverage."
good,"a typical day at work would include cleaning and maintaining a clean work environment, finishing all work assignments. You must have a good customer service AND TAKE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION into consideration"
good,I enjoyed my position and the benefits are great but didn't like the direction the management was going in.
good,Always changing. No day is ever the same. Had multiple opportunities to grow within the company and move around the county. 
good,"Come in, do your work, get out. Workers were generally pretty open and fun, all laid back people. Management associated when they needed to because they seemed to have a lot of stuff on their own plate. Nothing was particularly hard. Would rewards us every now and then."
good,"A typical day at work involved a number of different tasks and goals. Sales goals and expectations were set on a daily basis. I was required to balance meeting or exceeding my daily sales goals while accomplishing multiple tasks that were set for me on a given day. I was required to work closely with fellow associates each and every day. With that, I gained a lot of experience in working with a team and learned many different ways to handle all types of situations. My time at Nordstrom gave me an all new insight as what great customer service is. I learned how valuable it is to take the time to make every single client feel special and to make every single experience the best one they have ever had. I now have a strong understanding of how to acquire, maintain and keep meaningful relationships with clients so that I have a strong clientele book at all times."
good,A typical day at work is generally non stop and very busy. I have learned to work in a fast paced environment and consolidate my duties. Management is very strict and operates tightly but is beneficial to the success of the company.
good,learned a lot with customer service. learn to work with people.
good,"Being able to grow within the company was amazing, but seeing what people did to get promoted was just disgusting. The resources available and benefits were amazing as well."
good,"I did stock, i worked with a great team, with a good work ethic."
good,"I am the expert at my current job. I'm aware of my sales goals when I start my day and plan my day with that in mind. I work hard to open a new rewards account daily as well. But more than anything I'm customer focused and I will go above and beyond to make each one feel like I'm there for them, to help them in anyway I possibly can and to build relationships."
good,"As far as retail goes, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. The benefits are great and the opportunity to make decent money, and grow in the company are wonderful. However, this work field is just not my ideal job. My work schedule was highly demanding and severly cut into my school work and personal life. I was often working 6 days a week, minimum 8 hours a day (often more). And they were very unwilling to work with my school schedule; not understanding the importance of Finals or class schedule. I learned great knowledge of the importance of customer service, and its competitive compensation encourages its workers to hustle and work hard, although, working soley on commission was difficult resulting in unpredictable paychecks. I loved building customer relationships and working with such great products, however, the overall work was a little too monotonous for me. On slow days, an 8 hour day could feel more like a 16 hour one. Management seemed quite off to me, there was blantant favoritism, and my manager never seemed interested in helping her workers become better in sales. I often got better advice and tips on how to better my sales skills from my own peers. Nordstrom claims to have an ""open door policy,"" but management always seemed unapproachable and unwelcoming to me. Perhaps if I had a manager who were more in-touch with her workers, my time there would have been different."
good,"A typical day of work was trying to engage with customers and helping to give them a great shopping experience by suggesting merchandise and styling them in what they felt comfortable in and what looked great on them. Management was good, my manager was always enthusiatic and encouraging, she was helpful and gave me great tips along the way. The hardest part of the job was dealing witht he traffic on slow days, and trying to compete with other sales associates for the attention of the of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job, was getting to make our customers over and seeing a confidence boost in them."
good,"I generally kept the store clean, not much detailed learning after my initial job training. The management was alright , but lacked communication with my co-workers and I. The hardest part of the job is being able to come to work everyday and keep up the entire store. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with other associates outside of the department I worked in."
good,"very productive work place, very strict! you're always busy doing something so you don't have to worry about getting bored."
good,"The pay is great 2 months out of the year but the other 10 months its hard to even scrape by. An adult with real life adult expenses will struggle in this 100% commission environment, unless you are in the shoe department. The busiest departments in the store also have the highest commission rate while the slowest have the lowest commission rate. So when a full time employee is taking home $400 paychecks for 2 weeks worked from a slow department, that same $400 is made by someone in a busy department in just a few days. Also, if someone in management doesn't like you (regardless of what store it is) your performance does not matter anymore to the company. You are blackballed and kicked to the back with no chance of moving in the company, you are stuck forever."
good,"Working at Nordstrom Rack accommodated both an inviting and comfortable work environment for all of its employees. A typical day at work consisted of me, and a few others working on the women's department floor, greeting and attending to customers or even working the register at times when the store was at capacity. Working in the women’s department allowed me to shadow different department heads of all sorts and gain experience beyond my department. The workplace culture was always full of energy when on certain days, music was brought to the floor while we prepared the store for closing hours or to open in the mornings. At times, my request for a flexible work schedule was neglected and I had to come in and work at times that were unreasonable on a school night. The most enjoyable part about the job was the area in which the store was located because the customers I interacted with on the daily were from all origins and backgrounds; it was a great diversified community."
good,Working  for Nordstorm was ok but they have to do better they care about the customer more then they employee too. This location have to do better. A lot have to change
good,"Nordstrom is pretty good for a mall retail job, but at the end of the day...it's a mall retail job. Pay for a seasonal associate not earning commission is $12/hour, which seems stringy considering that the employee is expected to go above and beyond with customer service. There are benefits like health insurance, 401k, etc., which begin after the employee has worked 1000 hours. Paid time off accrues very slowly after 1000 hours worked as well. Overall, the benefits make a job at Nordstrom a better option than a lot of other retail, but your soul will still be destroyed by  crazy hours, fussy customers, and all of the other negatives a retail job entails."
good,Nordstrom is a reputable company with great people. I really enjoyed working there and the culture at Nordstrom is very diverse. Over it's a great place to work.
good,Nordstrom invests in their employees with intense training. I felt that I can advance to any level as long as I work hard. Too bad the store manager was a bully who compromised the company culture.

good,"I gained much in site to the fashion world, Nordstrom carried current products ranging from Gucci, Valentino, and Prada. I gained valuable knowledge of all products across many departments including sunglasses, shoes, makeup, and menswear. The experience at Nordstrom was very beneficial to me. I learned a lot from my managers and coworkers, selling techniques as well as customer service tricks. Overall Nordstrom was an great company to work for."
good,"-4-8 hour shifts"
good,"Nice pay, but the mandatory overtime is killer. 6/10, 6 days a week, 10 hours a day during the holiday months. Overall, if you can keep your numbers up, you’ve found yourself a decent job."
good,"Nordstrom was s good place to work except for the hours and having children, also it's a tone of work and depending on the condition the customers are allowed to leave the store in sometimes its hard yo get things done in  timely fashion"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Nordstrom for the first 1.5yrs I was there. Around that time we hired a new CTO, who then hired a new VP for our org, and it felt like we haven't stopped going through reorgs since. Unfortunately there is never a lack of initiatives, but we don't ever seem to have enough developers to do the work, and leadership wants it yesterday. It feels unsustainable, unfortunately."
good,"Nordstorm is a very productive company with fair treatment towards employees, providing them with great benefits. However, management at Nordstrom could change and the products as well."
good,"Working in retail is a great experience to have. I recommend everyone do it at least once in their life. However, each company is different and may result in an overall positive or negative experience. Luckily, I can say that I had a taste of both worlds and feel more well rounded because of it. But, I've reached the point where I can confidently say that I do not want to continue with retail or the Nordstrom company. I'm thankful for the connections I made and experiences I had from working in retail, but it's not a fulfilling career in my personal opinion."
good,"If you want to job with minimal interaction with the customer, then this is the job for you. It pays well enough considering that you're standing at the door for the majority of your shift. There will be instances where you'll need to review video and work on cases, but for the most part you're just a security guard."
good,"My Nordstrom store in Connecticut was going through a transition during my time there. About a year before I arrived they received a new store manager and as I left, the new manager was moving to a different store."
good,Monitor camera footage for the main employee entrance ensuring specific codes are being used appropriately. Walk high theft areas in store ensuring products are secured properly .
good,"Nordstrom has a great foundation to be the top leader in fashion sales. With a little more drive and focus on its employees, there is much growth opportunity within the company."
good,"Has great pay, but asks for a lot that is not in the job title. Other than that the place is good to grow in and to try different things in the company."
good,"I worked at the Nordstrom Ebar in Rigdale Center in Minnesota and when I started there it was fine, but over time and closer to when I was about to leave, my manager created a really uncomfortable environment for me to work in. She wasn’t much of a leader, but a competitor, which is odd because She was supposed to lead by example and be a leader for a our team. Since I started working there (1 year) five people have quit working there, because of the way she treated them. They all went to Human Resources and told them their experience working there and still, nothing was done about the way she treats people on the team. I would not recommend working here ever."
good,"it was a great job, met alot of cool people along the way. I didn't have any personal time for myself though, you never really notice that while you're pushing yourself to meet those work deadlines."
good,Hands down Nordstrom is the best place to work at if you want to be taught how to sell period in the retail world. Company take pride in teaching and cultivating sales associates to secede.
good,Fun work environment but unrealistic work expectations. Great job for student associates who don't plan to grow with the company. Constant restructuring of the company and not much job security in management.
good,"In my department, my teamwork was phenomenal, and management was great. I learned a lot about keeping busy and one of the hardest parts is making customer relationships. Due to the nature of retail in this day in age it's a very slow work environment if it isn't one of two large events in the year when it can be much more busy."
good,"- Some rude customers who did not appreciate the work you do, some of them Nordstrom employees "
good,"Great work culture but bad benefits and slow career growth."
good,A typical day at work would consist of being around all types of people and getting a break every few hours. You learn how to efficiently communicate . I learned that the customer is always right and everyone will sometime have a bad day. The management was good and fair. They were flexible with me whenever i needed time off. The hardest part of the job was not letting those few bad customers ruin your whole entire day. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming to work a great bunch of guys and girls each and every day.
good,Retail industry is hard. Online is what is killing the big box stores. It is hard making money the last year.  The year return policy hurts what you make.
good,"just store  management and asst. store manager  didn't do any work,but took the credit of all the other managers and asst. did for the store.will go down"
good,"Working at Nordstrom rack was a fun experience made slot of friends I still know to this day,  you got a raise every year and good discounts on 90% of the merchandise."
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work if you are a self starter. Sales positions may be stressful, but the opportunity for compensation is above average for a retail store."
good,I would say it was challenging cause it's a fast business based off sales and commissions you have to really push yourself and be strong to work there I'm glad I can say I survived through it all don't get me wrong I would definitely employ there agin but it will definitely be something I think through about if it fits my personal life
good,There are some tips in the nordstrom that depend on how fast you doing at you your job and how quality you work on..if the empolyee works he/she speed is good the company will pay for he/ she.
good,"Great employees and management. The entire store system was very organized , but the store was extremely fast paced and intense which made the sales floor constantly messy which was very stressful at times."
good,On the day to day Nordstrom Rack is overall a busy place to work. It is fast pace with a lot of customers coming in and out of the store daily. Management is respectful and pushes you do work to your potential best.
good,As long as you are good at sales and have a passion for your department you will succeed. However there are sometimes unrealistic goals set that are unachievable.
good,"Of course its a competitive work place but its a dog eat dog situation for sales. Almost like a high school the way rumors spread around in the store. Nordstrom culture hypnotizes the people with low ambitions to want to ""work there way up in the company."" But it depends on your personality how you will grow, of course sales are important for that, but you will kiss butt to grow"". Lots of young people that are in management that dont know how to manage properly as it is there first time."
good,Favoritism sucks with the store manager. Most DMs are okay and you can enjoy a work/personal life balance as a sales person. Not in management. The first two years are your best years!
good,"The people that work at Nordstrom for the most part are nice  real people ,you want to know . Nordstrom offers 20 percent discount at full line stores , the Rack, and on line, and shipping and gift wrap are always free. Great Benefits for health , and 401k."
good,"Job consisted of routine surveillance (both physical and CCTV), weekly department audits and creating strong relationships with both employees and management. Nordstrom creates an amazing work environment which is relaxed and objective. Rapidly expanding company with plenty of opportunity for growth and promotion, but not within the store which I worked at. Management within the Loss Prevention department created a difficult work experience via scheduling and negligence in training agents to become ""released"". Training process was not catered towards the individual which caused a lapse in training."
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom would include fulfilling all requested orders, maintaining stock and the available merchandise and tidying up my section. I personally believe that better management needs to be adjusted as well as better training. Workplace culture can be stressful but one should definitely learn to not let everything bother them. I really enjoy my coworkers and we all seem to get a long very well. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with Nordstrom's return policy and poor management."
good,"Nordstrom provides a ton of room for growth and advancement within the company. Over the years I've worked for Nordstrom i have been promoted over six times in which four were management positions. "
good,"I learned a lot at my time at Nordstrom. I worked on commission so i was encourage build relationships with customers so they felt more comfortable shopping with me. I worked in the children's department, which one wouldn't think is the best but i made it work. I learned how to deal with parents and their children. Knowing how  to talk to people was extremely important skill to have and i picked up on it very quickly. I was very close with my coworkers. We were more like a family and they always kept a smile on my face even on the hardest days. The management was good. Sometimes we (the coworkers) and them wouldn't see eye to eye but they always had the best intentions for everyone. A typical day there would be first completing whatever pre-selling task in the stock room for about 30 mins. Then I'd talk to the manager about my numbers and see how much i have to sell for the day to get the paycheck i want. After that i get to selling until the end of my shift giving the best service i could possibly give."
good,Nordstrom Technology is a good place to work but no wow factor. Lots of changes going on as the tech portion of the company begins to become modernized.
good,Great place to work with great people. Good opportunity to earn more money. Good atmosphere. Good benefits. Close to Cedar Rapids. Hours are just difficult if you have little ones at home.
good,"Complicated at times"
good,"Retail is what it is...  Working weekends, dealing with customers, and, just being flexible but Nordstrom prides itself on being one of the best companies in retail to work for."
good,you have to love what you do and have a very good knowledge of clothing. you have to be well rounded and get along with people
good,"Love the company, hate the pay. Workload can be extremily large and your pay does not reflect the time spent completing the assigned department task."
good,Sales and customer service.  Tidied up during the times the store was not busy.  Always wrote thank you notes to customers & informed them of upcoming sales. Best part was working with nice people & helping breast cancer survivors.  Hardest was the stiff competition of coworkers.
good,This job was good to start the retail experience. was a bit hard to work while going to school. Pay was great. Great job is you like competition.
good,The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers and helping them find what they need. Management was nice and worked with everybody.
good,"Although I have only worked for Nordstrom's Rack for only a year, I feel that I have fully encompassed the overall feel of the company. The employees seem happy and are highly accommodated with privileges such as a great 401k Plan and excellent pay compare to other jobs. Although these seem like great perks, you are not always entitled to your hours with overlooks the great 401k Plan and discounts."
good,"Gave Nordstrom a lot of years. Feel like I was compensated well for retail. However, over the years the Nordstrom brothers found ways to take a lot of the perks of being a manager away. It just became a thankless job over time and I got burned out. Job really became only good the last 5 plus years for college grads, not people with families."
good,During a typical day at work I deal with many nationalities and personalities. I've learned to have patience and how to adapt to difficult situations.This company is full of ambition and I fit very well with my environment as I am a very determined person. I learned a lot from my managers such as time management and how to be a strong leader. My coworkers are also very kind and welcoming people who enjoy what they are doing. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping a customer leave feeling satisfied and celebrating the hard work we've done during the year.
good,"Pros I appreciate both Nordstrom and Chanel as companies.  Hard to move up within Chanel.  Management is great.  Very hands on.  Cons "
good,"A typical day at work was challenging. I learned how to become a better saleswoman and how to set sales goals and obtain them. Management was okay, depending on who your manager was, made all the difference. Luckily I had managers who were easy to compromise with and were respectful and understanding. My co-workers were okay but because of the commission sales environment a few of them were very nasty and vicious. The hardest part of the job was working your butt off to make sales and then checking your numbers to see that you had been hit with a big return(s). The most enjoyable was the fact that I love what I do, I love to dress all types of different women and build relationships!"
good,A typical day would be providing excellent customer service and also finding a product for every customer that walked thru the doors of Nordstrom .
good,I loved working for Nordstrom due to the environment and merchandise. I did not and still do not consider a retail sales position to be anything long term.
good,"I was a sales person for the Women's Shoes department. This department was quite challenging because salary was based on commission and competition was high amongst fellow sales people. Nordstrom taught me how to think, reason and communicate quickly and efficiently. The downside was that it was retail sales so the stress level was high during sales events and holidays. Sometimes customers were mean and rude without reason. Fellow employees would also steal your sale which resulted in a loss of trust with your coworkers."
good,"Typical day would be having the mentally to provide an amazing customer service along with the great customer service you provide get as many products as you can out the door with the customer. Being competitive because we do work off commission only, and making sure I made sales goals.As a sales persons everyday I come across customers that I cannot connect with in order to give them a great service because they were not as open, my goal is to always overcome that difficulty and get that customer out of their shell and connect with them. Managers are not really as involved unless there is a major problem, and the customer request their presents. I always try my absolute to educate my coworkers about product knowledge as much I can, and teach them everything I know that will make them better sales associates. Many employees come to even managers are available to teach or show them how to do something I don't know how to do. Hardest part of the job is being there over 2 and half years, being one of the top sales employee on that department managers dependent on me much more than anyone else.I am constantly doing their job without the title and the pay. Some days I enjoy it because I like being training employees, teaching/coaching them, giving them constructive criticism back on what they need to work on however some days I simply cannot do everything by myself and it gets overwhelming. The most enjoyable about the jobs is meeting new and different people, and sharing stories with them getting customer letters on how they enjoyed shopping with me."
good,"Good products to sell, and ample opportunity to make friends and establish regular customers."
good,"The team and employees are great, but be prepared to be on your feet all day carrying endless amounts of clothes and help customers."
good,I enjoyed working here. Management was great. Customers were nice.
good,   It's been great working for them these past seven years . I achieved the highest goal a sales associate can achieve which is pacesetter and recieved no cash bonus. It was the first year this happen and this made me feel we were not appreciated as the top 1% of the company's earner's. This is the main reason Iam seeking new employment.
good,"Love learning all the lines to sell , great co workers"
good,very busy.
good,I found my experience at Nordstrom to be EXHILARATING. The company grooms you to grow and travel far as long as you are willing to commit to the process.
good,"Just like any customer service job, you will have to deal with rude customers on a daily basis. You will be a verbal punching bag constantly so you need to learn how to handle that mental stress or depression will devour you. Traffic is seasonal/holiday-based so some days work will be overwhelming and others where there is nothing to do. Turnover is high because there isn't anywhere to go. People and jobs are shuffled around constantly and there could be no opportunities for growth for over a year. If you're looking for a summer/school job with great benefits and flexible hours, this is great. If you're looking to grow and get experience in management, this is not the place."
good,"Most people don't realize that it was bad standing all day, same times, I just I wish I had done some things different , but I it's a lesson learned. Deffintly we did get that one person that stirred up drama, and I'am above all that and just doing retying to make the which from courage and luckily a defend knew was opening ip in medical and it's the best call I ever made."
good,"Nordstrom has always been known for its amazing return policy, however what they don't want the customer to know is that when you return the items you purchase that commission is taken off of the employees check of the pay period you returned it on. For example: you buy a pair of $200 denim in January and you return them in August because you don't wear them anymore and you know you can return them. The commission the employee made off those $200 is about 6% which comes to $12 that employee made on that sale. That $12 comes off of that employees paycheck for the pay period in August. Roughly 40% of everything a Nordstrom Sales person sells is returned. During the year I worked for Nordstrom, I sold $250,000- but my yearly income was only about $20,000 working full time. Commission based sales in retail are a complete failure with the way the market is. While the compensation was terrible for the location I worked for the culture and people I worked with made it hard to leave Nordstrom. "
good,A good job to learn the ropes of retail. The store is always busy and customers are eager to hear about the reward programs. The interview and enrollment process is quick.
good,"Regional managers and Store managers have different expectations that are impossible to satisfy both at the same time."
good,"Working for Nordstrom is almost perfect, any job has its flaws , but Nordstrom has been one of the best jobs i could be apart of.The teams behind making it a wonderful place to work always goes above and beyond when its appropriate"
good,Layed back enviorment. Stress free enviorment lead is difficult to explain always changing and they lack communication. There was no dress code when I was there.
good,I enjoy working at Nordstrom however the pay is very low. My coworkers have been very helpful in training me and learning the technical aspects of the job as well as a productive sales approach.
good,"Since your paycheck was commission based, you could get a high or low paycheck depending on the flow of customers and how much they spend. Any returns are deducted from your next paycheck, and considering it is Nordstrom, they accept pretty much anything back for return. I loved my coworkers but tensions are high because you are all competing to get sales for a higher paycheck. Since it was commission though, you can sometimes get off early which is a plus. But that also means you could work a full  8 hour shift and leave with barely any sales if other workers take them all or if there aren't a lot of customers or purchases. Holidays are the best time for sales but after the holidays are the worst because of all the returns you must make up for."
good,"I sort, scan out, process out orders as the fall down from the shoots. I lift 45 to 75 pounds n also work on computers I also package out orders n place them on the converabelt when done"
good,Has not opened yet but i have been told by management it is a awesome place to work so hopefully it will be true to their word
good,"I worked there for 15 months before I quit. The staff is fun, you learn so much about food and dining, and it was always a fun day going into work. However, management was messed up, you'd be promised a promotion and 4 months later you're still wondering why you haven't moved up even though people are requesting you to serve them. Go to HR and they won't resolve any issues. "
good,this job consist of unloading trucks an items and sorting them all over the warehouse. I really didn't like this job because I felt as though there was no future to this job. No good benefits and an the pay was ok. I didn't really learn a lot at the job because I already knew how to do what the requirements were.
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom depends on the time or year. Sometimes you come in and your are busy the moment your shift starts till the moment it ends. Sometimes its really slow and time drags. This is my first commission based job and it isn't as bad as I thought it would be. I have learned a lot. Its been almost a year and although I enjoy it here, my time has run its course. It was a learning experience."
good,A typical day at work is started by opening all the merchandise in 4 to 5 departments on average. Every day I lean something new. Ive learned POS at Nordstrom how to process online orders and transfer merchandise and rack to other stores. My co-workers are amazing and we worked very hard and well as a team. Most enjoyable part of my job is my schedule 6 am to 2 30 pm.
good,"Amazing company"
good,"I truly enjoyed my time working for Nordstrom, I met so many people and built so many amazing connections. I would go back and for this company in a heartbeat."
good,"Working for Nordstrom is very fast paced. The people are great and the advancement possibilities are really exciting. Nordstrom is a big company, but there is always support available."
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work, especially if you are a single person, there is room for growth and opportunity. The pay is good and fair. they are  as flexible as possible."
good,"If you do your job, and your sales numbers are high, you have nothing to worry about. Don't be weak and demand the respect you desire. Do not be a push over to the veteran salespeople, because they will walk all over you in every aspect of the job."
good,"enjoyed seeing my coworkers everyday, base pay isnt high enough to cover you when its slow, very clean, hours can be tough but its a nice place"
good,"Very fast paced during peak seasons. I've learned so much about buying offices, merchandising, building customer relationships and integrity. Management focuses on ""Use your best judgement"" ideology. Diverse range of workers. The hardest part of the job is their ""Return Policy"" because the salesperson job is commission based and what is returned has to be taken from your sales. Being passionate about fashion, so styling customers that you've built great relationships with on a daily basis is joyful."
good,"Nordstrom was a very exciting and cultural department store with easy opportunity for growth. I enjoyed working in a commission based environment where some friendly competition against co-workers was involved, but the department I was in had more of a hidden agenda... I was the only female in the Men's Shoe Dept and it seemed as if the male co-workers would constantly express their personal feelings when the male customers specified that they would rather shop with me, a female. They saw this an an ""unfair advantage"" and would constantly badger me about which customers I should shop with. I never got across to my department manager for he was usually detached from his duties, and was shortly let go from the company after numerous amounts of customer complaints. I learned that somethings are out of your control and you have to  accept new challenges. I never gave up on selling in the Men's dept even though I had constant backlash from my co-workers, in the end its made me who I am today and I'm not afraid of competition, if anything, its made me stronger."
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work. Nordstrom only promotes within. Everyday is different and a new challenge. I enjoy merchandising on a daily basis, offering great customer service  and teaching my team the Nordstrom culture."
good,"exciting company to work for, great benefits, loyalty, wonderful management team, 401 k"
good,"A typical work day started with a store meeting, merchandising new product and a walk through of the floor. Then store opens and I began to greet and provide customers with outstanding services. From the time I entered the store I was greeted with warm smiles from co workers and management every single day I worked, I learned how to be direct with customers, working here taught me to have confidence in the products and how to listen clearly what customers need. The hardest part of the job to me would be the urgency of making my daily goal, it was a little pushy and rushed.  I loved merchandising, being able to make people happy, the appreciation from the company and the staff was amazing."
good,There is always a large opportunity for growth within the company. However the quality of managers vary greatly from extremely supportive to extremely negative depending on the area you work in. There is a great sense of team work within each department and it is a great place to work!
good,"A typical day consisted of upselling luxurious merchandise to customers and cross selling between departments while giving excellent customer service. While being employed here, I learned that I enjoy customer service and that satification that comes with it. I also learned that I don't enjoy the commission aspect of retail sales. The work place is a combination of relaxed and competive. Competive in the sense of hitting sales goals for the hour, day, week, month, quater, an annually. I would also say this is also hardest part of the job. As far as the most enjoyable part of the job, I would say the customer satification that comes with giving above and beyond customer service."
good,Fun place to work with low-stress atmosphere. Highly recommended to college students with busy schedules/projects. Ver malleable understanding managemnet.
good,"While Nordstrom was a fabulous company to work for, I did not feel fulfilled or challenged with the job at hand. I am not made for a sedentary lifestyle."
good,While I started my job working at the rack and later the full line store in chicago  the company as a whole was very progressive. My only issues I had was with certain members of management playing favorites with certain members of the team.
good,"It was a nice well rounded place, but hourly isn’t what is deserved. Managers are great, co-workers are great, and customers are friendly to interact with."
good,"I worked in the Kid's Shoes Department.  This department is awesome, because you get to interact with children who are about to get something new.  The joy on their faces is enough to make you appreciate the job alone."
good,"Great place to work for, reputable business. wonderful management, good pay."
good, Great Company to work for. There is inconsistency with work life balance because consistent change in management. Great Co-workers who are committed to the values of Nordstrom.  
good,Nordstrom is a ok. The benefits are pretty good. The only thing I dislike is management. The management could be favoritism at time but overall it’s a decent place to work.
good,"with all the money the company makes, they barely pay employees (depending on your location)  but other than the small checks, it is a great place to work. But you will be on your feet all day so be prepared. You usually have free reign to be very creative. Great coworkers etc"
good,Nordstrom is a great company. There are however some flaws in the system once you work there for a while but overall a great company and they offer a lot of benefits
good,"From my experience my location had no moral. Management could careless about anything but sales. The traffic was very limited. So, basically you have to phone everyone. Even if you are new. There was no coaching. Just write-ups and firing. We would have 2-3 events per month and be expected to make goal. Talk about stress."
good,"One of the most productive jobs I've ever had. I loved that I always had something to do and the customers. The compensation could've been a lot better and I wish that there was a better flow of a relationship between the management and the employees but nonetheless, an amazing company to work for."
good,"Nordstrom have a good training, coaching and nurture employee to grow with the company. the company offer very good benefit to all of employee and good salary. they also have HR department inside each store to help all of employee with salary, benefit enrollment and paycheck."
good,Good friends and management slow paced listen to music managers and very nice your lunches are in a big room where here r vending machines and other things they have snacks you can pay for and outside smoking area
good,• Management multiple real-time queues ensuring SLA compliance
good,"The attitude toward the restaurant division at Nordstrom is borderline hostile. The store managers do not care about the need of the restaurant. In fact most of them feel as tho it is more of a burden than it is worth. Store managers are very hard to work with, and unless you are an a** kisser, your time here will most likely be short."
good,"Nordstrom rack in Willow Grove was the worst job ever due to management, and supervisors not being on the same page. The location was also a bad location when it comes to employees."
good,Very hard and long hours for very little pay. Too much time spent off the clock or in the stock room without a chance to sell.  Fellow employees very kind and willing to help you when needed.
good,"Definitely made life long friends working here through school.  Commission was only source of income. If you didn't sell you didn't make money. If people returned, you didn't make money. Hard job with no return policy."
good,If u can have perfect attendance.  Make no mistake in packing an order  in clouding when pieces to order missing.  Than the packing department is the job.
good,"Great company to work for. Management is the reason why I left."
good,"Good company, nice work environment but poor business management. Healthcare provider sucks managers gossip about workers but pay is decent for college students. Would not recommend growing with the company"
good,"management where very unprofessional, but the company overall was good. the best part about the job was helping the costumers with their purchase and the morning shows."
good,y favoritism the Somalian group tends to play the race card allot. but when no management is not around they bulk rush you yelling at one in there face and body gestures are very intimidating it seems like very angry if u don't help them practically. then scatter when other English SPEAKING peoples come to the area. its your fault right away. I believe that was bulling . now that I think about it
good,"If you want to learn how to grow your patience and understanding through customer service, this is a great job. Retail with Nordstrom provides you with the opportunity to grow your understanding of a struggling retail world. The genuine interactions you have with all walks of life is valuable. Although, it may take some serious networking to grow within the company. Nordstrom tends to run a bit like “it’s all who you know” kind of company. But if you can network and make the right connections, the world is your oyster."
good,Wanted you to either be there all the time or completely cut your hours. Management didn’t always align with one another’s decisions and rarely backed you up.
good,Lots of opportunities but a ways to go to compete with Amazon and top ecommerce companies. Fighting an uphill battle. Teams not set up for success.  Interesting waystop.
good,"Commissioned sales, which was skewed in favor of those who had been there for years. Work-life balance was ok, but was not good for students. No job security, especially for newer sales persons."
good,"I loved meeting new people, and getting introduced to new products. The rate of pay was ok. I did not like the fact that they would cut hours, and play favorites."
good,"Led and conceived the innovation of decision management programs and systems in the areas of: business strategies, forecasting methodologies, financial modeling, analytical approaches, behavioral predictive technologies and strategic policy changes."
good,"Commisioned sales is competitive, but if your quick on your feet and attentive you can earn decent money."
good,"It's ironic.  I love Nordstrom as a company. Its ideals and principles are greatly admired. Unfortunately, after 5 years I must leave. Management that does not support, work life balance that does not exist, and the pay is way below what someone can live off of. It's a bittersweet departure."
good,"I have met lots of great people, customer and employee alike, but the competition and shade thrown between employees reminds me of being in high school. The benefits are fine, the pay is hard to pass up, and they are accommodating, however after being there for a little over 6 months my eagerness has turned to exhaustion with the management.  Sure you can move up in the company, if you have the ability to steal sales and step  on others to get yourself to the top. If you want that kind of career sure, but for those of us who simply want more it's hard to leave with a smile on our face."
good,Nordstrom has opened more doors for me and my career than any job on my resume highly recommend this job to anyone. There is a certain culture at Nordstrom definitely a get right or get left mentality. All in all you just have to be the right type of person to work there.
good,But for what you get paid.  I would only recommend this job for someone in high school or college or someone who can literally sell salt to a slug.  Because honestly the only way you can make a living there is if you pretty much need a little and I do mean a little extra money in your pocket.  They care about their customers and their product and customer service is crazy.  The company discount is amazing and the perks if you can get in the right click are endless when it comes to career advancement.  I recommend coming in doing an internship but don't work on the floor and try to make a living just off that.
good,"Overall, Nordstrom was a great stepping stone going into high-end retail. I don't think I would personally reccomment anyone to go apply unless it's for a corporate job or management."
good,If one person doesn't like you no one does . They act very fake to your face. They also fired me because of a medical condition I couldn't do anything about.
good,"Nordstrom doesn't care about their employees, they dont allow you to talk time off by PTO, sick days or no advanced request, they dont allow holidays off, and you dont have a set schedule during the holidays. they dont care if you have a family or home life the only thing they are concerned about is the company, as long as your willing to work long hours, mandatory over time, being required to work all holidays as well as have your everyday schedule  changed daily to accommodate the  customers..."
good,I was a sales associate in the TBD department. Their bonus structure with their return policy was completely ridiculous. They take away your sales bonus even if a customer returned 100 days past purchase.
good,This is a job for someone that dose not  aspire to advance. You will work extremely difficult hours and have extremely high sales goals. You will be put to the test daily.
good,A typical day  at work would include standing around for at least a couple hours and our store was so slow that there were times where me and my coworkers would literally be forced to stand in front of our department by our manager for hours while no customer would come by. Our department manager had issues with almost everyone and was very passive agressive and rude. She would have sly comments about us. The discount was not enough in my opinion. It was a very discouraging and toxic workplace. My manager would try to pry into my personal life ask me about my financial circumstances. The only time i looked forward to coming to work was because my coworkers made it better for me.
good,"Favoritism and competitive compensation were my biggest issues at Nordstrom "
good,"I worked at the MAC cosmetics counter in Nordstrom and was very displeased with the manager and the culture of that counter. If you can handle condescension and fake interactions you could survive here, but don't get any hopes of advancement within MAC, because that won't happen no matter what. There will always be some aspect of your performance that will ""need to be improved"" before you can advance."
good,I worked in Salon Shoes and a typical day starts with 30 min stock time then you get put on rotation for customers if it is slow which it usually is. The hardest part of the job is competing with the pacesetters and the down time. Workplace culture is kind of snobby. Most enjoyable part of the job is its not crazy hectic and messy.
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for as a place to get started in the cosmetics industry.  There are many people you can meet through working at Nordstrom who will give you advice on where to go next.  The location I am in, however, has limited mobility for advancement."
good,I had really terrible hours working here. The management changed when I was working there. Some workers really are only there to pass the time
good,"I was not satisfied with a management people and my working schedule. The hardest part of the job was tension between co workers and misleading management. "
good,assist customer with purchases such as shoes and accessories.  Attempt to meet daily qutoa.
good,"This company seems a lot better on the outside than it does on the inside. Personally being a full time employee that worked for them for two years, I was treated terribly. The way the pay works is ridiculous, and it is impossible to get benefits. Plus, they look more deeply and interview better when it comes to promoting managers because a lot of them do not know what they are doing at all. In addition, the managers could never answer any of your basic questions and neither could Human Resources. Maybe it was just the store I worked at but its no wonder why people quit and are constantly unhappy when they work there."
good,i learned alot about working in a warehouse and the things you have to stay aware of and a typical day at is you come in eat breakfast put your things in the locker area and clock in go striaght to your station and begin your task the hardest part of my job was adjust to different work areas after i already got use to working in my main station
good,"My boss was a bully. She ran the department like a mean girl's club.  She was eventually demoted, but not before I left. "
good,"No work-life balance. You finish work at 10pm most of the time, you get home at 10:30pm. The only thing you wanna do is sleep! No time to enjoy with family/husband...it's rare to get the morning shifts. "
good,"Worked in beauty and found policies inconsistent based on how well liked you were by management. Some employees allowed to advance jobs/positions at any time, while others were told they needed to be in current position 3-6 months. Certain employees written up for issues like timekeeping or not meeting sales goals, while others were given a pass. Management largly underqualified and not proficient at coaching/communicating with employees. Lots of threats about losing your job and not much encouragement or inspiration from those in management. HR department not very helpful fielding complaints. Salary plus commission and benefits for full timers was good, but no extended vacation time possible ( like a week straight) because always some sale or event preventing approval. Also online sales fulfillment began to take priority over ""brick and mortar"" employees."
good,The company was a pleasure to work for but ultimately they care more about there clients then they do about their employees making it hard to want to stay.
good,Nordstrom is a high fashion environment that works hard to prove good customer service. If you don't reflect those values your won't grow your career here. It does work well for college students who needs flexible schedules
good,"A day in the life at Nordstrom used to consist of coming in, checking your e-mails and doing CCTV and floor surveillance, the company decided to completely shift the Loss Prevention program and move towards a uniformed guard position. The company only offered 4 pay scales and little to no room for advancement."
good,"if you are in any sort of management position...prepare to have no time to yourself. Be promised overtime pay, but then be told that you cannot have overtime hours."
good,"Nordstrom is truly a place where one can learn and experience the varying aspects to Retail. "
good,As a retail management intern they will work you to the bone in the stores. Also to reach corporate level you have to work store floor first even if you are qualified with a degree.
good,"a typical day at Nordstrom means being on your feet for 8 hours, restocking departments, opening accounts, and excellent customer service. the mangers varied from department to department but for the most part they were good mangers."
good,"I enjoyed working for a company like Nordstrom that truly cares about the customer and is so inviting and welcoming to people of all walks of life. With that comes lack of appreciation for the people who help keep the lights on...the employees. In particular, within the cosmetic department. Pay was decent and discounts were great, but they do not appreciate the employees that work the hardest. I was there for a little over a year and busted my tail in sales and customer relations and I was still slighted on multiple occasions when it came to promotions. They do not promote within and when they do they go for the weakest link to prevent management from being superseded. They definitely show favoritism to certain people and certain brands and they will fire you on the spot if you leave to go to a competing company. Maybe they should appreciate people while they are there and they won’t leave. I’ve seen this be a pattern for them before I came and after I left."
good,You will learn a lot by working with company if you are invested.  It is fast-paced and really competitive.  You won't get attention for being mediocre.
good,Manager was unfair and couldn’t work with me with my scheduling. The hourly pay wasn’t the best and they want more out of me and didn’t want to pay fair.
good,You will learn a lot by working with company if you are invested.  It is fast-paced and really competitive.  You won't get attention for being mediocre.
good,Manager was unfair and couldn’t work with me with my scheduling. The hourly pay wasn’t the best and they want more out of me and didn’t want to pay fair.
good,management is focused on a few people instead of the entire staff and shows favoritism towards certain individuals. I was salary employee and helped with multiple out of state restaurant openings which caused the training staff to be there 7 days a week open till close. working at least 70 plus hours a week and not getting compensated for any overtime at all. if I'm working I would like to get paid for it.
good,"I can't recommend a job at Nordstrom to just any one of my friends who may be looking for a job. It takes someone who is willing to compete against their peers while being able to maintain strong team cohesiveness. The successful associate needs a strong amount of social intelligence, social finesse, cultural sensitivity, and the ability to provide VIP service. You need to be able to multi-task selling on the sales floor, selling in the fitting room with the customer, ongoing go-backs, on-going floor upkeep, on-going stockroom upkeep, late evening closing and early morning opening. You need to have a polished, professional quality while maintaining authenticity and approachability, making yourself relatable to clients while being assertive enough to tell them your honest opinions. There is no base pay, only a commission structure with a guaranteed hourly rate that is on the low side. I've never had to use my guaranteed hourly rate. Expectations are high, on both the customer side and on the management side. You will grow a lot. You will make more money than any other retail job. But if you can't handle stress or competition, this job is not for you. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you've made someone's day by virtue of your understanding of their needs and by lifting up their spirits. The hardest part of the job is the commission structure which pits associates against each other and often leads to disagreements about whose customer it was. Another hard part of the job is the pain in the feet after standing for 8 hours."
good,"As a whole, I enjoyed selling fine jewelry and working in this beautiful store.  I began as a sales associate and was promoted to manager. We were extremely understaffed, and often I worked more than 7 days straight.  Many of the people were wonderful that I worked with, but retail is very competitive and at times produces a non-supportive atmosphere."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew."
good,my co workers were nice and hard working big team players I learned a lot about wine and different foods. The best part about my job was that I met new people everyday and learned something new.
good,"A typical day at my former retail employer."
good,"I was a seasonal employee therefore we worked full-speed which I enjoy. What comes to mind first when you think about Nordstorms? Customer service, customer service was the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"make repairs as needed , fix store equipment ,paint drywall and plastering, performed a variety of task including heating and air condition repair. preventive maintence on all store equipment"
good,I enjoyed the work environment but the pay was less that an livable compensation.
good,"in 4 months I was able to learn the Menu but after I learned it, there was chance of creativity or advancement."
good,I found my experience at Nordstrom to be amazing and heart breaking all at the same time. I thought I would work there forever but the culture and overall values I felt were lacking. Great sales training.
good,"styling, and merchandising all day, equals a wounder day at the office."
good,"I came to the company with the expectation of making money and being promoted. there is very little communication between HR and MGT, leaving a lot of unanswered questions. not a lot of room for growth and the salary could be better."
good,"My time was fun I enjoyed my coworkers who I worked with in Web Fufiller, Stock Team, I felt like we created a team environment and got our job done in a manageable time consistently, it was fun."
good,"I enjoyed working at Nordstrom, however it's a competitive place because you make commission. If you are up for that then go for it. Also, you cant really work part time there since it is commission based."
good,"Some politics,,,  not new for any company but sounds unfair who work really hard. Its a good place to work considering the discount and some good quality clothes."
good,"If you were not in the managers click you were treated badly. "
good,Good place to work while going to college but doesn’t pay very well to support family. Some employees are great to work with while others are difficult.
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to learn and grow as a salesperson. However, management and other employees can drastically affect quality of work and commission earned. “Veterans” will try to take your sales so you have to be ruthless, especially if you’re new, and that can add some tension to the work environment. Some department managers are extremely childish, unprofessional, and rude to employees."
good,"I worked at Nordstrom in Elizabethtown, PA but I worked for a agency and the benefit package was not offered, but it was a very nice place to work from I saw."
good,Never have I worked somewhere that cared so little about the hard work you put into it. They care very little about all the positive things that you do to help the store to take care of it and keep it clean and presentable. Management is never happy. No matter how hard you try to help or make them happy it doesnt change. Nothing it good enough. The turn over rate is higher than it should be. Honestly no one is happy there.
good,I only worked there a short time and I was very young. I think there is room for advancement but it wasn't the job/career I was looking for. I had fun learned how to help customers find outfits for certain occasions and things like that.
good,"Great discount, always know when sales are coming. Good management and always flexible, willing to work with my schedule. Fun employees and work culture."
good,Working at Nordstrom is fantastic. I would highly recommend it. The leadership training is fantastic.  Working on a team is critical. Each day bring new challenges and opportunities.
good,"Worked as overnight cleaner and my shifts started from 2am-10am. Job consisted of vacuuming, sweeping, cleaning mirrors, dusting, bathrooms, etc... Lots of non stop work except on breaks. Mostly work alone or with another cleaner. Had to quit because this was originally a side job for me but ended up being too much work with weird hours."
good,"the Norstrom rack I worked at was fairly a fun place to work because all co-work gelled well with one another. However management there wasn't the. greatest and could still be better. I formally work only holiday season at the rack because of college schedule but before getting back in school, I would mainly part time hours."
good,I enjoyed my time working as a sales assocaite with Nordstrom. They provided flexible hours and the management was very helpful during the training process.
good,Not a practical job to live off of. It's very clique-y. Not a lot of room for advancement unless you are personal friends with management. Have to pay back the store if you don't sell enough in a pay period.
good,"Enjoyable staff, horrible management. I learned a lot of new things about retail and also took away some real life skills. I wish I could've stayed longer."
good,"The company is outstanding. Managers and co-workers are fantastic too. However, job hours are extremely less. We feel like we're spending more on commuting and at the end, we're barely left with any savings."
good,Company was very different when I originally started. The level of Customer Service was held to a higher standard then it became all about the money and sales.
good,Had a great time working at Nordstrom but the hours were not so great. The employees are happy and helpful. Many of them have been there for years so that’s amazing for a warehouse.
good,"too much bias and politics involved in working at their Fashion Valley location. Store only interested in making money, not their employees. Time off is limited and not given easily, even for funerals and weddings."
good,"Fast paced environment, always helping clients with what they are looking for. Management is all politics unfortunately. The best part of my job is working with great people for the most part."
good,"Other employees are nice and easy to get along with. Store is clean and kept clean by everyone. 20% discount for employees. Sometimes business is slow, but picks up after quitting time and time goes by fast. Managers are helpful, but don't always abide to those who need days off and those who need hours."
good,"Pay grade varies among department and location, as well as management quality. "
good,A fantastic place to gain experience and great if you want to keep busy. I enjoyed being able to raise my customer service experience by learning how to serve customers the 'Nordstrom way'. The point of sale system was also a challege but now that I know how to navigate many others. The culture was a little more cut throat for entry level people. They do make you take your work outside sometimes in keeping up with customers. I was asked to skip school classes in order to take more shifts. They are focused on you keeping up personal numbers so there is room for growth and advancement.
good,"If you want to work for the company go to full line and really pay attention to the training you receive. When i started with the company i was absolutely in love. As i moved ""down the pyramid""  i  saw how selfish the company was. Most store mangers  (not all) cared about who they liked most and not above who was making months. A manager who made every month and was a constant cash call winner would receive constant opportunities and one who could not improve business was promoted and received praise."
good,Favoritism plays a huge part in where you end up in the company as far as advancement. People get singled out and pushed out of a job without being fired. Hours are a struggle. Manager to team communication is awful.
good,"its a great environment; however, the breaks are ridiculously short and you never know what you work until 3:00 the day before. Schedules are ALWAYS changing, it's rough when you have kids that have to be somewhere at a certain time!"
good,"Nordstrom is a fun place to work and you can get good experience along the way. It can also suck you dry both financially and physically as seemingly everyone feels they need to be as hip as they can be and wear the newest and greatest stuff regardless of the cost and/or whether the associate can afford it. It also called for most weekends, evenings, holidays and in my case working between 60 to 70 hours a week."
good,"Lots of work, need to learn departments quickly and on your own. Barely any hours given not worth the hassle. Good only for seasonal and not long term."
good,"Good friends to work with. Managers ok. they have a high turn over."
good,"Was lots of drama, associates fighting over sales and always changing policies to keep employees happy. A very young mangement staff. I am now  finished with my  2 weeks notice and am unemployed."
good,"I love helping women and men alike feel better about themselves everyday.  I don't just sell make-up, it's about seeing beyond the product and seeing the need in the client that is deeper than just buying a mascara."
good,Great job just looking for more oppurtunities and advancement where my skills will be valuable
good,"The hours are crazy but they are flexible when you have the right manager, the benefits are the cons you only get them if you work 130 hrs every month"
good,"A typical work day is like meeting new people, fulfilling new goals for myself, my department and then for the company. It is challenging and fun at the same time. Nice co-workers, different backgrounds. At some points I need to spend more time to solve an issue with an online orders and relocate them."
good,Its a great place to make quick money and build a great customer base.
good,Great establishment to use your competitive skills for increasing
good,"Come in greet everyone ,i just love to work ,i have great work ethic.Working at lowes has really gave me the experience to learn about things i just never knew."
good,it's good company to work for it could stand to be more fair about promoting within. Nordstrom is a solid company and I wouldn't mind working for them again in the future.
good,"Very chill workplace "
good,"Working for Nordstrom has been an experience of an lifetime. I’ve learned a lot , grown a lot & was able to associate myself & build an strong relationship between customers ."
good,"solid pay, retail scheduling, Commission based job, some days are slow but holiday and summer sale very busy, coworkers are a delight to work with, managers get shuffled around pretty frequently,"
good,"•Responsible for opening and closing store while on duty; holds building alarm passcode Document incidents, investigative updates, Quest Awards and thefts into APIS."
good,"Honestly show up, do the work and go home. Trying to make friends wasn’t really worth it in the end. You might find a few special ones but the management tends to be a little too faced and 100% plays favorites. I would say the pay and benefits for retail is really quite good and you can’t beat the deals you get there. Honestly the only reason I stayed for so long was for cheap handbags, shoes and clothing!"
good,At Nordstrom you have to make a certain amount of money or not you get talked to. it was difficult to make money at Escondido because its a very slow mall
good,Working at Nordstrom was an experience. You meet all sorts of people and build relationships. The company has a pep rally every morning to keep workers motivated and has some kind of special activity weather it be a sales party or sales competition among departments monthly. The pay can be up and down due to returns but all in all I would encourage anyone to apply for the experience alone.
good,Have open  availability.. learn every department be ready to open rewards. Get to know everyone in management. Go to work on time and push yourself to learn.
good,"A very congenial work environment; however, the unrealistic sales goals creates an atmosphere of sharks circling for the kill. Some employees would literally stalk customers within the department; the company puts a good deal of pressure on employees to increase their productivity (sales per hour). Salespeople compete with the inter"
good,"The management was terrible. They talked to you like you were a child. On slow days, they would send you home after a hour of being there. they dont care about doctors note."
good,"Great opportunity for advancement. Poor management wears down on employees and burn out happens quickly. Too many meetings, not enough work being done."
good,Manager said I was going to stay on the team but ended up getting less than a 2 week notice that I was being laid off and didn't receive enough time to find a job replacement for myself. They were also interviewing people for my position right in front of me on my last day at the job. Everyone there was a shark and wouldn't be kind to newcomers
good,"My position was commission based-selling. This incentivize you to sell as much as you can. However, it is difficult when customers are lacking. However, you do get the opportunity to be immersed in the forefront of fashion and be creative with helping a customer create an outfit. It’s very empowering to help someone and provide them with the confidence that looking and feeling good provides."
good,"Sales goals can seem daunting during slower seasons, and if commission is missed too often, you can get written up. Management picks favorites and if you're any bit different than Nordstrom culture, it feels very high school to be employed at a store. The company overall has great learning opportunities for employees and has great morale."
good,If you don’t have a clientele you won’t make it far A lot of the sales are based on  be backs!  If you have that then you should be OK!  My manager was OK but others were not
good,"this is a great job for a college student, but as a grown person with bills to pay this is job is kind of a head ache. the company pays you on the 4th and the 19th of every month, but if these days fall on a weekend or a holiday you will be screwed."
good,"individual work with minimal collaboration"
good,"This was a good company that took me in and helped me a lot. "
good,"Nordstrom is a very eccentric place to work. I personally did not work directly for Nordstrom. Therefore, I can only speak of my experience at a third party representative company I worked for."
good,"When I first started working there it was great experience to be apart of such a big professional company. But over time my feelings started to diminish for the job after dealing with unruly management, and very negative co workers."
good,From my experience at Nordstrom I am able to work with and get along with any type of individual from any walk of life.  I've learned the importance of being a self motivator and a self starter.  It has definitely given me the opportunity to be responsible for taking ownership of my own business.
good,"Although it's a commission based job, a minimum wage is paid if quotas aren't met. For me, this never occurred. "
good,"you are over worked never enuff workers, managment was not professional, in the begining i loved it but once the store got new maneagement things went left, its a non-union job so they make rules up as they go,  they pay you for all you work but I found it to be very overwhelming and over worked alot"
good,"It is a fun place to work, if the management is good. The first managers I had (store, department, and assistant department managers) were fantastic! They all cared about the team. All three of my managers changed to different people. The new managers were very poor, and many people left the store. I have heard that currently, all of the workers are new because people do not want to stay at that store. The company is okay, the product is nice, and the people were fun. Environment with the first managers I had was team focused, about having fun, and helping the customers enjoy their time at the store. And unless you are a manager, you WILL NOT be getting a full 40 hours. Only 3 people I knew of at my store were pulling full hours, and they had all been there more than 5 years."
good,"processing merchadise, making sure you're bein productive, and detail oriented. Responsible for shipment orders, tags, and security tags. hardest part of the job the seasons"
good,"It  was  an  ok work  environment,  yet  it  can  be  a  much  more genuine  place  of  acceptance. However not all people are the same, nor will they treat you the same, so i still like the store, just not for me to work."
good,"The pay was good, but the job was very difficult for being a one agent store. Management in the department had a high turnover rate. The clientele was very diverse and very challenging to deal with at times."
good,"A job Suitable for people who like to help but keep things from you and give you the run around to take advantage for personal recognition. The cafe's management is ok but didn't cooperate as needed for me being a expediter. The culture of the place is average. I learned to not trust even more then I already have, do to favoritism and inconsistency of communication. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with every order plus making sure every plate, garnish, and tickets are managed properly. This is only if its super busy. If you love to work around food give it a try that's the most enjoyable part of the job learning new foods, herbs and spices."
good,Every morning when I was scheduled we would have these rally that would pump up the sales teams.  If was fun cause they would raffle prizes and do fun games to earn points and discounts.
good,"Near holidays no work/life balance. Management did not communicate schedule changes, business goals, department needs. Wages were above average and received multiple pay increases."
good,"managing a team was great. some really talented people answering phones & taking care of customers. "
good,"The department I worked in had a great manager, so I enjoyed my work experience most of the time. We were commission based which definitely created a competitive nature amongst the team."
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for and depending on your location there are many opportunities to climb up the chain. The work is very fast paced and will cut into your personal life.
good,good team in both front and back of house. decent pay and beanfeasts and offer a discount. fast paced stress filled but awesome team helped pull through busy times.
good,"The store used to be on its A game and management was awesome, until within the past year... There's been a ton of management changes and not for the better. Most of the department and store managers have become disconnected from the Nordstrom way and don't listen to their team members concerns. Human resources has become part of the selling force and does not stand nuetral, so it has created a loy of issues within the store. The associates have no one to go to with issues and the product selection is lack luster."
good,Terrible hours and extened shifts during peak periods. Low pay for work demand an load. Good experience overall but not a long term job prospect. Good company philosophy .
good,"Nordstrom is a decent place to work. They do fairly compensate you for what you do. BUT, you have no life outside of work. You are giving next to no warning when you go onto overtime, and they aren't usually willing to work with you to give you time off. If you have a family and like to hand out with them, this may not be the place for you. I no longer have the drive to move forward in this company. I was denied for no good reason."
good,"Una Cía. sin liderazgo cada empleado hacia lo que que pensaba estaba bien. Aprendi a tratar ese tipo de clientela Gerencia solo se enfocaba en tener ventas por catalogo asi quita empleados, no paga seguros medico ni dental afortunadamente los empleados nos llevamos bien apoyandonos unos a otros sin envidias. Lo mas dificil cuando llegara un empleado nuevo. Qué un empleado de las gracias por el apoyo recibido"
good,"Unfortunately, I ended up with a new and very poor manager or I may not have left my job at Nordstrom. I loved selling dresses to women. I love working with people."
good,"I worked in office and then worked at home. Been there 6 years. The first few years were great! Supervisors cared about you and your goals. The last year and a half has been the worst of my working career.  NON STOP system changes and new team leads often, who don't actually care about you, just your numbers. Everything is so negative and micromanaged. It's so stressful and I cry before work daily. They randomly fired 103 customer Care and then let go some very senior roles outside CS to save money. Everyone had to get a brand new shift, even after having the same one for years, whether the new one fit your schedule or not. Now constantly understaffed so working non stop contacts"
good,"Free samples."
good,I worked as a stock team member. I really enjoyed being able to work at my own pace and organize merchandise in the proper departments. The discounts were a perk.
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom is stressful. Having to make sure you make enough sales not matter the store volume. You are required to sign up customers for a Nordstorm credit card. If you are not able to meet those guidelines you will not succeed with this company. You will need to have personal drive."
good,I didnt agree with the $9 pay rate for such a well known upscale company. With Commission comes greed. Girl steal your sales and nothing can be done. Working with women comes gossip so beware!
good,"Friendly environment to work in until it gets too competitive. Management pushes that one needs to ""make more money,"" but all they really mean is to sell more for them. This is despite the fact that customers are being helped by others - and that really is the main goal, right? This job can be extremely rewarding though as long as you have the energy and push to drive sales. Nordstrom is also known for customer service so if you are eager to do all you can for others, this is the job for you! Management and competitiveness will vary per location and department so you cannot expect one store to be at all similar to another. Scheduling is also very difficult, so make sure the department you are interviewing for actually has the full time hours to give you."
good,"While I was working at the Nordstrom Rack, I would be called almost daily on my days off to go into work. I would give them my school schedule and they would ask me not to go to school."
good,Great place to learn solid customer service and sales experience you can always use in other fields.  Only problem is when sales go down the pressure to sell sell sell or be let go is real.
good,"Work life balance was good, nothing more than 40 hours a week.  The management was a little lacking showing favoritism towards certain employees.  Also was concerned because over the past couple of years the overall food quality has changed"
good,"a good place to learn about the ins and outs of the restaurant business."
good,"Wonderful company full of diversity.  Benefits easily surpass most retail jobs.  "
good,I worked here as a temp and the managers weren't very nice I immediately started to look for more jobs. They spoke in a very condescending tone and didn't really care that much about your availability
good,"No comment on this job. answering calls for catalog orders, interesting but nothing I could do for over a year.I did not appreciate staff listening in on your calls to make sure you were trying to upsale or say the right thing."
good,"Great internship, learned so much about retail management and how this is NOT where I want to be. It is very difficult to get promoted out of the store level."
good,I loved selling petite clothing.I had a great relationship with customers.The selection of clothing was a really nice line.
good,I liked Nordstroms due to the education and creativity that it offered me.t also taught me that customers were very important and had to be. All the education was offered from an employee that worked in Brass Plum. She even had her own register due to large sales. I think every young person should be trained by Norstroms. I like the companys strong work values and good customer service.
good,"Nordstrom Warehouse Upper Marlboro Maryland"
good,enjoyed working in this company. learned a lot information from makeup to clients.
good,If you love fashion great place to work. If you want a career in fashion this place is a good steeping stone in the right place
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work for. The people they hire are very enthusiastic about their job. Which makes it enjoyable to work.
good,"A typical day at work  includes: greeting customers, running back in forth between sales floor and inventory room to grab sales items and bring to customer, ringing up customers for purchases, taking returns, working to adjust displays, organizing stock room, calling and emailing customers.  I learned how to treat customers, create a good work environment and present myself in a professional manner. Management handles the opportunities of workers on sales floor. Co-workers are friendly. The hardest part of the job is going in everyday and consistently making your selling goal, which is not a difficult task to a good salesperson, in a well marketed store location that has a variety of expensive and somewhat moderate items. Most enjoyable part of the job is making better numbers then people whom have been there longer than you."
good,"The culture, and environment is very ""Dog eat dog"". Its mostly commission based, and management can sometimes be unrealistic."
good,Working at a retail store can be fun and stressful and fun at the same time. This place has great employees and they all help everybody else to help ease the stress that a retail store can bring at times.
good,"Assist customers with sales, returns and other transactions. Greet customers in a timely, professional and engaging manner. Open new Nordstrom Fashion Rewards accounts as a means of building customer relationships."
good,"everything starts at the top and follows all the way to bottom of the chain."
good,"Working closely with customers daily to retain and foster assigned account.  Training,coaching and inspiring counter team members"
good,"No matter what time my shift started, my day would start the same and that is doing my daily stock assignment that the management team delegated for each sales associate to complete. Once I was done with that I was allowed to go out on the sales floor and start selling for the day. I always went by our five point standard. After about four hours into the day we would be given an hour lunch break. After our break it would be back to selling. What I learned was that commission base environment is very competitive, challenging and it can be fun. Management was challenging at first for me to adjust to. This was the second Nordstrom location that I worked at. It was very much different to what I was use to, but I adjusted and became comfortable with their management style. Even though the environment was competitive, my co-workers were terrific to work with. Everyone was very helpful to each other no matter the issue. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to working in commission. It was my first time in this working structure but after a few customers I became more comfortable. What I enjoyed most about this job was growing the relationships with customers. When customers would come back in to see me, I know I did my job."
good,Great overall culture and the standards are there but stronger management is needed to embody their philosophies.
good,"Every day was basically the same as far as selling shoes to customers and figuring out what the best fit was for them. I learned I do not like selling shoes or working on commission-only based pay. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistent pay and the returns amount came out of our paychecks for the next week. Management was comprised of people who were not good sales associates. My co-workers were fantastic and goal-oriented. The most enjoyable part of the job was I had to learn how make the most of every day, especially when sales were low."
good,I Love Working At Nordstrom!!! I enjoy the store rallies and I a have a great store manger. It is a great place to work.
good,"Good job for Loss Prevention, internal and external investigations, shoplift apprehension and goal is to lower shrink"
good,A lot of lay off period and extremely early overtime last minute notices. Almost flexible schedule rotating breaks. All standing job. Safety is taken seriously.
good,"If you want to be a part of the industry in any way, Nordstrom is a great environment to work in. However, the work life balance was slim to none. Management good, but could be more understanding on slow days when you're expected to pull customers out of thin air. Also, very high profile;e customers, so I recommend a thick skin or working behind the scenes if that fits you better!"
good,"it was a new store, poor communication, rude employees. the hours where great though. it had great benefits, it's a beautiful store. might be nice to shop there"
good,It was an interesting work environment they have exceptional quality merchandise they have a great reputation and it was interesting and stimulating to interact with various customers.
good,"Was a great company to work for,  the supervisors are nice and friendly. And are always willing to help. The management are warm and welcoming as well."
good,"A typically day at work can be very slow, depending on the day of the week and the amount of traffic coming into the store."
good,"Working in the packing department each day was pretty typical, the routine didn't change much. I would say it's a good place for college students to work on school breaks."
good,"A lot of bureaucracy. Some store are better than others, good ones run amazingly, bad ones are like a mean girls club. A lot of pressure on selling and on employees buying goods."
good,It was a fun learning experience and I learn a lot about customer service and being patient and always putting the customers first. I learned how to make a business relationship with the customer
good,"good place to work, lots of new faces room to advance career the work life  balance is great we have a nice break room and clean facility. its hard to find a job that will pay an treat you good like nordstrom."
good,Awesome place to work when manager cooperates. Different managers will run departments differently. Great opportunity to make money. 15 min. breaks in between lunch breaks and discounts at the Nordstrom Restaurant and e-bar.
good,"I love Nordstrom! Ask 15 year old me what my dream job was and I would have said that it’s to work at Nordstrom. As someone who has worked at the Thousand Oaks location AND Pittsburgh, your experience as an employee strongly depends on management. As brick and mortar retail is declining, Nordstrom perseveres. Sadly, it just isn’t doing enough. Nordstrom employees are sadly still only receiving either their commission or their hourly rate. The commission rates are outdated. As someone who has worked both upstairs and downstairs, the commission rates in women’s apparel is shockingly low. It’s very difficult to be expected to sell $20,000 for a mere 6.75% commission l. For those of us who live over an hour away and commute, ithe pay is unsustainable. Downstairs the employees make anywhere from 9-10% commission.  Departments like BP, Savvy, POV and Collectors strongly need a higher commission arate. Or at least their hourly rate PLUS commission. The work yo pay ratio is unbalanced. Otherwise, Nordstrom is a great company with tons of growth opportunities and the customers are fairly nice."
good,"Commission based must have strong selling skills, good customer service skills , be able to deal with stressful situations . Must be able to work every holiday"
good,"Good company too work at I loved the 3rd shift job would definitely work there again if I ever moved back to iowa, just wish the job wasn't seasonal or it be the best job I've had"
good,Good company to work for. Lots of departments to choose from. Lot's of turnover due to seasonal hiring. Great management and they help to mold new employee
good,Hated Working A Various Times Of The Day Need Something More Steady. I Don’t Feel The Job Pays Enough For The Work Done...............................
good,"I enjoy working here because there is no limit to your success in terms of sales.  The higher you move in terms of management, however decreases your chances of being able to sell.  The most enjoyable part of my job, aside from giving the customer a great experience, is coaching and developing a team.  I have learned a lot during my time here including: merchandising, inventory control, analyzing reporting and style-flexing with a variety of different employees."
good,"I worked there in the Nordstrom glory days.  It was very busy so you made a lot of money.  Also the benefits were amazing, which they have cut down drastically.  Also when I worked there 20 years ago they paid more hourly then than they do now.  Every time I shop there I am sad to see that they lost so much of their customer appeal."
good,"Store was competitive in the wrong ways, no work life balance but the money was good. Very hard to advance without support or guidance. Not enough research done into the Canadian market"
good,"Expect to have no life during holidays and the summer for their sales. Pay is decent, supervisors dont care about skills it's more about who you know."
good,At Nordstrom most Sales Associates are hired on a 100 percent commission based salary. I worked at Top Shop/Brass Plum and a regular shift normally would have about seven sales associates on the floor. On the weekends for the location that I worked in it could be ten at one time and the taper through the end of the day. So knowing product and making a strong connection with your customer can be the most lucrative key to meeting your daily sales goals and making sure that you make a suitable wage to live off of. Either you work there for a long time and create a strong personal shopper network or you move on.
good,"The further away you get from company HQ, the less company values and policy are followed."
good,it was ok at first wanted more after being there for a year. it’s easy work. the people is what make the job annoying. it’s a lot of high school drama
good,"This is a great job for students. i do not want to write a minimum of one hundred and fifty characters, because it is not worth talking up or down about nordstrom rack."
good,it was ok at first wanted more after being there for a year. it’s easy work. the people is what make the job annoying. it’s a lot of high school drama
good,"This is a great job for students. i do not want to write a minimum of one hundred and fifty characters, because it is not worth talking up or down about nordstrom rack."
good,"I did fulfillment or whatever. "
good,"A decent place to work, depending which department you're in. Also a clean atmosphere. Management has a great impact on the team, my first manager was amazing, we then had a change and everything starting going down hill from there. It was more of favoritism, than being recognized for actual hard work going into your daily tasks. I did try a few times to move up into management positions, because I know I was over qualified for the position I was in, but it was never recognized."
good,"I worked at the E-Bar fro nordstrom for three months for the season while I enjoyed my time here and learned a lot I was fired at the end of the season with the reason for my termination being that I hadn't learned enough. I was later told by a different member of management that the assistant manager took every opportunity to find reasons to fire me because she didn't like me as a person. Atmosphere during the shift depends on who's leading the team very much like high school where only the ""best"" get noticed."
good,enjoyed the people I worked with as well as the store. they do a lot of work into customer service and it feels good to work for a company that cares so much about their clients.
good,Nordstrom is not a bad company to work for you get a 20% discount and commission plus base pay and at Nordstrom you take a Manager in training program however the coworkers are not all to friendly there however at the rack I worked at it was more of a family everyone got alone had a great store manager that would work in customer service if the lines were long had a great department manager and they really worked with to halve out work and regular life rather it be school of family benefits as in insurance isn’t worth what you pay Howe after working there for almost a month you get your 401k package and you get pto once you have accumulated 1000 hours as well as a pay raise so how much you work makes a pay difference once you work 600 hours you get holiday so regardless if you work that holiday or not your going to get paid and if you work the holiday you get time in a half and your holiday pay you come in making what minimum wage is and if it goes up so does your pay per hour so over all pay wise it’s a great company you just have to find the right store and or location that makes you fell like this isn’t work because it can be a lot of fun you also get a chance to be in the pride parade and other things as well
good,"Overall my time at Nordstrom was increadiable, I very much enjoyed working for a family owned company.  But at the end of the day it's still retail, often times with all the Nordstrom events along with specific vendor events there is no good time to take any time off. Forget about having a summer vacation during mid June through all of July due to their Anniversary sale.  It's their biggest sale of the year, so no summer time spending with your family, children & friends.  Which is why I ultimately left, I was tired of choosing between family functions or literally bartering to get a specific weeekend off."
good,"It's been a good job for the last few years, but there's nowhere to move up. If you're looking for a paycheck until you find something else, this is good. The company is presently going through a restructure and it's not looking promising for anyone looking to climb the corporate ladder."
good,Nordstrom taught me how to become a better manager and the ability to learn great skills for any work environment. I was able to hone in on my customer service skill set as well.
good,"If you don’t have strong retail experience, you will not do well in this store. It is very high-end and competitive. You do have a lot of freedom depending on your department, but are expected to perform very well at all times"
good,Nordstrom was a great working environment in reference to individuals who enjoy retail and having flexibility in this industry. You're your own mini boss.
good,"Days vary, some days are slow, while others, such as weekends, are busy. The good thing about working for a company like Nordstrom, is customer loyalty from returning customers who appreciate the service and products they get from Nordstrom."
good,"store opens earlier than the mall and always closes at least 25 min after the mall."
good,"Nordstrom is a wonderful company, that is very supportive of its employees. It is a fun place to work. However, there was very limited growth potential once reaching a certain level."
good,"Commission sales were extremely tight.  Instead of being able to count on your team members, they were always looking to some how get your sales behind your back."
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with and would recommend it to other people. The hardest part was not being able to help every customer find exactly what they were looking for.
good,"From sales associate to management to Human Resource Generalist, Nordstrom is a productive, fun, fast-paced work environment, focused on delivering what they are best known for - their exceptional customer service - as well as staying abreast of the latest and greatest fashion/trends."
good,"Nordstrom is a good place to work if you arein the fashion industry in the Seattle area. They have good benefits package and some of the teams are fun to work with,"
good,"Again, what is the point of being forced to write reviews to post a job application.  I would like to write a review about Indeeds process and forced labor."
good,"If you like working with people, here is the place for you. I work in shoes, and was forced to talk to mostly rude customers all day. A lot of drama and bickering within departments."
good,"Management does not respect your time off from work.  Must be mobile, if you're in your position, in management, for more than a year, you are considered seasoned and have to move to another location."
good,Great place to work as a college student. Lots of opportunities given. Treat your managers with respect and they will treat you right. Try to enjoy the moment and don't stress your daily jobs.
good,"very fast paced, very little training, super rude customers but in retail it's one of the best paid. I dealt with a lot of escalated issues and was running around the store all the time."
good,Great people to work with! I worked with many cross-functional teams and all were great to work with. There's a very collaborative environment at Nordstrom.
good,"If you are able to work flexible hours and enjoy sales, this would be a great place to work.  The company has a good culture for a retail company. The schedule changed week to week."
good,It's a decent paying job but if you don't plan on sticking around it can be kind of a cut-throat job. Management definitley picks favorites. If you're looking to just have a source of income I say keep your head down and just work.
good,"- There is potential to make a lot of money but you have to but in a lot of effort to so"
good,"Co-workers are great and work hard. Challenges with team management and inconsistent direction. Open workplace does not work - too many people in rooms with no dividers, just desks."
good,I feel that if you get more  people for customer service it would have been a wonderful experience.Although some of the scheduling wasn’t all there I did appreciate my time Working there there
good,Clock in and dive right into customer service as you would greet everybody and assist any customer to a shoe(s) and make sure they get the a great experience.
good,"Very close knit team, enjoyed the staff and other coworkers. Days were repetitive. Put the truck out, size shoes, size the floor. Not much room for learning or to advance in your career."
good,"They offer health and dental but its at a crazy rate. I found out for my health, I had to pay 2k before I could even see a doctor and then they pay 70 percent of the cost after you pay the 2k. Dental I am not too sure about. Trying to get days off is a headache and thats my biggest issue, If you dont care about that, then it is a good place to work. I asked for a week off 3 months in advanced and it got denied. They dont consider your personal life and I have never worked for a company where I can request a week off 3 months in advance and it gets denied."
good,"This company will push you in your abilities to lead.  You have some say in the financial aspect, no part of budget planning.  The Store Manager sets all goals.  If you are motivated enough you can get creative in your role.  The customers are amazing and love to build a connection with you!  The team is good when they feel supported"
good,"This was a fun place to work, management was kind of a let down but the job was fun and flexible. The only thing I hated was the lack of service focus and the huge focus on turning and burning and selling as much as possible when traffic in the store was bad and one or two vets on the floor were hogging clients."
good,"I learned so much from my experience at Nordstrom."
good,"People to work with were friendly and helpful, however management was in ""name"" only and proved to be very lacking in customer service skills and problem resolution skills."
good,"Nice place to work with kind people. Bosses were very serious, but days do go by fast because of how busy it can get. The bistro has a beautiful view, and the food is great. So the food was easy to sell."
good,"The work was constant which provided a seemingly fast day.  When days get busy, or sales are occurring, the management did not balance the schedules to accommodate the craziness.  On the other hand, the starting pay was fair."
good,"A typical day varied based on the season. Each day you can expect a different culture based on the public and clients. Depending on the department you work in you can expect a different type of management. You'll gain many friendships throughout the store. The hardest part of the job is returns because it does put a dent in your commission. The most enjoyable aspect is never knowing who will walk in, there are times professional athletes will come to shop."
good,"a typical day of work consisted of 8 hour shifts, working closely with customers and their needs. Working the cash register and providing great customer service. We also provided each customer with hand written thank you cards and weekly phone calls regarding their shopping experience."
good,"I decided to work at Nordstrom in the Women's Shoe Department during the summer between my college years. There was honestly nothing special about it, except for my former manager who left after a few months after I left. He made me feel comfortable about learning about fashion and customer service and was always there for me when I had trouble."
good,"Must be self driven and goal focoused, able to work well with others in a competitive environment. Sales are tracked by the hour to meet daily goals.."
good,Great company and I have loved working here... there are just a lot of grey zones within the company that as a manager is up to you navigate through and it is tricky.
good,"its very fast paced and competitive. Great way to gain product knowledge and enhance customer service skills. Can be stressful, you are expected to meet/exceed your sales goals."
good,"I loved working at Nordstrom. I enjoyed the products I sold and working with the customers. "
good,"Nordstrom has been good to me as my first job. It provides a 401(K) and health benefits, which is not something I can say for other employers who provide the same kind of pay. Nordstrom is a company I definitely recommend for competitive, driven individuals. If you are looking for a decent base pay, Nordstrom is not for you. I have succeeded working for Nordstrom, but only when I make strictly commission. The very few times I didn't make draw (commission), were the times that my paycheck was barely enough to pay for any bills that I had. So, if you are looking for a mostly stress-free environment, this is not the workplace for you. Making commission is stressful, because when you go home at night or have a day off the next day all you're thinking about is whether or not someone is going to return something on you that day that you're not there. The returns do affect your paychecks, and trust me when I say, they come at high rates. Otherwise, if you are a hardworking, self-motivated individual with the passion to be successful this is the place for you! It has been a great experience for me and I would do it all over again if I could. Just as an FYI, your managers are not allowed to give you a professional reference after you quit, so if you're looking to build those on your resume this is not the company for you."
good,"It is good for a temporary position. The managers and coworkers are awesome though and the company culture is nice! But what they say about you being able to earn a lot of money with ""commission"" is misleading."
good,Management was terrible and refused to work with my school schedule. She would also schedule me on days she knew I was unavailable and refused day off request months in advance.
good,"-Regular retail job"
good,"""I've worked with Nordstrom for over 10 years. They are amazing if you value, hard honest work, giving service, wanting to move up & succeed. Once you start here, this company becomes like family, and you can move on to do whatever is desired within the world of nordstrom. Your current manager will help you achieve what you want. However, don't underestimate the 'hardwork' aspect of this position. They run really fast!"""
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work with a fun environment. Great opportunity to build a clientele for your future sales. Commission based environment.
good,"Although it's a great store, certain departments were disorganized and led to frequent conflicts in a commission environment.  It's pretty much everyone for yourself, which is fine, but causes frequent conflicts with other, less ambitious associates."
good,"Working at Nordstrom Rack was a pleasant experience. My supervisor gave me all the tools I needed to succeed and complete my requirements. I was responsible for organizing merchandise and making sure the store looked clean and presentable to the customers. I also cashed out customers, opened rewards accounts, and worked the fitting room so I spent most of my time with the customers."
good,its a commission job so you can make decent money around the holidays but the managers only care about numbers and not fairness. coworkers will steal your sales with no repercussions. the corporate culture of nordstroms is awesome but the store manager doesn't follow it. The store manager is very rude to everyone but his favorites which get all the promotions and employee recognition. If Corporate MADE SURE that their standards were being followed I literally would rank everything 10/10 but the standards aren't followed in favor of chasing an increase in sales at any cost
good,It was a pretty laid back environment and you were required to do much really. The commission was pretty good and u got paid based upon how hard you worked.
good,"I love working at Nordstrom. The company has a great reputation and carries the best products for this demographic, but as an employee they reevaluate your benefits every six months. So if you don't hit the hour requirements during this six month period you lose benefits for the next six months. I work well over the hour requirements over one half of the year (holiday season) but the other half of the year is a lot slower and hours are harder to come by. I don't like this policy, as it strains on my medical expenses. Also, pay is low, but the job isn't too hard so I guess that makes sense. It's just frustrating to work there for a long time with no recognition and make the same amount of money as some ""newby."" No reward for loyalty to the company, which is probably why there is high turnover. I do love our customers and that is the most rewarding part of the job."
good,"Work quickly. Be productive, show enthusiasm, make every customer feel as they are receiving level 4 service,be vocal about where you want to advance to help push you in the right direction my manager was amazing at that"
good,"Management is not cooperative, nor do they care about their associates as much as the customers. Support sections do not hold any weight and are often overlooked as not needed compared to sales associates."
good,Great place to work at if you are a social person who loves fashion. Had a good time shopping with customers and helping them with there shopping needs. The pay was good. The only thing I didn't like are the random hours which made it hard to balance personal life and job. And how u are on you're feet all day long can get extremely exhausting by the end of a the day..especially during a sale.
good,During sales and holidays it was very busy and made the days go by fast. The coworkers were nice but management was to tough and critical to the point of uncomfortable work environment.
good,I was a Loss Prevention Agent.  A lot of watching the cameras and going out on the floor.  I would work bad hours due to I was just hired on for the new store opening up. Loss Prevention manager was awful but others good.
good,"It is a tough roll when you are attempting to achieve your sales goals and there are more sales people than customers. Managers are focused on making more money, thus selling on the floors instead of developing their team. This is a reflection of managers at Nordstrom whose rolls are so insignificant that they are able to be on the floor selling all day. However, the company is very lenient about taking time off and punctuality. Those who decide to stay and make a career out of retail can make a decent amount."
good,"Good energy, management is helpful. Hardest part of the job is when there is no customer traffic, as our sales have a lot to do with our paychecks. Job growth could be better but it is also very competitive."
good,They are a great company to work for but they do have to work on there pay.. they have level systems and it gets very hard to reach them if you aren't given the hours.
good,Loved the fast hard working always on your toes environment. Getting to set and meet sales goals while chatting with customers makes the day go quick.
good,"Fashion forward company, Learned a lot about fine fragrances. Enjoy the people I work with and the customers. Customer service is their first priority."
good,Your income is determined by your effort. Typically work 5 days a week (close to 40 hours). The internship put me in a better position to run my own department or store someday.
good,commission based  sale a lot great but when customers return items its subtracted from how much you made. you will be fired if you don't reach the mark they give you
good,Great customers and co-workers. Flexible working hours. I learned how to merchandise the floor I learned about the different designers. I enjoyed it..
good,"Typical day is normal, some days are busy and some are not."
good,Glamorous job title however with any workplace full of girls there is bound to be drama. Luckily I have thick skin and am not very sensitive and that is how I made my business thrive going on three years of employment with the company. It's better than most places I could imagine working!
good,"Bad management, most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work and know the customers hardest part of job is commission sales some days can be slow."
good,I really love being empowered to provide amazing customer experiences for customers. Since we received ne management in my department it has been harder to provide outstanding service.
good,"Great place to work, awesome co-workers,  but not great for advancement.  Management definitely plays favorites , they need to focus on associates who have put in the time and work rather than the ones who have 6 months and promote them."
good,"In a typical day at Nordstrom you spend the day tending to customers, helping customers find products for events and occasions. You also problem solve customer, technology, and sales issues."
good,I enjoyed working for Nordstrom. You are required to make daily sales goals as well as reach out to customers. diverse staff. management varies by department. hardest part of the job is meeting sales goals during slow periods. I loved customer interactions the most.
good,"Very demanding of hours 50+"
good,"Love Working for Nordstrom, I love fashion and customer service, same office politics that hinder progress at any workplace."
good,This job as a good part time position which I enjoyed working with my co workers and servicing customers for purchases of store items.  Often time I provided assistance as a personal shopper for special events as they were  occasionally required..
good,"Fun place to work. Great discount, fun interacting with people. commission based. Had to work for sales sometimes, pay would vary. the company has added too many sales in the past year. hard for employees but benefits customers."
good,"Nordstrom is a fast pace upscale store. Working in ""Studio"", I sold high end women's designer clothing and accessories, working on base salary plus 6 3/4% commission. I exceeded my sales goals monthly and was in the ""Top 10"" in the store several times each week."
good,The commission structure was different in every department. Management seemed to be cliqueish at times. My experience was was healthy and competitive. I can understand why someone else wouldn't have seen it as healthy
good,"Fun environment but retail hours are terrible.  The pay on the management level is not great.  Great experience though, with great managers, if you're lucky to get a good one."
good,"A typical day at work consists of merchandizing, up keeping of the department, and selling. "
good,"In my almost two years at Nordstrom the level of customer service you learn and the level of professionalism is like nothing else and it reputation speaks for it. The relationships you get to create with your customers and the service you can offer is truely remarkable. Also the people that work for the company are the best thing that you can hope for in a job. They really are like a family and that is what keeps most employees there at least in my experience. The tricky part about working for this company is that Nordstrom gives its employees and managers the freedom to ""use your best judgment"" reguarding any difficult situation that you come across. That being said, the company gives alot of freedom to management to decide what they think is ok and whats crossing a line so every single manager has a different idea of how things should be. this can make working for managers there incredibly difficult. And because Nordstrom has such an entrepenure spirit about it, there are a ton of bias involved in who moves up and who gets demoted/fired in the company. You can be a top seller and work for the company for years but one day if a manger decides they don't like you anymore they can find a reason to fire you or keep you in your spot so you cant move up and thats it. I've seen it happen numerious times. and HR does nothing to help support the employees, they are there to protect the company that is all. So you have to walk on eggshells pretty often because if you end up getting a power trippy manager or vengeful one you'll be stuck in the same place or out of the job pretty quick."
good,"I am fortunate to be a part of such a unique and reputable company. Nordstrom stands for customer service and that make that clear the first day you join the team. What makes Nordstrom unique is that it truly allows associates on the floor to use their best judgement to resolve issues and ensure the customers leave satisfied. A manager is not required to make most decisions. "
good,"Nordstrom is a wonderful company and I am great full for the work experience. However my experience at the rack was not as great, however it is a true reflection of retail. The hours were inconsistent and low. The non stop fast work pace was great and my co-workers were a great support. Constant interaction with customers was fun I really enjoyed selling and assisting people. It all came down to the hours, the amount of stress and work did not balance with the amount of hours given(25-29) per week."
good,"The overall company is great to work for. However being a sales associate things can get very competitive with people fighting for sales. Very commission driven, I wouldn't go back."
good,"A typical day with the Nordstrom Rack proved to maintain a consistent rhythm of job responsibilities at a fast pace."
good,"As a manager, to be successful, your life is your work and work comes first."
good,"Customer serviced based company which pays commission."
good,Commission based retail sales job with a very good earning potential.
good,I had the opportunity to work with some really fantastic people and build some great relationships.
good,Seeing different fashions and merchandise come through the warehouse
good,Great company must be self motivated to make a good living. work off commission and you must make your sales goals to make a decent living.
good,"I definitely enjoy the people I work with, and the feedback I get from co-workers, with the help that I am able to provide them. A typical day at work consist of many calls from customers from all over the country calling in to ask about their account, or certain events. The day consist of many changes throughout the work week with little time to adjust."
good,"I really enjoy working in Nordstrom Cosmetics.  Dealing with the public and helping them select beauty products that will make them feel good about themselves is the best part of this job.  As a manager, I am responsible for making sure my team is doing this same thing, with a smile on their faces.  The hardest part of this job is that fact that even though I am in management, I have sales quotas to make and am still paid on commission."
good,A very competitive and fast-paced environment but a fun place to work especially during company events.  Customer Service #1 priority.
good,"Nordstrom is good to you if you're a sales person, but somehow even though we're expanding all over, they cut profit sharing 2 out of the last 4 years. Good as a stepping stone, but don't expect to tsay more than 5 years unless you're a really good sales person. "
good,"Acting as a cashier and store operator. a typical day for me was scanning merchandise as people purchased items and excepting money and credit card transactions. Also, unpacking merchandise, scanning it in, and keeping count of all merchandise. My co-workers were very helpful and easy to work with."
good,"Delivered exceptional service receiving and responding to incoming calls from customers and coworkers"
good,"Whenever I tell someone that I work for Nordstrom I typically hear two responses: ""I hear that is a great company to work for"" and ""Do you get a discount?"""
good,"Though customer service is talked about, numbers truly do take significant priority when it comes to job security."
good,"A typical day at work would mean that we would have to get on the phone and convince customers to come in and shop. Nordstrom offers quality merchandise, but business was always slow and the store manager put substantial amount of pressure on department managers. Fifteen minute breaks were never enforced, and department managers didn't care much about them. Importance was coverage on the sales floor and if that meant missing your breaks, then you were out of luck. Commission was very competitive, and the work environment was extremely cutthroat. I learned a lot about catering to customers on an intimate level, and their sales training is off the charts. The co-workers were lovely, made some great friends."
good,Management more focused on accounts and not customer experience as well as establishment appearance...alot of inside employee thefts and unprofessional sexual conduct throughout management.I enjoyed the experience of opening a new establishment and seeing it florish...not very much communication throughout day with different shifts
good,"They ONLY promote from within. Starting as sales associate is sometimes necessary to get your foot in the door. Should you show that you can perform and are professional, you will advance very quickly."
good,"good place to work, great benefits and the pay was decent... work life balace is not so good because you can find yourself working all the time. management was good ant giving hours and giving time off if you needed, as for the company, in my two years of working there, we have been through 3 managers... its easy to get a job at nordstrom but very hard to keep one. managemnt can be very secretive and fire you in a heart beat."
good,"A typical day at work includes greeting customers that come up to my makeup counter, helping them find what they are looking for, giving the best service I can. I also handle cash, do returns, stock, book for events, pre-sell items and teach classes for makeup. I love being around people and enjoy working in a fast paced work environment."
good,A company grounded and consistent with its original policies and values.
good,"Fast paced, learned new computer programs, I had some awesome coworkers, like a new family,The hardest part of the job was the lack of communication between manager and staff."
good,A typical day would be come to work greet customers and help them with whatever they are looking for. The management was good and I really like my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was meeting sales for the day. I enjoyed seeing all the new trends and fashion pieces that we would get in.
good,learning something new and keeping up with the new trend . Colors is fascinating and showing customers the ways of matching things together is a fulfillment by itself . Working with a team that has one goal and on the same page together minimizes mistakes and turn to an at most profit to every one. It gets hard when more than one customer and I had to give each of them a complete attention and respect but makes enjoyable when the customers decide to wait for me till I am done with each customer.
good,Nordstrom has gave me the most opportunity to learn with management and my co-workers. We were a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning different skills within the different departments.
good,"Working at Nordstrom can be both a positive and negative thing. The people there are great and make work a fun and positive experience. It can get very difficult to work here when not selling because hours become limited and base pay is received instead of commission. People either make commission or base pay, whichever is higher. I have had a very pleasant experience working here since I understood and took off with the sales aspect."
good,"Loved the job and wish I could have stayed. They have no training, you learn as you go.  Management picks favorites which seemed to be the guys. I worked in Mens Furnishings after the truck but they did not ask the managers if they liked the job I did."
good,Nordstrom rack was as ordinary as any other retail store with upbeat colleagues and reasonable pricing on clothing to make selling to the customers all the more enjoyable and easy.

good,"Working here was a great experience, I would definitely work for this company again. The pay is great , the hours are great , and the benefits are great ."
good,"- Typical day at work "
good,"I learned a lot and grew a lot working there. Your experience definitely depends on your manager. Also, as is expected with retail, scheduling isn't ideal."
good,Great comp To work have everything I needed it fun and exciting very lovely happy environment great people learning appreciative and inviting loved working there
good,"The pay was decent, the people were nice, the discount was nice and overall the job was easy. They push credit cards like crazy, but nothing unexpected. Overall just boring."
good,Loved working here!  Amazing place and people. Nordstrom is really big on growing and changing workers for the better. One of favorite jobs that I have had so far
good,I like working with the public. The benefits are great and they have a great track to move up in management. I like the discount i get as an employee.
good,"The company focuses a lot on returns and commissioned sales."
good,"With great managers leading their teams, Nordstrom offers a very professional and diverse work environment where if you choose to grow within the company, you will receive all the support necessary in order to achieve your work goals"
good,"Love the environment. Classy and friendly place to work."
good,Overall good experience! Loaction was a set back for me but the hours were flexible. Good benefits for full time employees. Employee discounts were a good perk as well.
good,"processing Merchandise "
good,I met a lot of nice people there. It was fun to work the special events.  I liked what I was doing.  I just needed more hours and money. It was interesting to help people try on different styles of clothing.
good,The regular day to day is busy and fast paced. Workplace culture is pretty accepting but there are difficult people every now and then. I love the discount because we are allowed to use it at Nordstrom rack
good,"Very customer service driven company. Created many great relationships with customers over the years while working for Nordstrom. Learned a great deal about what it is to give excellent customer service in my tenure .  Hardest part about working for the company in my opinion, anniversarying sales from previous sales events."
good,"This job is fast paced, there are always projects to work on and lots of customers to help. Great company to work for and grow with. Must have patience for growth to occur."
good,"I worked here temporarily on a number of nights, merchandising new shipments of clothing with one other team member. It was somewhat behind-the scenes and was relatively relaxing work."
good,Good working environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able  partner with management and create visual cues throughout the store and windows.
good,"I've worked at both the rack and full-line. If youre looking for an enjoyable team experience consider the rack, head for management. If you're looking to make as much green as possible, push through entry level commision if you can and gun it for management as soon as you can. Commission is not for those with responsibilities at least not in the beginning. I hated it but had to do it and still do sometimes! Its part of the process. I loved the rack, loved the family culture, but the money and career outlook just wasn't enough"
good,I was not employed with Nordstrom through indeed. If you have any questions please call me thank you for your time! I will be happy to answer any questions.
good,i learned a lot. Met some cool associates. I enjoyed helping people. I received over 20 customer letters with great reviews. We got on pretty good. Not a real stressful place.
good,Loved this job but was laid off before Xmas which broke my heart n spirit but other than that they were cool and management was very understanding to me
good,"I have been with this company long time.Its a very good company."
good,Not a place of work and my co workers were very nice. The working experience there has helped me improve my skills.The company had a flexible schedule that worked for me.
good,Fun place to work with excellent cross-selling abilities in other departments. Pays decent commission and has room for growth to transfer to Management
good,"The company values almost all other employees over its accounting department. Stuck in an old paper based filing system that hasn't changed in decades because management fears change."
good,"My view on Nordstrom’s it was a nice experience, it was my first time working in stock department. I learned the job quickly , wouldn’t mind working there in the future."
good,"Building clientele through customer relations, fun and exciting place of work, management always on point. I've learned to better communicate with the general public."
good,A typical work day would everyone grouping up at the beginning and doing a specific job after and making sure everyone is on board and gets their task finished.
good,Great company. Managers work with you on any issue that may arise. Management has open door policy. Coworkers are nice and friendly. Hope I can keep moving up.
good,"I do not recommend working here. Unfair management. Do not appreciate hard working people. Have to get too many credit cards to be a ""good"" employee.."
good,"Working for Nordstrom gave me a lot of retail experience as well as enhancing my customer service background. I learned cash room duties while there, as well as building a client base."
good,"I started working at Nordstrom in 2015, It has grown as a company here. Left due to a whole year of lack of work.. but 4 years here was very great. Picking department, you need 580 units by End of day. Which now that 100% of returns come to Nordstrom San Bernardino, its harder to hit your numbers. But it is also duable depending how much work is dropped. This is for picking department. They have company lunches, and recognition meetings, and awards. You can make up to $18.50 per hour here. Depending on your accumilated hours."
good,They will accept most of your schedule request which is nice. Very flexible with hours. Management plays favorites so make sure you’re on the good list.
good,"Great company, great benefits, great culture. Always had fun working at Nordstrom. Great discounts. Benefits are available. You meet many people (co-workers and customers). They promote within the company. Awesome sales training"
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for, have learned a tremendous amount in all aspects from product knowledge in the customers service area."
good,"Nice coworker nice HR"
good,If you are in the right department then you can make a decent career with a 6 figure salary. Management is mature and size keeps things more honest than a boutique environment.
good,"I have acquired much retail experience while working at Nordstrom which definately helped me move on to my Account Executive position with Elemis skincare, UK."
good,Good job just the management at location needs better communication and more opportunities for growth and more hours some people need more training than others still
good,I loved the ability to tailor your attire to your department merchandise to inspire the customer to purchase more. I enjoyed working here and would go back if the position fit better with my lifestyle.
good,"Take care of floor, customers first always. A bit cliquey within departments, you're either in or you're out of the loop noticeably. Decent pay with commission."
good,depends on how you make of it. The people were nice. should go and check out the city. nice to see that they are expanding to other parts of the world and they will be growing even more.
good,"Even though I only worked here during Christmas season, I was trained professionally about the techniques and knowledge to assist the customers best. I was also given the chance to grow more at Nordstrom after my contract ended, and my manager was very helpful and thoughtful to guide me."
good,Pretty fair company with a lot of great people.   Of course there are bad eggs in every business so just steer clear of them and you’ll have no issues
good,"Great place to get experience and the discount definitely helps. "
good,Be ready to work. They hire you for a job and expect you do exceed in it. It’s a great place to work and I loved the accountability I was help to and the standards that I had to uphold.
good,Nordstrom values customers. They don’t open on major holidats like macys. Nordstrom cafe is awesome. I couldn't stand on my feet all day is the only reason i left.
good,I liked my time at Nordstrom. I worked on the sales floor for nearly 10 years and was proud to work there. Felt like a family owned company despite the size. Good ethics.
good,"Commission."
good,"enjoyed my colleagues in the cosmetics department , everyone worked as a team. All of the events while stressful were lots of fun , full of high energy"
good,I worked both full & part time. They were pretty flexible with my schedule when I was in school. It is a good place to start if you want to pursue a career in retail and/or fashion.
good,"Great Benefits, needs to work on life/work balance, job culture, fair and consistent career advancement....I'm a man of few words so now I'm just vamping."
good,"Very few company policies that give it's employees autonomy to make decisions related to customer care, without the fear of repercussions. Employees have to be comfortable with the ambiguity that comes from this."
good,Great place of employment. Mandatory 60 hours overtime was hard. As the start time was 5am - 3pm. Mon-Sat. Benefits were excellent and management was great.
good,"Nordstrom is a good place to work, it taught me how to be eloquent in the way I speak with clients. It also taught me how to cross sell and that helped me a lot with my next career."
good,"A typical day at work was slow at times. Sometimes there were way too many people a shift and the work environment would become very competitive. I did enjoy the discounts and being ""in the know"" when it came to fashion."
good,Helping customers needs to be a passion in this field. Great associates once everyone opens up. I made sure every customer had the best shopping experience while they were in the store. Made sure the customers were served in a professional and diligent manner that'll make them want to keep coming back.
good,"Nordstrom, was the true start of my career in hospitality, I quickly grew in the company starting out as bartender all the way to General Manager.  Nordstrom has a true corporate structure which paved the way for my career to grow and understand how to manage a restaurant though financial platforms.  Showing me hands on the importance of standards and structure in any business and creating a self discipline to assure the maintaining of standards to their highest level."
good,"a great place to start and grow if considering retail as a career, great customer service.If wanting to grow in a management position, a lot of opportunities are available - which is awesome. Great benefits for full time employees, flexible for students as well."
good,Nice working environment and supportive colleagues. enjoyed the working culture.Learned lot of things.Supportive management.Supportive Human Resource.
good,How successful you are depends on how much Management likes you. They did not treat everyone fairly. I say go at your own risk if you think you can handle this environment.
good,Great experience to see if retail is for you. Your experience without a doubt rides on which manager/department you are placed in. Don't intern if you don't have other money to supplement your income.
good,"This write-up is in regards to the Nordstrom Rack. Friendly and fun when employees are praised through verbal recognition or when the store team is given incentives to be motivated and excited about making the day! It's a tough gig to deal with irate customers day in and day out. Everyone knows that. "
good,"Went through the store picking up items from online orders wasn't too difficult. You have to work quick but it's not bad work, pretty chill. Good breaks, decent people, not bad."
good,"I loved the general culture of the company. While I have a blend of positive and negative Nordstrom experiences during my tenure with the company, the positives outweigh and remain as my lasting impression. The Nordstrom family was ever present and their spirit could be felt throughout the organization — especially if you were local to store one (headquarters). The fundamentals of leadership were delivered through the training I received while at Nordstrom and were ever-present in my career outside of Nordstrom."
good,Good place to work if you like standing and bending all day.  Call center is very demanding and micromanaged at the highest levels.  The hours are good.
good,It’s fun to walk over there.Flexible schedule get paid every two weeks.Manages a nice and there’s always an eight hour schedule.You got a lot of stores around DC Maryland and Virginia
good,"Working at Nordstrom taught me the difference of working in a department store than a 1 unit store. I was given more responsibilities from my previous jobs because I was required to open and close registers when previously only managers were allowed to do so. To be honest, I believe in any customer service job the customers are the hardest part of the job, especially if they are unhappy. Although that is something I learned throughout my years in retail to know how to keep calm and know what and what not to say."
good,"I worked here for over a year and I loved it. The pay and hours were great. I learned literally everything from stocks, apparel, accessories, home, cashiering, and how to work in the cash room. The only reason why I left was the store manager. She did not treat her workers good and was very mean girl vibe. I loved all the other managers there and the previous store manager. The recent store manager just made it an environment that nobody wanted to work in because of her. Most of the managers left so we were really understaffed with management and workers on the sales floor."
good,I learned to work with a variety of people in both a fast-paced full-price and off-price retail environment. The culture is friendly and up beat but highly competitive. The hardest part of my job is the rigorous schedule. Merchandising the sales floor and using digital reporting to analysis our business is the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,Sometimes the job could be unfair but the pay is good if you can get the hours. . They have flexible schedules depending on the manager . It’s a good company depending where you are .
good,Working at Nordstrom was a great place to set and meet daily goals as well as challenge yourself in a fast paced diverse environment. A typical day could be very busy and or very slow. The hardest part of the job was the very long hours. The most exciting part was the good salary and benefits as well as the motivation from selling and hitting your goals.
good,"good job to get foot in door for management role. great people, not stressful. company appreciates employees and tries to reward them outside of just pay/overtime with parties and opportunities for discount increases."
good,"Worked there for almost 2 years, met the best people ever and learned A LOT. Fun environment but it’s no place for if you want to move up in the company any more. They change too much constantly and favorites absolutely get played all the time. Coworkers are amazing people, long lasting friendships. You definitely will wear more than one hat working here."
good,"20 years ago this company had similar issues as it does today. Kissing butt gets you furthest. Next to that, it is $'s. The people providing service and services are rock stars. Always go the extra mile. Don't expect so much from the person who hires and fires you. And if you want praise for work well done; get over it."
good,"The job wasn't difficult, it was okay honestly. The only downside is getting paid twice a month. The department I worked, was Picking and truth be told it was mainly walking and scanning and that's all."
good,"Very hard work but fun and you get paid well. Hours suck sometimes, i left because I wanted my weekend back. Great management, but that varies from store to store."
good,"Good  salary, very stressfull, poor management, bad schedule,  don`t provide traning for employees, have great benefits^ medical insurance, discounts for employee"
good,"Overall very liberal work environment. Management is typically understanding. However, the company is restructuring and diverting resources from the store locations to web services."
good,"Nordstrom is a good company, but I only worked as a carpenter building and remodeling the store.  I was not a Nordstrom employee. I have no information regarding a typical work day of a Nordstrom employee."
good,"Relied on tips, some good days and bad days.  Worked with many others which made it fun, but also stressful.  Loved working and meeting new people from the job."
good,It was a pleasure working at Nordstrom. The discounts were great and environment was relaxing. The customers were great and co-workers were a blast to work with.
good,"As a commission based sales associate, it is expected to independently drive your own business through clientelling and being an expert on current trends."
good,My co-op workers were good. The job was fast paced . We were fully trained as a group . We got to move to other departments and learn many different jobs.
good,They provide you with all the tools you need to succeed. Work environment is very dependent on department and coworkers and commissioned pay can increase competition.
good,Great company to work for. Wish all the stores followed the same guidelines for promoting within. The Naples Nordstrom promotes from within but not with quality candidates. Many applicants have not worked on the floor long enough.
good,"This was a seasonal position for me, so I can say that I may not be qualified to do a review of the company. From my experience, it was an okay job, I wouldn't make a career out of it."
good,"They expect you to meet your sales goals, but they make those goals pretty realistic. They encourage cross department selling, but the other employees get kind of aggravated when you do so because you are taking their commission."
good,"Some days could be slow which really hurt paychecks, but overall not a hard work environment. Good coworkers, pay could be better though. Some managers not as good as others."
good,"Providing answer for employees in regards to HR needs "
good,Just have to be ready to work and they will watch you. Crazy hours. 3 to 1pm 6 days a week. Just clixking scanning scanners and moving boxes. Then there are people whk cherry pick which is smart and right to do but people will take advantage.
good,Commission based environment that had very high expectations. What management put out as the values of the company was not supported by high management which lost trust in the employees. Very cliquey environment and promotions looked as though it was favouritism and not earned off of merit. You do have the potential to make a lot of money however sometimes you aren't given the opportunity to.
good,"It was a good working place. Supervisor was great."
good,"So much career stability based on how behind they are with product development techniques. If you have a great manager, this is the best place to work, but if you suddenly get a different manager, the feeling changes quickly."
good,"It was a good working place. Supervisor was great."
good,"So much career stability based on how behind they are with product development techniques. If you have a great manager, this is the best place to work, but if you suddenly get a different manager, the feeling changes quickly."
good,Pretty standard for warehouse work lotta people lotta different job opportunities kind of monotonous but again repetitive warehouse work pay is not too bad
good,"Mad decent but Supply Chain management at  San Bernardino DC Warehouse was run by nice people who hired A-holes. Assisted in high value shipment logistics and security. Assistant to supervisor for opening and closing of department store and process profits and loss reports. Versed in FedEx World, DHL, and UPS kiosks and software. Hazardous goods training and DOT certified."
good,"Customer service was what Nordstrom was known for.  The product training was excellent.  Learning about the Nordstrom culture was my favorite part.  Unfortunately, many things changed during my Nordstom years."
good,All locations are beautiful and presentable and all employees are expected to match the store's appearance. I developed most of my social skills here.
good,You can make all the money you want depending on the department that you work in.  I enjoyed the autonomy to build my business at my own pace.  Management storewide was a bit lacking in my opinion but I had the luxury of working under two GREAT managers in my department.  It was a great place to learn alot about sales and the fashion business.
good,"Working here was one of my firsts jobs, their training program molded me into a great customer service representative as well as strategic sales person."
good,it was okay working a typical day at work was okay i did not see any growth with the company amd the flexibility was not there alot of ppl come and go here
good,Yap its good company to work. But all most all the teams are very small teams. You will get lot of responsibility. And also there no specific teams for testing. Overall Ok to work
good,Great place to start visual career. Creative when involved in windows. Overall very physical job. be prepared to work hard and hustle. Only real advancement is regional or corporate in Seattle.
good,Management is mediocre and does not necessarily hire the best person for the job. You are ignored if you do your job well and all the attention and help is given to the sub par employees.
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work with wonderful positive people.  The best part of the culture at Nordstrom is having the empowerment to make good judgement decisions to take care of your customers to give them the best possible experience.
good,I don't have an applicable opinion of this company because I worked there over a decade ago when I was in high school/college. I do not remember specifics at all.
good,It was a lot of learning to be able to recommend what worked best for each client. sales goals were high for the area and was hard to excel when customers could always return the items.
good,"The people that work at Nordstrom are always very pleasant and knowledgeable. Working her was always great as everyone is so friendly. A,ways something to do, always someone to help."
good,This was a great PT job for my needs at the time.Excellent money for the number of hours I worked. Downside: Mangers tend to be very young and inexperienced and make critical mistakes than a more seasoned person.
good,First time job for students not bad of u need experience in sales. Not full time maybe less than 30 hours a week. Did not care for commission sales. Would rather better pay.
good,"It was a very fast paced environment and could be very stressful at times. Typically it seemed co-workers did not have your back, as everyone was on commission. I would only recommend this position for someone who was very interested in pressing a career in fashion."
good,Consistent hours and decent pay while transitioning between jobs. Management provides solid feedback and recognition is often given to those who perform well.
good,"Since i started 5 years ago there have been significant adjustments to management structure. Managers have 4x the work load since when i started. You can make good money since you're commissioned, but if you have a bad store manager or team, you'll be miserable. HR is poor."
good,"Able to grow with company, driven to always better their store policy and customer services. Great company to start in and build customer service experience."
good,Worked a lot with customers and employees. Fast paced. People are nice. Helped the Personal Styling team and assisted with their sales. Overall good work place.
good,"It's been several years, but I recall being satisfied with the position. The workdays were great and sometimes stressful. I learned a lot about merchandising. The most difficulty I found was in cross departmental sales."
good,"I really liked the employees, and made a lot of friends there."
good,Nordstrom gives you all the tools you need to run your own retail business. The work culture is fantastic and it embraces diversity.  Plus the benefit packages are good.
good,Great new store with great opportunities for growth within the company. The company truly cares about your well-being which is refreshing to say the least.
good,"I was fortunate enough to open the store in 2007.  It has changed a lot in the 11 years that I have worked there, but is still a decent place to work."
good,"Reasonable schedule, job expectations were manageable, inventory is sufficient, the clientele is loyal, nice, clean work environment, because of the policy to hire from within, some managers can be challenging to work with."
good,"I was an intern in the Retail Management program at Tysons Corner. I did learn somethings about management but every intern's experience was different depending on the department you are placed in. Majority of your time you will be on the sales floor, and they expect you to hit the ground running with sales. Commission is hard to earn but if you get the hang of it then its a lot of fun! great experience."
good,"Very very fast-paced work area and friendly work environment. "
good,Very good employees who are fun to be around. Consistent scheduling.  I don't have too much more to say about this except that I think it is ridiculous to have to fill this out for every job.
good,"Hard on the body. Sometimes mandatory 6 day, 10 hour schedule. Simple work. Opportunities to move around to different departments. Fair management structure."
good,"you're really there to take care of the customer, sales are hourly plus commission, and they really want you to sell from other departments because that is really how you make your money."
good,"Ive worked for two Nordstroms, and depending on the manager really effects the overall happiness. Generally speaking, This is a good company to work for, im sure the time will come where i go back and work for them again."
good,"-commission based sales completely"
good,Nordstrom is a good place to work if you're on the floor. Everyone working there is really nice but the company promotes a certain look. Otherwise potential to move up is very limited.
good,"-commission based sales completely"
good,Nordstrom is a good place to work if you're on the floor. Everyone working there is really nice but the company promotes a certain look. Otherwise potential to move up is very limited.
good,"i don't like the management team, but I like the colleagues. Most of the associates are in between the mid-late 20s to 60s. Pretty chilled at work daily basis, repetitive work."
good,Nordstrom’s was a good company just not for me I didn’t feel as if I was compensated enough  for my time...................…...............................
good,"PROS - gratis, work life balance, funny coworkers, great training seminars, decent base pay"
good,The pay is nice. The hour and off days vary per week. Thats a downside. Its commission based but if you miss commission twice in a row o\you would be fired.
good,"great company but management lacks the knowledge of running a successful business. certain locations."
good,"It was a great environment to work in, honestly. People were friendly, but also competitive. The only reason why I left was because the assignment was over."
good,"It was fun but managers tend to pass off their own work when it comes to work on the sales floor , they would never be found and tend me boss around as if they own you."
good,"I had a great experience working at Nordstrom commission jobs are just not for me in that sense Nordstrom is, my co-workers where great and very helpful so were my managers I was able to move to another state with my job also."
good,"I was #1 Top seller of credit/debit cards at a Nordstroms Rack, however they kept drilling me everyday to do more and it was exhausting after a while and instead of motivating, it became like a threat to get more cards open. I stopped working there because of that."
good,"At Nordstrom you have a great environment with everyone that works there. Also, you always have the HR door open to talk to them if you have any opinions or suggestions to tell them."
good,I don’t think there are many jobs out there that are perfect. But Nordstrom’s definitely strives to always improve their system. I hope this short review is helpful
good,I worked for Nordstrom for years while I was going to college. This was a great place for me to work and make new life lasting friends. You definitely work hard but working on commission definitely teaches you how to really understand your customer and shine in the customer service arena.
good,"A typical day can be busy or slow with some busy work. There is a lot of person interaction. I learned to step put my comfort zone and think outside the box, I learn to multi- task and be more competitive. Some management was good but there was a struggle in managers understanding the difficulties associates face. The hardest part was getting sales and meeting exceptions when business was really slow and the most enjoyable part was my co-workers."
good,You could expect to work hard around holidays. Manager demands can get ridiculous. The longer you work there the more efficient of a worker you are considered. Learning the store was initially the most challenging thing.
good,working there you always met new and interesting people. environment was good and the feel of welcome also. co-workers were friendly and the discount was good as well.
good,"At the beginning of a normal shift, upon arrival we check in with our manager to see if there are any events or sales going on, competitions, new trends and pieces in the department, and areas to focus on. During the shift, we'd maintain the floor and offer service to wandering customers in search of certain products or outfits for an occasion. In downtime, we could travel other departments to see their new trends that could possibly pair with items in your department. At the end of the shift, we check in with the closing manager or coworkers to go over your leaving duties."
good,"was a good place to work but the competitive salary and not a steady paycheck did badly. Also if seasonal you have to fight for a spot to stay on, not much time off and you don't really get shifts shorter than 8 hours which can get in the way of school life. Even for part-time you work lots of hours."
good,Started off working at a decent wage with a competent department but lack of communication between management and the employees quickly became an issue. 
good,For the most part I really enjoyed working at Nordstrom. Given the chance I might work there again in the future. Working in the stock room was probably my favorite part.
good,"My manager was ready and willing to help at any time. "
good,"I’ve worked with soo many different people, soo many different cultures and new experiences. It was a fun experience to be able to be a little far from home so i could have had that opportunity to meet new people"
good,"I worked for Nordstrom for 6 years in many different roles. "
good,"Nordstrom is a good company.  I work for their Rack store.  It is a very fast paced location and extremely busy.  I enjoy meeting new customers and have many relationships since I see them in the store often.  Knowing some of your customers on a first name basis is a nice benefit of my role.  Management has changed since the beginning that I started.  New store manager as well as all new department managers.  I personally have had a total of 4 managers for customer service.  All managers have different views from the previous.  Working here has certainly taught me more patience as well as being flexible on changes.  "
good,"I enjoy working at Nordstrom but often times feel micromanaged and unappreciated for the hard work I put in. However, I love working with customers and ensuring they leave happy and satisfied!"
good,"Cutting edge, fashion forward great place to work. Advancements with the company are easily obtain and promoted throughout the company. Would recommend this employer"
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I enjoyed my time with them, it was a grand opening of the rack in VA. The employees were great and management was ok to say the least."
good,"My manager at Nordstrom Garden State Plaza in Paramus, NJ was very accepting of my school schedule. Mostly everybody on staff there is friendly and willing to help you out to show the ropes."
good,"Always a fun and goodtime. Stressful when busy especially during trend show and holidays but worth it in the end. Glad to have been able to learn the ""Nordstrom way"" of doing things"
good,I worked at nordstrom in the women's shoes department for a few months. It was a very good learning experience as i was able to deal with many customers and learn about how the customer always comes first.It was also nice working in commission because i was able to determine my own salary depending on how much sales i did. I left because the hours became too much with school.
good,Nordstrom was a fun place to work and has a really good employee discount. The management was really good and everyone was willing to help if you had questions.
good,"Nordstrom was a good place to be employed, my concern was limited career advancement. Our team was responsible for incoming and outgoing product safety and distribution to all departments."
good,"It a great place to work and advance, but there are no guarantees. You can lose benefits and position depending on sales even if the business is bad and the economy is suffering."
good,"Nordstrom was a great place to work because the environment was very upbeat no matter what time of the day I worked, and I enjoyed the camaraderie that was shared between employees."
good,"Working for a company like Nordstrom is wonderful because of the company's values."
good,"Working here, you have a lot of freedom. No one is hollering at you. You just go out to the store and find what is needed for the customer.10 items an hour was the standard. Management was understandable."
good,Working at the Nordstrom Rack was nice but they need to train there seasonal employees better.  I love helping customers it is fun for me this is what I do.
good,"Higher end retail sales, you must be ready to do the work to get advancements.  Follow up with customers and Pre-sell. Wonderful diverse group of Co-workers in cosmetic department always ready to lend a hand.  Hardest part leaving wonderful friends."

good,"I love what Nordstrom stands for, I think they try to keep the culture a key piece of what they stand for, but it is few and far between. They have a hard time being honest with there employee's and building the bench into a way to make a pipeline of talent."
good,Nordstrom is great if you're fine with commission and everything being about sales. I was more interested in customer service than how much I could get people to spend.
good,"This was my first job while I was still in college. Great commission and exposure to sales, while working for a great company. It depends what department you get placed in, but overall good pay."
good,"Nordstrom is a fabulous place to work.  The diverse culture, the range of opportunities and the fantastic managers make Nordstrom a 'One of a kind' experience. "
good,Love nordstrom! The managers care about their employees. A lot of room for improvement. Great career opporutnies open for everyone as long as you take your position seriously. Nordstrom is also a very diverse company. They accept everyone and do not discriminate. They also give frequent raises unlike other companies.
good,"If you are in sales and good at it, this is a great stepping stone to learn. Management is not always the best but there are typically two or three good managers somewhere in the store."
good,"My experience at Nordstrom was extremely positive for many years.  I reached great heights, growing with the company from the ground up.  It was an exciting place to work, filled with a ""can do"" entrepreneurial spirit that helped to shape my strong work ethic."
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom consist of always familiarizing yourself with the sales floor , making sure every customer is taken care of and being aware of your surroundings on the sales floor. As a sales associate my multitasking skills have enhanced tremendously. I have also grown in the sense that I am much better at effectively communicating with customers and making sure they are completely satisfied. Nordstrom has a family based culture and management encourages you to know your customers well and give them the best shopping experience while shopping on their terms. This a great company to work for because of the positive and upbeat culture. Although sales and holidays can get hectic and stressful, giving the best customer service possible is always satisfying."
good,Management is always willing to help you move up in the company and can help you get to a greater position quickly. It gets competitive but it is a job that makes you work for what you get.
good,Nordstrom is a great place to begin your selling career especially if you are timid. The hours are flexible and managers are always encouraging to their workers without micromanaging.
good,"Honestly I left Nordstrom Ala Moana mainly because Mall Culture is dying, ever since the move to another wing of the mall, foot traffic had declined tremendously; & it was hard to make commission paychecks. I also wanted to earn experience outside retail, and get away from spending my paychecks there. "
good,"Nordstrom was a very fun company to work for and I would work for them again in a heartbeat. If I could, I would choose to work for Nordstrom corporate, rather than working in an actual store."
good,"I was responsible for selling clothing to customers in a retail environment.  I consistently increased net sales while pursuing a Bachelor’s degree.  Workplace environment was customer service oriented, which was a critical attribute I learned which I still apply to this day.  The hardest part was leaving the discount.  The enjoyable part was forging significant relationships which have proven to be fruitful to this day."
good,Nordstrom is a fast paced retail environment with great advancement opportunity. Only problem I had was with management not being supportive of the staff and making sure we were protected in all aspects during our employment.
good,commission is everything here and if you are a shark on the sales floor you can make a lot of money. That being said sales people are not so fond of new sharks as they can be territorial but as long as you don't let anyone intimidate you into shying your potential or money away you have nothing to worry about
good,If you can handle a tough commission based sales environment then you may like this job. When times are tough and sales are few the once team based environment turns overly competitive and sometimes ugly. If you aren't sales driven then you won't survive here. Management was hit or miss which either made the job experience miserable or fulfilling.
good,"here is a place where you can work hard but constant in 1 place., the work goes by fast tho and hellps the time go by. the supervisors are understanding"
good,Can be a bit competitive.  Great for those whom love to sort and organize.  Up to date on styles and fashion.  Difficult not to shop while at work.  Learned great management skills with through the company.
good,"Working at Nordstrom was really fun, being able to meet customers and help put outfits together piece by piece and build trusting relationships where you're able to just find each other right away was a great experience. I would say it's fast paced, just because you need to know how to be quick on your feet and quick with putting things together for your customers as well as being able to help out other customers or co workers in your department. Make sure you're good at multi-tasking because there is a lot of it with this position. The hardest part of this job for me was being able to go to school on top of anything. When starting out you want to probably work full time to be able to make any sort of money, because it is commission, so you are working A LOT."
good,"Nordstrom takes care of there employees rather well. I enjoyed the clean environment and the customer interaction. If it were not so far away, this job would have been even better."
good,Good atmosphere. Pay is average. Meet tons of great people! Lots of work but good of people who like to keep busy.  I learned a lot about product and how a business runs.
good,"Job was easy to learn, management helpful. Structured environment, you are required to stand for the duration of your shift. Shifts go by quickly. Overall a good place to work."
good,"Nordstrom is a good company to work for. However, managers are not compensated adequately, and the path to higher management is not clearly defined. There is also a sense that once you get into higher management, its not about how qualified you are, it about who knows you."
good,The same as dillards except management better and more caring  of sales force. I was voted allstar one time recognition.Highest award in the company.  I would go in each day set sales goal merchandise new product on displays.Organize stock area in back.
good,"Overall this job was cool and enjoyed working at a face-paced. In addition I loved building my clientele. However, Management in my opinion was somewhat helpful."
good,enjoyed working with Nordstrom. Holidays were busy and I chose to leave when I started having children.  Management was well trained. Overall a great place to work.
good,"Nordstrom offered a friendly work environment, good training, and opportunities to advance.  Friendly and congenial working staff, fair number of breaks for lunch with a great culture."
good,"The culture was nice when I first began, but as the years progressed the new management became hawks. They would sneak up on you to see what you were doing. It ruined employee morale."
good,"Fun place to work, mostly surrounded by young, energetic, and genuine people. It is still retail, you work long hours and a lot of holidays, nights, and weekends. Stingy with PTO. Mostly commission based."
good,"it's a fine place to work.  Nothing extraordinary about it, but you make good money and you can have a flexible schedule.  sometime the managers get all caught up in credit card accounts."
good,"There is a chance for me to learn more advanced technologies. Your day will be more productive if you just deliver the given tasks."
good,I enjoy my job most of the time. I interact with customers who are sometimes rude. I like most of the people I work with. I think the pay is good for unskilled work.
good,Working in IT at Nordstrom was fantastic. It allowed me to see many different aspects of the company. They do require every associate to work the annual sale  in the store which I was not thrilled with
good,"nice and polite working space with fun people. I work in Nordstrom for Celine clothing presentation, the atmosphere in Nordstrom is really welcoming and I love it."
good,Face paced environment that requires attention and discipline. Workers motivate other equal employees to create a relaxed workplace. Bosses are easily approachable and understanding of situations
good,it was a very good place to work at. working third shift and I loved it and the scheldules friendly people and very helpful the management was also very helpful.
good,"I worked for Nordstrom almost 20 years ago, but it was a great place to work. Their primary focus was customer service, and it was a fast paced and fun environment."
good,"Hardest part of the job is the compensation compared to the job requirements, but great benefits along with great people all around. Each store is ran different so pay attention to the store manager and how they treat other managers cause it doesnt get better from there."

good,Worked  for Nordstrom for 14 years. I enjoyed helping customer building customers. I enjoyed  working  with personal customers throughout the store in different departments. I was responsible for stocking and keeping department clean and organized.    I  called clients to let them know of special events and sales. I  really enjoyed the workplace environment.
good,Work benefits are great but salary is not that great for upscale retail job............commission is ok too... Lots of Product knowledge trainings and the work environment is quite friendly...
good,"This was a great place to work for 5 years. Until my last manager, I really enjoyed working for this company. I would suggest working here to any friend."
good,Great place to work. Lots of great co-workers.  Fast paced and rewarding selling environment.  Big focus on digital sales to increase service and sales opportunities. Inspiring Management team.
good,Norstrom rack is a fun productive work in place for all employees  that would like to advance through the company.  Working at Nordstrom rack is not too hard of a job but  once you get acclimated to the system and how things work everything falls into place.
good,Worked here during highschool. Better pay than other places. Flexible scheduling with new ways to always keep work interesting. If you're into retail than this is the spot for you.
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to expand your knowledge of the fashion industry. Every day you have the ability to learn something new, no matter how long you have worked with the company. Nordstrom is great about adjusting to current times and is always fair to not only their customers, but to their employees as well."
good,Working at Nordstrom gives you the best customer service training while also allowing you to build your own business in sales. The environment is an upbeat and friendly atmosphere.
good,"The job entailed so many responsibilities other than just sales.  Cleaning, organizing, reticketing, and processing returns were expected to done as well.  Not enough time in the day to get everything done.  You get to know your coworkers very well and build relationships."
good,Nordstrom has a great reputation as being a good company to work for and in my experience this is completely justified.  A really great place to work.
good,"This is a great job for students that require a flexible schedule.  Job advancement is challenging as opportunities have to arise in order to be nominated to move forward in the company.  "
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for overall. Very competitive, which I've never experienced before this job. They worked with my school schedule which was a plus. It is a commission based job though so the money is never guaranteed and very inconsistent, which I didn't enjoy at all. Nordstrom's company culture is very family based. Very easy to move up in the company as long as you are very committed to such growth. They rarely hire upper management positions outside of the company which is great."
good,Enjoyed my time at this job. Worked in stock and had a great team that i worked with . We were swamped all the time but the job was easy and pay was fair. You'll have the routine annoying managers but the company is great
good,"A typical day At Nordstrom would be clocking in getting your walkie , key , portable check out machine & apron & getting right on the floor helping customers taking back & fixing the floor"
good,"Commission % should be higher. I work in the women's shoe department and the commission rate is only %10, i think it should be %15. Management is a little lax. Culture is fine."
good,"Leadership is open to ideas and encourage engineers."
good,"Fun place to work with a lot of opportunity to grow. If you are not competitive and not sales goal minded, you may have a difficult time. Great perks and opportunities."
good,I was hired as a temp and didn't think I would like the job. I was able to listen to music and do my work with disruptions from others. Everyone was friendly and I never had a problem with anyone. I wish I could go back!!! Pretty good pay and I got paid every friday.
good,Dept Manager needs to treat his team more fairly. There is favoritism with him. Asst Managers for the most part are good. Fellow employees are great to work with.
good,"A very nice and upscale place to work. Everyone is very professional and passionate about their line of work. It can be super competitive and not a friendly atmosphere to work because most departments work on commission, so your co-worker are not going to be the friendliest people."
good,Great company to get direct customer experience with. Providing excellent training and a customer-centric model of sales that you will take with you throughout your career.
good,"Consistent collaboration with key leaders on the store level.  Including department managers, store managers, regional and national leaders.  "
good,"Competitive pay for the job, overall reasonable hours for retail. Promote from within mentality is nice if you are looking to build a long term career with the company"
good,It was a very valuable experience for me.  The teachers were given freedom to develop their own lesson plans and field trips.   The school offered many opportunities for continued study.
good,"great management, great people to work with, great customers. Nordstrom gives their employees the freedom to take care of the customer that every company should strive to match. They do their best to keep everyone happy and satisfied regardless of your position."
good,like the discount and the coffee bar helped being there in the morning. but my dept was falling apart they fired us to rehire us a week later. it was not a hard job
good,"Sales goal sometimes hard to reach, depends on your store location. People is nice, but of course, some of them are aggressive on sales."
good,I had an amazing time working here and the company provided a family feel. They treat their workers well and prepare them to successfully complete their jobs.
good,"Nordstrom taught me all I know about the retail culture, I was able to establish a quick name for myself and worked through the company to succeed. I took another opportunity in my career there and then came back years later based upon what I missed in my education there."
good,"I loved my immediate boss, but she wasn't give the tools to succeed. We were understaff because of logistic issues. Some of the team members couldn't get along with each other."
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work if you like Nordstrom. Must be competitive when it comes to sales and commission. Managers are constantly on top of you for your numbers, but there is definitely room for advancement if you are meeting those numbers and requirements. Managers tent to micromanage though. As long as you are doing your job and trying your hardest, you should be fine."
good,"As long as you are committed and serious about your position, this company will take care of you. There is often high stress, but the benefits are decent and the pay is above average compared to other retailers."
good,"Great Customer Service, Good products and an organized company. Business is slowing down, retail is moving more online, the co workers though were great and very supportive."
good,"No respect shown among employees and no equal opportunity! Managers were partial and gave no opportunity for growth. Politics will get you ahead. Boring as well, some people made the job enjoyable."
good,"On a typical work day I go in and start off my day doing some stock work. Then depending on how busy the day is I am constantly on the floor selling to customers. Before leaving, each employee is responsible for doing some stock work. The work is not hard. But, sometimes it can get very competitive with coworkers since it is a commission based job. The more you sell, the bigger your paycheck is going to be. I was employed part time only because I am a student and I was able to make more than employees who were working full time. It's up to you to decide how much you want to make. Overall, I liked the job, the responsibilities are not too much, and the pay is a lot better than any other retail employer. Management can be very understanding, they tend to be young and know what it is like to be a student and working."
good,Lots of absolutely beautiful women every way you look. The job wasn't hard but you had to be very accurate. Pretty much all day I scanned items in and out of inventory then shipped them to the proper places.
good,Nice job to get but wouldn't work here forever most customers who shop at Nordstrom are rude and racist. but since you get paid off commissions its worth dealing with the bs.
good,"If you work hard you can get where you want.  Whether a sales person or in management if you apply yourself to the customer in front of you, you can build a strong business."
good,"I'm planning to move to Peoria ,Az otherwise I would stay with Nordstrom, I learned a lot and great fun for all my successful career with Nordstrom .Im an exemplary employee and remain to be a productive highly skilled employee."
good,At Nordstrom there are lots of promotions from within. I always walked out happy with my job and felt good when customers really appreciated the help.
good,"I like working at Nordstrom but it is very hard to grow within going into management. The pay is 100% commission and depending on what department u are in, it can be quite hard to make a descent paycheck due to the percentage they pay u!  I would love to stay but can't do to no growth potential and minimal salary amount!"
good,"Nice place to work for people who offer great customer service."
good,Nordstrom  maintained high standards and had excellent profit sharing . Management was sometimes a problem with no consistency and high turn over.Incentives were good and basically one got paid on ones sales ability and hard work which benefited me.
good,"A lot of hard work put into the job for not enough pay. "
good,Fun workplace. Plenty of opportunities for advancement provided your manager supports it. Meaning the managers only pick and choose who they want to promote. Besides that nice work environment.
good,"Very modern fun, it all depends on what sales for you decide to work for, others make money year round while others depends on the timing, it is very common not to reach a sales goal."
good,"I work in a fast paced, fun and productive environment. I appreciate the support I receive from fellow employees and management staff."
good,Working at Nordstrom was a great learning experience for me. It broadened my understanding of people and working in a retail environment.
good,Working a Nordstrom was fun . Its all about fashion and sales . commission based mostly . but a fun atmosphere to work and be around . love they value holidays to spend time off with the family instead of being open like many other retailers
good,nordstrom is a commission based job so its never steady. You could have 1 great paycheck but followed by 2 poor pay checks. another great thing nordstrom is all about moving up.
good,This company is excellent because it offers benefits and allows students a flexible schedule to attend classes.  Great part time work environment.
good,"working here was an awesome experience, with snacks and vending machines to buy from, free coffee on occasion, free pac man and basketball games for breaks, a ping pong table, and a food truck that comes for break and lunch, there really isnt much more you can ask for from your employers here. other workers are kind and interested in who you are and dont act like you dont exist. Literally the only problem with this job was the management. there were a couple of exceptions but for the most part the managers are very rude, pushy, and exuberate the feeling that they are above and better than you."
good,"Very fast paced environment, willing to grow is a must. Being able to get designer merchandise at a discount is always great. If you love fashion, being social, and being busy this the place for you."
good,"Great place to work if you are looking to work hard and meet commission sales goals for good money! Must keep work environment clean, able to sell shoes and other items in surrounding departments, work well with team members."
good,"A fairly straight forward retail sales position, biggest stressors being the expectation of opening retail credit cards for customers and attaining your sales goals with a very liberal return policy that is counted against your sales."
good,"A normal day a t Nordstrom's starts with morning meeting, putting out any product from the nights  before truck. servicing the customer is the number one priority at Nordstrom"
good,Nordstrom is full of amazing people. they are the hardest working group of people and the most talented folks i know.  i hope the company continues to see how valuable the people on the payroll are.
good,They are great company and all the staff and bosses are nice. They give flexible schedules and paid well. But the management are always changing rules and every year they change managers in every departments.
good,"Typical day at work would include installs/decommissioning of hardware. Troubleshooting connectivity issuses.  Also database maintenance for raised floor database."
good,"Benefits aren't great. But for a college gig, they're pretty flexible. You're pretty engaged with nearly everyone in the store which makes it fun to get to know everyone."
good,Overall the guest along with the staff were great. I had a great time helping my guest shop and getting to personal know them. Helping them pick out gifts or items for theirselves.
good,"customer service is key here, typical day was organizing stock and assisting customers , co works were really nice, company is great to work for hardest part of the job is dealing with customers and being on your feet"
good,Up and coming new store in PR. Good work ethic and good team. Provided good training with complete information for store opening.
good,Great Place to work if you love fashion. Not enough support for Loss Prevention Dept. Very small budget and high expectations for LP agents in Full Line Stores.
good,"Your personality should change to please your supervisors regardless of your sales techniques are working."
good,Co- workers are the best at Nordstrom. A typical day at work you will have sales goals and want to meet them. Management can sometimes pick favorites so that was not fun. I did learn a lot about sales.
good,"Commission-based, long hours standing, often overstaffed sales floors, great discount, great co-workers/managers, fun work environment (especially around the holidays and sales)."
good,I loved stocking the departments before the store opened because it was peaceful and time flew while working. My managers were pretty flexible and not always down your back. The best part of the job was that I got to get experience in dealing with customers and stocking items since I would love to be a retail manager sometime. I loved the discount and learned certain retail terms.
good,"Great company to work for, 401k plan and paid time off. Creating repeat business by developing long-term relationships with regular customers. Using a bannock measuring device to find the actuate shoe size of a child."
good,A typical day at work includes being on the floor assisting the customers. Filling the floor and re merchandising as needed. Opening nordstrom reward cards and checking customers out
good,Nordstrom's is a fun and laid back place to work. My only complaint is it is still very old school and it is hard to make a difference or change a process.
good,"Most days are pretty busy, so it makes the time go by faster. The best part of the job are the people/ co-workers that you meet along the way."
good,The people I worked with were great. I really had a great time working here. The management was ok. Overall it was good experience.
good,"I would rather not include a review of Nordstrom's Rack on indeed. I am more than willing to speak about it in person, however."
good,"I enjoy working at Nordstrom Café, the staff great and easy to get along with. The work hours are relatively agreeable; the restaurants closes at 8pm."
good,"The biggest asset to Nordstrom as a company is it's customers.  The clientele that Nordstrom attracts is quite desirable.  It creates a pleasant work environment that is welcoming to me each and every day.  They are what drives my business and keeps me engaged.  "
good,Come in open up the stand and wipe down my area. Greet costumers as they enter the store. I learned how to be more open and costumer oriented. Management wasn't stable and the rarely promoted from within the store. The coworkers were cool but they gossip like its a high school. The hardest part about the job was staying busy during the slow times. The most enjoyable part of the job was making new friends and building relationships with the costumers.
good,"I have worked at Nordstrom for over a year and have evolved within a sales role, as well as mastering my skill of maintaining customer relationships. I have truly enjoyed working with such amazing and creative people."
good,Working at there in Milwaukee was an ok job to work at. The people where very friendly to work with. I wouldnt mind working there again
good,"Fast-paced environment, which I enjoy, however stressful, I enjoy mostly working with employees. Difficult to reach resources at times."
good,I was in charge of the registers and greeting customers. I learned how to communicate with customers and give great customer service. My co-workers were amazing and the management was good as well. I truly enjoyed working with my team and making the customer happy leaving the store. I received a lot of positive feedback!
good,"great people to work with"
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for. The company not only takes care of its employees but also values a culture of belonging.
good,"Overall, I had a really positive experience working at Nordstrom. The people are amazing, the customer service is like no other store I have ever seen, and the overall atmosphere is really fun and bubbly!"
good,Everyone is nice and has great customer service. Learned a lot bout men's suites and retail industry period. I enjoyed everything about this job.
good,"At Nordstrom they have an inverted pyramid when the sales associate are the face of the company and managers, hr, and service experience are support. The support team are there for us, so we can provide the best service possible."
good,"I have increased my knowledge of facilities maintenance and management of a team. I currently manage 2 separate building for Nordstrom. One is 172,000sqft and the other is close to 40,000."
good,"A typical day at work is constantly busy and full of interesting people and situations. "
good,Learned  a lot. Busy during summer. Some people are sharks in the commission business. Hard part is selling if your not used to do it.
good,NOrdstrom is a great work environment and the people that you see on a daily basis truly work together as a team. Work/life balance is tough in this role due to the sheer responsibility that you garner.
good,Nordstrom Cosmetics is a department to enjoy not only for the selling but for being able to teach the customer of beauty from the inside out.  To succeed one needs to be goal oriented and willing to follow strict guidelines.
good,"Overall I enjoyed my experience with the company, great perks and amazing people. Opportunity to move up and transfer to a different location."
good,"A typical day never looks the same as a Nordstrom Restaurant Financial Analyst due to the focus of support shifting between regional and divisional employees on a daily basis.  Organization, Customer Service, and communication are key elements at succeeding to ""stepping down Nordstrom's inverted-pyramid"".  The National Directors that I support are shining examples that a strong foundation built on communication offers a seamless multi-level teamwork to accomplish a multitude of tasks of various magnitudes.  My co-workers are the clear reflection of what Nordstrom prides itself on: a workplace with diverse individuals that always look for the option that goes above and beyond, if it means it might make your day a little brighter.  The hardships within my job heavily revolve around being able to efficiently coordinate multiple projects with varying deadlines, all without compromising the support of your fellow peers.  By far the most enjoyable part of my job is the creative minds that surround me, as I get to witness and partake in new ideas to move our team forward."
good,I was in charge of pulling all the orders that the stores wanted to be shipped out in  there appropriate place. i also oversaw that everything was done in appropriate timing
good,"There is always room to move up in this company. Nordstrom has great benefits, and a fun, fast-paced environment. The people that work here are fun and nice overall."

good,"There is always room to move up in this company. Nordstrom has great benefits, and a fun, fast-paced environment. The people that work here are fun and nice overall."
good,Had good communication with team members. Flexible with all types of environments. Involved in all kinds of group meetings with the entire project team.
good,"great discounts on clothing and shoes, good work environment, great connections with good customer base, many locations if transfers are necessary"
good,"As the Jewelry Specialist and Accessories Lead, I was in charge of opening and closing duties, as well as merchandising and inventory management.  My co-workers were respectful and had a great understanding with our customers.  Communication was key to a successful day as well as interaction and motivation within the staff.  As management, providing a positive atmosphere was key as well.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers and meeting their needs as well as the helpful comminicatioin with the staff."
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I was promoted from the sales floor to manager in less than 3 years. I would recommend working here to anyone looking for a good job with a good company.
good,Approachable management and great working environment.  Very customer driven.  Began in the men's dept. and currently a host in the Bazill restaurant.
good,"A beautiful store with all the items you could ever need.  Nordstrom can complete you from head to toe."
good,I enjoy my job because no two days are the same. Most days are very busy with assisting customers and sales associates. Management empowers the staff the use good judgement and treat people fairly. That can be challenging with a commissioned-based position and a flexible return policy.
good,This is great company to work for if you don't take mass transit because some of the days can be really long. There are a ton of positions for you to choose from and room for you to grow however the departmental aspects of the business model dictates how and when and if you can move from a position once you land it. you have to stay in one position before you can change it or decide to move on but it is still largely based on whether they can afford for you to move and if they have time to interview new workers and or train them. the upside is you gain a great deal of experience working with a large workforce and dealing with a huge customer base. you really pick up on customer service skills and build strong work ethic due to the demanding schedule and interactions from day to day. They offer  medical benefits and a 401k plan after an initial 3 months probationary period.
good,Nordstrom offers great benefits and cares about their customers as well as employees. The hardest part of the job is it takes quite a while to move up. But work is always consistent.
good,fun work place with supportive management. lots of cool people. flexible scheduling. all about the money. must always make goal. decent pay.
good,"Very little to no training, very fast paced."
good,I never have a bad thing to say about Nordstrom. I definitely appreciate everything I have learned and the opportunities I have gotten from this company.
good,you will learn to grow and develop. decent health benefits although the salary increase so slow. But I enjoy heartedly my job. the company started to get crowded with the new management.
good,Definitely a competitive workplace - some people might feel too pressured by it and some people will love the atmosphere.
good,Good for retail class. Compensation is not enough for the amount of work. Cosmetics sales culture has changed and not for the better for the last five years.
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for, though I am looking for a career that is located closer to where I live.  I'd like a better work/life balance."
good,Good company to work for with good benefits. I was a sales associate in Women's shoes and worked full time. The hardest part of the job was working strictly on commission. Pay fluctuated greatly based on how busy the store/season was.
good,"At Nordstrom I was a picker, I went to the location(s) on a list of tickets, matched the UPC, was then responsible for sorting accordingly and sending it to be packed. This job was highly physical."
good,Fun work place with friendly team members to get the job done. Really laid back job. I really enjoyed working here. Great company to work for.

good,Exciting place to work. High pace. It was amazing to have the opportunity to connect with so many customers and really help them find what they really needed and to help them to boost their self confidence.
good,"had a fantastic opportunity to learn about sales procecesses, facilitated improved selling techniques, great culture and history,"
good,"Pros and Cons to every job, but it is a great place to start and if you do well you can get promoted quickly and learn many skills"
good,"- Dealing with issues each day"
good,"- Typical day would have you working to maintain our stock room and inventory accuracy. "
good,Lots to learn in the internship program. Company treats interns well and gives them the tools to gain a lot of knowledge.
good,I worked here during a summer program. It was a very great place to work at i have no complaints about HomeGoods. I worked there for about a year without any problems.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the kids in my department and seeing them happy and smiling when they leave.
good,Pays really well without a degree. Makes it easy to grow within the company if that is something you want and they always try to promote from within.
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to grow your own business. It provides you with core values and freedom of expression. Unfortunately, you will be limited on having weekends, nights and holidays to yourself. However, you have the potential to make a lot of money doing what you love if fashion is in your blood!"
good,"A fast-paced, competitive, goal-oriented, and creative environment. Promotes autonomy amongst employees, a long-standing corporate model for top-rated customer service. An organization that promotes the importance of teamwork."
good,"In working at Ebar, I learned everything I know about coffee and customer service. It was a fast-paced but very organized work environment and the days always went by quickly. I also gained leadership experienced in coaching my fellow team members on how to make better coffee. I really enjoyed the people I worked with, which makes almost any job enjoyable."
good,"Great opportunities to grow. They will train and develop you. It will be your life. Live, breath, eat, think Nordstrom...ALL DAY EVERY DAY."
good,"• Maintain customer service while building long-standing customer relationships"
good,"Acted as Interim Manager while a replacement was being found"
good,Constant change of management and staff.  The conduct and culture is ideal for College age employees.  I beyond that age and sometimes is hard to relate.
good,"This job was fun and my first job in United States, I have learnt a lot in terms of customer service. And sales, I was very good at my department and I have enjoyed the job."
good,sales positions are challenging during down times such as after holidays and early summer. busy times are during anniversary which is in late july/august and of course holiday season.
good,"Great environment, very goal oriented, and customer service is always top priority. As a whole the workplace is diverse, safe, and inviting to customers and employees,"
good,"Great place to work. Great people, positive atmosphere. Always willing to teach. Hardest is remembering what to do in the different areas."
good,A typical day at work consist of selling shoes and making sure the shoe area of the store is clean and organized. This job has allot to do with customer service and pleasing the customer and finding the right shoe for them.
good,"Goals are highs, competitive coworkers, stressful enviornment. Nice clean work enviornment. Gratis and training provided was exeptional."
good,"Working at Bar Verde is great way to meet new people and broaden our guests horizon food to table concept. We have wonderful food and a brilliant Chef that takes risks. As a hostess, I love to be the first person they see so that their dining experience can begin. Management are professionally and also work as a team player. They don't mind getting their hands dirty and bussing tables when we are busy which in my mind shows that they not only care about the restaurant but also the nothing is beneath them. The hardest part of the job is guests not willing to give our restaurant a chance because of our remodel. The most enjoyable is getting to know my guests on a personal level."
good,"Great place to work, is very fast pace and there are many departments in which you build relationships since you make their coffee daily."
good,"Nordstrom was a great, diverse environment to work in and be apart of. Managing a team of 15 ppl helped me learn to multi- task and become a better communicator. Over the years, I learned how to delegate to others and spread out responsibilities so that every member of our team felt included. I learned how to read and analyze sales information that was relevant to my business. Merchandising the floor and creating compelling stories with clothing and accessories was a big part of my job."
good,Built amazing relationships with my coworkers and customers. I have learned a lot about customer service and the beauty industry.
good,"get to work figure out how many waves were going to  be ran that day. get a pick list and go to the right location and get the items and send them to packing. i learned that i can lead a team if need be. i felt that management doesn't treat all employees the same, there  is favorites and it is very clear who they are. i got along with most of my co-workers. hardest part was being in charge of 30,000 piece projects. it was a lot of pressure and frustrating at times but in the end i loved the responsibility and showing what i am truly made of. i loved what i did at nordstrom, i loved the bonds i made with co-workers, and just knowing i was apart of something great."
good,"nords is a gtromreat place to work for job security ,but as for as the daily work environment it was very uncomfortable for me coming in only no spainsh person they made it very hard for me to join in the nordstrom family"
good,I was allowed to do work once assigned and management supported it.  I was recognized for the initiative I took and the successful investigations I conducted.

good,"Working at Nordstrom is a must for all who wish to further their career in customer service.  The company not only treats their employees well, but their customers as well.  Working at Nordstrom teaches many lessons on how to be a better customer service agent while continuing to support those who no longer work for the company."

Working at Nordstrom teaches many lessons on how to be a better customer service agent while continuing to support those who no longer work for the company."
good,Great customers and opportunity to showcase salesman skills.
good,"It feel like a family, all the people are very nice. We work with product getting it ready for the stores"
good,"Commission based and it is apparent. Some departments aren't as catty, but some are. Personal Stylists work out of many departments and can be the cause for stolen sales and such. There is a huge opportunity to earn money though if you are not afraid to learn about every department and assist the customer in that manner! It can be very rewarding with the customers you make relationships with. This is a position that will increasingly get more money the longer time spent there."
good,"When I first started at Nordstrom I was a sales assocaiate in the Narrative dept. (clothing for women in ages in 40-60 ), most of the sales associates were older women in the department but they help me with product knowdledge, gaining clients, and overall selling experience. However I notice that the commission didnt work well for me and I wanted something a little more stable and dependable so then I moved to the communications department in our store. Which in turn ended up loving doing! On a day to day basis when come in at 8am, get any reports together for the store manager to read in morning announcments, put away any mail in desgianted managers mailbox, I then get on the phones and proceed with answering/transfering calls, make pages or announcements  through out the store, for an example, paging a customer to return back to a department, paging store manager, or selling managers, closing announcements. After a few months working in the communications department I then was ask to become the communications lead, I trained new operators with the guidelines and expecations as an operator, I also was responsible for making our schedule. This postion help me more with learning the leadership role, it taught me how to delegate the work load and make it an complete team effort.  I also assisted with any phone issues throughout the store, whether if a phone was broken would either replace it or order a new part etc. Submitting request for managers voicemail resets. Overall i loved this position! I would say the hardest part of this job was encountering some of the customers and"
good,"Great company to grow."
good,I learned the most amazing customer service skills at this job. Enjoyed all of my coworkers and have made long time friends here even with some of the clients. Management could have been a little less concerned about numbers and more concerned of the well being of their employees.
good,"Implemented great knowledge of traditional and recent trends in fashion to style an array of clients and meet their satisfaction. Employed vast sense of suitability of a particular fashion to create a unique look to cater to exclusive clients. Engaged ability to generate innovative ideas that convey an image the client would like to showcase while maintaining a strong client/stylist relationship, and building a greater client base."
good,Positive atmosphere but hours are long. Selling is most important so you must love that aspect. Management is consistent and the company promotes within so you have opportunity to grow.
good,"I have worked for Nordstrom for many years, and been through numerous classes, trainings, and positions in the company.  The number one goal is to make customers feel good and make the day. The majority of positions in full line stores allow you to earn commission on sales."
good,"Nordstrom treats their employees as well as they treat their customers. It's a great place to work if you have an inherent salesmanship--if you don't, this might not be the job for you, as your income is based on your commission."
good,I really liked working in this diverse environment.  I felt like the team was my family.  I really liked to the smell the clothing after a hard days work.
good,"Overall, Nordstrom has a great company culture and benefits package. The schedule is typical retail, weekends and holidays and lots of long hours."
good,"- great work place"
good,"While there are many opportunities for advancement at Nordstrom, there is no such thing as work-life balance. They expect you to devote your life to this company, and honestly if this is what you decide to do you will move up. However, for anyone who doesn't want to make this company their career, I suggest looking elsewhere."
good,"While I worked at Nordstrom, I worked as a womens sales associate and was a stylist there. I got to assist customers in picking outfits for their everyday life and specail occasions. I got to learn finances, customer service skills, computer skills, up to date fashion styles and much more. The co workers I worked with where very fun and outgoing, easy to work with and helped me function in a strong team environment. The hardest part of the job was maintaining my customers. I would write thank you letters every week to my clients for spending their time with me. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the new people I got to interact with."
good,"Everyday is a new day. I walk into work and always go to the host stand right away to see my section and see what the soup is. It is very routine but, necessary. I treat each table with respect and I also love giving my undivided attention. I want my customers to know me not just as their server but, as their friend. I want to give them suggestions on food, wine, or anything else they need. I give my all. I love most of my co-workers. I enjoy their company and they have really become more than just my friends; more like family. The hardest part of my job is when a co-worker is so negative you feel the energy all over. I need positive energy to feed off of. I love the people I serve. Sometimes they are the people I see all the time and I know their routine but, i also really enjoy seeing and meeting new people to connect with on a deeper level than just bring them food and beverages."
good,"At Nordstrom, a typical day at work mainly consists of providing great customer service while striving to meet your daily sales goal. We are responsible for greeting every customer and making them feel comfortable and well informed. I make suggestions based on my product knowledge and what the customer is looking for. Each day sales associates check on orders we have made for previous customers to make sure they have shipped and will get to them on time. We follow up with customers by sending them emails, thank you notes, and making phone calls. Besides selling, we are responsible for keeping the floor clean and organized, fulfilling orders for sales associates at other stores, and merchandising new arrivals. My coworkers are very supportive, and although we work in a commission based environment, we rarely get into conflicts. "
good,"Many may view retail as a ""job"" but I have made it a ""career"" as a Personal Stylist. I work closely with my clients and make an effort to develop long-lasting, trusting relationships. I work very hard to educate myself about current trends to ensure my clients are getting what they want. Nordstrom has taught me the best customer service methods all while developing my sales skills."
good,"I have learned so much at Nordstrom.  Time management, organization skills, developing a team, customer service and constantly learning something new about myself or the business."
good,"company provides health benefits"

good,great place to work. Always having events for clients. Customer service
good,no room to move up not enough hours rude customers and managment
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom is coming into work not knowing what the day will be like, especially working in the Kidswear Department. Everyday we do a new floor set for the new inventory that has come in as well as organize our floor and make sure the items are organized to the importance for the customer. Most importantly everyday I contact customers/clients and follow up with them for multiple reasons: order satisfaction, alterations, shopping experience, and appointments to come in and shop. Nordstrom emphasizes the importance on customer service and everyday I make sure I give my best service.Working at Nordstrom I learned how to separate work and personal life. Nordstrom is a full time job so being present everyday I learned to not take work home with me and to end each day knowing I did my best and the next day will be better. Also, I learned more about patience. Customers at Nordstrom expect a lot from employees and sometimes it was hard to stay patient but keeping the professionalism and calmness makes a difference in the customer experience. Lastly, I learned to adapt to change well. Nordstrom went through the biggest change and decreased the number of managers and that changed the way work flowed everyday. I was able to adapt to manager changes, staff changes,and schedule changes. I learned that you never know how the day will go so have an open mind and be ready to adapt. Management at Nordstrom is very structured. I appreciate Nordstrom for this. I have a great relationship with my managers. Management is very organized, encouraging, and pushes their employees to"
good,"Its a great starting job for experience, but get out within a year if you are not planning on making a career out of it."
good,"Front of the store greeter, and fitting room specialist. Gave product knowledge consistently to every customer entering the store as well informing them about the benefits of the company's credit or rewards card program."
good,"Always being attentive to my department, having great product knowledge on merchandise and being able to up sell my best customer on favorite items of the season or just basic merchandise they may need for their wardrobe. Always following up with my customers to recap the shopping experience they've had with me through personal hand-written letters, emails, and phone calls sometimes text."
good,"If you love sales and fashion, this place is for you. I learned new ways of selling products effectively . Management was very good about giving constructive criticism. As all sales jobs are, there is a bit of competition, but nothing too overwhelming. Very personable experience given to shoppers at Nordstrom"
good,sales commission base. Worked in women's clothing and mens furnisnings.
good,"I come in greet tables and take care of my tables. I strive to make their dining experience and enjoyable and memorable one and ensure that they want to come back and dine with us. Every situation is different as is my interaction with every customer. My coworkers have good days and bad days and sometimes it's challenging to get everyone on the same page for that day and for service. The days when we are all on the same page service is at it's best and we have no customer complaints since everything went smoothly. Hardest part of the job is finding the perfect balance with doing what is right for the business, customers and the employees. The thing I love about my job is seeing a returning customer come back because they love the food the service and the atmosphere of the café. When a customer tells me that the food and the service was great it puts a smile on my face."
good,"I was a 2 time All Star and achieved Pacesetter status each year I worked for Nordstrom.  My sales were the highest in the store each year I worked for them.  "
good,Employee controls his/her salary. Flexible hours. Open-door policy allows room for employment advancement.
good,"Nordstrom is a wonderful place to work!  You are empowered to own and drive your own personal trade and business, which makes every day and every interaction unique.  I have been able to cultivate wonderful relationships with my clientele and co workers while sharpening my leadership, management and customer service skills.  The hardest part about working at Nordstrom would be the inconsistent shift schedule.  However, there are so many positives that outweigh that one negative.  Nordstrom provides a fun and high energy environment with wonderful management opportunities and benefits."
good,This is the best retailer to work for.  Wouldn't go anywhere else for sales.
good,"Fun Place to Work"
good,"I enjoyed working at Nordstrom, but my issue was just the travel time, it was pretty far and transportation along with crazy shift hours became an issue"
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for if you are in the right location.  Nordstrom company allows you as an employer to build your own clientele.  Nordstrom also gives you the opportunity to ""be your own employer"" by creating your own commission sales."
good,"I worked in the BP department apart of the Fashion Board Internship.  I merchandised the clothing and dressed mannequins.  It was a high volume store with heavy foot traffic, so multitasking was key!"
good,Nordstrom was a great company to work for. ON a daily basis you can expect to me new and exciting people.
good,great company overall but if selling is what you want to do for a living then it'll be great for you. Those slow months really drag and most of the store is commission
good,Such a fun environment to work and push yourself to achieve new goals everyday!
good,Learned that I was actually able to perform customer service well. It was fast-paced and went by quickly.
good,"Great company but mobility is required"
good,If you are a pretty self sufficient and knowledgeable person this job is perfect for you. Work hard and strive to learn more you will move up quickly. Nordstrom likes to hire from within so promotions happen often if you put forth good work.
good,Great place to work for. The supervisors are very helpful. Also very good pay.
good,"The internship program is very sales oriented, which confused me at first but makes complete sense to me now. Nordstrom has a good philosophy and working for them is good because they hire from within."
good,Innovation and bias towards action are strongly encouraged. Lack of on-boarding process makes it difficult to maintain legacy culture outside of the stores.
good,Excellent employees and great customers!  Easy to come to work everyday and build customer relations.  Our team is always finding new ways to uphold great customer service.  In addition our customers provide feedback daily on their shopping experiences.  This way we know we are doing a great job.  Customer suggestions are always welcomed.  There is an open door policy at Nordstrom.
good,Nordstrom's culture of the customer first is thoroughly embedded in all of its operations.
good,"Process and merchandise shipment"
good,My co-workers were fun and easy to work with. Working here allows you to obtain great leadership skills and communication skills. Also efficiency is a great asset to the job. You learn how to work quickly yet efficiently.
good,Good money. You have to have a entrepuenural spirit.And be in a good section. My manager was nice cant speak for all the managers. You can work with sharks which could get annoying !
good,"•	Performed Merchandise stocking and ensured the store was kept according to company’s standards "
good,"like most jobs, had to be clocked in on the dot. some managers were heartless and cared about themselves. but that's more of a review on an individual not so much the company"
good,Great company to work with.Learnt new technologies when working here.
good,Good place to work but issues with not enough products in stock which resulted in lack of business.
good,"good place to work, good people and company advancement."
good,Work on commission. Managers are resourceful. Co workers are mindful and helpful.
good,"If you like to do customer service work, you will love working at Nordstrom rack.  You get to meet new people and famous ones."
good,"On a daily basis i had to unload and load merchandise, unpack and pack merchandise"
good,"Responsible for holding daily morning and mid shift meetings. Controlling labor costs, ordering and  scheduling within budget according to year over year performance and daily sales forecasts."
good,I learned how to take inventory and how to use their scan gun.
good,"Like any retail establishment there are slow days and good days. However, Nordstrom taught me how to build my own business & market my abilities as a sales person. The hardest part of the job is cold calling & being rejected. The best part of the job was helping people who did not have a clear idea of what they wanted or struggled with self esteem etc."
good,"I absolutely loved my co-workers! I met some very dear friends here, however the management is completely unprofessional! The turn over rate is a bit crazy even in a retail setting."
good,"HIgh paced job, that requires self motivation because you are paid on commission. Some departments are over staffed."
good,"With Nordstrom Rack, you better know your merchandise. Their customers want to know about the designers and what is the materials that the merchandise is made out of."
good,"Big firm"
good,"With Nordstrom Rack, you better know your merchandise. Their customers want to know about the designers and what is the materials that the merchandise is made out of."
good,"Big firm"
good,"Very fun overall place to work for, made a lot of friends the entire time I was there."
good,Great company to work for. Great benefits! Lots of Opportunity.
good,"A normal day consist of, styling and helping clients.Locating and sending merchandis while building a relationship with them.Restocking and merchandising the floor and working the cash register.I enjoyed learning  alot about designers."
good,Nordstrom Rack is a great company to work for. There is always room for advancement.
good,"A company focused on customer service.  "
good,"A typical day at work would be responding to employee needs, completing paperwork, looking for shoplifters as well as dishonest employees. I have learned over the years great time management skills, and a sense of urgency. The hardest part of the job for me is the patience it takes to put together an internal case. I like to see fast results and with internal cases, that's not always the case. The most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers, I have been at this location for a little over three years and some of them have become like family."
good,"Working in retail sales is great for a college student but awful for anyone beyond. The hour a horrendous. But the pay is great when your a college student. Also because the hours are so fluid it is for management to work around your school schedule. Also Nordstrom has fantaxtic health benefites, and again it does pay well."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was working alongside my co-workers. The staff at Nordstrom are the most professional and the best in the business.
good,A day at work contains greeting and assisting all customers. Working with department managers to provide best customer service. An employee here will be able to learn leadership and communication skills.
good,"I enjoyed working in the inddors, meeting new people, and the hours where great."
good,"fun place to work, good benefits, commission based but really cool once you get the hang of it. i personally just needed to get out of retail."
good,Positive working environment for those that thrive on commission based pay.
good,As a high school/college student working at Nordstrom is fun and rewarding! Coworkers and management are nice and it's an overall fun environment to work in.
good,My days at work were only 3 days total and consisted of me taking inventory on shoes and accessories for the company. I learned to be productive with my time in order to finish by the end of the day and work with others to finish in time as well.
good,"•	Set and achieve personal sales goals while supporting the goals of the team."
good,This job showed me how to be great at displaying excellent customer service!!
good,"This company is a blast, but beware you will end up working to pay for the merchandise that you purchase there.."
good,You have the opportunity to create your own career and make as much money as you would like. Fostering relaionships is must for the job but it makes it that much more fun!
good,Loved the recognition to engage and inspire associates to do well
good,was a great place to work. fast pace. my co-workers were great. the hardest part was making sure u scanned every item.
good,"-familiarized myself with all new product"
good,"I've learned how important customer service really is. I now would do pretty much anything for one of my customers. I have learned amazing communication skills and the importance of keeping in touch with customers. I would come to work and find customers and make sure they were helped. The hardest part of my job has to be working on commission. It's tough when it's the slower months and it can be a little discouraging. The best part of the job is my personal customers and having them come in for appointments or to work with me. It's great having someone trust you to make them feel great. My co-workers are great and I've met some great people but it is very competitive because it is a sales and commission based job. The management is good and bad at times. I feel they play favorites a bit which can get a little frustrating but if you stay focused, you'll be okay."
good,very comfortable workplace.  Didn't think I would have been here that long but it's going well
good,"Very supportive and fun place to work. Great corporate culture without being too ""corporate"". I was able to use interpersonal and logistic skills while given the opportunity to build my own business under the Nordstrom umbrella. Rewarding in that you could get constant feedback from customers and coworkers. "
good,"In the Seattle techie ecosystem, Nordstrom is definitely a late entrant, but they're working hard to catch up quickly. A bit of a split personality at times when it comes to online, they attempt to balance rich customer experiences that inspire with optimizing experiences that sell. Managers work hard to support rather than manage which helps foster a servant leadership culture."
good,"The core value at Nordstrom is providing outstanding customer service. As a sales associate each day is about creating and maintaining customer relationships and ensuring each and every customer who walks through the doors is greeted, serviced and satisfied with their experience. Management is promoted from within the company, so every department manager, store manager, buyer or regional merchandiser has been a sales person. Co-workers are competitive but friendly. I enjoy the daily interaction with customers, and the competitive atmosphere that makes me strive to work hard and meet and exceed my sales goals. "
good,"great time working with customers, sales position,great associates to work with, great managers, they are friendly and nice, always willing to help out."
good,"One of the best jobs I ever had. Management is very hands on with selling techniques, checking in to see how you were in regards to customers and rest of staff. Small team (depending on department). Commissioned based job. Made you aware of store history."
good,"Nordstrom was a fantastic place to further my skills. The management was laid-back, but thorough with instructions and clear on what goals my department, team, and myself as an individual needed to meet. There was always an open door policy, and I learned a tremendous amount about teamwork, accuracy, and time management."
good,I learned great customer service skills and time management. The hardest part for me was cross-selling being that you have to have great product knowledge.
good,The opportunities with this company allowed me to develop management skills in an environment that puts customer service first. Outstanding customer relations are a foundation to carry into all future business ventures.
good,"I've learned many valuable Loss Prevention and Management techniques at Nordstrom, all while meeting new and interesting people."
good,"the job is student friendly, but advancement is only given to employees who truly fit the Nordstrom culture. The benefits, 401k, medical and dental are solid and are best aspects of working at nordstrom."
good,Nordstrom is a really great company to work for with a lot of room for advancement if you choose. It is a fast paced environment where things are constantly changing. You must be comfortable with computers to work in the call center.
good,A great company to work for with good benefits package.
good,Nordstrom is a really great company to work for with a lot of room for advancement if you choose. It is a fast paced environment where things are constantly changing. You must be comfortable with computers to work in the call center.
good,A great company to work for with good benefits package.
good,"I was hired at Nordstrom in Redondo Beach to work their half-yearly sale. The position was temporary and lasted for two weeks. While at Nordstrom I learned the importance of selling the merchandise to maximize your personal earning potential. Though I enjoyed that as an employee you have the power to earn as much or as little as you would like, I did not like the pressure that commission sales puts on an individual and I found that to be the hardest part of the job. Overall Nordstrom was a learning experience for me; I learned the ins and outs of commission sales and how to talk to customers to help them find that perfect outfit."
good,great way to expand your customer service and retail experience
good,"• Performed cashiering duties to include receiving cash, checks, and charge payments."
good,"It was a good experience considering i was from out of town,they welcomed me like i was family"
good,Obsessing over fashion magazines no longer interferes with my job responsibilities because knowing what the fashionistas are wearing helps me style women more efficiently. I love transferring my love of fashion from the pages to the person.
good,"Nordstrom was an amazing company to work for, great environment, staff and opportunities to grow within the company."
good,"Because there's a different sale everyday- everything you do on a daily basis impacts the business right away- instant gratification, very rewarding."
good,"Stock merchandise, learn about inventory, work at a accurate schedule"
good,"Worked for Customer Retention for about a year. Great management team, easy-going environment. Good pay."
good,"Nordstrom allows you to run your business the way you see fit. Great work environment, co-workers become closest friends."
good,Nordstrom is a great company. I learned a lot about customer service while working with the company. Nordstrom's is a elite in fine customer service. I enjoy working for them.
good,Everyday was different. It was a very active job. I loved helping people face to face. It was a great atmosphere to work in. Nordstrom is a commission based salary company it is great for college students because you can basically make as much money as you want for the day. You can make a lot more money than a person working a minimum full- time job; than a person only working part time at Nordstrom.
good,A typical day at work is fast paced and very satisfying. There has been a complete revamp of new management in the recent years. This has caused much disappointment from myself and many of my co workers. However my coworkers were great people and I am actually good friends with all of them. The hardest part of the job was adapting to new management. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was dealing with many interesting people and being able to service them to their enjoyment.
good,"I held many rolls during my time at this company. Starting out as a sales associate, working on a commission basis. I would assist customers, suggest items to them based on their need and popularity of items, ring sales and follow-up with customers after to ensure they are satisfied with their purchase and notify them of new items that would be of interest to them in the future. I was selected to be in the company's Management Program and was promoted to an assistant management position and then to a management position where I was paid a salary plus commission and several new responsibilities added. Supervision of staff, creating the monthly schedule, and running department meetings, resolved any employee conflicts and dealt with any customer issues or concerns as well as rotating with other managers on a monthly basis of being Manager in Charge of the entire store when the Store Manager left for the day or was off for the day."
good,"Assist customers with payments, purchases, account research and inquiries. Banking and Accounting duties. Provide change as need to sales associates."
good,Enjoyed working there and working with people and getting clients to sit and give them consultations.
good,"Nordstrom is already an amazing place to work for; just ask Fortune! The Rack is like an outlet except BETTER than most! Typical day in the store would include Go-backs from the fitting rooms and the Customer Service desk. Of course assisting customers with what they are looking for, giving a second opinion, or just making sure that they get our latest store events. All of the managers are passionate about what they do, especially the store manager!"
good,Excellent environment with a varied staff that each understands their strengths and weaknesses. Management that sees your potential and works towards moving you forward.
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to learn more about or perfect your customer service skills. It was great to be able to help find customers their next great outfit. Some great co-workers, some not. It was a commission based job, so some workers tend to steal sales or lie about you to make the boss dislike you. The only part I disliked about it being commission based is that there were slow seasons, like the summer when people were away, but for the most part, I loved working in retail where I was constantly up to date with fashion and able to interact with the public."
good,"I sold Women's shoes. A typical day would include completing your stock duties, then selling for the rest of your shift. Learned a great deal about customer service. I met some of the greatest people in my life working for Nordstrom. I have worked for 4 different stores, and have found amazing people in all of them. You definitely work for you money, but it is worth it. Overall a great company to work for."
good,I learned a lot being with the company for 6 years. You learn all business procedures. The hardest part of the job I would say is the customers. Sometimes they take advantage of you. But overall a good place to work. Working on a commission only jobs is kind of tough but once you get the swing of things you get paid pretty well.
good,"Pay is good, horrible management. Have to wear full suit at all times. I tend to break a sweat at work from running up and downstairs."
good,"I love Nordstrom. They easily have the best customer service culture in the world. Compensation could have been better. It was inconsistent and mostly based on commission. Benefits were hit or miss based off how many hours worked and how many hours scheduled was based off of performance. Management was awful at the Richmond, VA location and most employees left in a mass exodus to ouro close competitor Saks due to the managers of Nordstrom being glorifed slave drivers. In the end the job was exhausting day to day especially if you were in shoe sales. It was so exhausting that outside of work if was difficult to find the energy to do anything else or even look for a new job. Overall, i could consider this job again if i was in better control of the pace of things, also if the pay and the benefits weren't so inconsistent i could see it being a full time job. Seeing as those attributes won't change any time soon, not to mention I can only seeing the management getting worse by the day."
good,"Enjoyed working at Nordstrom.  There are always things that people wish they could change or don't agree with but all in all, great company with great opportunites."
good,"Return policy to flexible. Not enough base salary. Thank you very much!!"
good,Retail works suck but most of the people I worked with were amazing. There is great opportunity to move up and make some real money if you know what you are after.
good,"Nordstrom was a great place to work. Great employees and great atmosphere. My only complaint was management. That's not including my manager, i'm talking about the floor managers."
good,"I had a pretty great experience working here. The people were nice, the environment was overwhelming but exciting, and my job wasn't too hard or too easy. I loved the fast pace, fun atmosphere, and great people. Although the job could be challenging, (I have never been one to back from a challenge) it also provided some stellar learning experiences."
good,A good place to work and allows many opportunities for advancement. There are many areas where you can be cross trained and everyone is always willing to help you achieve your goals.
good,"The people who work there and the pay are nice. However, the schedule can be demanding and changes very frequently. The benefits aren't that great either. The warehouse managers can be quite arrogant as well, but the department managers are usually pretty nice."
good,It was a good experience being that it was only a seasonal position. I worked in the accessories department and would go up to fill in for cashier whenever I was needed. My main choice was cashier but it wasn’t available during that time.
good,Great company to work for the pay was amazing they give raises fairly. management was easy to talk to and always willing to help. A lot of politics but if you can ignore that then you can survive working here over all good to work at just always watch your back.
good,"Management there didn't really want to promote you if you did well at your job because they didn't want to replace you. Easy job, but not worth the time and effort if you're not going to go anywhere."
good,Nordstrom was a great place for the 11 years I was there. Inclusion is a big opportunity at Nordstrom. Promotion is available however people of color can only get but so far.
good,I have been in the working hours of different types of the week and I will be there only as seasonal my job here is to package orders for customer and make sure it gets there at a timely manner and keeping a clean area.
good,"They had good benefits with 410K. They also do a lot of the community, such as helping the Habitat For Humanity and the local food bank. The people I worked with were a great team of people."
good,Company cares about employees. Nordstrom offerd employee great benefits. I really enjoyed working for this company. Friendly environment and the pay is great.
good,"Providing excellent service to every customer through all available channels is the typical day at Nordstrom. The customers and product change, but the mission remains the same. Nordstrom has a very strong workplace culture and is eager to promote from within and develop internal staff. "
good,"I left because I was in school and was given more shifts than I could handle. The first manager I had was fantastic and hard working, and the last manager I had made it really easy to leave. That being said, Nordstrom is a great environment to work in and the pay is great."
good,"So many things to do on a daily basis."
good,"flexibility is great here. "
good,"they want u to feel as if it is your own business. U have your targets to reach and expect to provide an exceptional customer service."
good,"Management depends on your location, overall great place to work, discount is a bonus. Overall would recommend as a company. great experience working there for 4 years"
good,I worked in the picking department. I enjoyed it because i got to walk around all night and pick orders to be shipped. I was just a seasonal worker. Over all it was a pretty positve experience working there.
good,Great first job! Learned a great deal about sales. If you are looking to enter the retail world nordstrom is the best company to be at! Great training and great products to sell
good,"fun job when your in your 20's.  Extremely costomer focused but sales driven.  I was always looking forward to work the next day, not often do you find that company culture."
good,Nordstrom provides a great starting culture with a lot of options to moves into a better career path to fit your needs and wants. It’s supportive and helps challenge you to your full potential
good,Not too much room for advancement if you do know anyone higher up. The company tend to have favorites. Higher management may not be aware of how service center reps are not treated fairly.
good,Most of the managers are content where they are so it leaves a slim chance for growth. Online shopping is taking over in person shopping which makes it because it is 100% commission. In store volume is decreasing every year because the internet is taking over.
good,Not a bad place to work at but had the same issues you would expect any other retailer to have. Management is decent and the employees are diverse so you can find any type of person there.
good,Nordstrom had a great system but it seems to be failing now. They used to pride themselves on hiring from within but for years I've watch countless coworkers never get the opportunity to move to the next position. If you start on the retail side The chances of you moving to corporate are non existent. You'd be better off applying directly to corporate and never step foot on the retail end. Thetheyno longer hire within.The company has good benefits but the salary is not worth the cost of living nor the ever changing schedule.
good,I worked in various departments in various cities. The company is a great company to work for and employees have many opportunities to gain product knowledge.
good,"a typical day at work starts with understanding the tasks and the goals for your department. organization is a must. as you first start out, it may seem  like chaos but during your training weeks you they make sure you are well prepared. Management will do everything in their power to make sure you succeed."
good,"Fun place to work if you like fashion, but difficult  to make your sales goals as customers switch to online ordering.  Great if you work in a busy department with higher price. points and larger commissions.  Long days on your feet and with downsizing it is difficult to get promoted nowadays.  I feel that I left the company at the right rime."
good,"I made the most most money during the holidays, which has its downside. You have attainable goals set an they're easy to meet, the problem is Nordstrom's ""no-hassle return policy"", good for the customer, bad for sales associate. They return like theres no tomorrow and by your next set goal you're probably looking at 1 or 2k in returns daily, depending on what you sold. "
good,"Everyone is competing against each other. Viciously! I enjoyed the people I worked with though. It's many long hours of being on your feet and when it's slow, you are not getting the sales you need and if you don't sell enough, you get a warning and then let go. I happen to move on before that ever happened."
good,"I think Nordstrom is a good place to work for someone who is competitive in making commission and doesn't mind super busy shifts and moving around a lot. It wasn't for me, but it has good benefits and it gives you experience on how to work fast pace in a popular store."
good,Overall Nordstrom is a great company to work for. It recently went through an infrastructure change that makes it slightly more difficult for career advancement. You will be happy in your role and have longevity if placed in a strong district with good peers.
good,It's a great place to work if you're in school. I had a great work/ school/ life balance and the culture is open and progressive. Management can be hit or miss depending on location.
good,Nordstrom was a fun but stressful place to work. Very competitive and high school like sometimes but the discounts and freebies were awesome!! Managment was awful however.
good,"I loved working there as a Business Manager. The culture and the people there were great. They really give you the oppportunity to grow, I started there as a part timer and 4 months in I was offered a Management position."
good,"Best place to work so far. Great support from all levels of corporation. "
good,"pros: great company, advancement opportunities, relocation opportunities, awesome people. leader in the retail industry, consistently looking for ways to improve customer service. "
good,"every job has its pros & cons. "
good,As a former employee of Nordstrom is teamwork was a very significant part of our success on a day-to-day basis the staff and management made sure that the staff morel was a boost every morning an afternoon. A high regard for cultural differences and quality was placed on each and every employee.
good,"You can grow quickly with this company.  They are big on customer service.  Nordstrom rack is a very fast paced work environment.  The rack is more task oriented, where Full Line Nordstrom is more Customer oriented."
good,honestly working here was ok i worked here close to 3 years i never really had any issues. Management can be a huge pain tho they lack communication and will throw anyone under the bus regardless of who it is or what the situation is.
good,Not bad of a place to work. Not enough hours to go around though. Mainly worked part time hours even though I asked for more hours. But overall a nice place to work
good,"The people on staff at Nordstrom are trained well in customer service. Because it is a sales job the are very motivated. However, there is a lack of qualified employees. Most employees and managers only have a GED and start after high school."
good,"Nordstrom was a very trendy place to work, I loved working for dior at nordstrom. Vacation time or any time off is very hard to get working there. Im glad im done with retail"
good,Working with the people at Nordstrom has allowed me to create some of the most important relationships and connections in my life. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of working with the various teams that I went through during my time with the company. The hardest part of the job is trusting company leadership to make the right decisions.
good,Our store manager was very careless and rude. I ended up quitting also because my immediate manager had been texting rude things about me and my coworker and our assistant manager showed us. It might have been unprofessional of her to do that but I’m thankful for it now because I get to leave that horrible place with its horrible management.
good,"Being able to work there really depends if you have a high tolerance for pushy coworkers. Management is good, there are a lot of things you have to accomplish and you're responsible for a lot of stuff. Nordstrom is a well oiled machine, it's just infuriating that they take returns into account and deduct it from your commission."
good,"I have worked here for many years, in various roles, and feel as though it is difficult for me and my co-workers to maintain a work life balance. Overtime and work done outside of regular hours go unnoticed."
good,Great company to work for if you are new to retail/sales. Its a fun environment to be in. The management team is fairly attentive and seems interested in making sure that they build you for success.
good,"Taught me a lot about customer service, and helped me feel more comfortable with helping people.  Made me a more organized person.  Difficult to work at Nordstrom and go to school at the same time however."
good,"A great work environment with friendly employees. Anything goes with regards to the dress code, whatever is fashion-forward and work appropriate goes. A little hard to make enough commission for a sizable paycheck."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Nordstrom Rack. Recommended if you don’t mind retail hours. They have good benefits and the managers were nice. I can’t speak for Headquarters or Home office, because I only worked retail location."
good,"Management is very organized and treats employees well. Decent pay, but not a lot of freedom in choosing hours when to work. Would mostly be doing the same two tasks the whole day"
good,"Great benefits but schedule makes a hard work life balance. They really do promote within IF you are willing to move all over the country for them. If you want to stay local, theres only so much room to move"
good,"Nordstrom was a fun, exciting place to work but in the slow months the days definitely dragged on. And the pay is never consistent which is always hard."
good,Being a picker was fast paced and you had to be accurate. You'd have a scanner and you scan a product to make sure you grabbed the right item. You'd then sort your items into bins depending on their size to go to packaging.
good,"Depending on the day it can be either stressfully busy, or very slow. I enjoy working with customers, but occasionally you have to deal with some tough service issues. Also hours can be difficult working a lot of weekends, and having split off days such as Monday and Wednesday off."
good,"I had a good experience there, the culture was wonderful.  The management was good, definitely a good place for someone with a selling focused background that wants to grow within the organization.  At the time that I was there (2001-2014) their open door policy was very apparent and they listened to the employees, by taking on new ideas & suggestions."
good,The job is fairly easy most associates are lively and friendly but some staff are just ridiculous and hard to work with. The customers are really great.
good,Not enough employees in Nordstrom Rack stores. Very demanding time and sales goals in the Nordstrom full line stores. Upper management is overly stressed. Very good on advance technology.
good,For a new company things got up and running smoothly.  But management was poor.  The co-workers were great. The job was relatively easy. I enjoyed being able to move to other departments.
good,"Most days are basically the same. Come in and check in with a manager and get stock/merchandising tasks for our floor.(not all departments do this, just my experience.)"
good,"I worked for Nordstrom for three years some time ago, and I worked for their main distribution center at the time, so this review may not be relevant - a lot could have changed since I was there. One of my favorite things about working there, though, was the people. The team environment was strong, the people were dedicated to the job and to each other, the support was wonderful. The company began shifting, particularly in the direction of management and goals, and it wasn't a fit for me at the end. I'm not sure how it is now, but the strength of the people and the support at the time was unparalleled."
good,"As you climb down the pyramid of leadership, job security becomes a concern based on your popularity and seniority. Favoritism existed throughout the corners of every department. The culture is amazing when customers are the center focus. I loved mentoring and growing my team as a servant leader and as a peer salesperson."
good,"Flexible hours, customer service driven and team work building position that teaches appropriate communication, professionalism, and how to handle various situations"
good,"Working with Nordstrom was nice, I started when the St. Louis Galleria location opened and I met a ton of great people. I have seen many changes in the company good and bad. Overall it was a nice experience."
good,"Can be more consistent with return policies across the company board so employees are confident when following “return guidelines “."
good,"Fast pace sales job. highly competitive between employees. Workplace culture is fun, many self motivated associates who love fashion and keep on top of trends!"
good,"Your competitive abilities are challenged daily.  The people are great, and if you are the right fit, you will enjoy your time here.  The management was understanding and very supportive."
good,Working during the anniversary sale hours are long and go by quickly. Management is reasonable and always a pleasure to be around. I know a lot is expected from those who are commission based and numbers are important for Nordstrom.
good,"Very busy and faced paced"
good,Nordstrom paid significantly more than other businesses within the area I lived in. The management was great and would work with you to achieve goals.
good,Nordstrom is for people that only want to work. If you want some form of social life then don't work there. You will regularly have to work 6 days a week 10 hours a day and depending on the job all you will want to do is sleep when you're off work.
good,Everyone in the workplace was dedicated to their work and advancement. I enjoyed most of the people that I worked with. It was a very competitive environment which sometimes would affect the level of comfortability in the workplace environment.
good,"Nordstrom in general was an awesome company to work for. I had a bunch of fun, made some good money and was able to grow and learn about the sales industry. Met a lot of long time friends and clients there and really enjoyed my time working there. Also helped me prepare and figure out what I wanted to do with my career in the future."
good,Pay is great.. benefits are normal. They are willing to train for any spot in the warehouse. Gives anyone a chance to move up in the company. Lots of overtime. Has a cafeteria. Only 10mins for breaks but 30min unpaid lunch is provided.
good,"Learned a lot about fine jewelry and sales. Sometimes high pressure when everyone came in at once and low-staff, but when not enough traffic, felt like too many people on staff. Good learning experience, especially to learn high-end products and conduct self in high-stress setting with sometimes unpleasant customers and difficult situations."
good,its was a fun job for the most part. making relationships with customers and being able to make them feel good about themselves was a plus. your co workers and management were great although you do feel like the higher ups are looking for any reason to fire you
good,"Nordstrom was where I cut my teeth as a young professional. The fast paced environment helped me build out strong skills in time management and working under pressure. I was there for a good amount of time but found it hard to have my pay increased, even when I went up for promotions or achieved milestones. They emphasize that you can sell more to make more, however when you are running a floor generating millions it takes administrative time away from your opportunity to sell, also your staff only makes commission and as a leader I could not morally take a sell over them."
good,"there is a competition aming sales man, a one for one attidue. there is not a team effort, make sure you look out for yourself because the management will not enforce lists."
good,"I believe Nordstrom is good to their employees in upper management, but it is hard to get a position higher than a sales associate. You have to go through their internship program or work for the company for 5+ years. The turn around rate for sales associates is very high."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for. The discounts are wonderful,  pay raises are automatic every 1,000 hrs worked,  and the merchandise is amazing.  Unfortunately,  if the store manager and dept managers are based,  then it's pretty much a never ending hole. Many employees are unable to advance or transfer of management didn't want it to happen,  directed HR would listen but not much changed,  and if store manager is always putting budget above everything,  understaffed to the extreme to stay under projected budget."
good,"The Comission culture was very competitive. In some way it was unhealthy, but the corporate culture is very nice and the working environment was very professional."
good,"I learned many great things from Nordstrom in the field of sales. If you're looking to get your feet wet in retail Nordstrom is the spot to do so. I would highly recommend finding out what your personal drive is, and if you're able to sacrifice time."
good,I have enjoyed working in retail for the past 4 years. Working for Nordstrom has been my favorite job but I need some change of work environment. I’m looking for a new opportunities to widen my interest and help me grow as a person.
good,"Dont think its a good job for promising promotion"
good,A typical day at Nordstrom is one where you learn and grow with your team. The hardest part of the job was losing someone on the team. I had a high expectation for my team to come together and be one unit t all times. Our mantra was were going to win together or lose together.

good,A great company to work for. They offer great flexibility and a good work/life balance. I worked in mens shoes and they've an incredible selection and size array for any age.
good,"Inconsistent scheduling and long store hours made for a difficult work-life balance. Compensation was fair for the amount of actual work we did, but a lot of downtime on slower days. As a salesperson, good money to be made during the special events and holidays, but otherwise just a lot of busywork keeping things running nicely for management's sake."
good,I loved woking just wish i wasn't seasonal. the workplace was very competitive but had its ups. was very into how the workplace looked i.e cleanliness.
good,Working at Nordstrom was rewarding. The work/life balance was difficult as the hours are long and inconsistent. Overall I enjoyed working for this company.
good,"There’s room for more improvement. I didn’t hate working here, but I didn’t like it as well. I found the work to be very repetitive. Very slow with growth. Management could’ve been a little bit nicer and respectful."
good,"Competent at managing responsibilities in a high-volume atmosphere."
good,"it was a commissioned sales position so with that you income is basted entirely upon your performance.  "
good,Learned that our industry is career and success driven. I loved seeing my co-workers succeed along with me. Made great relationships that have now become friends/family.
good,great company to work for. but little to know chance for growth since the company started merging departments. you will have to move out of the state of VA
good,I love my manager and the trust she instills with me to do my job. I work in an area where collaboration is critical and so communication is a key factor to success.
good,workers were great to work with. ethics and a lot of politics came up because is a competitive work environment but nevertheless is was nice worker here.
good,This was a good Summer job. I got to work as much as I wanted and make as much as I wanted based on my ability to sell which I loved that.  The only bad part were the inconsistent work schedules .
good,Overall NR was a great place to work. I enjoyed opening the store and becoming part of History in the Making.  We were the first NR in SC.  It was enlightening and I enjoyed meeting the different associates and management team that came from previous stores to offer their expertise.
good,"This jobs give your the hours promised, but does not use your experience in the "
good,"I would prepare everything on the front end for the restaurant to open for the day. A lot of the people i worked with spent more time talking than working, so unfortunately i had to pick up a lot of slack. I did like the store it was absolutely gorgeous, they had just remodeled. I ended up being offered a position in a higher paying department, working overnight and i accepted that job. It was almost the perfect job, couldn't ask for any better."
good,"I loved my time at Nordstrom. I was hoping to make a career out of it. Unfortunately the Store Manager at the time made it difficult to grow with the company. I was an All-Star Sales person and loved my job and personal clients. Due to the Store Manager enforcing every single return with no questions asked, I was seeing less income and less opportunity for growth."
good,"Working at this Nordstrom was entertaining, the store stays pretty busy and we had a good client flow from the college and the culture in St. Louis is great for the makeup and skincare industry!!"
good,It's a sales job so numbers are the most important part of the day. Management was sicky-sweet nice. I enjoyed my coworkers as individuals but you have to be a shark to survive there.
good,This company is a Great place to work and learn from. Myself personally have learned a great amount of knowledge from my prior Managers. I now am a Manager and enjoy my job. I want to make a Career with Nordstrom if possible.
good,"it's a good place to work if you like clothing and discounts, it is a fun place to work for the pay not so much but it balances out with the discount you get."
good,But company policies don't always trickle down to department heads. Talk to the other employees in that department about their manager's strengths and limitations and see if they're a right fit for your work style.
good,"The company continues to grow & keep up with the fashion trends. Although providing excellent customer service has always been an important quality that Norfstrom has exceeded in accomplishing, the care and concern the conpany has for its sales associates meeting their daily goals has completely diminished."
good,"Fun place to work but didn't have fun or enjoyed with commission based pay/environment. Managers were always friendly. Hours are not flexible at all, barely got any days off"
good,"Good Environment, don't get too comfortable,  use the opportunity to grow and go. Takes persistence to move up the ladder. Very event driven with strong emphasis on sales per hour and daily/monthly goals."
good,"I enjoyed working with Nordstrom for over three years. There was always room for constant growth in the company. "
good,"This was my first job, I adapted very quickly and I’m very confident with how well I do my job. Also feel as if some employees slack and i fill in doing most things. The management could use some work, I feel as if the managers are very unprofessional, favors some employees from others. The job is overall a good job but I feel that at times things can be unfair."
good,"Competitive environment of course because It was based on commission but co-workers and mangers help you a lot with building relationships."
good,Working at Nordstrom was a great opportunity to combine a passion for fashion with a dedication to delivering personalized customer experience. I learned how to share my own experience with dressing with customers to create customized wardrobes.
good,"I really liked working here but they have folks that have been working there for quite some time, so they got all the best shifts, It was very competitive and a lot of favoritism towards senior employees."
good,"It is a great part time job. Management was fairly decent, the work place was very friendly, I learned a lot more about makeup and different cosmetic products."
good,"Although just a seasonal job, they were very welcoming and supportive to me and my other seasonal co-workers. All management was patient and willing to help."
good,it was a pleasant experience working at nordstroms I'm just looking for a more set schedule to fit my family need as i have two young children whom need me for school and such.
good,Good place to work at. Management was nice but didn't encourage everyone to move up and grow. Not enough sales. Customers were shopping online rather than in store.
good,"Nordstrom still one of the top companies in retails, but there are few things still need to work on in term of its employees. For instance: ranking of schedule, they are not fair to new people."
good,As a support worker my answers are different than sales staff. The opportunity to advance is only available to those willing to travel to a different location. Management tends to not be connected to support staff and their concerns. Great benefits. Good work otherwise.
good,"It's a very fast paced environment, but definitely a nice place to work at. They pay above minimum wage. The hardest part was most likely finding solutions to problems that could easily be solved due to preexisting (not working) solutions. The best part was being able to talk to people and help them."

good,I started out as a regular sales associate and worked my way up I wont awards and was recognized by customers and my peers I learned a lot and worked hard it
good,"Great place to learn customer service. If you are a seasoned sales associate, look elsewhere.  The pay is low compared to other commission retail and growth is very slow."
good,"Nordstrom is commission based so your entire paycheck depends on your customer service. Returns get deducted from your check as well which is a downside. However, Nordstrom is a fast paced, friendly competitive work place where theres room to grow. Management is friendly and responsive to any issues you have as well."
good,"Fun place to work, good benefits!  Typical 9-5  hours, on call required. Great portfolio inventory, no junk properties at this management company always felt safe!!"
good,norstrom was fun to work one hr break and if you concentrate on your sales you will make a good living . there was room to grow if you get lots of hours but most is part time because if you reach the 1000.00 hrs they will have to give you benefits .but in for the most it was a fun place .
good,"Okay company, a lot of hard workers and a lot of things you can learn from them. If you work hard, your efforts will generally be noticed. It's hard to give up a lot of important times in your life to work, though."
good,My time at Nordstrom Rack was great for what it was. The company culture is awesome if you subscribe to it. It can be competitive but in the end everyone wins. I learned a lot from them.
good,"Worked in their HQ near Pike Place Market, so it was an awesome location and views were forever.  Distinctive culture compared to other big Pacific Northwest companies I've worked, at, fun and upbeat.  Structure lacking in many areas, I got the impression that management preferred it this way to promote an ad-hoc culture. "
good,Fun and open-minded high end retail.  Great vendor trainings and exposure.  There are a lot of great and experinced people working all over this store!
good,"Typical work day is 9am-5pm, with very little need to work after hours. You might find the tech to be dated here, so don't come in expecting top of the line systems with easy access to data. A lot of manual excel processes exist. General culture is fairly laid back, however this can vary from team to team. The hardest part of the job in my opinion is dealing with the lack of visibility to data and control over suppliers."
good,I was a great place to start off for a first job. I learned skills regarding customer service and how to work in a fast-paced environment. There was definitely competitiveness between sales associate.
good,"I did enjoy the experience of working for Nordstrom, however, knowing what I know now its best for someone who is highly committed to the Retail Industry."
good,"Because the company does not have exact rules to follow, you might have managers that are amazing at what they do and how they treat you, and you may have some that do not exactly understand their role."
good,"A typical day at work incuded standing for your entire shift and assisting customers/coworkers with floor merchandise. I learned that working in sales is tough because your success does not always reflect the hard work you put in. My manager and assistant manager were both very sweet, helpful, and understanding. The culture was great because the people were so alike in terms of personality. Returns were the hardest part of the job because they would be deducted from the current pay period. What I enjoyed most was working in the fashion industry but I hated working on weekends and holidays."
good,There is good money to be made with retail sales with Nordstrom. The management has become more and more convoluted from the bottom up. The initial idea of a more employee-centric company is no longer the case within the company.
good,"It was fun to work here and great discounts, just no growth opportunities. The commute was challenging and was the primary reason for resigning. I managed the espresso bar so never really fit into the rest of the store's departments."
good,Very forward thinking company willing to let employees be who they are. Got into many disputes over sales to customers from other salespersons.  Company very lenient return policy makes it hard to make commission sales stick.
good,Good money hard work you get paid bi weekly 2 10 minute breaks and a 35 minute lunch !! You clock in and out on a computer be your to check your hours saoly its been know for hr there to mess up on people hours
good,"Good place to work, employees are usually empowered and respected. The exception is when business is slow or in a seasonal down trough. Management style is very American and not yet adapted to the realities of Canadian retail and workplace style. Development and advancement opportunities only appear when business is good and not when it is needed such as during times of decline and when motivation is key to morale. Decent benefits for Full-Time retail staff. Flexible work hours. Customer service is amazing yet it often comes at the cost of employees compensation (return policy will effect your commission) and work hours (closing time is technically undefined as long as there are customers in the store)."
good,"Due to the way the commission is set up, people tended to be ruthless when it came to helping out customers in search of a higher commission. The discount doesn't really do much unless you plan on using it to make an expensive purchase"
good,"Use the best judgement in all situations is the Nordstrom model, they have ever all different positions above customer service and make it a point to promote from within."
good,I would recommend people for this job. Allows you to push yourself and advance in the work place and offers multiple different departments in the warehouse to experiment with.
good,"For the most part, I have been able to enjoy a good family life while maintaining a good career life as well. You definitely have to be flexible working different hours with Nordstrom, but I would recommend a career with Nordstrom."
good,"As a commissioned sales associate you have to be comfortable being fairly aggressive on the sales floor and be okay with returns. If you sell more, you make more."
good,"All around a great place to work! Nordstrom is accommodating to special requests and supportive of career growth.  There are a lot of changes happening right now, so be prepared to be quick on your feet and be able to move in a different direction at the turn of a hat."
good,"Worked at the Grove, and Nordstrom is the kind of company that cares about the kind of business your employment is capable of bringing the company and little else. Have hit wall after wall with HR and management about sleezy sales practices and about sales sleuthing (stealing sales) and they hardly bat an eye with that sort of thing. The lack of value provided to each employee is obnoxious. You are paid almost entirely on commissions, and if your team is meeting or exceeding their sales goals (even by means of stealing sales) they will do little to change what is happening."
good,It is a nice work environment. Typical retail hours. Salespeople are paid on commission. It can create a cut-throat environment. Pay fluctuates based on time of year and when sales take place. Learned great customer service skills.
good,"The best part of my job is connecting with my customers, getting to know them and their most important values. I always exceed their expectations for customer service, even by Nordstrom standards. "
good,Good commission based retail position. The pay was good during busy times of the year. Fun contests were offered. The opportunity for advancement was limited.
good,"Unsteady check outcomes due to seasons (Christmas and Anniversary Sale are the best times to work) yet, best job to work if you are in retail. Good opportunity to make above minimum wage depending on which department you are in(BP is probably the worst department to work in because it easily gets messy and for the amount of work those girls do, their commission percentage is not enough.)"
good,Nordstrom is a easy fast paid job the company quarterly meeting are fun overall a great company to work for the co workers treat you like family and having the discount is a plus
good,"I worked in the cosmetics department which happens to be one of the  more confined and most cut throat area of the entire store. Our commission wasn't very good but our hourly somewhat made up for it.The management at the time needed a HUGE improvement. With training on management and how to speak to fellow employees. Myself, along with many others, dealt with harassment of a particular manager on several occasions. Making the work place a very hostile place to work. With that being said I loved my job and I do believe that Nordstrom cares about their employees. I would work there again considering the management has changed."
good,"was also one of the customer service representatives who worked on the special project for our customer. This team struggled a lot because we had different ideas about the priorities, sequence of actions and responsibilities of the team. After a few rough weeks of work, with a lot of conflict, I suggested we hold a facilitated team meeting to help get to the root of our conflicts. "
good,"Each and everyday you would be on the selling floor selling to each and every customer that came in. The return policy is horrible and they take everything back so as a commission sales associate it was agitating every time something was returned for that reason. Being in the shoe department, people would wear the shoes to their events and bring them back the next day."
good,"I worked for the Nordstrom Product Group - it was very fast paced, very competitive but was a challenging place to work which was good.  Lots of opportunity to work on various product."
good,"Not sure what this place will look like in 2-3 years. Work is challenging and fun, people are great, managers could stand to talk to each other more to avoid miscommunication across departments. Love the store discounts."
good,"Solid company to work for. Very intent on doing things the Nordstrom way.  Unfortunately, not much room for individuality, although they stress that. Must be able to work within the culture or else not much room for growth."
good,"Honestly its not a bad job the only issues with has to do with management, If the place wants to fix any of there issues then they need to honestly go through there management team. Some managers are not cut out for it and some do not get the credit they deserve, I think they do a little to much blaming on there team and people under them then on themselves."
good,"I worked at the kids clothes department and so i get to see all the actions. A typical day is to scan for old items and take them out from the floor then organize and put all new product in front. Working with kids is great because they are just fun adorable little people. working with them also teaches you patience because you have to take time to show them around, explain things to them or how a toy works. Since they have very small attention span it teaches you more patience and understanding. "
good,The Nordstrom culture is great and the people are generally wonderful but more and more people are coming from outside that care more about the bottom line than the people.
good,"If you are looking to move forward within the retail industry, then this would most definitely be the place for you. As with most companies, if your manager acknowledges your work ethic, they will try to help advance your career with the company."
good,It was a good job they need to not count logistic item counts for when you are scheduled to box items instead of finding them because then the count is unfair for those who are packaging
good,Working i Nordstrom had me to learn much more about working with people and understanding their needs. I was able to achieve great customer service and communication skills.
good,"I was able to explore a variety of roles, and the career pathway used to be very transparent. "
good,"As a sales person you really can't be friends with your coworkers because at one point or another you will have fight hard for customers. Or, you can just sit back and watch everyone else make money. To move up in the company you really have to kiss management's butt . I have seen tons of ppl who didn't even have the requirement become managers! Not a terrible place to work, I just wish management was better."
good,"Worked in sales selling clothes, customer service sales , enjoyed my job and learned how to create window displays always on the phone looking for a certain item for customers."
good,"Very fun and competitive sales. A lot of young people work there. Best department to work in is shoes. Worked weekends, and shifts always varied. Good college job."
good,"Everyone that I worked with was friendly and supportive, and management was not too bad. They worked with what you could do and I enjoyed helping out the customers."
good,Good company to work for. There's plenty of space for advancement. 401k is competitive to other companies as well as health benifits. Would recommend to anyone
good,"Long hours on feet with plenty to do. Bare minimum of break time, stress on metrics must establish loyalty program with customers this means opening credit and debit accounts through the Bank of Nordstrom. The rewards card is top priority before sales."
good,"Occasionally preparing store for opening and closing hours"
good,"This is a great work at home position.  The management team is helpful, however they are not neutral when it comes to scheduling.  They will get information from you with a helpful approach and contact corporate and look for ways to force you to work the schedule they want.  Most of the time shift bids and exchanges are blocked."
good,Very professional place. Good place to start a job. Not so much a career. Good upper management. Good environmental. Great working conditions. Nice 8-5 job.
good,The elegance of Nordstrom speaks for itself. I eNordstrom brothers arent too big headed to not come to their store and interact with their employees. Goes a long way
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job at Nordstrom is helping people put together a wardrobe by maximizing all aspects and avenues about finding the cans, for example looks and proper fitting right down to every detail.  I always focus on the ""Can Do's"" that has made me successful.  A typical day at work is number one priority the customer, at the end of the day I want the customer to leave with a smile.  It is very important to build a relationship with a customer and once that is accomplished you will have a customer for life.  That's what makes the work culture positive when my customers return and ask specifically for me."
good,"Opportunities to advance your career, long hours, commission only salary, online sales will affect your in-store sales, long hours on your feet, compassionate management."
good,The often promote those that are not ready/inexperienced but the merchandise is outstanding plus excellent benefits as long as you maintain the necessary hours.  The downside is there is no base pay; you must make commission high enough to pay them back the hourly wage.  This is a confusing practice.
good,"I love nordstrom and working there was enjoyable but as a part time employee I was not benefited and unless you were at corporate or really high up, your schedule changed every two weeks and you had no control over it. That was a deal breaker for me becoming career nordstrom."
good,"Working At Nordstrom was Very Fast paced, they provided a great working environment and awesome on the Job training. However, managers do not communicate well with employers on updates."
good,"Overall not a bad job for being retail, if you are a salesperson you stand on a tile and greet customers all day. And general public isn't always very kind due to you earning off commission and having to push your product hard at times, which can enrage people. The management is usually decent people but they can come off fake at times but how else can you make selling overpriced clothes exciting. Also fraternization can be an issue depending on location. I've seen both and it kills the moral of the store when the upper chain doesn't see hard work when they are advancing their friends."
good,"Great place to work due to the friendly staff and the customer base.  Helping people find special outfits and accessories for their events or just for casual living was a breeze. People are nice, if you are nice to them. Always aim to make them laugh, at the very least try to get a smile!"
good,The fulfillment center in the warehouse is where I was. I enjoyed the different positions I learned and I liked the 1st and 3rd shift people and management was great. But the 2nd shift people did not make me feel welcomed and I was very saddened by this. I feel that the second shift people did not like me because I was foreign and a Muslim.
good,Good place to work because you get to work with people and paid for your ability to connect. You also get the opportunity to advance into leadership if you perform well.
good,Here you have to be very creative and knowledgeable because you are with a great group of competitive human talent that are drive and wants to be the best they could at what they are doing.
good,"When I started at Nordstrom I worked in Cosmetics, the culture of the company is fast-paced and upbeat. After store managers changed there was quickly a change in morale. Store managers and department managers need to be chosen wisely. The store manager was discriminatory and favorited certain employees, would not engage or even say hello to most employees. Very rude and working for the store quickly became disheartening. Very hard to make goals in a retail environment but co-workers and customers were, for the most part, fun to work with. There are pretty unattainable sales goals, especially considering the internet is our biggest competitor. But the overall morale and working conditions were excellent. The company truly looks after it's employees. Managers and store managers should be stringently looked at before placing them in certain positions/stores. Some people are just not a good fit. The manager in my department before leaving was vindictive and petty, took pleasure in firing people or reprimanding people. Manager before that was a very supportive and easy to work with individual."
good,I like working for the Nordstrom warehouse however I feel that I have more to offer than the work they've assigned to me. I also prefer not to work at night.
good,They are a good company to work for the management team was supportive and they seemed like they were wanting to help and better the employees i believe compensation should be greater then it was considering all the information that takes place
good,Fun atmosphere. Decent employee discount on store merchandise. Nordstrom does have opportunities for benefits and 401K. Sometimes difficult to make sales in certain departments.
good,"A typical day, i will arrive to either open or close the shift. Do some prep, clean accordingly to the day; as well as executing food orders. What I liked the most was the schedule, you can go in early but you don't leave late due to being located inside the store. Management varies, as in any other restaurant. At the moment the management team cannot get their act together. The hardest part about the job at the moment is trying to reach an agreement over anything; the managers all have an opinion and do not sit together to agree on a ""right or wrong"" way of doing things. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that it is a small restaurant and you really get to meet different people and interact with the customers."
good,"Amazing attitude vibes  , amazing place to work for if you're looking for a positive energy positive vibes a positive atmosphere everyone is so so nice"
good,I liked working at Nordstrom. Management was not as professional as i would have liked. There were to many people trying to be in charge. Overall it would have been a great place to work if there was some type of order.
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work if you see yourself in retail. They are constantly thinking ahead as how to stay relevant in this challenging retail environment. You get to work with beautiful items in a diverse store with a multitude of personalities.
good,I worked for the company on and off for about 5 years. I have done 5 different departments as well. It was always fun to lean how to do each department!
good,"A lot of expectation is grounded in the retail side of service industry,"
good,"Enjoyed working in a fast pace Ebar ( coffee shop), Learned about coffee and its culture, grew relationships with regular  customers , Liked that my service could make someones day"
good,Nice and productive team.Whenever you need help someone will be able to assist. Many clothing and accessories to choose from. Work place is chill and nice to be at.
good,Nordstrom store has a beautiful scenery and outstanding customer service. The Sales associate were nice and helpful. i would recommend this place to everyone.
good,"Job is not secure, however benefits are good if hired on with the company. Management is sometimes clueless to workers needs and  favoritism plays a huge role in promotions. Cow-workers are friendly and helpful."
good,Working at Nordstrom can be very rewarding and stressful at the same time. A typical day your require to do  stock work at the beginning of your shift. Then phone calls and emails to follow up with your customers. After that its time to fish for customers because you have to make your sales goals. The environment is very competitive which makes it stressful at times. The best part of my job is assisting customers and making them happy.
good,Good work environment and culture.  Excellent pay and benefits.  Management sometimes doesn't have the best handle on things and your told conflicting things from different levels of management.
good,Great opportunity to build a focused Book of Business with returning customers. Through a system I developed I retain close communication with my customer base regarding opportunities aligned with customer needs and wants. It has been a fantastic experience.
good,the most enjoyable part of your job is being able to teach and coach your team and being able to make someone feel good about themselves.
good,I enjoyed  the customers especially the children. many of their parents would bring their children in to see me. the gm would hire young and inexperienced assistant managers would not handle delicate situatons.
good,"Great communication skills, easy work place, manager is excellent. I learned that if u want to succeed in life you have to work hard for it. The hardest part if working is the fact that you work so hard and you still don't make goal. Co-workers are awesome to work with. The most enjoyable part of my job is when a customer tells me how much they enjoy there drink and that its the only coffee shop they'll come to."
good,Nordstrom is still growing and is a fast-paced environment.  The corporate culture is very particular to Nordstrom as are the people since most of them started their career at the company.
good,"Great staff, flexible hours, great benefits. A fun atmosphere to learn about how to manage your own business flow. You must be willing to be around a lot of people and suggestive selling is a must!"
good,"I always begin the day by pulling report and checking business numbers and emails. Stockroom walks are also done every morning to ensure everything is clean and organized. Daily tasks and stock assignments are assigned to team members before they arrive. Throughout the day, I handle any customer issue, and make sure the sales floor is running smoothly. Tasks such as schedule/sale prep/inventory prep are delegated between managers or sales team. The management team I currently work with is amazing, and so is the sales team."
good,nothing special the customers at Nordstrom are very uptight . customers want to give you a hard time but don't want to spend the money . so overally its just ok
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help someone find outfits that they feel good and confident in. Co-workers make it a fun and loving environment we're like family. The hardest part of the job is having hundreds of dollars in returns and no return policy.
good,"Big Company with a lot of great apples but a few rotten ones as well. I didn't limit myself yet I was held back by my Store manager. Was given awards and recognition in meanial achievements, yet when I wanted to influence substantial change for the better, I was limited."
good,"The people are a lot of fun. Its about building YOUR business for success. Need to know how to sell for sure. You need to work there for a while to have an advancement but its hard living off of a 30, 000 salary."
good,"as a cashier my job is to assist customers with anything they may need once they step into the cafe. my main duty is to take orders but i also help with running food, bussing tables and i have also served tables when i am needed. my coworkers are amazing, we are all really close and work well together. my favorite thing about working in the cafe was meeting new people and helping make someones day better by giving them great service."
good,Its a fun job if you love fashion and helping people. It can get annoying sometimes when you get hit with returns or if its slow but during peak times theres always a lot of people to help.
good,"making fashion decision to and for customers. good benefits and 401k programs, health care ok, love dressing for my customers, your department can win store contests. You can make your check as big as you want."
good,Learned how to interact with all walks of life in a positive and professional manner.  Gained extensive customer service skills and relations. Typically working 40 hours a week with good co-workers and management. Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with afferent personalities and building relationships. Hardest part of the job would be earning a higher income.
good,There are always sales to be made as foot traffic is very good.  The most enjoyable part of the job is my co workers they are a good group of guys.
good,"I learned an amazing amount of skills in terms of running a business, and customer service.  "
good,This is a great place to learn customer service and sales. If you love to sell products to customers and make the happy this is the place for you
good,I was forced to work in customer service because i was great at opening accounts but i wanted to work in men's wear. They were very supportive but only in the area that benefit them and the ignored my personal goals.
good,"This current position is unlike any that I've ever had. My day starts very early, and begins with the team and I processing merchandise and preparing the product to go out on the floor. I have never had a job that has been so physically demanding, including lifting boxes, creating cartons, as well as loading and unloading our delivery truck. This would probably be the hardest part of the job, as it requires lots of lifting, bending and potentially strenuous activity"
good,Productive and very easy to comprehend with rules and regulations at work place. Friendly co-workers and promptly organizing merchandise completely and accurately.
good,Good place to work that pays well.  Management has an open door policy that is inviting to new ideas and concerns.  Unfortunately this is still a retail job and layoffs can happen based on ups and downs of the retail market. Instead of hiring new staff during the busiest times of the year they instead force employees to work 6 and 7 day work weeks.
good,"Overall I learned alot about marketting and maintaining business relationships from this company. I think it is definitely one of the best retailers to work for. Great benefits, okay insurance.  very professional. I feel as though this company suffers the most at the mid management level, and in work, life balance issues."
good,"A very fun day at work will consist of bringing a smile in every single customer face i assist in choosing the perfect outfits for whatever occasion. love love love the  interactions with customers getting to know them in a short time and servicing them is a very rewarding feeling. In doing so i will sometimes get co workers to give an opinion when needed to reassure my client. From time i will get  my manager involved in speeding us-special orders, or waiving expedite shipping fees."
good,Friendly and flexible workplace and had a friendly staff on all shifts. The hours and compensation were flexible. The hours could have been better.
good,"Working at Nordstrom for 11 years has given me the opportunity to grow in many aspects.  It has been an honor getting to work with so many wonderful people in different groups over the years. Typical Nordstrom employees are friendly and willing to help reach a common goal. Many get involved with outside causes to help others less fortunate."
good,"I worked with the Logistics team. I enjoyed my manager and co-workers but the other managers didn't treat me with respect. They would get mad at me for something small. I was seasonal so I wasn't made aware when something changed. My favorite part about working there was my team, they were wonderful all four years!"
good,good job enviorment but poor sales analysis. the store was a great opportunity and i learned a lot of costumer service and team work i dont regret working for nordstrom.
good,a typical day for me involves answering incoming telephone calls and route to them the appropriate staff member. I have learned many interpersonal and customer service skills in this position. Management is easy to get along with and my co workers as well because i am a very social and outgoing person. The hardest part of my job is the hours at times and the most enjoyable part is interacting with the customers.
good,"Serving Job. Multiple managers. I was a server working with people who have been working there for 10 plus years. It was obvious when people who have been working there had what they wanted done during the industry. I created clients on a daily basis. At least once a day, customers' requested me to have them be served. I was honest and I learned that honesty is key when it comes to food. Although people have different tastes, if you can describe your favorite dish to people, they will take your word for it. I never had a customer take a dish back that I recommended."
good,"saber vender cualquier tipo de producto "
good,"great atmosphere, detail oriented. "
good,"I enjoyed going to work every day and being able to interact with customers all day, every day. I stepped down from management because I wanted to be more one-on-one with customers and focus on the customer experience, which was nearly impossible to do as a Department Manager."
good,One of the best places to work in the retail industry! Great co-workers. This.company really empowers sales their professionals to provide exceptional customer service.
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work, so many smiling faces and great customers. you build so may relationships by just having a great personality."
good,"I was a very fast learner at Nordstrom. At the time I had no prior experience with a job so dedicated to customer service. The department I worked for was a slow paced department but I managed to build rapport with my customers and no matter which department they were shopping in, they would look for me. "
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Good hours and metro accessible. Easy to learn what's required of you. Good pay and always overtime available. Always space for growth in the company. Just a overall nice environment to work in.
good,Nordstrom's a great company to work for with great benefits and nice working environment. I love interacting with people and being personable its a great place to do so.
good,This job allowed me to grow and learn. I enjoyed the culture although there were things I would have changed about the way things were done. Mostly about numbers but also cared about personal growth and development and was a company that promoted from within.
good,"I loved working her but in a smaller store be prepared for clicks."
good,I have met many people during this internship experience and I feel like Nordstrom has prepared me for my next career with the training that I have recieved.
good,"*Typical Day: Extremely Busy"
good,"Great culture, awesome training, lots of tools for success, they put a lot of focus on career development, BE MOBILE if you want to advance quickly. be smart and learn in every training they give you"
good,"The typical day consisted of merchandising, customer service and sales."
good,So a typical day would be clocking in and checking the sales floor for new merchandise. Greeting all customers and being of assistance if they need help. Being knowledgeable and providing styling advice.
good,"I love Nordstrom culture, customer service, products and people. Great benefits, pay is commission only thus income is not consistent, but with time and experience and a developed client book there is great potential for higher profits. I learned a ton about management, retail and customer service. "
good,"Working with shoes and people is always a fun environment to be in, especially for a girl, who loves shoes. Co-workers always talked and hung out, so we built a friendship connection. Management was a little difficult to connect with more if you were not management."
good,My overall experience since working with Nordstrom Inc. has been great. Extremely reputable company with many perks and opportunity. Hate to have to leave there because of relocation purposes
good,the pay was the only reason i stayed it makes up for the tedious environment and work that never seem to stop if you dont have no experience then this is a good job
good,"Waiting for the deliver truck, unloading and loading merchandise for customers. I have learn how to do audits, scanning.  Work with my co-worker was exciting we work well together unloading the merchandise.  The hardest part of the job was working  till the mid part of the next day to unload."
good,typical day at work was to reorganize the products from the prior night.  clean and dust shelves.  restock products and prepare samples.  process returns and damages.  great place to work at.

good,typical day at work was to reorganize the products from the prior night.  clean and dust shelves.  restock products and prepare samples.  process returns and damages.  great place to work at.
good,"I thought management was great, they truly wanted you to scudded and they were a very supportive environment. Some co-wokers did not appreciate the opportunity as much and embrace the experience."
good,"A typical day for me started with cleaning clothes of the floor, then when you done you have to continue checking that same area, no help from coworkers,"
good,Nordstrom provided customers and employees with fun and caring environment. Nordstrom encouraged pride among employees. Management team were very respectful toward each other. This fostered team work among the management team. The work hours are hard to create a work/life balance. I love working and meeting new people.
good,"My customer service skills I learned them at Nordstrom."
good,"As a Manager in Training (MIT), I assisted with filling orders and taking inventory. I held pre-shift meetings with the staff and assists in setting up the restaurant to make sure service ran smoothly. If there was any customer complaints, I made sure it was taken care of the guests left happy and wanting to come back. I did end of the day sales reports and emails, making sure other managers and corporate managers were informed with how the day went. "
good,Nordstroms is an excellent company to work for. The hours are flexible and the benefits are amazing.
good,"typical days was organizing the counter and products greeting customers, calls customers about events we have coming up"
good,"If you are a top producer and your manager likes you then you're all set, but if not than your life here will be very difficult."
good,"Inventory control, Training in Memphis TN, Review daily PO buying reports transfer reports and Markdowns, Controller of samples, worked the call enter.  I joined them one after the Cataloged launched and they had not conducted a Inventory.  I earned how a catalog is created shot from the season to season - what it took to conduct a warehouse inventory- expanded my scope for training. Hardest part of the job, the commute, At the time I my son was young and if I need to get him, traffic could be  deterrent. I loved Nordstrom and their philosophy about customer service... we didn't have to say no.  Great liberty in ability to resolve issues for customers."
good,"Working for Nordstrom was my dream job when I was in high school. Now after working there for nearly a year I can say much different. I do love the fashion industry and am lucky to have had the opportunity to work in it hands on. I loved all of my co workers dearly but the management was really unorganized and lazy. The hardest part of this job was reaching sales goals since there were so many people working in my department at once, but it was achievable. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to know customers on a personal level and working with them every day."
good,Productive work environment . I just think that in someways they could care more about their employees.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of maintaining the sales floor, working to help customers find specific items, and helping to cash them out. Management was good but wasn't always flexible with scheduling. Hardest part of the job was trying to identify shoplifters and making sure other stores are notified. I enjoyed helping customers find what they were looking for and helping them get deals on merchandise."
good,I have learned about the retail business since I've worked at Nordstrom for over a year and have known what labels are in season or not in season.
good,"I loved working for Nordstrom. Great company. You just have to understand the retail world to be comfortable. There is many challenges when you work on commission. However, I made good money and was very successful."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy my job and my team."
good,"Good opportunity to advance. Performance based standards allows you to do well and be rewarded. Hours are not 8-5, if that works for you then this may be a good place to start."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for, the customer service culture is bar none. The associates are great, the work pace is fast and there is always something to complete.  The compensation is fair , they promote health and wellness are truly concerned about their employees in the time of need. Ultimately a great company to work for."
good,"I worked in the Kids' Wear department, so it was joy to work with and help each customer looking to buy something in the department.  I enjoyed working with my coworkers, the hardest part of my job was leaving a great group of people.  We worked best together than any other team I've been on.  I learned what the sales industry was like, I've never had a sales job so it was a great place to start and learn.  I enjoyed being able to learn about the fashion industry and enhance my customer service skills."
good,A typical day at work for me was always busy it was a coffee shop people always love coffee. It would be busy if Nordstrom had a sale or the holidays black Fridays. Management was very easy to talk to and they had a open door policy which was great. My co-workers where supportive when need be. I really enjoyed the job I mean we all have good days and bad days but that is just part of being human. I love putting smiles on people face especially when I know I did my part to make them smile that was the best part for me.
good,"Great place to work, IF the timing is right and you have great management. Typical work day includes greeting customers maintaining visual standard and your floor and processing new inventory. Work environment is homogenous at time but during sale season the teeth come out. Employees turn into sharks and from that point its every man for himself. Im convinced I have the best the best manager in the store and this is what makes my experience here enjoyable."
good,"In the past 6 years I have challenged myself daily to out do my own best and compete against others performance. I have managed 8 different departments, with each promotion came new challenges and responsibilities. I have learned to manage others and to work with a wide variety of personalities and with that came the ability to control clashing personalities amongst a team. My teams have always viewed me as a leader and a fair one at that. I have grown and promoted 6 of my associates who have gone on to management and regional positions of their own. I manage my team, my areas of responsibility and the budget of my areas. To guarantee the success of my departments, I would put together monthly business plans, give my team direction and plan volume driving events. The hardest part of my job is accepting things that are beyond my control that can affect my business."
good,Very nice and energetic place to move. Values customers. All about customer experience. Love co-workers and manager.
good,"Not to sound to pessimistic, but it's the truth., It's a job, it's nothing to degrading and you do work with very awesome people. There are very genuine and sweet employees who are very comfortable to be around and great to work with, unfortunately there's a higher amount or unpleasant employees who care little or nothing about people just getting sales and thats managers included. The best part about this job though is definitely the support team. The guys and girls behind the scene who stock the product, clean the store, fix the broken things. They are so down to earth and the best crew in the world to work with. I've learned a lot though:electrical work, HVAC, carpentry, to multitask, innovation, etc."
good,"Clock in, go to meeting with managers, go to station and work, get a 30 min. break. Go back to work and get a hour lunch, then back to work. Get a 15 min. break, then back to work until clock out and leave for the day. "
good,"This was a great place to work for. The hours were flexible, and sometimes you left late. Overall this was a good place to work for. "
good,"a typical day includes selling, i learned how to become a a great sales woman. management was great. co-workers were easy to get along with but the hardest part of the job for most people was making commission even tho i was good at it commission was still a challenge. the most enjoyable part of the job was serving our guest.     "
good,A great place to work and allows advancement. Nordstrom taught me how to coope with a fast-paced enviroment. The store embraces everyone's values and culture.
good,"Sold shoes, at times it was very slow or very hectic. Worked part-time but was given full time hours. There was no definite time to when your shift ended, could be hours after originally scheduled. Co-workers were great, I loved working with them. Manager was ok. I loved working with customers to find the perfect shoe. To me a shoe is an investment, to a women its very important."
good,"I was promoted here but didn't care for commission. The managers I've worked with were mostly sub par, but I had a few great managers as well, who climbed up the ladder instead of being stuck. The co. treats you well if you make them money...but so does every other company."
good,"A typical day was performing opening duties or making sure the 1st shift perfomed their end of shift duties, greeting customers, performing customer service by tending to the customers, checking them out, and performing closing/end of shift duties."
good,"In order to be successful, you must prospect and develop and grow sales relationships in a highly competitive environment."
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work. I have learned how to manage people and be a team player. Also how to set goals and beat them.
good,"As a person that was trying to balance school and work full time it was extremely difficult to work here as there very difficult hours to work. There is never a steady schedule and 3 months out of the year you can not request a day off which made it very difficult to see family that is outside of the state. I could never enjoy holidays because my family was out of the state and i was required to work those holidays or the day immediately after, therefore i spent every single holiday since ive been hired alone or with very few family."
good,Nordstrom cosmetics is a constantly evolving environment that is chanllenging and very hands-on. We host events every 4-6 weeks and are always looking to grow our client base and event turn-out.
good,"Great Company with unlimited access to advancement and opportunity. I hated the work schedule on weekends, odd hours and commission based salary. It's not my forte. The particular location had lots of work to do in management store-wide and overall feel being positive for co-workers, employees and customers as well."
good,Great company to work for with good benefits. Company growing and alot of room for advancement if willing to relocate. Strong team enviroment and culture.

good,Great company to work for with good benefits. Company growing and alot of room for advancement if willing to relocate. Strong team enviroment and culture.
good,"It was a great experience overall and I learned a tremendous amount of customer service skills. It give you no cap on income which is great also. Management could be a little better though, I feel some managers are not qualified for the position. The hardest part of the job is the schedule and the fact that it always changes. You will most like miss out on most of your events and holidays outside of work."
good,"I have worked for the Nordstrom family for almost two years. I can say, I enjoy most of the people I wor with. Thursday through Sunday, it is always busy around there. Which is what I like, because it definitely helps your day go by a lot faster. Everyone there is very friendly and always speaks to one another. The management are great people. They definitely strive to make sure their department is improving and their teams are helping each customer. Making sure that greet them with a smile and letting them know bout current events that are taking place in the store. The hardest part of my job is when a customer would come in with a return that is way passed our 30 day policy and I have to tell them I cant return the item. It's only because most of our shoppers are used the regular Nordstrom not having a return policy that they are unware that we do. The most enjoyable part has to be some of the relationships I have developed with most of the frequent shoppers thast come in. How they will usually as for my opinion when shopping for that perfect outfit. But more importantly the relationships I have with my coworkers. We have become good friends."
good,Creating lasting relationships with customers/clients is the best part about this job.
good,Sold Cosmetics and skin care to Nordstrom customers.
good,Great company to work for and learn and grow. Provides lot of opportunities to work on latest technologies. Provides for good work life balance. Compensation is in line with market.
good,"I enjoyed coming to work everyday, as Nordstrom's main goal is to keep their customers happy. I love helping people in any way I can, and Nordstrom encourages their employees to do whatever it takes to ensure their customers have an easy and effective experience."
good,"A pretty good place to work if you like fashion. 20% discount, just have to really sell sell sell and ignore petty people. You can make good money if you are in a good department. The only thing that kinda sucks is if someone returns you have to make it up and Nordstrom returns basically everything. An overall good place to work if you like working in sales."
good,Everyone is respected for who they are.  People are free to dress  in their own personal style.  Management  encourages on line shopping. This hurts the professional associates.
good,"long hours but alright pay, have to deal with customers and fellow employees. you're out on the floor most of the time, each dept has a different culture."
good,A typical day at the location varies depending on the department in which you are placed. My department was suits and things were very straightforward after training is completed. Many experienced employees would help you understand more efficient methods to doing your job but prior selling and money handling would be required prior to hiring.
good,"Good place to start your experience, however to move up will be hard considering the climate retail is in. Sadly my retail career has ended and I am now focused on looking for something else to help me grow."
good,Nordstrom is a customer obsessed environment. Very fast paced and sells driven. If you love customer service and being customer obsessed you will love Nordstrom.
good,"Super hard on employees when it comes to discount or commission. The customer is always first, even over you. Loss Prevention watches employees more than customers lol Besides that great earning potential and location."
good,"Although I did not work at Nordstrom for a long time, I enjoyed it for the most part. Had to quit due to medical/health conditions I was dealing with at the time."
good,Great company.  Just too far from home at the time.  My department shrank so my income started shrinking.  Great benefits and excellent products.  I.peccable customer service.  I just could not survive on the pay with over an hour commute to and from Barton Creek Mall to North Austin..
good,"I was a department manager at Nordstrom for 5 years. It was overall a great experience and met some of my now life long friends there. Work/life balance is difficult considering it is commission and sales based and it is retail so the more volume you manage, the more time you will need to spend in store and it is expected. Job responsibilities were very clear but always changing"
good,"Make your own work like balance , follow the rules and sell you’ll do great. "
good,"slowly reduced hours until my benefits were gone"
good,"The managers care about maintaining their department, but not always about maintaining employee morale. Managers dont stay in their department as long as some of the sales employees, so the longer the sales associate has worked there, the more leyway they get from the manager. When combined with the shark mentality, leads to poor team morale. "
good,"Strong company with a lot of opportunity to move up, especially if you are willing to relocate.  Expectations and workload are very high for Assistant Department Managers and Department Managers.  It can be a very stressful environment if you don't have strong organizational and time management skills.  You'll be expected to work evenings and weekends until you get to the District/Regional level.  If you want to ascend the ranks, expect to work very hard and be smart about how you allow coworkers and managers to perceive you, because your ""Nordstrom Network"" and politics are everything when it comes to promotions.  If you produce strong results, are likeable, and build rapport with Store Managers, HR, and Regional Management, then you'll have a lot of opportunity.  If you don't, you'll essentially be blacklisted and become stuck in your current role or more than likely termed as soon as HR has a strong enough case against you.  It's a company you'll either love or hate."
good,"Working at Nordstrom was quite the learning experience. The training staff was unforgettable, in a good way, upper management was a different story. The atmosphere is very tense and it was constantly busy but overall I loved my time there."
good,"Fun place to work, loved the people but Building Services' work was no joke!! There was always something that had to be done and we seemed to always be shorthanded."
good,"Nordstrom is commission based, so naturally it can become a competitive environment. It is tricky to move up in this company, being that it is so large. I received great experience from working here and made some great friends."
good,"The manager taught me so much and made me grow so much as an individual. The workplace culture is very snooty, but I made some life long friends whilst I worked there. The hardest art of the job was mkaing commission every 2 weeks and worrying if you didn't that they could fire you for it so it was quite stressful."
good,"It was exciting meeting different clientele on a day to day basis. Learning about the different designer sunglasses and also learning the different tricks how to tell the difference between UV and non, was fun. Management could be considered unpleasant, very go behind you back type on somedays. Excluding management, work environment was very pleasant, and staff had cool diverse feel to it."
good,"My manager was amazing and our customer, by and large, were great.  It's hard work but it can me really enjoyable.  The discount wasn't too shabby either."
good,"Working at Nordstrom was a fun experience with a lot of good benefits and the metro card incentive was 1 of the perks, but the bi monthly pay was a bit odd."
good,"To begin, every retail store has its ups and downs. Great store to understand higher end brands and work with quality over quantity merchandise. You learn about sales and commission. Enhance your customer service and ways of selling. Product knowledge."
good,"I learned a lot working in the Nordstrom cafe. I worked hard, I was treated with respect from my coworkers and Nordstrom taught me how to give great experience and skills."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Nordstrom. They involve all employees, have meetings, potlucks, parties and conferences to keep everyone interacting with each other. Teams can be large. Favorites are formed. Good benefits and nice discounts. I'd work for Nordstrom again."
good,"I worked seasonally during the anniversary sale, and it was extremely fast paced and required a lot of energy. I learned a lot through the team and everyone is very friendly, but also very competitive. As a seasonal employee, I was expected to have open availability and work a lot of hours, which of course has its pros and cons."
good,they down sized recently and raised the hourly but lowered the cap dramatically. they do have amazing benefits and after working there for 4-6 months you start earning paid time off. It is hard to get promoted at this specific nordstrom right now because they just downsized.
good,"start time at 6am 2pm for first shift 2pm to 10pm for 2nd shift 10pm to 6am for 3rd shift big warehouse, many departments I would say stock control department is the hardest customer return is the easiest friendly management you can listen to music witch make it enjoyable to work at"
good,"Pay was great if you worked hard enough. Holidays and special sales can get hectic, but pay was worth it. Always keep a smile on your face. Great managers."
good,Fun place to work but have to work more. It is always busy. Overall it is a very good place to work at. its nice and clean. You will always find good people to work with
good,Great fun place to work an you get to meet great people. Wish there was more room to grow but management was very fair. I recommend work for this company to anyone seeking to apply there.
good,"Nordstrom was a fast paced extremely competitive job.  Employees will take clients and sales from each other, not follow the ethics that are described in job description.  Management did very little to back associates with this issue."
good,"Have fun and don’t get caught up in the  minutia and take advantage of all the benefits!!"
good,"Working at Nordstrom taught me a lot about great customer service. For example, I quickly understood that building personal relationships with our customers was our number one priority."
good,Very friendly work environment! Always a joy coming in. Everyday was different. There were some bad days but at the end of the day we would all come together as a team. I learned alot from my coworkers.
good,"I started as sales associate in 2009 and moved in areas of more responsibility with the guidance of great managers "
good,"I really loved transitioning there from the fast food industry. That was a great experience and I genuinely enjoyed the work environment when I first started working there. However, after some management started to change vastly I saw it was time to move on. It's great for a part-time job with a professional work setting and nice benefits. They're a really nice brand to work for."
good,"Overall, Nordstrom was a great company to work for with good benefits. However, recently they have undergone restructuring and it has caused a lot of issues and unhealthy work/life balance."
good,Nordstrom Rack was a fun environment to work in. During my time there the service experience manager (as well as all the other managers) we very helpful and fun to work with.
good,I was able to move up positions very quickly and I learned a lot. Unfortunately not having a set schedule was very inconvenient for my family. Store traffic slowed down significantly making it difficult for commission based employees to make a decent living.
good,It was ok until the workers like to started trouble but other then that is was ok I got to work on time I like doing work by myself there but other then that it was find
good,"Working for Nordstrom was one of the best experiences I ever had! The team I worked with was phenomenal, but the clients that we served were mostly horrible. Management focuses on training and promoting all the time - its great if you want to gain knowledge and experiences. The management team only looked out for themselves, documenting all errors - keeping a paper trail for when they needed to terminate employees. The managers were the main reason I left this position, I felt that there was no work life balance even though that's all the company talks about. The block out july, November and December so that no one can request days off- this was not the biggest deal for me as most of my family was local."
good,"Its a great job if you have other goals in your career, but I would not necessarily have it valued for a lifetime career. Plenty of politics when dealing with customers and advancement."
good,Management was bad. They were very loose and not very strict on sales people who had been there longer. But overall fun place to work at with great co-workers. Plus you get employee discounts.
good,"It was a nice place to be, but hours were often cut and I was the solo person for a counter hidden away in the corner. It was difficult to sell my brand due to location, but being determined to sell it, I partnered with other areas of the store. After I left, the counter was closed. The brand wanted a representative but Nordstrom wanted it mixed in with the beauty overflow, not as its own counter."
good,"There was constantly something to search for something to do as the company seeks to find more innovative ways to connect with their customers. As there became more complicated customer issues, it was my responsibility to find quicker techniques that would not only benefit the customer, but it would help strengthen the bond between fellow coworkers as well as we sought out to understand everyones capabilities."
good,great if you want a second job or a flexible job while you're going to school or have kids. Can have some favoritism in some departments. the future of retail in racks rather than full line stores.  hardest part of the job is the wages. commission isn't great while food and beverages department can be a little better but overall not great. best part can be the connection you can make with others in your department or store.
good,"The immediate boss was amazing, the only issue was the new VP that came in and prevented us from being converted like promised at hiring. I left another job for this reason, and was told they were going to outsource."
good,I go in from 2pm-10pm 8 hours on your feet inspecting items That been sent back from online orders . Have a break at 6:00pm as well as lunch.I will go back on the floor at 6:25 have to be at my station
good,"If your goal is to be successful in retail sales, Nordstrom has the best training around.  Many retail stores that see the company on a person's resume are more likely to hire them."
good,"It is a good place to start out. The discounts are great but the management sometimes has favorites and it shows. Overall, it is a good place to start but it will be hard to advance."
good,"Competitive environment with good growth opportunity. From experience, employee complaints not taken seriously by management. Fair pay and balanced work/ home life."
good,"It is a good place to start out. The discounts are great but the management sometimes has favorites and it shows. Overall, it is a good place to start but it will be hard to advance."
good,"Competitive environment with good growth opportunity. From experience, employee complaints not taken seriously by management. Fair pay and balanced work/ home life."
good,"Too lenient with customers, and not providing support to employees  when employees tried to enforce company policies. Not enough employees scheduled to prevent theft."
good,I love working here but dang does minimum wage in Seattle hurt. A burger out here costs an hour and if my parents didn’t pay my rent I don’t think this would be enough to support myself.
good,Working at Nordstrom is not that bad. It just depends on the manager you have and what kind of work environment within the department that you work in.
good,It’s great being ahead of the trends but work life balance isn’t a thing working in customer Service. Management changes every year and the customer are entitled and very rude in the Atlanta market. Nordstrom also deal with a lot of fraudulent purchases so commission base positions suffer a lot! Be careful when expecting a great sales gig the return policy doesn’t allow you to make money!
good,Great company to work for great way to learn and get experience with retail. Nordstrom has many different brands that can help with product knowledge.
good,OKay it is what you make of it. If you know how to run your own business then it's a great place to capitalize. Unfortunately sometimes they change commission structure and it does not benefit employees.
good,I didn't work for the company for more than a few months but while I was there I gained lots of sales skills and experience. The interview process was swift but thorough and they made sure I was comfortable with my training before moving on.
good,"In my departament the manager lacked of principles. I saw how she stole sales from her staff many times and also how she gave preference to few."
good,Great company to work for. Just outgrew the commission atmosphere. There isn’t a lot of room for advancement unless you a favorite of management. Management needs some serious refreshing.
good,"Good first job and great place to learn some selling skills. Retail so you work weekends and nights. Hardest part is to build a client base, but easy income."
good,It was a fun place to work. It was a job I had from high school and was able to move into the buying office. I enjoyed my time there but wanted to progress my career
good,"Nordstrom is a interesting place to work, the amount of work life balance is non existent . But being able to self teach how to run your own business also being a good manager is learned with growth . Hardest part of the job is the management in specific Nordstrom stores."
good,The culture shifted in mid-2015 and dramatically continued to spiral downhill due to management expanding to only be eliminated in 2016 of over 300 employees and management layoffs.
good,"If morning, I opened the doors. Monitored the cameras for suspicious activities. Walked the floor. Did refund fraud investigations. Tracked refunds on a database. Organized events such as a shrinkage fair."
good,"Nordstrom is a nice place to work, the management and the coworkers are all great people. I personally just didn't like working in commission based enviroment"
good,"I enjoyed my stay at Nordstrom and honestly thought I would never leave. I maximized my sales goals and met a lot of interesting people both clients and peers. I would say the management is lackluster and should certainly adhere to their ""Triangular method"" which portrays the employee at the top rather than the customer in training. I will say you bend over backwards for the customer, though usually gratifying. However their leadership program is very inclusive and very necessary if you plan to advance in the company, it is used as a tool even when you are meeting satisfactory goals, to make you work yourself to death. As usual in any work environment, favoritism is also a variable to consider. The discount is a mere 20% but if you bust your tail hard enough you get an additional 13% off~ groundbreaking. The pay is wonky as well considering it was a straight commission role. What really put a bad experience on the table was my end of the rope at this company. I attempted to transfer to another store after being a solid member of the team, performing exceptionally, loving my job and yearning for more. And they took that away from me. Shame on you Nordstrom! I had many take-aways from this company overall and it certainly helped me grow my people skills, ability to outreach to foster business and maintain both professional and personal relationships. If you have all the time in the world with zero desire to actually move up, work here. Else this is not the place."
good,"Overall a great company. Typical retail complaints (hours/holidays/days off/etc) but better than most. Fun environment. You ""run your own business"" for the most part"
good,"As a Manager , the morning started taking care of all the New Merchandise, creating Fashion statements in A locations to show the Newest Trends and items Juggling tasks and hours were a key to opening shifts and as a manager it was my job to find ways and finish tasks on time. Taking  care of discounts, schedules and paperwork before the store open was a must. Put aside a good  couple of hours within the day for me to sell ,as a sales manager to reach my store and department goals .Interact, teach, coach and positive reinforce my employees.Made sure everyone was on board with the rest of the departments within the store. But most important made sure that I had a Happy team that were connecting with customers and made money selling our products in the best way possible, creating relationships and having a pleasant  environment to work at. Through the years I have learned that people work for people and the more motivation and life balance you create within your team , the better the results are.Having a healthy relationship with my team and sharing our learning  experiences with each other made work a pleasant environment to work at , grow and achieve personal and business results."
good,"If you are a hard worker the company does recognize this and puts you on the fast track to management. There is your typical seasonality with the job, so there are extreme highs and lows. One downfall to the management track is the ""forced"" relocation to move about which can be difficult if you have family."
good,"On a personal level, its time to move on."
good,"Overall, Nordstrom is a great company to work for. Over the years I have realized that the cost of living versus what Nordstrom pays just isn't enough. "
good,"Nordstrom is a good company to work for overall, it is very diverse and in most departments you control your check, you just have to put the work in.."
good,"I love Nordstrom's culture. Only left due to needing more stability for the family (i.e. steady paychecks, medical benefits). Was only offered part time, but commission made up for it."
good,"I worked at Nordstrom for years in sales. Some days work was like being at summer camp, but you have to drink the cool aid to be in management. Also your experience really depends on your manager."
good,Planning is failing.  Many portions of the business are not communicating with each other.  Structure and the operational intelligence is lacking.  Many failing sectors of the fulfillment process. Development is non-existent and people are placed in roles without prep and support to progressively grow. Lack of positivity in the relationships to set an example.
good,"This is a good place to work if you're in need of advancement, money to pay student bills, and a good stock team. I'd say the hardest part of this job is the hours. Waking up early to work at 4AM is good, but towards the end, you'll feel yourself tire out. I enjoyed the stock team and the time spent with them. We really got to know each other and learned how to communicate with one another."
good,Nordstrom and Customer Service tend to be used hand-I’m-hand but it’s all about what you do with it. Many try to find the flaws in the company or say that the people are fake but ultimately it’s about the customer’s experience.
good,"The job was easy, except for being on my feet all day. Some employees were allowed to do whatever they wanted, with no repercussions."
good,"I really enjoyed working for the company, my boss unfortunately was the one who ruined it for me which is why I am now looking for another job. Not opposed to working for Nordstrom again in the future."
good,"Cleaning and sanitizing silverware, pots, and pans, safely and efficiently operate dish washing machine, ensure proper soap and rinse chemicals are loaded for washing, removing damaged or broken dishes, utensils, and glassware from service, empty and clear garbage bins and breakdown boxes, and deep cleaning of kitchen and equipment."
good,Working in Loss Prevention was very laxed. Mainly utilizing the tools provided to you and having support from fellow agents. And the benefits were really good.
good,"Nordstrom was one of my first real job after I came home from LA. "
good,"It’s a fun challenging place, people are trying to make their best. "
good,Fun and exciting place to work. Commission based pay kept it exciting and competitve. Hours are long during holidays and difficult to balance work/life at these times of year.
good,"Unfortunatley, they do not accept medical excuses for sick days. I missed 3 days in July due to a stomach virus. Last month I had influenza B and was released after missing two weeks."
good,"For me this job was so long ago and it was seasonal, so I don't believe I am the most qualified to comment on the work environment. However the staff were very warm , easy going and friendly."
good,"Management at specific stores is awful because they don`t put their employees first."
good,Cross team support in Colorado is good and the local office is a good place to work.  Support outside the local organization is hit and miss. Although there are opportunities to advance it is usually difficult to take advantage
good,I only worked there for 1 day and I liked it.  I was hoping to get a call back to work inventory when needed.  I'm available whenever needed to fill in
good,"Good pay and hours"
good,"I love working in a world- class Luxury environment. Developing and maintaining relationships with customers provides me with brand awareness and innovative product knowledge, which builds great clientele and provides exceptional customer service! My gift of servicing will always be my foundation to relationship building no matter  the working environment!!! Thanks to my retail experience ❤️"
good,"Really loved my job and interaction with customers, however I did feel management could have used a lot of work. They didn't often set an example for the employees under them."
good,I worked the 2nd shift.  I started getting a cut back in hours so that the 1st shift could have work.  Getting sent home early did not allow me to have enough funds to make my rent.
good,"Busy Days! I loved it. They provide extensive training and give you the skills to be responsible for your business. "
good,"Automated distribution center.  Value Added Services, pick, pack, ship.  Customer orders pulled/shipped for Nordstrom.com and Nordstromrack.com.  Overtime and Saturday work is required.  LEAN methodology.  Management team has many years of experience. Production environment.  All activities are measured. Physical aspect requires consistent lifting up to 30 lbs. Standing and walking all day is required.  Utilizing RF devices as well pallet jacks, lift trucks, and work carts are all required tools. Casual atmosphere.  Although there are long work weeks, management tends to find clever ways to boost moral.  They provide weekend breakfast, quarterly meetings with fun games and interactive activities. Annual year end party with lots of prizes and food.  Annual BBQ is another quirk that they provide for all employees to enjoy and bond with their peers.  Weekly raffles and incentives paid to high producing employees.  Beside their hourly rate which is above the national average, they provide a large package of benefits."
good,Waking up excited to go to work to involve yourself with tuff situations that require patience and a lot of critical thinking/ problem solving is what intrigued me most. This helped me a lot in regards to personal growth.
good,I like working for the company I like the people but every Jobs has its pros & cons I wish management was better but other than that the job is great.
good,"Nordstrom was a perfect place for me to get my foot in the door. Through working there, I learned the importance of customer service, patience with a variety of people, and basic sales techniques. However, it is still a retail job and, in my opinion, should be a stepping stone to a higher position."
good,Great way to get some retail experience. They do promote within. Management can be a hit or miss. The atmosphere is awesome. You will learn how to develop yourself if you want to make this a career choice.
good,"Nordstrom is a very motivating and energetic environment.  They like to see smiling faces, positive attitude and hard working employees.  There are long hours and early morning meetings at times.  Every morning there is a Pep Rally with fun and loud music to motivate and energize the employees for the day as well as acknowledge great performances accomplished by the departments and individuals."
good,It’s a very good place to work at. The company gives back to there employees. They take care of us it’s a great place to work at . They have three shifts I woke gravyard and it enjoy it. I’m
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job; especially location, were the people you met. Clothing is a way of exemplifying your personality, so to be able to help everday people find themselves through the clothes they wear was quite the pleasure."
good,I loved my time here but was making terrible money for how much i was working. Had a great team and they did fun things for work culture. It gets very slow and when its slow youre brokkkee.
good,I'm not good at writing theses reviews Nordstrom is a pretty decent place to work. Tons of brands to choose from.there are plenty of new faces to interact with.
good,"The employees were usually fun and nice to each other. Management was overbearing, unfriendly, and not caring. Benefits were good, schedule was flexible."
good,Fast paced fun and good hours payed well nice people and nice bosses everyone was friendly and cheerful Everyone on first name bases they made me feel welcom
good,"I don't really have bad things to say about Nordstrom. Overall they are a great company to work for, but it is very difficult to build your own clientele depending on which location you are at. I used to work at the Galleria and there was many slow moments. Very difficult to maximize on profits individually. Overall it was okay. Maybe if I was at a different store I would have better success."
good,"I appreciated the luxury environment on a daily basis,"
good,Overall an easy job when you get used to everything very attention to detail oriented. You have to deal with numerous problems daily and have good judgement at all times.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Nordstrom, although I feel management should be more experienced. There is definitely ""power trip"" issues within the management team and unfair promotions. The company does offer a lot of great benefits to employees like transportation reimbursement."
good,"Definately recommend Nordstrom RACK seasonal to anyone even starting in the job world. It is team oriented, fast paced, managers are friendly, and you can feel alot of support from the staff. The hardest part is when there are no positions open after seasonal shift ends, and you must say goodbye to ones who helped build your resume."
good,"I feel the commission selling culture encouraged treating customers like money and not people. Often I think managers noticed behavior like this but did not take any action against it. That being said, I did enjoy working there and do feel like the mission of providing excellent customer service is great."
good,"Pay is competitive for retail, does offer full time employment with benefits which is a plus. Room for advancement. Expects a lot, many different tasks."
good,They have a solid foundation as a company. But the Dj to day process depends on the store. It is very competitive and most jobs as sales associates are commission based.
good,"fast pace on weekend and holiday season. over fun place to work, great customer service provided to customers. Good work incentives. lots of events!!!"
good,"We are the Fashion Authority. Selling the hottest trends to our clients. I manage a team of 8 and 1 assistant manager. On a typical day I am checking in shipment, merchandising my floor, handling customers repairs and communicating with my store manager, regional manager and buyers. The most enjoyable part of my day is helping customers find that right piece of jewelry to go with their outfits. Especially helping that bride that is not sure what jewelry will go best with her wedding gown."
good,"Fast paced, diverse environment. "
good,"There is no typical day at a Nordstrom/Nordstrom Rack store.  Most days, even weekdays are incredibly busy and hectic.  The brick and mortar stores sell the Nordstrom product line and many well-known designer products.  However, the stores have become the receptacle for online purchase returns.  "
good,worked for Nordstrom for over 15 years. I enjoyed it for the most part. Management has an extremely high turn over rate. I've had over 15 different managers in the time that I have worked there. I love the company as a whole however and the 401k!
good,"The Nordstrom warehouse in Cedar Rapids is all about numbers. Making your productivity numbers, quality numbers, attendance points. They track everything. Management is hit or miss, some of them are great and seem to genuinely care about their employees and others simply care about whether you're making your numbers or not. They do promote from within, so you can move from being just a warehouse processor to a trainer and then a lead and maybe even an assistant manager."
good,"Once you get in Nordstrom, it’s pretty nice. The environment is full of new ideas and things to learn. It is retail so it does come with customer service problems but many that can be maintained, and many that can’t. Overall, it is great business that just like any other has few kinks and querks but works to be the best Nordstrom is can be."
good,Easy job great team nice work place. No overtime available  eight hours shift  only. Pay period is only twice  a month not every two week. Must be have great money  management.
good,"Gained a lot of experience working with the company, learned how to maintain a retail clientele. Although i loved working for the company, the pay was extremely low for a high end department store which caused me to switch jobs."
good,Pleasant job to work for. Meet people from all walks of life. Fun place to work. Get along with everyone. Friendly environment. Provide outstanding customer service.overall an okay job
good,"most supervisors are laid back and willing to help, some will direct you to an area you cannot use. Customers are sweet and understanding, coworkers are laid back and fun. Very fun place to work for, worth everything"
good,Fast paced competitive working environment. Knowledge about fashion and current trends is necessary. High quality customer service is expected. Commission environment is stressful.
good,"Nordstrom is an excellent place to work, but the change from Orlando to Jacksonville was very difficult as the management was new and not from the Nordstrom Old School. "
good,"It is a very pleasant work environment with a very friendly staff."
good,"I enjoyed the environment but some of the managers aren't trained very well on how to speak respectfully to team members. "
good,"I really enjoyed my experience at Nordstrom as a commissioning sales associate. They make sure you are confident and ready to sell on the floor, and their customers are loyal and understanding, for the most part. "
good,Their grading scale is unrealistic. They also don’t tell you to till the end that you’re graded collectively. The pay is high as well as the benefits. But overall it was the management that made me decide to go. You definitely need phone edict to be able to work this position. You also need to be able to word things properly and it’s also customer service so you can’t be too sensitive because people can be rude and demanding.
good,"Quick paced, work from home option, paid 2 weeks training,flexible schedule. vacation time along with paid sick time email access for requested time off."
good,"Working at Nordstrom is great for those who do well in a competitive environment, as the job is commission based if you intend to be a sales associate."
good,"A typical day involved getting chores done and then serving customers. I learned how to work in a fast paced environment, and deal with unpleased customers. My manager was very straightforward. I enjoyed the individuals I worked with, because everyone was helpful and caring. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rushes, or times in which a lot of customers were in line, in the beginning when I was still going through training. I enjoyed learning the art of creating specialty beverages and how to build relationships with customers to make everyones experience memorable."
good,"A lot of opportunities to move up the corporate ladder, but it really is all about the selling at the end; there's not a lot of learning and essentially more repetitive work, you only really alter your work based on each customer you interact with"
good,"I worked there seasonally before I had to have a surgery. They hired me fully after the season ended because they liked me and I did my job. However, I found I had to have a surgery and they would not let me take medical leave, so I had to quit. Which really sucks because now that I'm able to work again they don't even have any positions for me to fill."
good,Nordstrom is a career. You get out of it what you are willing to put in. You can work your way down the pyramid but you have to be willing to play the networking game.
good,"training was pretty minimal but then again it was only a job meant to last for a month, no major complaints but no major positives either. management was good and coworkers were friendly."
good,"Competitive, fun work atmosphere,Enjoyed the environment but the hours were difficult. Great management. Exciting and creative atmosphere. Working at Chicago location was much better than Oakbrook"
good,"fair.  Rate this company*required"
good,"Difficult to manage work/life balance, especially for students. The management has extremely high expectations and they are often very difficult to follow through with."
good,"Nordstrom was good for discounts. They had a really terrible return policy which means you'd get commission and have it taken away almost immediately because of returns. Workplace culture was fine, dress code is awesome except you cant wear uggs. Hardest part of job was closing, balancing the register. Your money counts on the volume of your store."
good,"A day at Nordstrom is in some way a routinely duty when you first arrive you clock in grab your fitting room key and go straight onto the sales floor to make sales. There is about 3-4 other workers that work in the same department as you so its very competitive when it comes to who's going to get and assist that guest first. Your required to sale to guest, maintain a clean sales floor, fulfill online orders, outfit guest/up-sale them, and provide the best service in a timely matter. I learned that if you want to survive in this type of work you must be money hungry and willing to go above and beyond everyday in order to obtain your commission goal. Management in my store specifically is good depending on whoo and what department you look at, but to be more specific the store manager is amazing he's has an open door policy and is very personal, when it comes to speaking on my department manager she is not the best when it comes to managing the team nor is she personal. The workplace culture is very trendy and fast pace at times but due to my work environment it can also be very difficult depending on what store you work at the foot traffic isn't always the best which means its harder to make your sale goals especially when theres many people on the floor in your department. Not only that but the sales associate will be penalized if you don't make your commission several times even if there isn't many people willing to do shopping. But the one thing I can say thats most enjoyable about this job is that when guest come in to shop it doesn't feel like work anymore it feels like"
good,I worked at the Nordstrom Rack and it was a decent place to work. I worked the front counter as a cashier. I enjoyed talking to a lot of our customers but like any other retail job you have your bad apples in there as well. A typical day is usually fast paced and can be really redundant. But if your crew is great and customers are cooperative then it should be a fairly enjoyable experience.
good,"Nordstrom is a fun, semi-competitive sales environment with a supportive group of people to help you develop your sales and client base. Nordstrom's industry-leading customer service is a driving force that keeps customers coming back as well as interested in the various divisions of the Nordstrom's brand."
good,"Worth starting off here and climbing the ladder if you're interested. Make an effort to get to know/develop a relationship with your management, aim high for your goals, work hard and you'll be remembered for opportunities."
good,Great place to work if you have no desire to change the role you get hired for.  It is extremely hard to even get an interview let alone actually move around in the company.
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work. Everyone that works here is very helpful and always willing to make your schedule work for you. The pay is way over scale for this part of the country as well.
good,"Great place to work if you have the right attitude and are willing to put the work in to do what you are supposed to do. Parking situation could be better, especially if leaving work late at night. Overall good experience."
good,Nordstrom from time to time takes care of their employees. They have had pay raises for the past four years. Great team environments. The human resources have great open door policy
good,"long hours, great pay with benefits. not so healthy work /life balance. made lots of friends and learned  a lot about management and HR. great for young and seasoned managers."
good,I love the culture/ stress free work enviorment and flexablity of my schedule. In general I like helping our customers and enjoy working with my team of collegues.
good,"New challenges always being introduced and the environment  was adept to change to adapt to the new challenges."
good,Not a bad company to work for. their benefits package is decent. Unfortunately their compensation policies and Salaries tend to be below average. It is a pity because is a good company in a struggling field.
good,Great company to work for if you're looking for a basic job. Certain departments are 100% commission based and can be quite competitive. Hard to grow within the company.
good,"Great place to work, fun and got along well with co workers. Worked great with my school and other life schedule. Had a great time entirely being there."
good,"Though retail is not my favorite industry to work in, I have had a great experience with my management and team at Nordstrom as well as pay and schedule."
good,"simple job and work was as simple too i learned to work at a face pace and be independent with my work without the need of constant supervision , hardest part of the job was the long commute"
good,Nordstrom is a great company. They value there employees and have great benefits. Nordstrom believes in promoting with in the company. Most departments are commission based. Cosmetics is hourly plus 3% commission
good,"Great company culture and positive work environment. Lazy management, little room for advancement unless you want to stay in the same position for 10+ years or move to Seattle. "
good,Working at Nordstrom was very competitive. The employees would sometimes fight for sales. I loved that you can help customers in any department and en commission.
good,"Working at Nordstrom reminded me of a high school click environment, with my manager being very loyal to certain employees and showing discrimination against others.  I have never worked in an environment like this - and worked within the entertainment industry for many years in Los Angeles!!"
good,"I was hard work, it was very busy. You always have to pick up some where and go back with helping every customer no matter how overwhelm you were or busy."
good,"Stepping into a competitive sales environment is not always easy, however, Nordstrom gives workers a good workout and opportunities to make decent money."
good,"A typical day working as an employer at Nordstrom Rack, we had a set goal to make for the day, we greeted costumers and helped find any merchandise they needed. "
good,competitive environment as we worked off commission but the team I worked with was great. there are a lot of store wide events for employees and sales competitions to make the days interesting. Retail is retail and it has its issues but many of my coworkers have worked in the same store and department for many years.
good,"Retail work is rough but can be  fun. When business is good, you work, but when things are off you will not, which makes paying rent, or mortgage hard at times. Its a great part time job and Nordstrom is really the best retail store to work for."
good,"Nordstrom as a company is great and offers a lot of benefits to their employees. However, the store location you work at will play a huge part in your experience here."
good,"This is a great work place for those needing to gain experience in Luxury retail. The staff and environment is very encouraging and willing to help you reach your potential. Staff is very willing to answer any questions and help when needed which makes it a great place to start outing higher end retail. On the other hand, some departments have really poor commission opportunities and even though I am top seller in my department, my 2 week pay check is still under one thousand. That is barely enough to survive... Some departments may have better commission opportunities, so make sure to do your research before they ask where you want to be placed during the interview. Otherwise, use Nordstrome as a stepping stone to work somewhere more prestige and make more money."
good,While it is a fun place to work and management truly cares about the employees.  The compensation is either hourly or commission and you only earn commission if you sell more than what your hourly wage times your hours for the pay period were.  The income is not something that can be counted on as it varies each 2 week pay period with seasonal highs and off season lows.
good,Nordstrom provides you with many opportunities to learn. If you're a hardworker there is opportunity to move up in the company. Sales goals can be stressful.
good,Great Place to work with great people. It is just a fast paced environment with long hours as is expected with the role. There are lots of changes all the time so you have to be quick and sharp.
good,The job is awesome! The pay wasn't too great but overall it might be worth it because you get to help people get what they need and see them smile. I loved getting a discount that was nice! In my department everyone worked as a team even though it was commission based. The training I received here was amazing and very helpful! I'd recommend this job to all my friends!
good,I would start at 7:00 am with a quick 15 minute meeting  to discuss the what all was going on for the day. From there our team of eight would split into groups and do what we called recovery of the store which means getting the store customer ready  by the time the store oped. My management for  the most part was very supportive and understanding of day to day challenges that came up. It was a very creative job doing window displays and would have to to say the hardest part of the job was not having enough time in the day. Hands down the most enjoyable and rewarding part  of the job was stepping back and looking at a finished window display and knowing that I dids that.
good,"I t is a good place to work. Good Management.      Discount  .  Culture .  Good people.  The best cosmetic in town, and responsable people............................."
good,"Buisy work day, fast paced environment which I enjoyed"
good,Good retail environment overall. commission based environment so its pretty competitive. Managers get salary but still have selling expectations. As far as clothing retail goes this is a great place to work. Can be very political. You have to be willing to play the political game.
good,Nordstrom is good company with room to grow for the right people. I enjoy working for the company for the most part. Hours are not what I need and I believe we shouldn't have so much focus on opening up credit cards.
good,"Nordstrom has many benefits for their employees including health coverage, PTO and discounts. There is opportunity for growth within the company. I recommend this company."
good,"This job has the potential to be fun and easy, but needy customers place way too much stress on the employees. They expect the best of everything at a discounted store."
good,"Working at the Rack was a great experience. I had not worked in retail in over twenty years, so it was a good opportunity to see how hard people work in this line of work. One of the hardest things about working at the Rack was the schedule you have to keep. I had worked a 7 am to 5 pm job for many years and the irregular schedule was something to get used to."
good,I loved the job. really did but i did not receive a full time position. They encouraged me to re apply next season but was turned down for a position with no explanation.
good,"I really did enjoyed working here, the only reason I didn't was because the working hours were terrible and they didn't let you take days off .  A typical day at work was restocking re merchandise and calling existing costumers."
good,"The different facets of Nordstrom cause for different cultures in each area. Some areas have very cut-throat management where favorites are promoted, while others have very flexible management who want everyone to succeed and grow their career."
good,"they treat the employees well , the work isn't strenuous you meet great people everyone is friendly you get discounts and if your store does well you get bonuses.."
good,I enjoy the department store atmosphere. My job had me in every part of the store and back rooms in search of ordered items. Co workers in general were pleasant.
good,The hourly rate is good for a retail store sales position. Good benefit. No stress. Management is good in general. Most managers are willing to help you to grow within the company if you are interested.
good,"beside from the snobby girls that work there, this was a great place to work. I enjoyed the atmosphere and got along with most of the people. at the end I left on contract but felt as if they would hire me back if they needed me!"
good,"its a fun place to go work but the writing is on the walls and sales numbers are constantly dropping.  When your fellow sales associates constantly complain that their new goals are less than those of last year, it's time to look elsewhere."
good,Nordstrom is a very competitive environment. You have to be able to handle some type of pressure. Other than that most of the people are friendly. You have to work for your money.
good,"This is the place to come and learn what customer service is about.  If you have never worked here, then you haven't been trained by the best. it is definitely the epitome of customer service"
good,"Typical day will consist of completing daily follow ups to provide update to commitments to customers. Greeting sales staff and management to update myself on the day's activities and goals."
good,I love it because of the team of people I work with. There are plenty on opportunities for growth as long as you put your mind to it. Apply to check out what Hautelook has to offer.
good,Great place to work great people everythujg about the job is great beside the benfitsbits takes over a 1000 hours to get which I feel like it's a lot.
good,Mostly a good company to work for . As with any company my work satisfaction varied significantly with the five managers that I worked for during my tenure.
good,"Nordstrom is an ok place to work. Ive been there for 11 years and worked in many roles.  Visual Merchandising, Sales, Department Manager, Regional Trainer."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Nordstrom. I was hired for the Christmas season and was one of 2 people kept on in my department. You need to perform to be kept after seasonal employment. Being said, if you want to make a quick buck during the holidays (hello college students), this is a GREAT time to work. You'll easily make $4k (before tax) per month if you don't slack off. Drawback with commission retail is the seasonality. You'll be lucky to make commission once Christmas is over. The returns will MURDER your sales numbers even if you think you are selling well. January is dead and shopping won't pick up much until Valentine's day comes around."
good,"I started in Women's Shoes where the highest commission is.  The job is 100% commission based, unless you don't cap your hourly pay.  The job is great for learned more about a customer service job, and working your hardest to earn more money.  I am a recent college graduate, and it was a great starting job.  Not somewhere I would like stay for longer than a year.  It is competitive on the sales end, you're always looking for the customer that has the expensive tastes.  I believe you need an interest or eye for fashion. Many people expect that."
good,"the company itself was good to work for, the management had their favorites that they would keep around. even though they said they didn't everyone who works there knows that they have their favorite for every department"
good,"My days working here would start early. Working from home with a cup of coffee and a smiley face (over the phone). That was the best, not having to drive into the workplace, but having an option to work from home. The hardest part about my day and position was problem solving when a customer order was unfulfilled and the item was sold out."
good,I met some of the best people working at this location and lifelong friends. I will say I felt like I was not compensated as well as I should have for the work I was doing. They worked with my schedule and I felt appreciated for my work. There is a lot of favoritism when promotions come around.
good,"Had great management that was always helping to get you promoted and advance in the company. Unfortunately, higher ups in the company are not as helpful and there are a lot of politics. The culture is positive and upbeat. Has the best customer service bar none."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for overall. They have great benefits and pay fairly well for a retailer. However, if you are not a brown noser, you will never be promoted or eligible for transfers. They preach about internal promotions all the time. The same people get promoted time and time again. I highly suggest getting in good with as many higher ups as possible if you are looking to build a career with the company."
good,"like the company, Commission baste if your in sales,returns are against your pay. If your in stock it's some good work for you.Employee discounts and promotions are good."
good,"Good place to work. Work culture is great, supportive environment and supportive teams. Sales are great. I loved working for the company, management has changed a bit."
good,"Unlimited earning potential but no work/life balance. Great culture, they give you the tools to be successful.  Be prepared to work most weekends and build relationships with your customers."
good,"I'd be asked to do a variety of tasks on a schedule that was printed out each morning and to complete it before I left at the end of the day. In between doing those tasks I also would help out customers find the clothing they wanted and would ring them out. I work in the men's dept and I love picking out outfits for them to wear. I love measuring them for suits and often had to pick out outfits that they needed to wear that same day for an event. Overall I enjoyed having a very full day, working with many people."
good,"Enjoy working and learn from the well train management team"
good,"The schedule is hard to manage as it varies each week. Management positions are relatively easy to come by if you work hard and get noticed, however, if you really want to advance your career with the company you will have to be prepared to relocate for promotions, even if it's not the position you really want. They put you through your paces and make you experience every possible experience before a promotion."
good,Nordstrom Cafe was a fun place to work for someone looking for extra cash. Management was friendly and daily tasks were manageable. Hardest part was standing for long hours.
good,Being in sales is okay. You don't nearly get paid for the work you put in unless you are a cut throats type of person. They pay more than hourly wage if you are hourly
good,Very demanding. At times you have to pick between your personal life vs. work. Often working holidays. Good management and supportive teams. If you are looking to grow you can get promoted and move up
good,"This was my first retail job so I definitely learned a lot. I think Nordstrom as a company is an excellent place to work. But this location has not been that fun. It's filled with a bunch of managers that know what they are doing but have a disrespectful approach to the workers. Our store location recently changed the way our team works and a lot of us workers had something to say about it. They could care less what we have to say about it and they always have an excuse as to why something is the way it is instead of just admitting their wrong. The hardest part is biting your tongue because anything you say or do will have an immediate effect on your hours. If you don't have completely open availability you could literally be scheduled for 40 hours one week and 10 hours the next which is very unstable. I found myself having to get a second and third job during the school year because I have rent and things like that to pay. You need a lot of patience, management wise and customer wise. At the end of the day just push through because you can't beat the pay. Starting is 11.00 and every 1000 hours you work you get a raise. If you live closer to any other Nordstrom or Nordstrom Rack location ,I would surely recommend to start there before you start at the Ann Arbor, Michigan location."
good,"A typical work day was both fun and exciting. Although a competitive work environment can be stimulating and make the job fun, I do not believe that management should compete with new and lower employees. this part of the job was stressful and did not allow for improvement in my sales experience."
good,"great, fun place to work and make a quick buck whether you work part time on the weekends while in school or are young and willing to work hard. not a lot of room to move past floor management."
good,Being able to flex to other depts made working  a lot better since your able to learn more things than just your own dept. Being able to listen to music is a plus. No job there was to hard to attain productivity numbers.
good,"I love the company 90% of the time. It was an amazing experience and I grew as a leader and had personal growth as well. Work-life balance was not an option. I was married to my job, which was an issue at times."
good,"Management is great their understanding and willing to teach, job is fairly easy, everyone is nice and outgoing and they offer tons of hours and are willing to promote worthy candidates"
good,"Nordstrom treats its people very well. The management can be very good, but not always. The customers are generally a pleasure to work with. The pay structure is competitive."
good,"This is a great place to start working in a retail career. You will learn the art of selling to customers and creating a clientele. Customer service has made great changes to support the sales team. However, the lack of stability due to the poor performance of the store meant that employees had to become VERY cut throat and aggressive. Make sure to negotiate your salary up front because there isn't likely going to be a significant raise in your future."
good,"typical day: frequently worked both stations by myself"
good,Nordstrom is a great retail company to work for.  Great benefits and lots of opportunity to grow and move up in company. Down side is long hours on your feet if you work in sales.  Can be highly competitive because of commission based pay.
good,"Working in Nordstrom will keep you productive all the time. If it was helping a customer to getting alterations, you always stay productive. The only thing I kind of dislike working there was some of the customers, I ran across some very rude ones."
good,"I highly enjoy working at the E-bar. I learned how to make every drink we have available. Steam milk to make a, late, cappuccino, macchiato, flat white and Cortado. I love learning how to prefect all the drinks we make and learn new ones. I personally think the managemt of the establishment isn't the best it could be. That is one of the main reasons I am looking to leave. The hours are in consistent and it's hard to have a personal life. One of the hardest parts of working at the E bar  finding things to do when we at really slow. One of the best parts is the people I meet and the getting to know the regulars. Not only what they drink but actually having conversation and getting to know them."
good,I worked for nordstroms for 2 years and the first year was alright until they started to make unnecessary changes and ruined a lot of things. Everyday I would assess what was going on in the delivery room and see what next days or any priority packages would need to be shipped out. Some of the management were smart and new what they were doing but for the most part they relied on us the worker way to much to help them with their problems when its them that should be leading not us.
good,"Overall good company, the management for the most part wants to see workers advance rather than promote from outside the company. The talent scouting for management is done by other managers who work alongside you to see what steps will be best for you to take next."
good,"This company provides with a great sales experience, product knowledge and the potential to earn great pay, The experience offered and training is one of the markets best."
good,"A typical day at work would be to check in, clean up after yourself and your customer. Hardest part was to just grab all the customers that you wanted"
good,"Great work environment! Very fun and the people who work there are amazing. There is a lot of room for growth and promotions, and there is a lot of fluidity in the company."
good,"Great place to work, schedules shift not to fun."
good,"Working the Credit Dept in  Colorado was wonderful. Heavy call volume, but management made the  day a good day no matter how busy we were. Now at Nordstrom Rack in Calif"
good,"Normal day as a stockperson is coming in at 4:30 AM and leaving whenever the manager tells you to. My schedule would say 11:30 but I NEVER left on time, most of the time I would leave at around 1PM because we were either understaffed or doing unnecessary tasks that put us behind schedule. Literally, all of my coworkers (whom I loved dearly) on the stock team left before I did because our managers never really treated us with respect and hardly gave us recognition. We got put down more than anything. Personally, I was degraded by my managers and they weren't the most understanding people when it came to personal issues. If I asked a question about the work, I would get smart or sarcastic responses as if I was stupid for asking. They boast this ""open door policy"" and when my coworkers took advantage of this benefit and spoke up about issues going on, things were peachy for about 3 days and then back to the same ol'. The company itself is great, though! Always did things for charity, potlucks, and when times got hard for me financially, they did help."
good,It is retail so the hours are tough but it is a great company to work for! You get commission on everything you sell so you are as successful as the effort you put in!
good,"I work as a rover, 30-35 hours a week. pay is above average any retailers, mandatory 2 days off a week, and management is very helpful. Highly recommended"
good,"Long days"
good,"If you want to work in retail, Nordstrom is the place to be.  The culture is extremely positive and the associates are outstanding.  You are in a position to go above and beyond to assist every customer."
good,"Working at Nordstrom of Partridge Creek in Clinton Township, MI was definitely a great experience. Your able to make so many connections with people of all walks of life by simply suggesting or securing the decision on a new piece of fashion."
good,"Love the job, working at different counters, getting to know all the different cosmetic brand. But the hours have gne down drastically for beauty on call"
good,Positive work atmosphere and great management. Learn how to balance job and multi-tasking skills. Great co-workers & every day is a learning experience.
good,"Great atmosphere to work in, Fast paced work environment. Learning experience, Extensive trainings. "
good,"Great place to start out in the retail world. Great client building relationships. Energetic, able to learn a lot about the fashion industry."
good,"came to work, was handed to daily sheet on previous sales day, today sales requirement and lastly last years sales. If day was slow would call customers to bring in sales by phone or by events.  On certain events, I was the event specialist.  I learned a new way to be the best customer service agent I could be. "
good,My typical day at the Nordstrom Distribution Center was just packing items for distribution while maintaining a constant pace. It was fun getting to work with different people while on the job but people were leaving every few days or so. I stayed at the job until I had to move back.
good,"I really enjoyed working the Rover position because it allowed me to do different tasks each day."
good,This is a great place to work especially if you are set on working in retail long term. There is much to learn but it is a fun place to work if you are willing to do what it takes to succeed. You are in control of how much you make due to the commission based sales environment.
good,"My typical day at the store would include a variety of situations. For the most part, the customers I had to help would be nice. The occasional mean and difficult customer sometimes made the job a lot harder. It was enjoyable seeing kids everyday and helping them pick out clothes, or shoes. Our managers were always very accommodating when it came to anything from break time, to scheduling."
good,If you can work sales you'll love working at Nordstrom. When times of season it is fast paced and and fun yet hectic environment.
good,Nordstrom has always been famous for customer service. I fear the future of the company is not as rosy. I am not sure there is a strong future for department stores in the current retail landscape.
good,"A lot of people see this job as being creative, in reality you don't have much control on what you can style. There are a lot of guidelines and rules, and depending on availability of product that determines what you can style. You are need to set floors, work with managers on determining the best location for product, teaching merchandising standards, producing several visual presentations throughout the store and maintaining them, and setting up events among other things."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Nordstrom. I was one of the first salespeople hired to open the first International Nordstrom location. Most of the other salespeople were friendly and I enjoyed working with them. I worked in menswear and the environment could go from really busy one second, to completely dead the next. I learned from Nordstrom that working in a fast paced environment can be difficult at times, but if you manage your time properly, you can get a lot accomplished."
good,"A day at work is always busy and sometimes long depending on what task you are doing that day. I learned a lot of things such as; picking, processing, sending, and receiving bulk merchandise from vendors. Putting away P.O.'s and replenishing any low or empty stock within the warehouse. The hardest part of the Reserve Stock department is looking for cases that are lost and replenishing the stock itself. The best part about the Reserve Stock department is you get to walk all over the warehouse while working. All my co-workers are funny and respectable people to be around, and we look out for each other in the workplace."
good,"If you are willing to show up and try to be the best, you will be promoted. You do have to let management know that you are interested in being promoted or with a good customer base. You can be successful as a salesperson. Returns can hurt you, but if you stay on top of them, not to badly."
good,They try and say that they care but they really don't. I learned that jealousy in the workplace should be dealt with immediately and not pushed aside.
good,Nordstrom gives great opportunity for growth within the company.  Nordstrom employees gain superb customer serivce experience and are given the ability to be independent at work.
good,"I worked my tail off at Nordstrom for over a year being promised promotions over and over, but since the turn over was so high they needed me where I was.  "
good,"I must start this review off by saying that Nordstrom is a great place to work. The culture is fun, the pay and benefits are top notch for the industry, and the work is rewarding."
good,"I worked my tail off at Nordstrom for over a year being promised promotions over and over, but since the turn over was so high they needed me where I was.  "
good,"I must start this review off by saying that Nordstrom is a great place to work. The culture is fun, the pay and benefits are top notch for the industry, and the work is rewarding."
good,"To do list which keeps me organized, howeber this doesn't mean am not flexible to changes that come along with the dynamics in the business or an orgaization"
good,"I enjoyed my time with Billy Jealousy, I got to know some great co-workers and always satisfied customers. It gave me great on the job training on how to help customers and make sure they leave the store happy with their purchase."
good,"Great job security, long hours and commission only. If you don't sell you don't make money. Returns kills you.. COMISSION ONLY says it all"
good,"Great retail company. Love the discounts, great job if you're still in school. I wouldn't do management though. Long hours for very little pay."
good,Great training program! Taught how to drive your own business and sales. I enjoyed working for the company and I would highly recommend it to others.
good,"Overall, it's a great place to work.  There is a lot of room for advancement with this company.  They are fast growing as well."
good,"The job itself is great, ""sell more, make more"" but there are some annoying aspects that you just have to maneuver around. Strictly commission; so you have to be hungry but weather the storm of fraudulent returns."
good,For me a typical day at work would be monitoring cameras looking for theft and walking around the store in the back storage areas looking for employee theft. I've learned that most theft is from employees and they steal by doing fraud returns and pass offs to customers. The management there is okay. It was a new store so their still in that learning phase of how to deal with important matters with employees and customers. My co-workers are amazing and really are there when I need them. Especially on shoplift stops where it can get out of hand they always make the situation better. That's what a team does. We help and protect each other. The hardest part of the day is trying to get a customer who is using a fraud credit card. That's hard because you really don't know if it's fraud until they try to use it and once you come onto the floor they run. The enjoyable part of my job is establishing relationships with the sales floor and management. The more we all work together and the more we all communicate with each other the better our store will run.
good,Worked here during the summer. Exposes you to the retail industry. Unless you are working in corporate or have no other options I wouldn't want to be doing sales here.
good,work-life balance is tough when trying to have a family. very tough working on commission only and customer returns go against you. very stressful not know what your paycheck will be each check
good,Management is open and willing to work with your schedule whether it is part time or full time.  Those that desire to grow within the company are given the support and training needed to do so.
good,"I truly enjoyed working others and helping customers with new product knowledge. This was a challenging position for me, being it was my first commission based retail job."
good,"Selling ,selling, selling in a high commission based environment. Competitive sales floor and a self driven business that uses in house individual track system to log potential high volume customers. Fast paced and profitable."
good,"I love Nordstrom, and I love helping others to shop and buy.It was fun but not enough money for me."
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom would be meeting and greeting customers. Assisting customers in making decisions regarding jewelry/watches. Keeping work area clean, as well as restocking items, jewelry boxes, etc. Sending out repair requests and making customers aware of promotions, as well are upcoming sales."
good,"Nordstrom offers a great opportunity for advancement. If you are a hard worker and have the will to succeed, it is easy to move ""down the pyramid"" in this company."
good,"I really love my co-workers! Department managers have been butting heads lately, so a many people have quit. However, I have worked here throughout college, and overall Nordstrom has been a great company to work for in comparison to other retailers."
good,Received and processed daily shipments. Learned how to input inventory of handheld scanners. Management provided good leadership. Co-workers always worked as a team. The hardest part was rearranging the stock room.What I most liked about the job was the people I got to work with.
good,I had a great manager for a mentor.  He taught me valuable information on running an E-Bar.  I still use a lot of what I learned today.
good,It's a great workplace but poor compensation. Management needs to be more experienced. I really like the work culture. Lots of fun people to work with.
good,"I give a bad management review because new managers and assistant managers need more training on how to handle, talk, and followup with employees. Even though they hire part-time, talk with the managers on how many hours you can work; they will work you as a full-time employee.One thing I wasn't to comfortable with is commissioned based pay, but if I didn't meet that, you get your hourly pay rate. Overall I love this place! They're fun, you can dress super trendy, and they have so many incentives where you can earn money on the spot."
good,While working in the kids department I felt the competitiveness right off the bat. I also felt that there were teams throughout the department making sure everyone was taking part in the sales. I really liked most people I worked with in this department and the fast pace environment but didn't like management and how they overlooked unethical behaviors.
good,"My coworkers were all very nice, as were the customers.  However, management had their preselected group for advancement.  They tended toward the younger."
good,A typical day at Nordstrom involves selling product and working closely with employees. I have had some truly amazing managers. The hardest part of the job is the strange work schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with great co workers.
good,"This is a great company to work for unless you get unqualified, unequipped management. It was fun most of the time. Some sales quotas are unreasonable."
good,"Nordstrom Rack is a great place to work, every Nordstrom I've ever worked for has great sense of camaraderie . The store all comes together to assure that goals are met and the customers are serviced in the best manner."
good,"Love all my co-workers"
good,"This job has helped me with working independently, as well as a productive team member.There are pros and cons to this job. I have learned exceptional customer service skills as well as building and maintaining customer relationships."
good,"My time spent in this company is largely very good. the hours at Nordstrom were decent for working a 3rd shift schedule,  and the company likes to hire their employees from within, witch is good. they are also incentive based so it gives you motivation to work hard and be competitive. what I did in the company was sort, build, read receipts, pack, and ship boxes."
good,"Good benefits and a lot of room to grow. Biggest fault is that due to the commission environment, it leads to an uncomfortable relationship with co workers. There is always a strong competitive element that tends to create a negative atmosphere. "
good,"a great company!!! very nice management and co workers. "
good,Cleaning and organizing shirts was a daily routine as well as calling customers for events and special sales. I learned great communication skill as well as working with a team of great employees. Management was strict but fair. The hardest part about the job was leaving it and the most enjoyable part was coming to work everyday and selling.
good,"The great thing about Nordstrom is that they hire management from within. All managers started out as sales associates at some point or another, so they have a fair perspective on the difficulties of the job and know the products well. All of the managers were a delight to work with at my store. With the constant communication (via headsets/radios), the atmosphere between everyone becomes a family-like team environment. At Nordstrom, they give you a pretty clear path on what you have to do in order to move ""Down the Pyramid."" There are no invisible hoops you have to jump through. It's a set path that everyone has to move through. Also, there is a ""Future Nordstrom Leader"" program for associates who wish to ""Move Down."" It's a great program, and I personally learned a lot while getting to network with people and management from other Rack and Full-line stores in my area."
good,"Great place to work if you can ignore the generic office politics. You earn based off of the work that you put in. Must be commission driven and very customer service oriented to succeed. Promotes from within. Depending on the department, a large part of your day may be focused on getting out of the negative (sales) due to the company's extremely lenient return policy. (We're often faced with what we call ""renters"" which are people who buy with the full intent to return it after it has been used - and then buy it again) Extremely sometimes overly-enthusiastic upper-management. Sometimes confusing blurred lines between bending the rules, and going above and beyond for the customer."
good,"The company rewards you when you perform well (as a manager).  The pay isn't the greatest, but when you hit your numbers the bonuses make up for it.  I loved the customers that I developed a relationship with."
good,One of the best companies that not only cares about customers but also the employees. So sad I am leaving because I am relocating with my husband to San Antonio
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work. It is a strictly commissioned sales environment, which puts you in charge of your paycheck. You are able to venture out of your home department and sell all over the store. "
good,"During my time at Nordstrom I ensured repeat and increased business via development of and outreach to new and established clientele, consistently met and exceeded individual sales goals, dealt with daily cash reconciliation at high-volume flagship, supervised staff of 2-4 employees within my department and managed break schedules in managers absence."
good,"A usual 8-hour shift primarily consists of approaching customers and helping them find merchandise. There are also specific tasks, such as processing orders from outside the store and floor maintenance duties. It's a good work environment-- employees have minimal supervision on the assurance to use good judgement always. The only occasional downsides include the commission based pay along with the excessive expected amount of outreach to customers. The management is fair, although could use improvement. Other than that, being a salesperson at Nordstrom is very enjoyable and doesn't always feel like just work."
good,"Fast paced work environment thats always changing. Responsible for sales, mechandising, stocking, quota attainment, and most importantly excellent customer service."
good,"A typical day for me is packing and processing orders. Since working for Nordstrom I've learned a lot about inventory management. Management seen to push for the growth of their employees. Sometimes we come across the whole ""too many chiefs"" scenario. overall, my co-workers are pretty dedicated to the job. hardest part of the job is the lack of communication. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction you have with people from all over the country."
good,A typical day at Nordstrom in my department consist of making a personal daily goal and a department goal.  I greet every customer on my floor with in 1 minute.  I always try to add on to the customer sale to the maximum.  I also try to make a connection with my customers for future business.  I give all my customers the best service I can offer.  I assist  and train new employees. I just completed FNL (Future Nordstrom Leader) class.
good,Customer Service rep and sales. Helped with sales and stock of shippment daily.
good,A strategic Brand Management role that was truly dynamic and fast paced.
good,"however management leaves much to be desired... Turnover in the selling departments seems to be unusually high, however the support teams generally stay rooted. Salespeople's paychecks are commission based, so really, you make your own paycheck."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for. After being there for over 2 years and working in different roles within the company I am ready to transition back into a job that has more consistent work hours. The people you meet while working for Nordstrom are inspiring, hard working and extremely nice."
good,"I enjoyed picking up the competitive atmosphere which drove me to be in the top of my department, Salon Shoes."
good,"I loved my job in sales with Nordstrom. Commission sales are tough, but this is a company that has customers no matter what the economy is like. Meeting new people daily when dealing with customers was a really fun part of the job. "
good,"Brewing teas and coffees in the early morning. Maintaining customer service with a smile. Handling cash at a fast pace, along with long lines of customers with heavy demand."
good,"Great company, can advance quickly at the store level, if you can sell and are willing to relocate."
good,"Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work if you're looking for a job in the fashion industry. They give you a lot of free rein when it comes to creativity, and working with customers. Participation in  merchandising the sales floor is something that differs manager to manager. If you have a manager that wants you to fully understand the way things operate, then you will learn a lot. When working in really competitive departments things can get a little territorial because your checks are based off of commission. Advancement happens quickly in comparison to other companies, but you have to be nominated. Proving yourself is big at Nordstrom, and if you work hard and prove that you deserve to be promoted they will deliver."
good,"Commission based job, it can be stressful when all returns hits you on a slow day (even last year purchase return will hit you!) "
good,Good company with many learning and advancement opportunities.
good,"Overall Nordstrom is a great place to work, unfortunately there was little room for advancement in the department I worked for."
good,"Great place to work, care about their employees.  Enjoy working with and assisting employees in different capacities."
good,"A good company who demands the best from all employees."
good,"Great company. Commissioned sales is different from regular retail. For one, my whole day begins and ends with me helping customers because in the end, what they buy from me is equivalent to my whole pay. Working hard is key. It does cause a riff between coworkers because of the competitiveness, especially during the holidays. I have learned quite a bit about sales goals and taking the initiative. The most enjoyable part of the job would definitely be the satisfaction of a job well done after surpassing the goals set for the day."
good,"An always busy workplace with many responsibilities. Working here has taught me extremely well work ethic, and always being on time and getting everything completed on time. My co-workers and and everyday working experiences was the most enjoyable. Other pros, were being able to have a flexible schedule due to attending graduate school, and being able to receive health benefits."
good,Excellent place to learn the skills of a good salesman. Hours are very flexible for students....
good,"Overall, Nordstrom is a very good company to work for.The benefits packages offered are better than those offered in most other companies. It is an excellent place for a young adult to begin his/her career and to gain the much-coveted Nordstrom training."
good,"Making plan to have a great amount of increases for business for every year.  "
good,"At Nordstrom, I really learned the value of hard work through the company ethics on providing outstanding customer service.  This taught me how to be more attentive to customer needs while learning how to quickly and efficiently accommodate those needs."
good,Management not up to par for department job advancements happens too quickly. No adequate training for logistics team members.
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for. There's so much experience and knowledge to gain. You work with a more sophisticated clientele than most retail store. The only downside would be that working for this company can cut in to your social life.
good,The overall work environment within Nordstrom is all about professionalism and respect towards each and every employee.  It's dedication to maintain a quality workplace is 2nd to none.
good,"typical day at work is prepare for the day by getting everything ready for to go orders, make displays for the food and after opening get ready for the rush during busy hour run food timely and accordingly.i have learned so much i am able to successfully cover any position needed.I love working with my co-workers we are a big family and we help each other. The hardest part of the job is having different manager tell how to do the same thing differently so basically no communication . The best part about my job is that is always busy and i  love working so that is never a problem."
good,"Verify orders pulled from sales floor. Shipped to customer as per their request."
good,Nordstrom is great experience to learn about customer service.  Meeting customers and building a relationship with them always keeps work interesting.  
good,"If you like making sales, do it at Nordstrom.  They will treat you well!"
good,"Have learn ed direct customer service skill."
good,Nordstrom provides an environment for people to thrive and advance as long as they are willing to make some sacrifices. 
good,"Great company to work for and a very diverse group of people. Sales goals were extremely high, and the only training I ever received was on the POS system, making selling products in my department rather difficult. "
good,"open tailor shop and prepare garment to be altered,learned that pleasing customers is very important factor,management is dynamic .People I work with are really fun .The distance between work and home is far and we get these wonderful discounts on designer clothes."
good,Being loss prevention agent was a new experience for me. The workings that go on inside of department stores behind the scenes were quite fascinating. Unfortunately the company had to lay me off considering I was the newest agent there.
good,• Maximized sales by keeping up with new product trends and styles
good,Company values their people. Great place to learn retail. Fun environment. Takes to long for promotion.
good,"Working at Nordstrom gives you a lot of opportunity. However, Account Coordinators in the cosmetics industry do not have a lot of work, life, balance. If you like sitting in the car all day and being away from home for 11+ hours a day the Account Coordinator role is a great role for you."
good,"I liked Nordstrom because it allowed me to create my own pay check, due to commsison based sales."
good,"Thankfully I had the ability to work in various roles in the company. Including visual merchandising, the Rack, and customer loyalty."
good,"Fresh out of the Intensive 5-month Training at Infosys, this was my first development project at the Nordstrom account. Replicating an existing application along with a few new modifications, although sounds easy but is always a challenge for a beginner. Tight deadlines made it even more challenging and turned it into fun of its own kind."
good,Same as that is for Nordstrom Production Support - Nearshore
good,"It was very good days working for Nordstrom, I had a realy nice time there."
good,"Varied responsibilities, mostly sales, although I assisted with visuals and scheduling. Learned how to interact with varied cultures, sales techniques, working my way up into a company."
good,This place was great while in college. I know a few people who went back to it while doing their masters. Good money and great hours made this place ideal over the last few years. Definitely recommend to anyone wanting to expand in the restaurant industry.
good,A good overall retail experience. Professional environment and specific to sitting down and working one on one with the customer in order to provide the best service and to meet all their personal needs. I ranked in the top third in sales consistently and created a strong repeat client base. Able to handle the challenge of extremely busy days and working with multiple customers at one time. Went back seasonally in 2010.
good,Good company. Nice place to work. Good culture.Good training program. Good support people. They give you the ability to run your own business.
good,I enjoy working for Nordstrom. It is by far the best retailer I have ever worked for! They strive to make sure everyone is treated fair and equally. This company is quick to promote young talent. The management strives to coach you which makes you feel like they strive to help you succeed. I say the real boss is the customer. which can be good and bad. All you can do is go in each day and strive to give exceptional service to each and every customer.
good,Nordstrom RACK is a great opportunity to get experience with a big coporation or company. Easily allows you to seek out the job/careers that you are looking forward to down the road.
good,this job is great it open me up to the supply field that i have been in for sometime now its i learned everything from issuing and receving to ordering processing and stocking.
good,Nordstrom is a great and exciting place to work for from the floor staff to management with competitive compensation.
good,Customer service type job. Great management and training .
good,best people to work with and just a great family. They help you when you need the help at work or in personal life
good,"You assist customers in wardrobing from head to toe. I learned that you can advance quickly with hardwork. Management can help nurture you and help you reach your full potential. My co-workers and myself work as a team. The hardest part of the job, is the physical labor and not always getting equal compensation for the hard work that you put out (typical of retail). The most enjoyable part of the job is connecting with the customer. They are honest, they appreciate all that we do, and they treat you like family."
good,"Overall the company culture was indeed exceptional, it was a pleasure to work with management and fellow staff."
good,9 hr p/day.
good,-Generous meal time
good,provide excellent customer service- meeting new clients and their needs (do 's and do nt's) management (some what supportive) co-workers (everyone trying to make a dollar.(commission -based) the hardest part of the job.( when you work very hard with your customer and they decide to return merchandise) the most important part of my job..(changing my customer negative attitude to a postive situation)
good,Working at Nordstrom is great. You give your best and you get rewarded in the end. They take care of their employees.
good,"working at nordstrom really opened up alot of oppertunities for me. i realized being there so long i developed good customer service and better ethics. also that nordstrom is located 5th market so that means we got to deal with all kinds of people from nice and polite to rude, crazy, physco. i leaven to handel all situation with concern and care for the safty of others as well as for my self and staff"
good,Good Company to work for
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for if you only have time for Nordstrom. Especially if you enter a form of management. The pay and benefits are great. But the job does require you to be able to handle very stressful situations, not to mention the Customer is always Right."
good,"In a time when brick and mortar locations are being less visited, it is a challenge to bring home a lot of money. If someone returns what you have sold them that goes against your sales the day they return it- hopefully if it's an exchange someone honors the work you did with the original sale."
good,"As a manager in the cosmetics department, I enjoyed the position, however I had to apply for financial help once a year when my hours were cut from 40 to 23. My hours were cut despite running the second largest counter with consecutive increases and five star customer satisfaction. They work you 50 hours a week during the busy season, and inventory, then come February and March, you can't afford to commute to work. I wish I had not had this negative experience. I know many people who love working for this company."
good,"Learning valuable skills in selling and relationship building."
good,Laid back atmosphere. Friendly. Enjoyed working there. Nordstrom is huge on customer service and event planning. I wished business was better at the location I was working at or I would had stayed.
good,I was in order pickup and everyone to the extent of customers and other associates was really nice. You match the order to the customer and sometimes run it out to their car (curbside pickups). Organize shelves and etc. Pretty chills job.
good,"I have a lot of tedious things that need to be accomplished on a daily and weekly basis. Most of my work is done in office where there is a lot of typing, and data entry. The remainder of my shift is spend on the sales floor making employees and customer feel at ease."
good,"The daily assignments was for employees to meet there quarter everyday. We had work perform at a fast demand pace, from lifting hanging and transporting."
good,"This company lead me to always have a different day, each day, which always kept things new and fun. With those fun times, presented me with challenges. These challenges were great opportunities for my managers to coach and train me so I could grow into a leader for others. The toughest part of the job was dealing with upset customers and feeling like we didn't provide them with excellent customer service. I LOVED being able to solve challenges whether internal or external and provide our customers with excellent customer service."
good,"Working at Nordstrom was vey fun and lively. Despite having a fairly high employee turnover rate the department always felt well staffed and I felt supported by my coworkers. The hours were flexible and reliable. My manager was knowledgable and willing to learn as well as teach. Overall, it was a great experience. However, not unlike most customer service jobs, I believe the employees should be paid more."
good,"I really loved the culture the company promotes and tries to give. The management was great. However, the fellow coworkers are like sharks and make it an uncomfortable and competitive environment. That was the reason I ended up leaving. I didn't feel like it was a good place for my mental health because of the people I worked with (again, beside management)."
good,"Great company to work for! I learned so many core skills for customer service, management and sales that will last a lifetime. I recommend working here"
good,"Great company, they promote from within the company. You will always have goals. There is an open door policy. No matter where you work there will always be politics"
good,Everyone starts as selling specialist which is fine when you’re starting but not okay if you’re looking for something more advanced if your previous job was eliminated due to restructure
good,"Working as a server can have its ups and downs, but I generally found working there to be very rewarding and educational. I liked the fact that I was paid my state's minimum wage of $7.50, which helped make up for slow days. There are also healthcare benefits and paid time off, which were wonderful and unexpected for a typical restaurant job."
good,"God work from home job with good pay. Had a lot of systems to use and get used to. Training was okay, once start taking calls is when you really get used to system. Customers were good"
good,Its a good place to work if you do not mind fast paced work.The managers are pretty coo and understanding and the food is delicious. Hours are flexible.
good,This company has treated me well in the year I have work there and for that I’m grateful but I understand no work place is with out its moments. Nordstrom is no exception although I can say usually they try their best to make amends.
good,"Great place to work, great management, high integrity, employee discount, hourly pay plus commission for reward sign ups, some employees are a bit immature, nothing to serious. Overall good start up job."
good,"Work is constant but not demanding, managers are generally very nice and helpful. During seasons there is a drastic increase in workload, however it is easily delt with if you are efficient and work with your team."
good,"Nordstrom creates an amazing environment to learn hands-on about customer experience, selling, and managing a business. I would recommend it to anyone interested in entering retail, sales, or management."
good,Job is decent pay but is more than likely going up when minimum wage goes up. It's more of a individual effort instead of team effort unless you apply to work in the backroom on the trucks they have 6 days out of 7. Also may feel like you have to be watching your back all the time because there are associates willing to tatletail on someone first before being a friend. They are always looking to cash in some how some way on anyone's mistakes.  But other than that not bad.
good,I had done commission sales my whole career prior to working at Nordstrom. I enjoyed the work environment and the people I worked with were always helpful and willing to work as a team.
good,Almost 23 years spent with Nordstrom in many roles. They embrace a promote from within culture that supports advancement and growth on the merit of your efforts.
good,"As stated above very good atmosphere fast paced when needed but thats as to be expected. Training is good and everyone is very willing to lend a helping hand. During slow times you tend to get get cut more if youre pt, also to be expected. The manager who hired me was definitely my favorite very helpful and goal oriented with a positive outlook. My only real con was my specific manager for S.E. her priorities seemed very out of wack would yell at you over your ear phone multiple times while you have something literally in your hands but other people can stand around talking for 30 min and nothing would be said."
good,"productive and fun workplace"
good,"A typical day consisted of direction from the manager or supervisor as to what department or project you are responsible for that day. You could be working in Men's one day, Women's or Kid's or Shoes the next day. It kept things fresh, never boring. The Store Manager and Supervisors gave you a lot of free reign to display and restock the merchandise creatively, as long as it was done in an orderly fashion."
good,I liked working there and the staff. Management was the problem lot of favoritism happened. Scheduling problems. Great pay and start off is great. Would work there again. Great atmosphere over all. Met some amazing people. The discount is awesome and there products are great. Cleaning up after people can get difficult specially on markdowns and events. Easy to get to next To the bus stop very convenient. Food court discount too which came in handy. Have to wear a shirt they assign which helps not finding an outfit everyday. They do supply enough shirts and they do order often. They have employee party which was fun and we got to shop one day a year before the store opens. Can move up pretty quick if your motivated enough. Sometimes have to be there at 6 am for markdowns. Y ok u can switch h departments if you need hours. They where good with supplying hours.
good,"Even though going in to the company knowing that there would be no potential for management growth and potential because of my age, I thoroughly enjoyed working at Nordstrom.  The customer first mentally fit in well with the way that I have always treated my customers. We were paid well to become highly knowledgeable in our departments and it was a joy to work there. I will always miss my time spent working there."
good,I love the job but wanted full time and did not get the hours they said. Management and employees were pretty easy to work with. pay and hours were lacking
good,Nordstrom is a busy setting but the management team puts in the effort to keep it uplifting and relaxed as a work setting can be.  There is opportunity to move up in the company and is expedited with related prior experience.
good,Great customer service education. Empowerment to make good judgement decisions to benefit the customer. Good workplace environment. Competitive sales breeds excellent work ethic.
good,"good company to work for. people are nice, management is good. benefits are good. the customers can be high maintenance and annoying but i guess thats to be expected."
good,Minus some of the Mess I loved Nordstrom for the most part a great place to work. The hours were convenient I enjoyed the job other than a few co workers.
good,"It was a pretty good experience. The job kept me busy and kept my eye off the clock. At times it was stressful, but as long as you stay focused it is a good place to work."
good,"Good company, fast paced. Could treat their employees better. Looking forward to more opportunities from the training and experience that I received over the years"
good,"Nordstrom provided a fun work environment with great co-workers. Culture could be competitive at times, but that comes with any retail job. Management wasn't great, turnover for managers tended to be high, but overall a nice company to work for."
good,"Only complaint is that I feel only managers are truly taken care of. Love the culture, customer obsessed. They’re the best at what they do & I would still be there if the location I was at didn’t close. Retail is tough, I suggest working in the support department for fair and equal pay."
good,"They did a excellent job as a owner in the point that they have a price point for every customer! They recycle to another store and they are a genius as far as a smart company.  However, I felt that I got in trouble for upselling in my department because they said I should have given a client that felt comfortable with me and pass it off to another person to have them do the sales. So, basically you want me to only reach a certain level and nothing more then that. Dosen't make alot of sense when they're are plenty of customers for e everyone."
good,"Learned a lot about the retail industry, whether that was the data we analyzed on a every day year to year comparison or just gaining knowledge of materials and clothing lines.  It was a very urban, fast pace company.  I would say the hardest part of the job was when I did not make a sale and had to clean up after a customer versus get compensated itself however it taught me what to do and not to do the next time a situation like that occurs again.  Most enjoyable part of the job was what you put into it you got out of it, because we were compensated based off sales."
good,Nordstrom was a great place to work. You learn a lot about customer service and product knowledge. They normally hire from within so promotions occur often
good,while i was attending nordstrom i had a great time working for the company . although i was there short period i took it upon myself to learn as much as possible while i went there. the staff and employees were very family oriented . the pay as well was great . due to an illness one of my family meme bee took upon . i was forced to relocate and resign from my job at nordstrom .
good,"Nordstrom is a great company with a family-centric mindset. The teams at Nordstrom give you the information and authority to help you make the best business decision. The company has multiple opportunities for advancement, and have employee led discussions to help you reach your goals."
good,"Exactly what I expected I think. Tasks included engaging with customers, putting items back on the floor, and keeping the sales floor tidy and make sure everything was sized."
good,"I did enjoy that working from home was an option. Workplace culture was phenomenal, but you must be mentally prepared to speak with difficult customers."
good,Excellent company to work for if you are seeking advancement in the high end fashion retail sector. They have unfortunately moved away from their always employee-centric mentality.
good,"A typical work day consisted of going to the dock (where items are shipped out), picking up a mobile device and start looking for orders available for picking. Orders come from Nordstrom.com and are sent into our store and we must fulfill those orders before the time limit on the order runs out. Otherwise, we should reject the item if it is damaged or not found in the store. Additionally, you perform quality assurance on items to make sure that the item is in top condition and not damaged before it is packaged and shipped out to the customer."
good,The Rack did not use my professional capabilities in marketing or sales so I felt under utilized. Enjoyed management of sales force and working with top management.
good,"I worked here for less than a year. During this time I was paid a fair amount for what I was doing and generating for the company. They were more than willing to award me with milestones and they do give incentives for driving credit and meeting goals- standard for most retail, Nordstrom simply does better than most. "
good,"You meet all types of people from all different walks of life and the discounts are amazing! Benefits, Pay rate is okay based on the location. Room for growth"
good,"Work started off easy, gave a lot of experience for dealing with difficult customers, salesperson training with very useful, eventually work got very monotonous, not many customers so all day you have to walk around constantly find something to do or day will drag on"
good,"As mind-numbing retail slogfest jobs go, Nordstrom is up there as one of the best. You may be contributing to a culture of egregious excess, sickening luxury and unhealthy spending, but at least the company you work for hires trans people and works to provide a space of equality in both their employees and in the image they present to the outside world."
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work. The company provides their employees with lots of opportunities to grow and thrive. I personally learned many things while employed with Nordstrom. I worked in multiple departments and while doing so, I learned a lot about the company. Management teaches their employees new things daily, and they provide great support. The hardest part of the job would be the long hours, and odd work schedules, but Nordstrom has so many wonderful qualities, that it makes up for it. Overall, Nordstrom is an incredible company and I would recommend that others search for employment with them, if they are interested in customer service employment, and looking to grow."
good,"Great way to build customer service communication experience, management skills, and fashion education."
good,"I worked for Nordstrom for 5 years and overall enjoyed my time there. The management is pretty good, fair and friendly to work with and proud to be a part of the organization. The biggest downfall for me was experiencing so many restructures, about 1x/year in Feb/Mar that sometimes got reversed the next year. So every year was a bit stressful wondering what's next and who might lose their job."
good,"I worked seasonal,  it's a great environment, I had a lot of support from my department which made it enjoyable to work there. My supervisor was very flexible with my schedule."
good,The NORDSTROM brothers are Amazing to work for. They are very hands on with the employees. Productive work environment - intense selling w/being customer obsessed. Room for growth consistent evolving. Being mobile is a plus. Multiple careers to chose from.
good,The hardest part of the job was trying to balance multiple customers at once. Management was great and they have a great support team. The most enjoyable part of the day was able to have fun at work and still being able to be professional.
good,"Working at Nordstrom was great for networking. With your coworkers and with clients both, it was a good tool to use to build your circle and meet other people that are potentially in your career field."
good,"After working many retail jobs, there is nothing like Nordstrom. The company treats their employees better than any other retailer, they pay the best and have outstanding customer service."
good,It's a solid place to work. Has its ups and downs but definitely more good than bad. There a lot of benefits that come with working here and the opportunity for growth is possible.
good,"So I worked at Nordstrom beauty for a year, and it was a great experience. Loved the people, the vendors, great exposure in the business aspect. Learnt how to manage a business, execute ideas and run successful events. The only downside is the horrible targets and the managers never support you when you HAVE NO STOCK TO SELL. Impossible goals at times and they pick and choose who to kick out. I loved the friends I made though, just avoid crazy people who want comission and stick to your own counter unless youre friends with someone at another brand."
good,Overall a great place to work.  The people you work with are great but management leaves something to be desired.  Management will single you out and put you on the spot for something as simple as talking to a co-worker while you're working.  There is a lot of favoritism in management with certain employees.
good,"Letting managment know your career goals will allow them to assist in putting things in motion for you. It was a great experience beautiful I assisted in the opening process of a store and a department.  I learned the in's and out's of what it takes to put a store of that size and volume together. I was also trained in other brands, departments to better assist my clients better."
good,I greatly enjoyed my time working on the Web Crew at Nordstrom. We acted as a team and sometimes even a family. It was a fast-paced environment and you have to learn quickly on the job because training can be minimal.
good,Overall this been a good job. My coworkers on my team have been hardworking and so was my previous manager. The problem is we have not been given raises in over a year and there is currently restructuring going on. I do not agree with the changes happening in the company recently. They are piling more work on employees and many managers were recently asked to take a demotion as they eliminated positions. My manager was one of the people who recently lost his job. He worked with the company for over ten years and was the hardest worker i've known. It seems to me this company is more concerned about  short term profits and are wiling to lose good hardworking employees. Constantly short staffed and over worked is how I would describe my work environment. Thanks to my team I have learned a lot and how to become a better worker
good,The best part of this job was working with so many different personalities. Figuring out what each individual employee required of me to help lead them into loving what they were doing in their role. I enjoyed employees turning from being indifferent in their role to actually enjoying their day at work and becoming more company oriented and productive in their everyday performance.
good,"a typical day at work would be coming into work learning about our daily goals and requirements we as a team would have to meet for the day at what we would call our stand up meeting , there we would discuss safety tips and top performers."
good,"Working at Nordstrom was a great experience.  At my location I was unable to advance without relocating so I chose to resign my position.  For the right position, I would go back."
good,Nordstrom is a fast paced and energetic to work for.  Most of my experience was in back of the house where the degree of work was of highest importance and attention to the executives as the front of the house (sales floor).
good,"Really cared about their employees, had an ""inverted triangle"" of priorities which put the bulk of the importance on the people who make up the bulk of the company"
good,Currently hit a slow period and I'm not even getting my 20 hours a week as a part time employee. I'm not sure how long the slow period will last or how long I can wait it out for work to pick up.
good,"Work is okay but becomes a bit boring when there are little to no customers in the store. In order to make our commission, we need to hit a certain amount of sales per hour but it is not attainable when there is no one to sell to. My work and life balance is good under my current manager and getting family vacation time was not difficult."
good,"The health benefits are on point. The hours varied and some departments I worked in would struggle to get a schedule out at least 2 weeks in advance. Some managers are great, others were okay. It is hard to get a direct path to corporate, if that's what you're looking to do. I wasn't cut out for straight sales, but the great thing about Nordstrom, is there are all kinds of different jobs and a different department may work better for you."
good,The job was exciting. On a daily basis it was a different situation. This was largely because of the people that were your team members and the customers who walked through the door.
good,The East Coast Fulfillment Center has only been around for about 3 years. As a result there’s still a lot of kinks to work out. Communication between departments and shifts is abysmal and things are constantly changing. Management often plays favorites and HR is useless when they mess up your pay (and they WILL). There is either mandatory overtime or you’re struggling to make 40hours which makes it hard to budget. Other than that it’s really not a bad place to work. Competitive benefits and pay for the area. The work itself isn’t usually too bad.
good,"Nordstrom is awesome they have great pay , the hours are awesome ,managers were great , and the environment was even better . It was always busy so you always have something to do . Hardest part would have to be the technical difficulties sometimes would get in the way of our daily routines but management made the most of it ."
good,"I recently took on a corporate role at headquarters in Seattle. I had many years of experience supporting teams and helping customers in our stores, and I have had extremely supporting leaders help me into my new environment and who have mentored me to a place where I can hold my own."
good,I enjoy working at Nordstrom and being apart of their Service Experience team. It’s nice to be able to talk to customers and make sure that they are having a good experience. I love that customer service is #1 at Nordstrom and that’s where I have learned many of my customer service skills. We are always getting compliments from customers on how professional we are and how well we treat them and that makes me feel good about my job.
good,"Pros: "
good,"Work schedules at Nordstrom were very consistent, and employees were given the option of what days they wanted off. Management was all really nice and eager to help."
good,"Overall it’s one of the better retail employers out there. There’s a decent amount of opportunity for advancement, although much less on the loss prevention and operations side of the business."
good,My team worked really well together and was supported both at work and away.  A typical day was collaborating to get our project completed on time and within budget.  Management was not very involved and weren't in a position to support initiatives.
good,"The company as a whole is great.  Good values, benefits, people! Some positions or departments are much stronger and more enjoyable than others, as with many companies. I would recommend and work there again."
good,"Always wanted to work for Nordstrom in any capacity. It was fun experience and was appreciated by all the key stakeholders."
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work through college. The job is commission only, so sales associates control their pay checks.  Management is very nice but there is little room for growth and a lot of politics are involved when it comes to how the store is ran."
good,"Good benefits, good employee discount, good culture Easy to transfer locations"
good,"A typical day consists of stocking and organizing your department. I learned a lot about efficiency. Some have different work ethic than others, so cooperation can be difficult at times. Most managers were understanding. For some, things like reaching around stockrooms mught be taxing."
good,If you love pretentious fashion this is great place to work. The discount is great and but management is not. Long hours and skimpy commission. Career growth is a joke
good,Nordstrom literally jump started my career.They saw talent in me and then pushed me to realize that as well. For anyone starting out I would seriously recommend getting into Nordstrom then giving it all you've got. Chances are you will get promoted into management roles that will prep you for experience within Nordstrom and outside as well.
good,"Normal warehouse work, picking, packing, receiving, shipping. Environment is good. Schedule changes very frequently. Great benefits."
good,"this is a great place to work if you are single without kids a lot of overtime require. fast paced, work independently, flexible with schedules. nice café on site."
good,When I worked there the goals were almost double other positions which made is very hard to meet the expectations. The management was the worst I've ever experienced but the boils down to 1 person who pretty much was the cause of 100's of employees leaving in that department. She had been there a while so no matter how many complaints she still is working there.
good,"I've worked both full and part time at Nordstrom. Currently I'm scheduled during weekends because of school. Apart from the holidays and big sales, working as a part of the web team is pretty simple and lax. As long as you do your job management is cool about you taking a few quick breaks here and there to talk to chat with coworkers. Our shifts tend to be a couple hours longer than sales associates and can be kind of grueling on slow days."
good,"Good company, flexible hours. Some people earn commission, to me that was just another perk. My manager was great, she was giving me flexible hours and they also have good benefits."
good,"Has great beneifts, but retail is still very hard on a good work/life balance.hope you have a good store manager. weekends off vs. CTR weekends.. they won't give you off."
good,Worked at Customer Service desk and on the floor with esrpiece and handheld device capable of assisting customers with checkout.  Extremely fast-paced.  Fun employee team.
good,"Management sucked but other than that it was great!! Great people, great location, great environment! The company itself is a really awesome one, where you have the opportunity to move to different departments if you wish."
good,"The biggest hang up I have is having to push the rewards program, but the job itself is pretty easy the compensation fair for the most part, but management holds it back"
good,"Fun place to work when you're into fashion. Marketing yourself and brands inside and outside of scheduled work hours, creating a close relationship with customers and get to experience new trends. Commision based, so it's not a steady paycheck. I worked in the Jewelry department and was in charge of repairs, ordering items, returns, and exchanges, inventory, marketing of the new product, etc. A lot of late night closing and picking up the slack of other employees."
good,"since sales associates work for commission, they are competing everyday to make as much as they can. Depending on one's attitude and behavior, this can excite them or cause distress. Dealing with multiple types of people a day requires patience and more often than not you will end up with someone who is disrespectful. You quickly learn how to deal with troublesome customers and how to remain polite and confident in spite of angry customers. The most enjoyable parts of the job is helping customers who genuinely appreciate your help/ guidance. If they enjoy your service enough they may exclusively shop with you and lead the way to more customers."
good,Would only recommend working here as a sales person. Being in management was not a good experience. They would rather you self promote yourself then let your work speak for itself.
good,"There are a lot of wonderful people there.  Learn everything you can, find your niche and then run with it. A lot of people I know who work there are super happy and intend to stay long-term."
good,"Great work environment, high demand on service and fast pace at times, Teams are very collaborative in resolving issues and create process\procedures ."
good,"Overall Nordstrom Rack is a great company to work for, other things like certain aspect could be changed, like management style, sometimes you feel like you're being smother and cant move because you're being watched at every moment."
good,Under the management when I worked there it was a great environment and fun place to work. The pay is just not enough live on. They allowed us to express our creativity with fashion and build strong customer relationships. Hours were fair amongst your coworkers and management worked just as much. It truly felt like a family.
good,"Retail and sales  can always be difficult, but overall if you provide good customer service and get to know your customers, you can do well. Management was changing while I was there so there was a lot of overlap with different departments and different rules."
good,Worked for the company 5+ yrs. Hours can be inconsistent depending on the season and department but the pay is decent. Strong focus on teamwork and leadership.
good,A typical day of working at Nordstrom Rack would consist almost entirely of customer service ranging from opening new credit  accounts along with purchases to handling returns.
good,"Nordstrom employees are paid a commission of all the sales they make — and it sometimes brings out an ugly competitiveness amongst floor associates. Many employees aggressively court customers in pricey departments of the store in hopes of hooking a customer and their commission before other colleagues. Decent benefits if you work enough hours and have alot of regulars, but very difficult to attain and keep your status."
good,"overall a good job, gets boring doing the same thing everyday. Great job to start with sales but scheduling is rough and you have to work most weekends"
good,The company overall is a good company. Nordstrom needs to pick management off skills and knowledge instead of friendship. The company can use some changes
good,"At the entry level I saw my co-workers who had kids struggle with a work life balance, and advancement. The managers did what they could but a retail schedule is not always conducive to having a family. I was going to college, and have no children so it was the perfect job for my situation."
good,Company is experiencing a fall with in store sales as it loses out to online retail. Goals still reflect a time when customers preferred to shop in store instead of online.
good,"Every day starts with a meeting in the morning going over what is expected for the day. Any events we have going on, promotions that are taking place throughout the store and recognizing departments as well as individuals. I  start by seeing what I have scheduled and planned for the day. I was responsible for managing two ladies under me, making sure they were meeting expectations, while coaching them to be successful. My management approach is to praise what each person thrives at and work on any weaknesses.  All of my managers always has my back and I feel comfortable with going to each one of them, weather it be professional or personal. They all have my best interest and allow me to make my own decisions because they trust me. Most enjoyable part was the comradery and passion for helping people. Hardest part was the inconsistent schedule"
good,Taking in stock from the delivery truck daily and preparing stations for the morning shift. Had the liberty to set my our work process. Hardest part was the manual labor. Enjoyed the environment with co-workers and managers
good,"I worked for Nordstroms during my time and college and it was a great job to have during college. The pay was average and reasonable for the work. The management could have been better at times , especially the way the promoted people seemed to be just based on if the store manager liked you or not. Lack of diversity in management but most of the employees were diverse in ethnicity and age."
good,"Was a productive, fast paced, and agreeable workplace. The opportunity to learn about many different roles, whether that be Security, Admin, HR, Cashier, Salesman, or management was always challenging but also extremely rewarding. Customer servicing was an actual joy due to the genuine smiles you would receive from customers."
good,"you can grow as much as you are willing to put in, great people and salaries are above average for the industry. Lots of employee recognition to promote loyalty and camaraderie."
good,I worked in the restaurant. loved the team. fun learning  environment. I only Left the job do to being passed over Ex Chef Job and Sous Chef job for being a single mom. Was told must be able to travel in order to be promoted to management.
good,"I love working at Nordstrom! The only downside right now is working in a smaller store so i feel like we get half of the Nordstrom experience, we don’t carry all of the brands that people love and we don’t have any of the big events that Nordstrom has. . I love my managers and the coworkers. The fact that we can give our customers a lot of our time is amazing. The Customer service is awesome!"
good,"Great place to work at , the environment is fun and perky, what I love most is the triangle is upside down meaning the people / consumers are before employees and employees are before employers and employers are before CEO. Working there taught me so much to be myself"
good,"A typical day depended on your shift would be morning or night.  More fun/busy on weekends since weekdays can be a little slow.  You would assist customers with needs as well as complete duties/tasks that the department manager needed help with."
good,"It is a nice place to work, decent pay and nice people.  I would rather work in the TV or Film business to use my skills as a video editor, or sound designer.  That is my passion."
good,"The job is good, the pay could be better and the goals they have should be more attainable especially after big sale events. I learned/still learning about product knowledge. My immediate managers could be better and the communication through out the store is lacking. The most enjoyable part is interacting with the customers."
good,"in selling departments long hours of standing is the worst part but if you're busy selling during those time you're basically writing your own paycheck based off of the amount that you sold that day. "
good,"The people really care, and it’s a great place to work! There are lots of opportunities to move up and work your way to the top, plus lots of benefits!"
good,"Working at Nordstrom can be stressful depending on how well your values match or misalign with the competitive job culture. Still, it is a great experience to become exposed to many fashion trends and styling skills as well as becoming well equipped to succeed in the clothing industry. Clients are awesome too."
good,"This job helps you build basic skills and gain experience. The management is not always all that good, sometimes there is favoritism. There is always opportunity to grow with the company which is great."
good,"pros: good work culture, promote from within, lots of avenues to go down"
good,"lots of vendors, stressful sales enviroment, fast pace, lots of learning and product knowledge. but Nordstrom is a good company to work for. you learn so much and can take that experience any where."
good,I write my own schedule and I build my relationships with customers.  I can help my clients purchase through out the store. As a Manager you are not Micro Managed.
good,"The company was pretty good to work for. I just wish there was better communication between Human Resources, Management and employees. Communication is Key."
good,"Perhaps it was because the store I worked at was next to a college campus. Perhaps it was because the location was in a peaceful neighborhood. Regardless of what it was, the culture embedded at Nordstrom Stonestown (San Francisco) is one that encourages its employees to strive and succeed. I've met many close friends whom I stay in touch with to this day. We were competitive yet friendly. It was a great job to have while attending college, not to mention the discounts."
good,If you're competitive you can make a lot of money here. The commission is great in most departments. Pretty much all the departments are commission only but if you don't make your cap you get the hourly.
good,"I was well trained from the beginning and guided. They recognized my talent and areas of interest and helped me build upon those aptitudes. Gave me opportunities for advancement within the company, i.e.; promoting my to personal stylist."
good,"I worked two different areas of Nordsrtom. First was the coffee shop (E Bar) for two years and then I did a few months (about 5) of retail sales. "
good,"Restaurant division is never given any marketing support, can make for a difficult sales environment. Recently went through upper management restructuring, new Regional Manager had 21 restaurants to oversee from Santa Barbara to San Diego and Hawaii."
good,"Working at Nordstrom was a wonderful opportunity. I worked as a Beauty Artist, so my position opened up many doors for me. I learned about many different product lines. The workplace culture is quite fun. You work with likeminded individuals who are passionate about their work."
good,"Nordstrom is competitive and cutthroat. It is best for people who are self drivers. If you are afraid of talking to strangers or are not good at standing up for yourself, you won't survive."
good,"Good place to work, would recommend. Very nice people to work with, they had great attitudes and helped push you to success. The management was very informative."
good,"Atypical day at work is fast paced, but manageable. Management is flexible, the culture is challenging at times. The hardest part of the job is receiving more training in logistics.Most enjoyable part is the teamwork aspect of the job."
good,Nordstrom taught me many thing about time management and how to approach people from many different cultures. I learned what it really meant to work as team and to take on a role as the leader.
good,"Friendly environment, steady paced, safe environment to work in. Flexible with work schedules, fun place to work at, potlucks, birthdays, baby showers etc."
good,Looks great on a resume. Great management skills attained. Stressful working environment if sales are not produced. Poor schedule. Hours not promised.
good,"Some stress but a fun place to work if you are looking to grow and learn. Focus on ""driving your own business"" really gave me an opportunity to learn about metrics that I may have usually ignored."
good,Its definitely a good starting point for sales representatives. everyone was nice and the company seemed to look after their employees. Not a bad seasonal job.
good,"If you like commission based sales then this job is for you. You meet some amazing customers, and the discount is alright. There are opportunities to move up with the company, but sometimes it is a popularity contest."
good,"Nordstrom was a great company to work for. Friendly, family oriented environment. Good benefits,and commission was fair. Excellent customer service!!!"
good,"A typical day at work, is very fast pace. Always moving and on your feet... greeting customers, assisting customers, keeping the floor clean and safe. I've learned to communicate with the team and customers and to multitask! The most enjoyable part is working with fun and encouraging coworkers!"
good,"Nordstrom provides you the tools and support to advance through their unique culture. "
good,"Provide customer service by greeting and assisting customers, and responding to"
good,Management and staff was easy to work with. I learned new and different ways to package items. Equipment was easy to work with and not to fare from workspace.
good,the store could get extremely busy at times specially during the weekends but for the most part the company would take care of its employees. pay was fair with advancement every 1000 hours.
good,"Well, it's retail, so don't misunderstand and think that it is going to be a picnic. That said, nordstrom's is a great company to work for. Management was always respectful and flexible, pay was fair, community was strong."
good,Always an opportunity to learn something new about the retail industry.  Management encouraged good camaraderie among co-workers.  Management gave the sense of being a part of a growing company and always promoted diversity.
good,"I enjoy my work very much and the diversity of cultures helps me to learn diferent forms and methods, and regarding  handling of personnel also learning"
good,"As one of the administrators, a typical day started with logging in on the computer the time I arrived at work, followed by making rounds to the different departments to post signs on alteration due date for orders that would be placed on that day. Once back in my station, I would multi-task between answering phones; processing alteration tickets; coordinating with sales representatives, seamstresses and tailors for customer fitting; matching garment parts to get ready for pickup; and occasional ironing, steam-pressing and/or spot- cleaning of stock items (garments, curtains, etc.). There were two 10-minute breaks, and one 30-minute lunch or dinner daily, depending on my assigned shift. After my duty for that day, I would sign out on the computer. Hardest part of the job was multi-tasking in a very fast-paced environment wherein I couldn't catch up properly between tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I took my breaks and ordered my discounted meals from the restaurant and coffee shop."
good,"Nordstrom was a good company to work for because they had really good benefits and paid students well. Typical day consisted of helping customers, cleaning the floor and making sure all the go backs are put away."
good,"You learn how to use a mobile device to execute sales goals and assist customers with locating merchandise as well as online shipping and pricing information."
good,it was great until a manager came along out of nowhere and started throwing his weight around. it went slowly downhill from there and it only got worse until i left
good,Nordstrom gives employees countless opportunities for advancement. The company offers a lot of benefits for employees. It has a great open door policy and treats its workers well.

good,Nordstrom gives employees countless opportunities for advancement. The company offers a lot of benefits for employees. It has a great open door policy and treats its workers well.
good,"Overall great company been there 4 years and still going."
good,I enjoyed my time with Nordstrom.  I was able to work my way up to become counter manager. Hardest part was being on feet all day but worth it. Loved to be part of the cosmetics team.
good,I liked working for Nordstrom. The coworkers are the best part. Everyone is young-spirited and hip. You must dress to impress in order to stand out amongst your very well-dressed coworkers.  Sell! Sell! Sell!
good,"Nordstrom Rack is a great career in retail if that's the sort of thing you're into. You go to work get an okay discount hours are choppy depending on store sales. Great managers, great team! Easy company to move up in."
good,"It is a good start for anybody to learn sales, the management is decent and the company tries to value its employees as much as its customers. You build connections with the workers as well as customers."
good,"Day to day Nordstrom's is a great place to work and grow as on individual."
good,Working at Nordstrom was a great way to learn a lot about myself. it made me realize I have a passion for what I do and I want to always do my best. Very challenging at times but worth it.
good,I liked the job only thing i have medical issues and they did not want to work with me even though i had good numbers as an employee.  I was told with
good,"Nordstrom was a stepping stone for me. At the time of my employment, I had sworn off from school and really had no idea in which direction my career path would head. I began to become enveloped in the life of Nordstrom so much that for a while I saw myself continuing a long career there."
good,Pay was 13 dollars per hour for a seasonal summer fulfillment center processor at the warehouse in the Inventory Integrity department. I was able to listen to music while working once I became trained in the position which greatly improved my ability to work. The warehouse is a bit noisy and I would most likely have decreased hearing after working here an extended amount of time. The management is helpful and good at training for the tasks needed. 15 minute lunch breaks with department. Some food options such as packaged snacks and refrigerated food machines payable with cash or card. Walkie Talkies allow for communication with the rest of the team while working in different parts of the warehouse. On average I walked about 6 miles per day. Dress code is fairly lenient. All this was during the height of activity during a Summer Sale.
good,"Specific to Towson: Cafe typical opens at 10am and closes by 9pm."
good,"As a line cook you are responsible for setting up your station and starting to work instantly, it is a fast pace due to the amount of volume that it does daily. I learned to become efficient with what I do. Great environment if you enjoy working as part of a large team."
good,"It is not a great job, but they are honest about it upfront.  Pretty much what you expect.  The staff is very nice but this work is not for everybody."
good,At Nordstrom a learned quite a bit in the field of maintence and I appreciate everyone there that ever showed me anything. If I had he Choice I would have loved to start my career in the feild of maintenance at Nordstrom.
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work with an excellent work culture, if you are trying to develop your skills. If you are looking for career advancement this is a great place for you."
good,"Taking inbound calls in a fast-paced environment . Responsible for billing questions, research previous purchases and payments, approving or denying credit approvals. Researching and solving customers' issues to their satisfaction."
good,"I loved working for Nordstrom, but retail can be very demanding and I needed a set schedule. When I retire, I would go back to Nordstrom PT. I loved the atmosphere, the energy, the people, the clothes. Lovely 401K! Some Mangers let the title go to there heads, while others build strong teams!"
good,"A great place to work but hard to get on as regular employee. The pay is good, the training is good, and the people are very friendly."
good,good work place fast pace. a good place to grow and to advance in your current role or in another role. they offer good benefits and a decent salary comparable to most jobs.
good,"If you're interested in growing your career in retail, Nordstrom is a great place to advance. I preferred working at Nordstrom Rack due to not being paid on commission. I really enjoyed being in management at the Rack."
good,"It was nice while it lasted. great people in all departments, I would've liked to move into the human resources department. I was also interested in the loss prevention department."
good,"What impressed me most about working at Nordstroms was the way they treated employees.  If you were willing to put in the time and effort you got rewarded.  For my work in the department and meeting and exceeding my sales goals I was awarded: "
good,"I was only working here seasonal so I don't have much input. The work itself was fine. It was just difficult for me personally since I had a lot of other things going on. Had I not, I wouldn't have minded staying."
good,"The scheduling depends on the department manager, there are little to no part time position available. The commission is cool, until everything you sold starts coming back."
good,"As long as you're a hard worker, you'll enjoy working at this facility.  They pay is fair and the environment is very friendly.  They also have an incentive program for those who work above expectations."
good,"Nordstrom is a competitive company with its commission based selling opportunities.  The pro of this is, that with their strictly promote from within philosophy, there are many opportunities for those that excel in sales, especially with the willingness to relocate to another store."
good,It is a good place to work seasonally and has good opportunities for advancement. It can be slow and it requires a lot of self motivation. Your success depends a lot on the department that you end up working in.
good,During my time at Nordstrom I further learned not only more about customer service but myself as a person. Since I am a busy college student and I only had a temporary position at the company I still managed to attain new skills. Now my time management has improved along with my ability to work under pressure.
good,good place to work. The employees and management are friendly and fun to work with. Management is nice and understanding. Wish they could pay a little more.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Nordstrom however, the culture was clickish. I experineced 3 managers in department my 2 years there and 2 for the entire store. I would have loved to experience a friendly leadership overall where it was not bias or contingent upon who you knew. Great leaders lead. If I were given the opportunity to work there again it would be in a different capacity to demonstrate what true teamwork and leadership entails."
good,"A great position for a summer of learning experience. If you are the new sales associate, you need to be ready to work a lot of the less desired and longer shifts."
good,"I didn't experience Nordstrom from a sales perspective as I worked in the Cafe.  We still had our own sales goals and numbers to achieve, but not to the degree that was required on the sales floor.  Very fast paced environment.  Really enjoy interacting with the customers and encouraging team building with the staff."
good,"Nordstrom Rack is a fast paced environment, sometimes there will be downtime but you must always look or be busy. I got into the FNL program which teaches you about management and will help you move faster through the company. Also helps if you get All Star or things like that, it'll stay on your Nordstrom resume, in fact when you apply for management they'll ask you if you were in FNL."
good,"Nordstrom has an outstanding corporate culture and is at the front line of fashion, technology and customer service. However, specific locations such as the one I worked at are not representative of said culture for various reasons."

good,"Nordstrom has an outstanding corporate culture and is at the front line of fashion, technology and customer service. However, specific locations such as the one I worked at are not representative of said culture for various reasons."
good,"It was the best job I have had so far, and I would definitely recommend it if you're trying get into retail and planning on staying in retail. The management can be good at some points and even worse at others. The competition for good commissions can be cutthroat at sometimes. Great play to learn a good skill, make good money, and learn a lot about a major company."
good,Loved working at Nordstrom but the position expectation was almost that of store assistant manager without the pay!  Good benefits but not enough PTO as there are not also sick days.  Difficult in an hourly position
good,"was a temp position but greatly enjoyed work life with Nordtrom Id definitely work for them again, Seattle downtown is just simply beautiful alongside the working life Nordstrom provided"
good,Fast place environment with lots of growth opportunities. The Nordstrom culture is a results driven atmosphere that focuses on providing the best costumer experience possible so customers want to come back.
good,Provided great sales and learning opportunities with a fun and friendly atmosphere. I was able to grow into my position due to great leadership and motivating commission opportunities.
good,Working for Nordstrom was a great experience. There was a lot of training and guidance. Loved the cosmetic environment along wth the management . Go check them out.
good,"I can't imagine working at any other retailer after Nordstrom. I love the emphasis on customer service and environment. The customers are typically wonderful to work with. The pay can be very good. However, the competitive commission-based work environment is not ideal for everyone. One must also be diligent in combatting fraud and theft."
good,"This is a good pace to work.  I was not on the sales floor and did not sell stuff, so I don't know that side of the business.  Good benefits and work culture."
good,"Hours as a manager were long. Lots of expectations with shockingly little development and no consistent feedback. Corporate buying structure is archaic and slow, leading to frustrating customer experiences."
good,"Nordstrom is a place where you can judge your performance on a daily basis, whether thats sales goals being met or not, there is constant work and pressure to succeed, if you are a competitive person that can thrive in sales then it is a great place to work. You must learn a lot fast especially about the products, you are considered an expert."
good,"great company and management team, beautiful shops wonderful customer service, nice items for all the people. nice location. suit all kinds of cultures"
good,As a lead the work doesn't stop between the problems with orders to the employee issues. I can say that I did enjoy all the busy work.All in all it is a great place to work at. I can honestly say that Nordstrom cares about their employees. I would recommend working at the Distribution Center.
good,"You can do really well in sales in you're motivated, and can adjust to the competitive work environment. I enjoyed working closely with customers more than the culture of fashion."
good,"Selling, communication, steady mindset. Have to have an ability to balance work-life to your personal life. Don’t have a jealous attitude. Always remain clean and at work."
good,This cafe was a hybrid between cafeteria and table service so servers had lots to do to keep up with the crowds. Being Nordstrom we had to offer the best in service and attitude. Anyone offering anything less wouldn't last long in this enviornment.
good,Barista duties included: making handcrafted espresso drinks while understanding coffee and where it has originated from. Being able to uphold a joyful environment while keeping up with food safety. As well as working well with other.
good,We work 8 hours a day normally unless it is during the busy season. Then we would work 10 to 12 hour days. We clock in and proceed to work in our department. Sometimes we are transferred out to other departments when they are in need of extra help. When I was a trainer it was very stressful because of favoritism. Was not fully trained on all procedures. I did enjoy being able to helping others.
good,"Nordstrom is a good place to work. The managers here are very accommodating of schedule restrictions and time off requests. In the Ebar, the climate is very relaxed and everyone is friendly. Pay is competitive, there is a very generous discount for employees, and the benefits are good if you qualify for them. There are opportunities for advancement, but they are somewhat rare and very often require relocation."
good,"Pay was ok, but in the specific location I was working for I had to pay a lot of money for parking. Paying for parking ultimately bumped my wage down lower, plus it was a long drive."
good,I enjoyed working at Nordstrom's they were pretty fair in most cases. The manager of the department was a do as I say person and not as I do. Very unfair in decision making.
good,"Overall, Nordstrom was a good company to work for. They offered a lot of benefits, continued to advance with technology, and adapted well to the drastic switch to online shopping. The employees were all friendly and made going to work fun. My only complaint was not being able to advance with the company in a timely manner."
good,"really competitive, not for everyone.  co-workers are very aggressive. the clients are great. discounts could be better..............................."
good,"Good money to be made as a salesperson and manager.  Was promoted really quickly from a salesperson in the shoe department to assistant manager.  Then from Assistant manager to a department manager. Enjoyed helping customers and selling.  Sales floor was very competitive.  Successful salespeople were customer service oriented, driven and competitive.  Nice ones didn't last too long.  Liked that they have numerous locations and that employees can move stores or transfer to a different department.  They also allow employees to transfer to their discount stores, the Nordstrom Rack.  Employee discount was a nice bonus, and I liked that wearing clothes from Nordstrom was not mandatory.  "
good,"Nordstrom overall is a great family owned company to work for. I was employed at their Flagship store for over 5 years. During that time I had many opportunities to grow, learn and excel alongside my peers. Day to day culture is positive but very competitive which promotes healthy competition to become better as a company."
good,"To be successful at Nordstrom, you have to be assertive and convincing. When you are placed as a sales associate at a department, it is necessary for you to know everything about it. People are independent and should be able to run their department on their own. If you are new, people will try to take advantage of that and steal your sales."
good,Great atmosphere. Managers want you to succeed. They will try their best to help you to reach your goals. Holidays can be stressful.  Be ready to work hard.
good,"Nordstrom is a good place to get an idea of a retail establishment."
good,"Nordstrom Rack has excellent pay based on your experience and great benefits. They offer full-time positions, healthcare benefits, 401k plans, paid time off, and a discount. However, advancing is rather difficult because favoritism plays a role more so than experience when it comes to the management choosing new managers to promote."
good,"Good place to work, very stressful if you are not willing to work hard. commission based job. very competitive. Friendly co-workers. Managers are understanding."
good,great environment although has recently changed in Technology from all the new recruits from other companies who don't share the same culture.  promotion from within has definitely declined!
good,"Nordstrom in general is a great place to work. Working on commission can be tough, but the benefits are great. Additionally, support from management aids in helping all new and existing employees."
good,"Great treatment, company was fair on break times and additional overtime hours if available. Company has weekly treats for employees for lunch on snacks."
good,"Delivering exceptional customer in every interaction with the customers, co-workers and vendors of Nordstom. Friendly, kind staff and using good judgement in all situations"
good,It depends on the day some days are very busy and some days are not but that is retail. Straight Commission is great when you are busy but it is hard to maintain a steady income when  you have a lot of returns.
good,"Productive place to work, able to move and try out different positions within the store. One can move around to different departments. Everyone was welcoming."
good,Great place to work. High expectations but great atmoshere. Team really helps each others out. Company does a lot for their employees. A lot of career advancement opportunities.
good,"My department manager was more cut-throat than others. I worked in multiple sections and different areas had a more relaxed feel. If you get a good department manager the workplace can be an amazing environment. "
good,"Nordstrom gives ample opportunity for advancement if you are a productive worker and show some enthusiasm for the company. If full-time hours are given, a lot of benefits (like medical) can be given to you, but if not, there are several benefits available anyways.   The negatives of the company are that since they promote from within, the majority of managers are not experienced in management in the sense of properly communicating with employees etc. Because of this, some managers can display disrespect and it is challenging to address."
good,Decent place to work if you are looking for a laid back part time job. Every story kind of does their own thing. You can tell the stores that they favor over the others with product.
good,Productive and safe workplace where everyone gets the same treatment wether your a regular associate or warehouse supervisor. You always work 40+ hours a week.
good,"I love the culture at Nordstrom.  It's full of friendly and fun people who are looking out for your best interest and are always willing to work as a team.  "
good,The best part of this job is that Nordstrom allows you to go above and beyond in the name of customer service. Making sales is so much easier and more fun when a company wants you to be yourself and have fun!
good,The retail industry is shifting and it is felt within the brick and mortar stores. Economic pressures affect the job in ways that are out of your control. Management is tenacious in trying to combat these pressures.
good,"To start with, the most amazing part of this company is it does not let you feel like you are a employee. "
good,My experience on the job was quite an eye opener because of the different characters and colours you see while working sales. The experience opened my eyes to more than just a job it's the way the industry works and the people you interact around you.
good,You have a sales goal each you come into work. It can be very stressful and competitive. The customer service you give is top  of the line.  I enjoy the job.
good,"Working in the restaurant is tough. Very demanding and high standards. But that is why the quality is so high."
good,I would answer calls from customers and tracked packages or helped them with their online order. Upsold product when possible. Also took advantage of working in the warehouse as well.
good,"An average day at Nordstrom includes helping out customers with whatever they need and maintaining an attractive sales floor and cash wrap. I learned a lot about accountability by following up with each and every customer I helped and being expected by management to build a relationship with that customer. Speaking of management, the manager of my department focused heavily on boosting her team. She would push us daily to not only reach our sales goal, but exceed it. Undoubtedly, the most challenging part of that job was reaching a high sales goal on such a slow business day. In a commission based environment, it's difficult to essentially make any money when customers don't show up. On the same vein, helping customers is easily the most enjoyable part of the job. In the past year of employment at Nordstrom, I've made several friends with customers; mainly mothers shopping for their children. When it comes to shopping for their children, these same mothers choose to exclusively shop with me because of the great service I provide and my friendly demeanor."
good,I had a great time at Nordstrom's but eventually got paired with the spawn of Kraken so things didn't work out in my favor. Other than that the OTHER managers seem great and the culture is a joy to be around. I may return to the Mission Viejo Store one day.
good,Nordstrom has a great work culture where management really cares about their employees and helping their employees grow within the company. There is a lot of opportunity within the company.
good,"Nordstrom was a great place to learn how to master sales skills. I started in the Individualist department selling designer wear in a location without much foot traffic. I made top five sales of the day my first week and continued to make the top ten throughout my time there. I enjoyed building relationships with customers-it was a great experience. However, I was never trained for the register and had to learn on my own and didn't receive any much assistance even when bringing the issue to my boss and store manager."
good,"I love working here but unfortunately there isn't enough hours to stay. Treated very poorly by the retail workers inside Nordstrom, and career advancement is hard to come by."
good,"Working in Loss Prevention in San Francisco, you never quite know how the day will end. What is important is that everything is conducted in a safe manner so that everyone can go back to their homes safely"
good,Nordstrom is a very good company to grow with if you want to make it your career but if its only something to pay the bills and school tuition then its for you. They have a very good policy called an Open-door policy where if you have any ideas questions and concerns you can go and speak with someone anytime no matter what. Workplace is very diverse. The hardest part is when hours are being cut after a big sale is over. Its like an up and down rollercoaster with the sales. The most enjoyable part is having employee week where you're discount goes up to 40%. Benefits are good.
good,"Nordstrom has a great culture with people who are willing to work with you. "
good,Was a good place to work as far as the people that you worked with and that supervisors were great. But on the down side I did not feel like there was a good balance for work and family.
good,"A typical work day consisted of opening the store, counting cash drawers, taking orders from customers, running food orders, cleaning the restaurant, bussing tables, closing the store."
good,You work in a large warehouse that is loud and constantly moving. There are a lot of safety guidelines and very strict rules concerning your safety. It is a somewhat  stressful place to work and you work with a team of about 50 people.
good,The company has grown rapidly and the culture is beginning to change vastly from when I began working here over 17 years ago. For the longest time the people kept me here because everyone is so pleasant to work with and supportive of your goals. It's still a wonderful place to work!
good,I had a lot of fun at my time here and honestly it's the team that usually does it for me. I feel like upper management could be less hands on and guide their team a little more from a distance instead of micromanaging. That was my only pet peeve.
good,"pushes with opening credit cards, not enough people in customer service and sales workers need to help them while they have a lot of work to do on the floor. Some managers are too annoying, not loyal. Not covered parking space."
good,I worked in their stock team and came in during evening times. It was a very laid back and relaxed environment. There was some heavy lifting and organizing but I was paid fairly.
good,"A fun place to work, fun employees and customers. Flexible hours and very understanding that LIFE happens! I had to leave because it was only a seasonal job, and was upset because I wasn't kept but I'm trying to get back in."
good,"Systems and procedures have a tendency to change on a consistent basis. New programs to learn, new concepts. A great place to challenge your problem solving skills!"
good,"giving your best customer service along with building relationship with customer really determining s your pay here, being an expert, assisting customer with items and giving fashion tips"
good,I love Nordstrom as a company but the management I experienced had very poor communication between the managers and employees. The company praises their want to move people up in the company but in my department (note I have only been there 10 months) there was a lot of letting go and hiring new.
good,"Use of modern technology made it easy to be efficient, generous employee discount, overall this was a really positive and upbeat environment to work in."
good,"The company felt like that you had to walk on egg shells, because there was always someone that wanted to catch you doing something wrong when in reality you were doing your job. Seemed very high school type of environment."
good,"My co-worker were amazing. But, working for a retailer such as Nordstrom, you have to understand a few things. One, you're going to run into the snooty valley girl almost everyday. They love Nordstrom. Dont get me wrong its a nice place to work and many of the customers a leisure shoppers so they have the best dispositions while shop but, take the good with the bad. "
good,The company has  a great product and instills a good work ethic in all its employees! I was pleased to be in sales and management and was impressed with the  caliber of overall training that i received!
good,Great place to work. Advancement is always looked for internally the con is you have to be mobile to expect higher advancenent which for some may leave them stagnant.
good,"If you are a hard-working individual who enjoys the everyday hustle of the ever-evolving retail environment; this is the job for you. This company rewards hard-work when its done efficiently with the interest of the customer, because it's their #1 priority. Depending on location, there are many opportunities to grow with the company down various paths."
good,Nordstrom employs amazing people that you will learn a lot from. Enjoy the discount as well! It might be hard to balance life/work but you must learn how to do it!
good,"This is a great fulfillment center to work for, the only criticism I would have is when implementing new equipment design, they are very unorganized and untested in their theories which creates alot of problems on the floor."

good,"This is a great fulfillment center to work for, the only criticism I would have is when implementing new equipment design, they are very unorganized and untested in their theories which creates alot of problems on the floor."
good,"Fun if you are a student and good pay relative to other states. The Boulder community is very enjoyable as well as the staff members."
good,"I like the benefits, management could use some work, HR can use some work. Hours fluctuate... so don't depend on a steady income. They tell you you will make more than what you actually do, so that is somewhat annoying. But overall its a good company and way better than the others."
good,"Retail is challenging but if its the field you choose, Nordstrom is your best choice. Working long hours on your feet while trying to meet demanding clients needs proved to be very stressful.  If competition is your thing, this is a great place to show your stuff."
good,Nordstrom allows you to own the costumer experience and make leadership decisions on their behalf.  Great collaboration with other creative people.  Super inspiring.
good,"Great training and benefits wonderful products lots of freedom very honest and easy to work with management!"
good,"Days were long and nights were longer in the Windy City.  Working for Nordstrom was an eye-opener.  The constant fast-paced, commission driven sales, customer involvement was really exciting.  Culture was spectacular.  Everybody was willing to aid and assist each other if problems or questions about products arose.  The hardest part was building of clientele in a huge and brand new city, which lead to my termination during the recession of 2010."
good,"If you want to get into the Service Industry for long term, there are huge advancement opportunities. Even if you start off in one area, there are also great opportunities for mobility into different professional disciplines. However, can be unnecessarily stressful at times and that stress trickles down the ladder from higher ups to employees on the ground floor."
good,Manager's run their business and team. You based your schedule off of business needs but were able to fit some personal life in between. It is easy to relocate but they don't compensate you.
good,"Nordstrom is chill place to work. The managers are pretty laid back but is still focused on bettering the business and company. You will learn how to work in a commission based environment if you haven't already. It is easy to grow with the company if you do what you need to, to succeed."
good,"The customer experience is critical for on-going business.  Building relationships thru service is key. "
good,"Nordstrom is great if you have the desire to move up within a store. Daily task include greeting, influencing sales, and following up with customers. Building your own clientele for future business is strongly encouraged and may be the only way to make money in the age of struggling department stores. Sales associates tend to be more successful at flagship stores and the company has done little to nothing to help support and supplement their employees wages at other locations; online ordering and personal styling are pushed instead. In comparison to other retailers the job is great, but being compared to poor competition doesn't make you a stand-out company. In comparison to other luxury retailers and offering a one of a kind experience it is solely because of the employees, who deserve more credit than they receive."
good,"As my first job as a fifteen year old, I was excited to work for myself and to help out my family. It took about 4 years when I was offered a shift management job, I stayed for 10 years."
good,"Overall a positive experience. Its a lot of hard work that can pay off. But, you must be patient and not in a hurry."
good,"clocked in "
good,Its a pretty fun environment to work in but you will only be making minimum wage unless you work hard every sing day for your sales.But a plus side is that 90% of your customers are very friendly.
good,work place is decent when you're not dealing with rude customers. Nordstrom is a good starter job It works until a better position is available. standing on your feet all day  is the worst part.
good,Amazing company to work for!! So many opportunities for growth within the company. Amazing benefits. Fun culture to be apart of. Love there core values.
good,Positive work place with supportive team. Collaboration with merchant teams and exposure to different areas of the company. My manager was very eager to teach and help me understand the business.
good,I enjoyed assisting some of our wonderful customers at Point Of Sale. I received a number of customer service letters expressing how my service was exceptional.
good,"Cool place to work if your into fashion and style. Good location, good company, must be upbeat and friendly to succeed. Overall a good atmosphere, with cool co-workers."
good,"I have built great relationships with the people I have worked with, this is the most enjoyable part of my job. The work life balance is also nice as most people work to live and not live to work."
good,"A typical day in store was very competitive because you have to fight with coworkers to make your sale goals, short lunches, the managers at my store had favorites that got away with anything."
good,Never a dull moment; daily teachable moments; company genuinely cares about employees; ever-changing; frequent new implementations; a strong retail contender
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work. They are very flexible when working around a school schedule. The hardest part about the job is dealing with customers. A lot of them come in upset about something and as an employee it is your job to fix it and make it right.
good,I loved the culture and demanding pace of work at Nordstrom. A great team of individuals that had a goal and pushed themselves to achieve it. Great business practices and a strong culture of family with accountability for peoples actions.
good,"A day at Nordstrom will be filled with making new friends, learning everything retail, customer service, and years of leadership."
good,Great place to work.  Commission driven pay.  Greet and sell clients building client base for future events.  Went through a lot of managers while employed.  Making goals for events.  Loved greeting new clients and building loyal customer base.
good,Nordstrom is a fun company to work for. Everyday is something new. I love their culture and the customer is always right outlook. I enjoyed helping customers.
good,I had the best co-workers. Nordstrom is a great company to work for. It will take you places. I had really great experiences that I will never forget.
good,I held a seasonal position at Nordstrom Rack. It was a good experience learning how to communicate and work with different people. I learned how to be efficient and work with a team.
good,"If your good at sales you will do well in this position. "
good,"I had the pleasure of building relationships within the luxury department store environment."
good,"I enjoyed working at Nordstrom. The store manager was awesome, full of energy and very supportive. Retail anywhere is pretty much the same  it all in what you make it"
good,I enjoyed  the culture and work environment at the Burlington Nordstrom.  I found the commission based salary to be a major incentive to work hard. A typical work day was 8 hours long which consisted of greeting and assisting customers in addition to answering the phones and arranging the sales floor.
good,"In general, the company treats you as an entrepreneur. You are given the chance to run your own business within their building. A fair sales environment with opportunity for all."
good,"As a Customer Service Representative and HR Associate, my typical work day consisted of customer check out and new hire management as well as assisting the Store Manager. "
good,"Nordstrom is a fantastic company to work for. They offer great hours, benefits, stock options and a great 401k option as well. Nordstrom does well to treat their employees fairly and with dignity."
good,"Nordstrom is a fantastic company to work for. They offer great hours, benefits, stock options and a great 401k option as well. Nordstrom does well to treat their employees fairly and with dignity."
good,"Selling to customers enhances people skills."
good,"Schedules are very flexible and give you the hours you need, a ton of benefits, decent working environment. The customers are some of the rudest customers I have ever experienced and most of the department management is not qualified, don't care, or slack off. Besides that, you can tell that the company as a whole cares about you and their customer's wellbeing"
good,"Nordstrom was an excellent first experience to a sales and sales management career. The company is positive, customer focused and provided a valuable training program."
good,Good company but not flexible with hours. There is a lot of potential to grow if you are willing to relocate. Weekends and holidays are required to work
good,"I worked for Nordstrom on 2 separate occasions, and feel like as far as retail goes, it is a great company to work for.  They really do care about their employees as much as their customers.  The down side for me was the commission pay and pressure to open credit cards.  I would rather focus on customer service and team-selling than trying to fight for sales and worrying about being written up for not opening credit cards."
good,Work pace can vary depending on the season. I learned the value of how a costumer shops and what style fits them best especially when working in a sometimes fast pace environment. The employees are great depending on you end up working with. Growth in the company is slow but possible.
good,"A typical day at the job is me going in through the employee entrance. As i walk through there is a mountain of stairs to walk before i get to the SPA room. I learned daily that there all sorts of people who have their each own needs. At Nordstroms it's our responsibility to help them to the BEST of our abilities and knowledge that we gained with training. The worst part about is all is high demand and ""reputation"" to hold as an employee. The best part as well is being there at any time to help the customer. Making there day enjoyable is really the true purpose."
good,"I love helping people whether it be in retail or with their payroll. But retail companies in general can be taxing on the body and family life.  Constantly on your feet, weekend hours, a lot of time away from family and medical benefits are weak."
good,Retail is retail but who you work with is important and I have to say my coworkers made my slow days go by fast. The management wasn't amazing but it wasn't horrible.
good,"Great place to work, excellent benefits, opportunities for advancement, usually calm work environment, busy atmosphere, nice managers and co workers that challenge you on a personal and professional level"
good,I definitely don't appreciate the commission structure. It is still a nice environment. The stores are beautiful. And the customers are amazing.
good,A typical day at work was getting there 15 minutes before schedule. To be able to do anything that wasn't finished the night before. Also putting away stock that doesn't need to go out. I learned a lot about eye wear and eye care that i wasn't aware of before. Management is pretty good no problems really in that area. Most enjoyable part of working for this company was selling designer sunglasses to customers who love to look good.
good,Fundamentally strong company with great working environment and a lot of scope to learn about the fashion industry. Excellent support by the management and very friendly approach towards the team.
good,"Great place to work if you are passionate about sales or looking for an entry-level position into the sales world. Work life balance can be tricky working weekends and some holidays. Miss having weekends off, but the hours can be flexible depending on management."
good,"Good place, good coworkers."
good,"Nordstrom sets a great foundation for building your sales skills and interacting with clients. Their benefits are great, but if you are ambitious and looking to dominate in the Sales world, I would start here, learn what you can, and move on."
good,Just depends on what department you end up in really sets the tone for your job and how fast you will move up. There is a lot of politics  so unless you really put yourself out there you get left behind. The corporate positions are over saturated and MIT always has precedence  which leaves a lot of us who already work in corporate and have the experience in the shadows of under qualified candidates .Upper management is great and understanding. a lot of flexibility in your work hours.
good,"Come in, say hi to others and proceed to attack the shipment. I learned the department numbers and floors. Management was never there to overlook anything. Workplace culture was very diverse which is not a problem. Coming in and listening to all of the racism and hypocrisy is the hardest. Most enjoyable was honestly the end of my shift so the bad habits could end."
good,"Retail can be a very hard job because you work all types of hours. However, Nordstrom focused on their customers which was a great thing about working there."
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom i would open the store, clean out all of the stylists dressing rooms, prepare their rooms for their first clients of the day by grabbing clothes and shoes from around the store that the clients had suggested to try during their appointments and fill the room with multiple potential outfits that ranged in their budget. After appointments i would repeat the process for the next appointment coming in. "
good,This was a great opportunity at the moment but I always know there would be an end date because i had larger ambitions to own my own company and help others get an opportunity they may not of had elsewhere and to grow my business to the same level of success.
good,I really like working for this company and have to over 6 years. They have their faults and ups and downs but I would recommend to anyone that is looking for a good company.
good,Working at Nordstrom was a great experience. Their approach to customer service empowers the employees to create a great experience for their customers.
good,"i work overnight doing housekeeping duties.vacuuming ,high dusting, cleaning toilets ,cleaning hallways ,mopping and any other cleaning task that is required."
good,"Fast pace environment with lots of learning through sales, newest fashions and point of sale computers and handhelds."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for as far as management and employees go, however, there are very low chances of growing into a management role or it would take too long. It is not a place for people who wants to have a solid career. But if you have time and looking into making extra cash, it is better than most retailers."
good,"learned a lot, many opportunities to move up in the company, very competitive. Need to be up to date on current trends.  Big emphasis to wear what you sell."
good,Working for Nordstrom is great if you are looking for a professional environment that truly caters to customers. There is opportunity to move up and relocate with the company.
good,Overall Nordstrom is a fantastic place to work at. The culture is why people will stay a lifetime. Your customers and coworkers become family and are the inspiration to keep you motivated to always be better. The policies and upper management encourage your own critical thinking and problem solving to make the business your own. Of course there is stress and emotions when you work alongside commission and metric based roles ... it can take a lot out of your creativity and motivation. Isn't that most jobs?
good,I was only a part-time employee and they still set-up a 401k for me. They had a great training program. They went out of their way to work with your schedule.
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for with good pay and allows for easy upward mobility in management. This can be a con however, since some managers are very young and do not have enough knowledge or experience in a management role."
good,"norstrom is a great  place to work, there are many things to learn from working there. it was a honor to work with this company. the clients and friendly and customer service it the upmost important thing."
good,It is very slow and not too many fun activities or excitement. It is very repetitive duties at the store. The same types of shift and not enough rotating shift. the pay is not worth the job.
good,"A typical day at work consists of constant movement and cleaning to ensure a nice, well-kept shopping environment for the customer. I make it a point to ask every customer if they would like t sign up for the Nordstrom rewards program to meet the requirements of signing up 5 customers a month."
good,Busy day. Learned the Nordstrom's experience. Management was nice. Co-workers were the greatest. Good retail work environment.
good,I worked at Nordstrom in Santa Monica for almost 1 year. Nice company and work environment but overall it was not for me. I did learn the value of customer service and that the customer is always right.
good,"A typical day at work requires you to be hands-on, fast-paced, and requires you to stand on your feet all day. It also requires you to be social and confident in a commission-based environment while remaining a team player so that your customers' achieve the best service as a whole. Your customers are your top priority; you are considered the face of Nordstrom no matter how high or low of a position you have in the business. Thus, you have to follow policies or be proactive in your choices. The hardest part of the job was managing disgruntle visitors and dealing with irregular or conflicting work schedules. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving positive feedback, using your employee discount, and meeting your volume goals (which definitely boosts your confidence). Co-workers were competitive and while some remained friendly, others can try to take your sales and you have to be careful about those kinds of situations and how you handle them."
good,Nordstrom is a great company with many great people. I enjoyed the interaction with my internal customers and external customers.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Nordstrom as it exposed me to high end clients and put me in a more responsible position at work. Days were long and intense, however the commission environment wa a huge motivating factor. This did also cause some conflicts and arguments between employees and co-workers."
good,"great culture"
good,"a typical day at work "
good,Coworkers were great to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers and building relationships with them.
good,"This is a great place to work. I have enjoyed my years for this company and have grown exponentially from my experiences there."
good,"If you are looking for money and a highly competitive job, this is it! The people train you well but they can be very stuck up. They can manipulate you in many ways and still smile in your face."
good,"Enjoyed my time and learned a lot. Great place to network and learn about service. You're able to move up with hard work and dedication, with minimal politics."
good,So very grateful for the time I spent within this company. Made several connections with very good people. My typical day was not very stressful and was usually organized. I would attend to the customers within my department as well as insure that the stock rooms and merchandise was organized properly.
good,"On a typical day with my coworkers it's normally busy, were always on the go. Which is a good thing assisting our guest in a timely fashion. It's awesome working with a team of enthusiastic individuals with great energy and knowledge of the company."
good,Working for Nordstrom taught me a lot of useful skills that I don't believe I would have gotten at any other retail job. Managers are very personable but are still responsible and keep everything running smoothly.
good,"Nordstrom is a Great company! Room to advance, Sky is the limit. Benefits are awsome! You can start as a dishwasher and end up as manager  of the cafe."
good,A retail company that take cares of their customers and employees. Nordstrom is a Fortune 500 company that has unlimited growth opportunities if your interested in a career in retail.
good,"hard to maintain work life balance"
good,I love the job its has its days when things seem to go wrong but everyday cant be perfect. Well structured and very orginized. Specs sheets so yoou cant go wrong on preperations.
good,The company was good to work for but being on the sales floor was not for me. I believe I would have been better suited for a customer service position.
good,My experience with Nordstrom was pretty good.  I love with the company stands for and stands behind.  Only thing I have noticed is competitive it can be that some associates tend to become jealous of top sellers instead of being inspired by them.
good,"Corporate, customer service environment.  A successful and smooth shift always came about through working together as a team.  Organization, planning ahead and taking responsibility always top priority, specifically when working under pressure."
good,"Fun place to work with great co-workers. Great, fast paced environment working with customers. Commission based, set your own pay check."
good,Experienced true customer service tactics in a renowned department store that puts their customers first. Able to see servant leadership practiced in the workplace. Many diverse sales and management techniques implemented by managers and sales associates. A large but efficiently run company.
good,Employees as well as staff are so welcoming and nice. you are treated more as a friend than an employee. the moment I walk into work I am very happy to be there. I enjoy conversation with co-workers while getting a hard days work in
good,Nordstrom was a fun place to work and offers advancement to those who seek it out.  Commission structure was good but some customers often took advantage of return policy.
good,"The company is a great place to work for and lots of room for advancement if you want to continue on the selling side of the business. Only critique is that management tends to hold their best talent as long as possible, while ""promoting out"" the people that don't preform rather than coaching out."
good,focused employees and structured company. Weekends off with holiday pay and personable management with human resources assistance offering confidentiality
good,"If you can handle the aggressive sales floors and competitive work environment, then this is the perfect college job.  You will make good money and have a flexible schedule.  There are so many opportunities to grow or just move horizontally.  I have many coworkers who have changed positions (sales to service experience or stock) based on the demands of their school schedules.  Others only work holidays and during peak hours.  It's nice to always have a place to come back to.  "
good,"Nordstrom provides an attractive place of employment with a focus on safety for customers and employees alike. I worked for 4 years in customer service in men's sportswear. I found working the sales floor to be stressful for me as it is competitive, especially during sales when additional outside temporary sales people are brought in. I enjoyed working behind the scenes and moved to the distribution center where I thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of the job. People in the distribution center were friendly and helpful. I learned a lot about where clothing in the United States comes from and how it is processed through to be marketed and presented in a retail environment. I learned a lot about working on teams and the importance of being a productive member of the team. My favorite part of the job was working with my co-workers and making long-time friends with many. The hardest part of the job was managing a diverse group of people with different opinions and perspectives."
good,I started out in Price Change and Transfer and was promoted to Store Auditor. I loved working with the department managers and helping them keep track of their inventory. It was always rewarding when their numbers would line up. I worked in two store and would commute between the two. I also loved the 33% discount on clothes!!!
good,If you do a good job you can move up quickly. Compensation isn't competitive but culture is unmatched. The best retailer in the world to work for - but it is still retail so work life balance is a challenge
good,"we strive to deliver the best customer service you can deliver while being friendly and knowledgeable about what we sell. In my role we come up with new ways to educate our co-workers, new ways to bring customers into the store by coming up with events that will cater to specific departments. We also strive to come up with new ways to get customers rewarded with our rewards program"
good,Help clients rebuild their wardrobe or help them pick clothes for special occasions like a vacation or work promotion.  I learned how to cross sell in a competitive and high end atmosphere
good,"Everyone who talks about their experience of Nordstrom has a sales associate point of view. They typically talk about returns and irate customers. I, on the other have only little experience dealing with the same issues. Working in the tailor shop is more than just a place to perfect your skill set as a tailor but this job also trains you to deal with all facets of the work world. it also helps improve your problem solving skills which are universal for any job.this job can be a very fast pace job depending on the volume or sale going on. my co workers are some of the greatest people to work with and everyone has a team work approach to there work. Last but not least my boss is probably the best leader teacher and mentor any employee can ask for."
good,I enjoyed working on commission because it was a challenge for me. I competed with every employee which made me work harder. I made sure I treated every customer with great service no matter how much money they were spending.
good,Fun place to work. Great people with supportive management. Great place to personally grow and develop. I've learned a lot just from working here and met a great amount of people with creative and awesome personalities. I had an overall great experience and would recommend this company to anyone that are interested in working in the fashion or retail business.
good,working here is amazing the only con is that you either get paid commission or hourly and thats when it gets hard. You can sell as much as you can but your paycheck won't be worth it at the end.
good,Overall great work environment and very relaxed. Really nothing to complain about at all. If you enjoy people you will almost definitely enjoy this job.
good,Nordstrom provides a fun and competitive work environment with ability to get commission. The company is structure to allow for job advancement.
good,Great place to keep your relationship building skills sharp. Focus on building a client base that you must actively keep in contact with and groom relationships over time in order to be successful and make commission.
good,"Five days a week, there is a truck with new merchandise. So there is a lot of re-organizing daily, and it gets stressful to not feel that you're not being compensated for the work that you are really putting in and balancing."
good,"A typical day would be to come in and put out any new merchandise we received the day before onto the sales floor, and help each customer find the perfect item they are looking for. I enjoyed helping people find new clothes that makes them happy and feel good about themselves."
good,"if you're interested in advancement opportunities in fashion retail this is the place for you. it's easy to get promoted if you're meeting sales goals and opening rewards. co-workers are temporary, it isn't for everyone. management is decent, most lack leadership skills. nonetheless, if you are looking to make an impact on your department, moving up in the company is encouraged and soon you can become a manager and exceed expectations."
good,"Learn a lot about fashion merchandising, how to pull and read inventory reports, customer service based company. Room for growth and promotion."
good,The team here is justnlike being with family every day. Everyone cares for each other and work together to achieve the desired goals.
good,"great company to work for, but management sucks.  The managers do not value your opinions, will embarrass you in front of a customer, but besides that it is a great company"
good,"A typical day looks like 7am start time kicking off with walking the departments I styled to ensure that all of my signage and visual cues were up to date. Then I would meet with my team and manager to discuss the days projects. If there were no team projects I would check my email for styling updates and decide what department I was going to style that day. Then I would pull outfits for the manniqueins and dress them according to instruction from our corporate office. I also assist with the cleanliness of the departments, as well as floor lay out and fixturing. "
good,"Nordstrom is a quality place to work, even though the job security isn't the best however. But the great thing about Nordstrom is they typically promote from within."
good,"Great pay and benefits, horrible management. Staff is so competitive because of high commission that it's hard to enjoy going to work everyday. Many customers abuse the liberal return policy which greatly affects your commission."
good,"Work was fun"
good,this was my favorite job so far. i was able to model clothing at Nordstrom as well as help Nordstrom with marketing strategies such as having a fashion show.
good,"The job is straight forward and there is room for growth within the company. Unlike other positions within the organization, promotion is about being proactive, if you want it then you have to speak up. Management is very supportive and helpful but will not actively seek out top performers for growth opportunities. Although the job is fairly easy, it can become stagnant if you are a people person that likes human interaction."
good,I would arrive 30 minutes before my shift to get set up and prepared for the day ahead.  There were no really hard parts about the job-- I'm very approachable so clients open up quickly to me.  The benefits were an enjoyable part of the job.  They offered Insurance and discounts at all Nordstrom stores.
good,It has opportunities to move up the chain. It is a learning environment that does focus on the customer's first. Talk to many customers resolving issues. Work with great people. I have learned a lot of patient.
good,This was my first office job and I have learned so much working here at Nordstrom. I have learned programs such as Outlook and Excel. I loved that I had my own desk with privacy.
good,"My experience at Nordstrom Rack was inviting and I learned many things from it. Every section in the store has a different system and pace of doing things. The managers are helpful and very focused. There are great advancement opportunities in the company so be prepared to see many people get promoted to different positions, company wide, that includes seeing coworkers switching locations, and welcoming employees to yours. Overall, it was nice to learn about how well the Nordstrom takes care of it's own."
good,"Nordstom is fun, professional place to work. It promotes the growth of each individual employee personally, professionally, and morally. A typical day starts off with a store pep meeting going over goals reached for individual employees and departments as well as encouragement and constructive criticism to reach goals that wer not met. Afterwards the rest of the day consists of checking inventory, research and set up of new/current merchandise for showing. Personal styling when possible for customers as well as record keeping, monetary transactions, and cleaning."
good,"I did customer service, cashier , product merchandising, fitting room attendance, and opened new credit accounts.  I learned alot about product merchandising and setting up the sales floor to increase sales. I worked with the women's department manager and team. It was a great experience handling team projects.  I mostly enjoyed interacting with customers and merchandising the sales floor."
good,Nordstrom offers a great work environment with lots of opportunity for growth and advancement.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company which is why of was there for eight years. It was a very productive, exciting and fun work environment.They promote from within which is amazing. I was the Assistant Manager in the Kid Shoe department for a little of two years. The department was a 1.5 million dollar department and very busy. I co-managed a team of ten while accomplishing my sales goals. This taught me time management skills. I model the behavior that I expected from my team by giving exceptional customer services and maximize each sale."

good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work, gives you all the tools you need for success."
good,Good Company To Work For. Great career choices and many great departments to work for.
good,"This position has taight me alot about the store support side. I take care of customer concerns, and help motivate staff in increasing our loyalty program. I ahve worked on the sales floor for a long time and feel like I can relate to staff."
good,"16 years, multiple positions"
good,"Working at Nordstrom you come across so many different types of people. you learn about different cultures and the mindset of people. The management staff is wonderful and they are easy to talk to. your co-workers are very friendly and are always there to help you. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the returns. Due to it being a commission based job, when the returns come back they can take a large part of your check. Even though that can be stressful, you still enjoy the environment and times goes by really fast."
good,You need to work the sales floor to learn what Nordstrom stands for. The company prides itself in promoting from within and this stands true.
good,"I have a great time working at Nordstrom. The people I work with are helpful and willing to work with your schedule. As a sales representative, I thoroughly enjoy my job. I like meeting new people every day and doing the thing that I love, sales."
good,Nordstrom is an opportunity that any college student should take advantage of. You learn so much that you cannot learn in a classroom and earn a decent check while you do it.
good,"Working at Nordstrom has been a blast. If you want to make money, and don't mind some inconsistency, this is the perfect place. Of course with all retail jobs, location is key. In my market (being one of the smallest), it becomes difficult to make the job enjoyable for yourself day after day of working hard for smaller rewards. Also, with internet shopping so large, there are many days where you ave the opportunity to look at an empty sales floor. Management looks out for management, not for their employees, but it is fairly easily and recommended to move 'down the Nordstrom pyramid"" (up the ladder).  Nordstrom really pushes you to create your 'own' business; which is true! The best part about this job is that what you put in, is what you will get out - provided the clientele is available in your area."
good,Nordstrom is an amazing place to work. They allow you to take care of customers as you see fit and give you the freedom to adopt your own selling/ management style
good,Excellent company for growth and advancement especially if one is mobile to various regions.
good,"sales position fitting customer creating customer loyalty making customers feel good. i work with amazing co workers. returns affect your pay check but thats how commission works, and i love most about my job is making customers feel good"
good,I would walk into work and clean up anything that's needs to cleaned up as in putting clothes away from the dressing room. I learned to be very neat and organized. I've gained experience in costumer service. The hardest part of the job was probably working your social life around it. Working in a department store for a summer job was difficult saying no to my friends when they wanted to go to the beach for the day. The most enjoyable part about working was meeting new people and being able to be a better communicator when it comes to customers.
good,"A typical day at work for me is the following. I always arrive to work 15 minutes early. I start off my day by checking my emails, than I do a walk through exception of the kitchen, making sure night time cleaning duties were done properly, that way I can hold people accountable for there actions. After that, I go through the walk-in, freezer, prep area & behind the line and do my preplist for the day. Once i post the preplist. I go onto RBS and look up my sales for the previous day as well as hourly employee timecard punches, type that into my schedule and into the declining budget. that way i can see where I am at as far as food cost and labor percentages. I print out my menu for display in the resturant with our specials and soups for the day before we open. I help out in the kitchen as needed to get the 911 items done that we need to start service. I send employees on break before we open, i do a linecheck to ensure we are ready for service. I serve as an expeditor during the busiest hours of our operation, which is lunch service, making sure every dish is met to our standards, garnished properly, and also checking the quality of the dishes before it goes out to our customers. After the lunch rush is over, i place my orders that i need for the next day, assign cleaning duties  and a pm preplist to my employees before leaving work. "
good,"It was my first time working and Nordstroms was a great place to work seasonally. It was a bit intimidating at first with all the other workers and being so busy during the holidays. My typical day at work usually started at 7:30 or 8 and I has eight hour shifts which included a one hour lunch break. I think that because it was the holiday season everyone was overwhelmed and a bit stressed so the management was a bit distracted. It taught me to work hard and be more independent, instead of having someone tell me everything I had to do I had to work and do a lot of things on my own. The hardest part was how much walking I had to do and the blisters that formed on my feet. The most enjoyable was probably the fact I was working at my favorite store."
good,Nordstrom was a great company. Nordstrom always promoted from within the company and had really amazing benefits. I learned a lot about true customer service during my time with Nordstrom. My managers were amazing. although Nordstrom was an awesome place due to the competitive nature sometimes the environment seemed a little hostile.
good,"it was fun, pretty easy not much required for the position. meet different people"
good,"Everyday We would get new product."
good,"great opportunity to learn more about retail and improve in a professional environment."
good,"Sales, Merchandising. I leaned how to put myself out there and how to talk to people. Management was great. Coworkers became friends. The hardest part of the job were making hourly sales goal. The most enjoyable part was helping others."
good,"After ten years of experience with Nordstrom, I have made many life long friends.  This is a great store to walk into and feel like my home.  As the manager, I'll set the plan for the day and enjoy being on the floor servicing customers.  Being a commission based environment, our goal is to build customer relationships as well as provide outstanding service.  I like to be on the floor leading by example both selling and coaching on the floor.  I enjoy being the coach on the floor and really like meeting the customers.  Being in retail a few traits I learned along the way are patience, service, humility and leadership.  As a leader, I enjoy seeing the growth in our teams as well as seeing growth in sales."
good,"a typical day at work was slow "
good,This position was easily learned. Management was there for questions and concerns. Nice work atmosphere.
good,"Customer service was my main priority. But at the same time, I took a technical approach to this job. You have a choice every day to either simply sell shoes or learn, memorize and absorb product knowledge in order to successfully sell each and every shoe to any and every customer."
good,"If you want to advance in Retail, then this is the perfect company to work for. Unfortunately for me I didn't have the best experience all the time on the sales floor but the company itself was a joy to work for."
good,Love this job and the excitement it brings daily. The pay here is slightly low for my comfort.
good,It was a good place to work. Everyone there was nice and friendly. There really were no down sides to the job at all so really it was an okay place.
good,Nordstrom's was a great surprise employer for me. When speaking on the phone with the head chef I never expected to be walking into a restaurant inside of I've learned so much about cooking and time management skills from Nordstrom's. I would greatly recommend anyone to give Nordstrom's a chance with the opportunity for advancement.
good,You extremely busy so your day goes by fast. You after rarely bored and the customers are pretty nice.
good,I experienced so much professional growth with this company
good,It was great experience for me and was able get management experience there. Unfortunate retail hours are long and unstable. I overall loved working there just want a different pace.
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom was pretty laid back and fun.  Nordstrom café was different than any other place I worked.  The customers would order in line, take their receipt to a table and then a server would come by and bring them the drinks and food they ordered.  It was a fun place to work."
good,I had to end this job due to the fact they would not offer me a customer service position. I did not enjoy sales.
good,"typical day at work consist of dailt duties, stock assignment, answer phones, give good customer service, sale shoes. I learned that hard work payed off due to i work off commission and it was very rewarding to see what my goals were.hardest part of job was stock assignments. most enjoyable part of this job was making ppl happy and appreciate you."
good,Everything about the company as far as benefits and pay was great.  The place is in dire need of a management staff that cares about the well being of its employees and not just the size of they're bonuses.  I learned a lot about the warehouse industry.
good,lots of room to move up but not the best paying as far as cosmetics goes.
good,"Thinking back to the time when I went to school and worked at Nordstrom at a part-time salesperson was very fun. "
good,"At Nordstrom a typical day is always about helping your customer. It is important to know what your customer needs are, and to also know your product to sell. We are sales people so our job is to sell and inform customers about our products."
good,"I have learned core values from this company, such as, how to be fast pace in a busy work environment, time management, customer service key points."
good,"A fun place to work"
good,"Such an amazing company to work for- great benefits, competitive pay.. etc. Work/ Life Balance as a Department Manager is the hardest part of the job; holidays, weekends, etc."
good,"The job is truly exhausting, and find it frustrating that it often interferes with social plans because working on the weekend seems to be a requirement of the job.  I loved my manager and the coworkers I worked with at the cafe in Glendale we got along great and everyone was always watching each others back and had a great sense of humor.  The mundane tasks with my current position as customer service rep at Nordis rack is far less enjoyable than my prior cafe experiences, I often feel like a robot scanning barcodes and  processing returns- though for the tasks Nordstrom pays above average.  I feel like I make no kind of difference to anyone, whereas in the cafe, I had more influence on bringing enjoyable service and customer experience."
good,"Lots of meetings, process oriented, good people, good work environment- Learned 'how to make it work' to get the job done!"
good,there is a lot to learn from the way this company is managed. There is a ton of room for advancement if you are cut out for it
good,Great company that's going through a lot of technology change
good,"Love the people, Love the Compensation, Amazing benefits. Great opportunities for career advancement. "
good,come into work at 6 might have a 1000 pair of shoes I have to separate them by color shapes and sizes move old shoes around no matter how many pairs of shoes we got there was always room for some more .management was good never had a issue my coworkers was real team players cause if their finish with there product they will come up each other to make sure we off the floor in time for the store to open .u can really grow with the company . 
good,I learned a lot about how to run a successful business and take the best care of customers.  The worst part about the job is that its hard to find time for family and friends that do not work in a retail environment.  
good,I would stand and supervise up to 10 hours per day and supervise other sales associates.  I did get to meet a variety of clientele who became very loyal which helped boost my sales since I had limited times to sell.  Promotional sales were always crazy but I learned a lot about marketing.  I think the hardest part of any retail position is the hours you have to work especially since most companies are open on holidays now.
good,"A typical day is answering 600-900 calls a day, in a very attention to detail manner, while being an ambassador for a store and keeping their info up to date. I leaned to better manage my time and i have improved my multitasking skills. My Co-Workers here are VERY easy to get along with once they get to know you. Also they make you feel comfortable. the hardest part of the Job has to be the volume if calls and the unexpected question that are thrown your way. Also dealing with the managers favoritism isn't particularly easy. The most enjoyable part of the job i would have to say is the environment and my co-workers."
good,"As an intern turned salesperson I have a lot of love for the company. I had a great internship experience and love being a salesperson... Not to mention if you sell well you get paid pretty generously, but a lot of this has to do with your department. Nordstrom is very cut throat and you must be a good seller. I haven't had too much experience with this,but I know plenty of others who have found the company to be sharky in terms of salespeople. There is also a lot of petty drama at times. You must have thick skin and good communication skills as well. "
good,"Nordstrom is extremely fast growing and if you can understand the Nordstrom culture, you can grow and advance quickly. Because they are growing so quickly, they often do not properly test new technology and it's a baptism by fire. Recently, jobs are being combined from 2 jobs into 1 job without increasing the benefits. "
good,Working as a stock attending was very fast going. While stocking I had to also be aware of customers on the floor and attend to their needs also. I enjoyed working with the staff in the short time I was there. The hardest part was helping to open the store and then having to leave since I enjoyed what I was doing.
good,Very busy with events going on to increase volume of sales and it was a fun workplace.
good,Very busy with events going on to increase volume of sales and it was a fun workplace.
good,"The environment at Nordstrom was great to work in. You work on commission so it makes you work hard. The management could be a little annoying and bothersome, but the other sales employees are really cool."
good,"great company culture, promote from within, compensation potential limited"
good,"I work with my team to drive business. I have learned about merchandising my floor, driving product, creating relationships with customers. Also creating excellent customer service to leave that lasting impression."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed this job and this company, I just didn't like my crazy bi-polar manager. Nordstrom has great benefits and pretty good pay. I just didn't see much room for advancement in my field.."
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to build your on business, the company provision are astounding with great products, and great customers."
good,"I worked for Nordstrom from 2007 until 2012 and have held multiple titles. I love what the company stands for and the benefits that you get. If I hadn't worked for Nordstrom, I don't think I would be the fashionable team leader that I am today. They company has it's standards and it makes you want to better yourself. The environment and people that you work with make it worth every minute of your time. The most enjoyable part of working there were of course the customers. The smiles on their faces after you've done your job well and the reward of seeing them again made me love my job. The one downfall is that good management comes a dime a dozen. I strongly believe in the saying 'Nice guys finish last' when it comes to Nordstrom management. But that doesn't mean they're non-existent. Favoritism also was a big problem in both Rack and full line stores. Sad to say you might need to transfer around until you find a manager you can trust in helping you excel and actually care about what you want while with the company."
good,Def a good learning experience! Fast paste environment with high expectations. I learned a lot and met some interesting people.
good,"A typical day at work consists of setting your personal sales goal for the day that you would need to achieve in order to make your ending pay period goal. The rest of the day consists of selling, assisting customers, and providing the best customer service to anyone who comes into the store. I get along very well with my sales team and we all help each other out as much as possible. The hardest part of my job is when people return items that you have sold to them. There are days where I will get over 1000 dollars of returns, which means I would need to sell twice as much for that day. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with because we have all gotten really close, as well as meeting and working with new customers every day."
good,This places is a nice place to work but im finding it hard to jain more hours needed to make it from month to month. pay is good but with no hours to spare it get really tight even with wife working. People are good to work with jobs not stressful. but the low hours makes it hard
good,This is by far one of the best retail stores to work in. Has plenty of benefits 401k health care etc. Its wonderful how theirs always room for advancement they wont hire a manager off the street you have to pretty much start from the bottom and work your way up.
good,"Competitive environment. A lot of opportunities to advance. This location has the best product selection around. I love/hate the commission aspect because you can make a lot of money, but if someone returns something they bought form you then they deduct it from your current pay."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of maintenance of the sales floor and directive selling to every customer that came your way. Customer service was HIGHLY stressed, and so one was able to build a strong rapport with their customers."
good,"Rally with store,whats new, and information regarding your department"
good,some days your business and some days your not. how some people are hard to work with. Great meeting some co-workers. dealing with some customers. meering customers needs.
good,"I absolutely loved my job and learning about products to sell. I was confident in what i sold every single day. I learned extensive knowledge on fitting men in anything from jeans, underwear, to suits. I enjoyed the people I worked with. It is always a challenge to keep striving for more being an all commission based pay. I enjoyed styling men and being reassured that I provided great customer service and knowledge."
good,Nordstrom is an expert in customer service. By working here you learn how to cater to each and every customer. Giving them the best experience possible is what matters. You are here to support and guide your customers.
good,The job was great. I learned alot about commissioned sales and the aggressiveness of sales. Learned alot about my self and high end clothing stores.
good,"great customer services skill, multitasking,"
good,"fun job, made great friends. It started out as just a job but I learned so much about running your business while working there."
good,"Productive Fast pase working invironment, Fun atmosphere with focus on bottom line."
good,"I really enjoyed my internship at Nordstrom. I learned a great deal about the value of customer service. I would have stayed with Nordstrom, but I had a passion to work on the corporate side of Retail."
good,"Norstrom is a great company,"
good,Nordstrom is a fun yet professional retail environment where you are encouraged to build relationships and get to know your customers needs throughout the entire store.. Followup with your customers is a must and calling to let your customers know when something fabulous you know they must have arrives! Good opportunity to make a good deal of money through commission sales.
good,"Great corporate culture, excellent organizational structure with strong employee support."
good,"Nordstroms is a very devoted business who gurantees excellent customer service and stands behind their word. A typical day at work was exciting, educational and fun. I learned many things about maintaining business and customer relationships and keeping every customer happy. Management was fair and co-workers were supportive. It was a healthy competitive atmosphere. The hardest part of my position was meeting numbers and goals and keeping your success consistent. It is not for everyone but If you love to push sales, manage events and are good at being pursuasive, this would be the job for you."
good,"At Nordstrom, the staff and customers are unlike anywhere else. There is a real sense of community and outstanding customer service that really makes this place warm and welcome."
good,I get shipment every morning and have to remerchandise my floor. I then go to a morning meeting with my openers and during today I sell and teach selling.
good,"Public Relations skills working at Nordstrom ,dealing with the public. Interacting with customers face too face on a daily basis and preventing theft is what I took away from Nordstrom"
good,"It was great experiences working at Nordstrom. I have learned a lot. I got chance to worked as an assistant manager at customer returns department, gained ideas of management from Nordstrom."
good,I worked as a sales associate for  five years and did very well for the majority of that time.  Towards the end a terrible manager was brought in that drove many good employees away from the company.
good,"I liked the management, I felt comfortable asking questions. Being a barista the pay is not that good though. The only hard part of the job was on the weekends when the line would be out of the door, I had to look down for at least two hours straight and my neck would be in pain, but I couldn't stop working or I would get in trouble. Having to work on the weekend was not fun. Another thing I did not like is that we could not make commission off of selling coffee products, policy said we made ""too much"" money to get commission, I was making $11/hr...... maybe around $13/hr with tips. I did like being able to make my own coffee drinks the way I liked them without having to pay - Free drinks!"
good,Goals can be high but hard work and relationship building leads to success. Fun team atmosphere. Co-workers support eachother and there are great perks to working in cosmetics.
good,"Great place to work for awesome people to work with and chefs to pay is good benefits are also very good like, pto, holiday pay and 401k and retirement as well."
good,A typical day at work would start at 7am and end at 3pm. I clock in and pick up a walkie talkie and mobile. I am either assigned to pick up orders on the floor or working directly with putting orders together and making sure they're complete. I'm constantly walking throughout the store for my entire shift as well as working on my own. I was a sales associate for a year beforehand so working on my own was a different experience rather than working one on one with customers. I work with a team from different backgrounds as well as ages from 18-50. The hardest part about my job is that I must be constantly moving in order to fulfill orders under a certain time frame. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I was trained well enough to take on different tasks which means that I can be assigned to a different job every shift.
good,"It was not bad place to be, but i didn't like the cutting hours. You cant count on a guaranted amount of hours which affect your paycheck. OTHER than that i dont have any complains"
good,"It has been a while since I worked here, but at the time, we were constantly going through change, definitely made things interesting.  Learned a lot about a lot of different things."
good,"Sometimes you are busy, other times you are not. Supervisors will get upset if they see you not working even after you complete daily tasks. Early Shifts. Not a lot of training."
good,Nordstrom is an all inclusive work space that allowed people to be who they are and feel comfortable coming into work. It was very easy going and helped me become more proficient in working in the coffee field.
good,"Day starts with morning rally, MIC talks about how the store did a day before and what are the goals for the day. The hard part of the job when some of the managers ask for unrelated tasks. On the weekend when the store is busy and customers compline and ask for assistance, some of them are unhappy because of the long check out lines."
good,"Great place for someone looking for a career in retail. Lots of opportunity for growth across departments, stores, etc. If you’re mobile there will be more opportunities provided. "
good,I liked working there because they were early shifts and I’d get off around 12 &’ have the whole day to do what I wanted. It was a good pay for easy work
good,Nordstrom has a great work/life balance and I've enjoyed the teams I've worked on.  They value their employees and the community they are a part of.  Career path is not always clear but it depends on your area.
good,"good company , people were nice, worked hard for your  money. Management is a little hard to get a hold of but willing to help out when you need them."
good,manager was terrible with scheduling and her attitude was bad. work in general was good. cant be a slow person if applying fro stock or reeving. overall its a good job for people who like to work without dealing with customers.
good,It was a good job a lot good people u make new friends and it’s not a boring place to be at good pay rate good everything I did not regret working their at all.
good,"Nordstrom has great benefits.  Expectations can be unachievable at times. The store pushes sales, however in store inventory is low and you are forced to place orders for people. Customers who shop instore want their items immediately and do not want to wait."
good,"as service experience,  you move around throughout the day. At times it is taxing, but can also be exciting and make the day go faster. Overall the culture is nice and inviting."
good,"This job allows for growth! I was able to work several positions during my time there. I worked with some of the absolute best mentors and made lifelong friendships. "
good,"Working there was generally favourable. I found the upper management and middle management and lower management, supportive.  I found however the work was difficult at times, and for me maintain time goals was next to impossible.  This resulted in undue stress."
good,"They always have an open door. Willing to direct you the right way to help you grow. Attentive, educational, they always retrain and offer other tactics to help you sale."
good,"I started off as a cashier in designer shoes. I then was recognized for my hard work and knowledge of many designers that we carried. With the knowledge that I gained , I was able to assist with different fashion shows and work with some of Nordstrom’s top Personal stylists. I also assisted in the cosmetics department as needed."
good,"If you are a top-seller, you will be treated well! "
good,"Retail is retail wherever you go. It is a fine job if you are looking for something to do as part-time or over the summer, but for me, it got a little monotonous. The pay is really nice even without commission. Having to meet sale standards is a little stressful but it is nice seeing it in your paycheck."
good,The great thing about Nordstrom is they will promote you to a job you have little previous experience in if you have a good attitude and you are willing to learn.
good,"A great company with stable pay and hours.  Voluntary and mandatory overtime is offered or required.  it is repetitive motion work, at the entry level."
good,"Overall Nordstrom lives up to it’s renowned title for “Best Place to Work” %85 of the time.  Retail as evolved entirely in itself especially in the Atlanta market for Nordstrom.  This can be challenging for someone who might be accustomed to the older traditional way of retail.  Customers have access to online shopping which is killing retailers however, Nordstrom tries its best to make sense out of it all.  You definitely have to sweat to make your paycheck livable"
good,"I've worked at Nordstrom for 18 months so far and my only complaint is the unstable paychecks! I'd rather not leave my pay up to chance (customer returns/random daily traffic) but if I received a stable hourly paycheck, this would be a fantastic place to work!"
good,"Nordstrom culture is nice. Managers are dedicated and nice as well. Life balance is not good, but overall, it is a good company to work. They need more consistency in management."
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work. There’s a lot of pros and cons about working there. The benefits are wonderful. Meeting and interacting with customers and helping with their needs is a great feeling
good,I enjoyed working there.  Management was good and listened to employees.  The room for advancement has diminished over the last few years.  Overall it was a great place to work
good,"Nordstrom is a good company and they take care of their people. There's always room for advancement. I learned how to work in a team environment and be a leader. Work place culture is to take care of the customer and a nice pleasant place to work. Most enjoyable part of the job is creating relationships with customers and making a difference in their lives to help them feel better and beautiful, (I worked in cosmetics)."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Nordstrom! Very Majic environment, always something new going on! Holidays very enjoyable. Fashion shows, the merchandise always changing. Interesting how a big high end store works. They treat people well and with respect."
good,I believe Nordstrom is a good place to work especially during seasonal periods. they offer a lot of overtime and now they have a very starting competitive wage at. 15.00hr
good,"It was definitely a learning experience.  I am a sales associate at heart who is passionate about exceeding the guests needs while shopping.  I was shaped and developed professionally by a hard cosmetic Mgr.  Overall she has a lot of responsibility and had major profit to deliver, so expectations were put on each CM and it was expected to be delivered. I enjoyed my time there, at Scottsdale fashion square. The roles are not for the faint of heart neither are the individuals that are employed there. You must take accountability for your counter and hour success is measured by the guests expectations being met but also goals being met."
good,Overall a good paying job. Hours are 6a-2p no weekends no major holidays. Earn PTO every pay period. Employees receive online and in store discount. Climate controlled warehouse
good,This job and working on commission was hard and not for me long term. I respect the company very much. It was the customers that made it miserable for me.
good,"Extremely fast paced, Customer driven, Great benefits, Teamwork is essential. Depending on special sales atmosphere can be extreme high volume. Do your best"
good,"Nordstrom really valued it's customers. They really believed in going the extra mile. However, management was so customer focused, it felt that sometimes they forgot about their employees. Overall I enjoyed working for Nordstrom."
good,fast paced setting. culture is really good. people are always ready to help you when you need it. you get good deals (especially if you go for designer items)
good,"If you are looking for a place to help customers out in a retail establishment, then I recommend working for Nordstrom.  A typical day begins maintaining your assign department and have a friendly attitude.  The most enjoyable part of the job is my coworkers and how we have formed a relationship of collaboration and support."
good,Overall a great place to work but varying business units have much different opportunities- some have none and some have a lot.  Results matter but relationships matter more.  This is a double-edged sword.
good,"Since it is a commission based job, there is really no upper limit to what you can make if you put your mind to it. Nordstrom gives sales people all the resources they need to drive their own business. That being said, it is also a very competitive environment and depending on your department, this can mean its very toxic and there isn't a lot management can do about it."
good,"The Ebar was a very nice place to work for me, as it started my career in the coffee business. Management could have been better, and it was hard to deal with the clientele, but overall I enjoyed being a part of the team."
good,"Was able to create and build own personal client list for long-lasting relationships with customers. Schedule was based on your sales numbers, and quotas would get more challenging the better you would do! Great environment to make friends with like-minded individuals, but management turnover was difficult with lack of leadership in department."
good,"I had a very good experience while working at Nordstrom for 13 years. It was a calm, healthy, and positive environment. company is very invested  in helping employee grow within the company."
good,Great place to work if you are looking for a fast paced job. Depending on what department you work in hours range from 10- 40 week. Flexibility for students.
good,Loved working at Nordstrom. I started fresh out of college and was able to immediately start developing my personal and professional skills. I never felt like I was alone and always felt support when needed.
good,"Retail hours can be tough but it was a fun environment to work in. The company is big on customer service and sales performance. If you are not comfortable working on commission and with people this is not the place for you,"
good,"Working there was great, the nordstrom rack is a fun place to work because you don't have to wear a suit to work and you get a fat employee discount. Management started coming down on breaks taking no longer than 10 minutes and people only getting 20 minute lunches right before I left."
good,"Working at Nordstrom really challenged me to be my best self everyday. You have customers coming in for not only a purchase, but an experience because this is the culture we cultivate with our Nordy shoppers. Plus working in a highly competitive sale environment, one can feel the pressure to change yourself to accommodate a particular preference, but remember.  Customers respond to authenticity and can feel someone trying to make a sale. You want to be a friend to your customer advising them on what works, while staying true to you."
good,"Easy job, commission based for most positions. Easy to make money for extroverted personalities. Lots of different tasks and customer base. Dress your own way which is great, but also still fashionable. Easy to get time off, and management is very swift to respond no matter the issue. You never feel like you are not heard."
good,"The company culture is great, it can be a little cliquey but that's because of high turn over and lots of seasonal hires. If you stick around for a few months, people loosen up a bit. Compensation is commission only, hourly if you don't hit your goals. Depending on your department, goals could be easy or near-impossible. Overall it was good, I liked my coworkers and the product. They have restructured the company a few times the past few years and it slows promotion and moving up. Management varies from department to department. Could be a tight ship, could be a boss that calls out half the time."
good,"I loved Nordstrom. It was like having a business within a business. You learn to build your own clientele, whom are people I thoroughly enjoyed and cared about. Nordstrom is also very flexible with your schedule, and they have benefits with insurance and 401k. The downside was how the politics within the company worked. There is also favoritism within the company, but I can admit I was a favorite because I sold the most out of my department."
good,I worked at Nordstrom for many years working my way of from sales person to department manager. The culture and benefits are great but as a manager your work very long hours will a low salary as they expect your to sell. I think Nordstrom is a great place to work and would go back there if needed. I think  in the changing retail landscape being a commissioned sales person would be difficult.
good,"Nordstrom has a fun team-oriented workplace culture. It's relatively easy to get to know everyone in the store, and there's always fun competitions and prizes to encourage sales. Making commission is pretty easy during the holidays and the Anniversary Sale, but in between it can be hard to get a good paycheck especially for certain departments."
good,"Nordstrom was a pleasant place to work at once you get passed the fact that it is competitive since it is commission based. Here I was able to build relationships with customers which made the overall working experience great. It was always nice to come into work and talk to my regular customers because I knew them and they knew me. Honesty is the best policy when working here, customers can tell when you're trying to sell vs. when you genuinely want to help them. The veteran employees at Nordstrom's are the best people to make friends with and they truly understand the Nordstrom way of things."
good,Working at Nordstrom has lots of pros. You make whatever you want. Nordstrom helps you in any way possible to become a successful sales person. You a meet a bunch of different characters. Very fast paced depending on location. Some stores rely on personals meaning customers that truly only shop with you. But you make what you put in.
good,"A typical work day at Nordstrom was something different everyday. It consisted welcoming customers, assist customers with their returns, sales transactions. Also included cleaning back stock and keeping the floor and cash wrap clean as possible."
good,"Nordstrom is great company to work for I would recommend anybody . There open door policy is very welcoming . The company’s benefits they offer , they give you so many options to chose from . I recommended this job to friends and family."
good,My time at Nordstrom Rack was great the benefits were good the team was great it was a fun and calm place to work at the only problem I’d say is management is horrible.
good,"This review is solely for the cosmetics department. I would definitely recommend anyone work here provided they're hard working, goal oriented, and customer focused. You really have to want to SELL and enjoy selling to make good money at Nordstrom. If you think this is just a fun job where you can do makeup, you're probably not the right fit. Management is supportive so long as you're making your goals. You really need to form a solid customer base and not be afraid of calling people (sometimes essentially cold calling) in order to get people to book appointments and come shop with you. My whole team is great and it's a close knit environment with most of the employees."
good,"Great chefs, lousy GMs.  Made advancement very difficult.  Was written up citing conversations that never actually happened.  When confronted about it, I was told ""oh, well I meant to talk to you.""  HR never addressed the issue when alerted of the problems."
good,It's a great company with some amazing people. The benefits where great and work wasn't hard just a fast pace work environment with a divers work place that isn't for everyone but can be a great thing.
good,"I Maintain the general safety of customers, employees and the store. Respond to customer’s needs, provide accurate information and direct them as needed. Perform monitoring and surveillance activities. Assess and assist in emergency situations. Reduce and control loss of inventory through audits, training and education. Maintain a high level of confidentiality"
good,"I think this is the best starter job , you really learn about customer satisfaction and retail in general. You are given goals every month for you to hit, most of the time they are realistic but when its slow you don't end up making much."
good,"Very Nice  people Contract Wages slightly low, very friendly and caring people, the wages are s low for entry level IT compared to other entry level positions , with requirements closer to System Admins than Service desk"
good,"It was a smooth and fun working experience, the cooperation between the my co workers and my superiors was always at a"
good,A typical day at Nordstrom was. Most of the time it started in the stock rooms.  I learned how to manage a team conflict resolution how to deal with angry customers. How to run a store and to make our goals for the day. There was no hard part during the day.  I would say the most hardest part of the day was to make sure that the customers received their items on time. The most enjoyable time for me would be when a cust would receive their item and was happy. Or when a client r e cived their item on time. The culture was excellent the customer was first and we were given the opportunity to make our own decisions. I learned this from my manager. This gave us the opportunity to learn how to become managers. We had the opportunity to sell within the store which gave us opportunity to grow so our salary might increase. The opportunity for management was endless. It all depended on oneself. I enjoyed every minute of the day.
good,very fast  paced as you had to pull merchandise from shoots and send it to the customers.  Sometimes when got moved out of that department to another one.
good,"Fast pace working environment when busy, when not busy could be slow but easy to find things to do to pass time (i.e cleaning, folding, etc). Met a lot of great people while working there."
good,"I loved working at nordstrom, i worked with a team of great people. My manager at the time was the reason I left we did not mesh well together and I think he took the role of manager in a different way. Some days it would feel little mundane on the slower days where we didn't have a lot of orders to process but overall a great place to work and grow."
good,"Management   need. be   more  professional "
good,"Family  atmosphere,cooperation from all employees,always moveing ay a safe manner,well timed breaks due to the nature of the job being performed regularly."
good,Very good company to work for. Set schedules good benefits. And different shifts. Good opportunities to move up with the company. Shift deferential for night shifts.
good,"Amazing place to work, with great benefits and working conditions, but type of workplace is very fast pace and always require a lot of time from daily life, but overall is a great place"
good,"Stress and sales pushing."
good,"great sales job if you're comfortable in competitive sales. You'll have people who only help themselves because at the end of the day you're either making minimum wage to you commission out on your sales and make more than minimum wage. As fas as job security, if you're a top selling person in your department then you're safe, if your department is slow/you aren't making your sales then they are also quick to let you go. Refunds under your sales number also effect your weekly sales achievements. Fun during holidays and during seasonal sales, but once its gets into a dry season of sales your hours also disappear. Great employee benefits as well even if you're part time."
good,"Management is very assisting and resourceful. Workload honestly depends on time of work. In the mornings, it starts of slow then picks up during the day getting busy."
good,There used to be ample room to grow at nordstrom but not anymore the way they have restructured the departments. It's really hard to get promoted but they do provide you the necessary skill set to take elsewhere.
good,"Nordstrom is an incredible company. It is hard to recommend which department to work in, or even if I recommend working there, as you never know the type of employees who have been hired. The employees have been hired for their skills and their knowledge, but not necessarily for their respect to their fellow employees. Sales people tend to be “sharky,” which can lead to a frustrating and stressful day when you are trying to meet your sales goal."
good,"Love the attitude overall at Nordstrom most the employees are great and are helpful. Always vibe with the manager even if you don't like the person , that was the biggest challenge ."
good,The best thing about working for Nordstrom is the environment that is provided for the employees and the customers. The environment is very safe and provides a spot where everyone can feel welcome.
good,"Quick pace, learned a lot of tools for retail, fun work place somewhere you constantly moving, great discounts for yourself, great lunch room and environment to work"
good,Good job but sales is not for everyone. Really enjoyed the company and approve of the CEO. We get a good discount on the merchandise. Lots of opportunities to move up.
good,"Being that my peers in the food industry were young adults, issues that arose were of individuals who felt unwelcome by some of their peers and that got back to HR. With that said, it also resulted in other individuals who were not aware of certain situations, yet due to association, these certain individuals were considered bystanders and HR considered them to be held accountable for actions acted out by others. In other words, unnecessary drama brought upon by some peers, when it shouldn't have involved others."
good,"If youre an ""ok"" salesperson, you wont see much on your paycheck. You MUST be hustling to see any commission. If you dont make commision, you get your base hourly wage. And we only got a 20% discount....like really. The cheapest thing there is like $50 but employees cant get more of a discount??"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Nordstrom while I was there. You have to be willing to work though-it is a fast-paced work environment and depending on your store, you're competing with each other for commission. As long as you're personable, motivated and work well with others, you'll do fine."
good,I absolute loved working there. Especially because I was a salesmen I was able to work for my money and the harder I worked the more I made. On top of that a lot of recognition for hard work. Time passed so fast on the job barley felt like work.
good,fun place to work that pays well. management is a joke. work extremely long hours 10-12 hour shifts and 6 -7 days a week mandatory. good benefits but if management doesn't like you you wont last no matter how hard you work.
good,"I worked for Nordstrom for 14 years. I was given the opportunity to grow and take on larger roles within the company. The only reason I am leaving the company is because the location I was employed at closed, otherwise, I would still be with them."
good,Working at a retail store is always hard. There is a lot to do with customers and you have to be very patient.  Nordstrom was a good experience and I worked her while in college
good,"I Loved working for Nordstrom. They pushed me to learn and think outside the box. They encourage employees to treat their business as if it were there own and the pay is generous. Once you reach management though, work life balance can be difficult around holidays and Anniversary Sale with expectations that you will be able and willing to work 6 days a week and upwards of 10-12 hour days. It was a very difficult schedule to maintain as a single parent. The culture can be SO awesome, and it was the majority of the time, however the last leg of my employment was with a particularly inexperienced manager who came from a Nordstrom Rack and didn't understand the full scope of various departments. It ultimately led to me leaving the company."
good,"No day is the same in retail, there's up's and down's but there are trends so you sort of can anticipate those moments. Management for the most is down to earth and understanding (at least in my opinion). The culture is fun, welcoming, inclusive and energetic. dealing with so many different people and personalities is probably the hardest part, but also the most enjoyable."
good,I deeply appreciate all the training and development I received at Nordstrom. It has prepared me for Management positions throughout my career. I would definitely go back to this company.
good,"I enjoyed being transferred to different departments and learning all the work related to that department."
good,"Honestly, I can't blame the company itself for leaving. The new store manager was the main block in my desire to stay. Coworkers, for the most part, made the job enjoyable."
good,"I had a great experience at Nordstrom for many years. I started off in sales and was promoted to Department Manager. I did well there, but the company changed policies about 6 months into me working as manager, and they got rid of managers for that particular department. I was demoted to sales with the  promise of being promoted once again.  Every department thereafter that opened up positions for manager I requested, and I was denied every time. It was discouraging because I loved working there.  I decided to leave at that point  and go to graduate school. I wish I had been able to stay there though, because I really did enjoy what I did there."
good,"Not bad. Work was obviously tedious, but not very difficult. The rest of this is just filler.  It's annoying that they make you review all of your past experiences."
good,Nordstrom is a good place to work. I really liked working there and the people that I worked with were very nice. If you needed help there was always someone that would come and help you.
good,"I had a great time at Nordstrom and had a great manager."
good,"when you come in you will print off paper work, review video, protect company assets, walk around, do office work, post at doors, deal with customer incidents, and for closing, check stair wells, bathrooms and cafe."
good,"Lovely benefits for employees, particularly for expecting parents."
good,I enjoyed my time here a great place to work with a safe and healthy work environment.management was good and gave you the tools needed to get your job done the best way possible.
good,Everyone who works at Nordstrom is fashionable and lively. The departments are very collaborative with each other in terms of taking care of the customer and ensuring store cleanliness. It really is a team effort
good,I worked here during Nordstrom annual anniversary sale. A seasonal position. I loved the environment every one worked as a team. Loved the discount! I did not want to leave.
good,Great place to work for growth in a company. Life/work balance is good and schedule is great for students (part-time). Management could be better though.
good,"This company was a great company to work for."
good,They provided in depth paid training. The management and HR department were very understanding and helpful. The only complaint I have about working for Nordstrom is the commission structure.
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work.  They are constantly developing new ways to improve service for customers while giving employees the tools to succeed.
good,Nordstrom is a amazing company to work for. You get to work with established designer brands. You’ll have the opportunity to learn a lot of product and fixture merchandising.
good,Better than any other retailer I've worked for. Company really takes care of you and they offer a lot of opportunities to grow from within and to further your knowledge about fashion and the company itself.
good,"Higher pay than other retailers. If you want to get rooted in the company, look past the poor culture on the sales floor and be sure to participate in their career advancement programs."
good,"typical day was to satisfy the customers needs."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for from a technology perspective. It very much feels like a F.A.N.G corporation. They strongly believe in the Agile philosophy of self-organized teams and try to focus on an ""engineering-first"" approach. This is a double-edged sword. What Nordstrom lacks is a balance of discipline and creativity. Specifically, there is a lack of cohesion within technological leadership. A lot of these problems stem from the fact that Nordstrom is a retail company, in which software is the means to an end, trying to be a technological innovator. There is a great disparity between the technology and business teams, specifically the leadership. It works, but like many other leading technological companies, Nordstrom suffers from high-attrition despite their competitive compensation packages. This is because no amount of money can make up for the burn-out and lack of long-term, cohesive vision."
good,A great environment and opportunity to grow in the company. I learned how to work at an efficient pace and as a team. The hardest part of the job were the days I was not there because it is commission-based.
good,"Must be a go getter. Must be able to take directions and go with the flow. Must be proactive. Must know how to be direct. Sales are top priority. "
good,I think if it wasn't so much ab sales and you can get more money just by the hour it would be a lot better I think Nordstrom was a good company but between returns and hitting you target ever 15 days is kind of hard
good,Great place to work at. Always meeting people from different backgrounds and countries. Great teamwork. Open to very flexible scheduling. Great pay and benefits.
good,"I worked for Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack for a total of six years.  I did everything from working on the sales floor, managing and being on the stock team at the Rack, and was a top seller at Nordstrom."
good,enjoyed my time at nordstrom  . but after a year of keeping the store nice and clean i got a .20 raise an insult. the work was not hard but need to pay attention to detail
good,"I worked here at Nordstrom for 15 months and, while a mostly positive experience, there are also a few bad things."
good,"Job and company are great, but it takes a long time to get promoted and career advancement is slow. A lot of people have worked for the company for a long time so it's really competitive."
good,If you’re mobile the sky is the limit. Clean friendly environment. Discounts and benefits are great. Managers are interested in each employee and wants them to succeed.
good,Lots of team work with Managers always willing to pitch in. Everyone one works together to achieve department goals and lots of opportunities to learn and grow with the Company.
good,"Typical day would be very busy, many different procedures to perform depending on the customer contact. I learned how to handle many customer issues with patience and understanding. My manager was extremely helpful and always available. A couple of great things about working there was the discount, and of course making customer's experience a great one."
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work, and has a solid workplace culture.  As with all contact center work, there is only so much room for advancement, so be prepared to switch departments if upward mobility is your goal."
good,"Lots of entitlement. Enjoyed the time selling and had some co-workers that were great, but many were rich and entitled. As someone who came from a humble background, it wasn't the best."
good,"Working in an area that relies heavily on season for work, while us sales associates thrived during peak season, consistently breaking our sales goals daily, once season ended, the sales goals were too difficult to reach.  When you have 9+ people on a sales floor with maybe 3-7 customers showing interest in a pair of shoes, it is difficult for everyone to reach the $3500 a day sales goal.  The company was extremely supportive and made many efforts to make sure everyone was getting by just fine.  My department manager was a different story, and many people left because of her.  I however enjoyed my job and felt as though my selling skills really grew there and would love to work for this company again some day."
good,I enjoy working at the Rack. It is a fun work culture and the management encourages advancement within the company. They are really good about recognizing and praising good work and accomplishments.
good,"Can be a competitive environment, but fun and quick paced. If you are passionate and enjoy it, it is much easier to get through. Lots of hours during seasonal times and gives you pretty good job security. Would not recommend if you are not very self motivated and a go-getter."
good,"In my experience, the management was not willing to work around my school schedule and would want me to work full-time. It was hard because the manager and assistant manager were on two different pages but, overall the company has good management and very good benefits with the ability to work your way up."
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work. They really believe in developing their people and promoting from within. Great growth opportunity if you are willing to relocate.
good,"This job is what you make it, comisison based selling isn't for all but managers and team members are there to support personal and corporate sales goals."
good,"I always felt very positive  every day when I arrived to my work, because the love for my work and my brand Kiehls. I always was very proud of Nordstrom because it is a very good company . they gave me the opportunity to work with them and I am very thankful . I learned a lot, many things I didn't know , not only what I have to do it and what I don't have to do it. The most enjoyable moments were  to give to my customers my best service and the happiness they feel when they leaved the store with my skin care treatment and the products they bought. To share with my coworkers my free time. Many nice people working there in all the store."
good,"I loved Nordstrom , it just sucked that my manager bullied me and made me feel bad for re-wearing some of my outfits or not having certain clothes when really she didn't know i was homeless so bad that i left the company and never shopped there again. besides that i loved my customers and the relationships i built."
good,Excellent to work at ...I had awesome co workers and hours are really flexible.. If your an early bird than this is the great place for you to work at!
good,A great culture with a hire from within mentality. They want to nurture their people and help them blossom. The right management and a great team makes a world of difference
good,"Nordstrom was a great job, it was great to work in a warehouse setting. The downside was working 6 days a week 60 hours a week I wasn't really told that directly."
good,"Overall great experience.  Made lasting friendships.  The culture can be ""catty"" at times, but most people are very pleasant to work with.  It is 100% commission, so you can make a great living here if you work hard and work on your book of business."
good,"For a majority of my time there, I had a decent time working at Nordstrom Rack. I was mainly required to work in the shoes department during my time there although there were shifts were I was required to work in another department. Towards the end of my time there I grew disinterested while working there. I felt stressed out trying to balance school and work and was frustrated that I was not working enough hours during the summer months while school was on break. I left on good terms when I did resign, so there is no hard feelings and I would recommend the job to others."
good,"great place to work if you believe in hard work, applying your due dilligence and staying on the right side of the power players. plenty of room for advancement and more responsibility if you apply yourself and stay smart don't succomb to workplace gossip."
good,"Grateful for my experience there, but would not want to go back.  Amazing education, but no work life balance. Early"
good,over all i enjoyed my employment at nordstrom I had to take some time for a loss in my family and I was dealing with a lot of pain in my back so I decided to take a break from the company
good,"Ive had the pleaser of working with this company for 6 years.. I recently resigned do to relocating but couldnt transfer because there wasnt a location near me. Working with this company, you really have to be a team player and rely on each other. They are really big on standards and policies. If your not a people person this job IS NOT for you.. Ive met so many people and celebrities and had awsome training through the company. The benefits are unbelievable. Some of the best benefits ive ever had."
good,"Worked for the Restaurant Division.  Fast paced, good pay. learned how to run a business.  Great experience. They take care of their people.  Very family oriented team."
good,"Dealt with inventory, re-merchandising the floor and keeping a clean workspace. Customer service and building relationships is held to a very high standard. I learned the importance of independence and personal business while also working as a team to finish activities. Nordstrom uplifts you to be the best employee you can be for the customer and yourself, fashion was just a plus."
good,I have leaned a lot over the course of my employment at Nordstrom.  These skills can be applied to much more than just selling luxury clothes. Also a great work environment.
good,Every day the employees would have customers from many different backgrounds and would learn how to best serve the customers based on their comfort. There will also be times were customer issues arise which could be stressful to resolve but in the end the issue is always resolved and the customer leaves happy.
good,"In the Nordstrom E- bar ( coffee shop) it was very lax and usually very fun and happy place to be. I learned a lot about various coffee beans, and the art of a true coffee beverage. Management had high expectations, held high standards were always friendly, and wonderful to work under. The culture was diverse, warm and welcoming. The hardest part of the job was resisting eating all the delicious pastries! The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and making them happy."
good,too easy for cooks to operate. not a solid environment for food culture. the job became boring very quick. not a challenge and/or educational for culinary arts.
good,"Working here was a great way to advance my retail career. I enjoyed the staff and for the most part, management was very professional. I learned a great deal about prioritizing task and working with a team."
good,"My typical work day would be to aide customers in finding their perfect scent. whether it be for their home, personal scents or the perfect scent gift.  The work environment at Nordstrom is very laid back, fun yet competitive. Managers coach while on the floor and it helps to gain hands on knowledge for future promotions. The hardest part of the job is being on my feet most of the day.  The best part of my job is helping customers and seeing the smile on their face from the service I provided them."
good,"Loved my job, but not easy to advance if you have been hired externally.  I don't believe this job exists any more in the capacity that I had it.  When I left, my manager informed me the roll was changing."
good,A typical day working at Nordstrom Rack was helping customers with returns and purchases making sure that my department was clean and go back free typically. In the morning for an earlier opening shift before the store opened we would re-merchandise the floor getting out new product and making sure that we followed the smart guidefor what we stood for in that month.
good,"The best place to get a start in a promising career in retail. You learn the value of sales and people all at once. Customers are the priority, and Nordstrom will make sure you know the foundation of all business is the people you're there to serve."
good,"Great company, great people who stand for the best."
good,Be super organized and use your best judgement!  This is not for the faint of heart.  You must make your numbers and have an action plan.  Treat your position as your own personal business passionately and you'll succeed!
good,Management experience increased with time at Norstrom! I loved being able to connect with the customers on a 1x1 basis. Cosmetic sales and Makeup Artistry blended with my experience in the beauty industry was a plus.
good,"Other than not having control over the music repeating thru the intercoms, the empty store overnight was still pleasant and I could typically work at a decent pace."
good,"The only thing I really didn’t like at Nordstrom was the balance. We were either super behind or never had anything to do. One day you’d come in at 430 in the morning and then the next, you’d be called off or switched to a different department. And the breaks? Yeah you get paid but for an 8 hour day, you only get TWO 10 minute breaks and that includes bathroom time and eating."
good,Nordstrom is one of the better retailers to work for. Overall my experience was fun and the potential for making good money is high. Just realize your check is based off your performance so at times it can be cut throat when trying to work with customers.
good,"Everyone was really nice. The department I worked in was a big family. My managers were amazing and always understanding. My time here taught me how to strike up a conversation with just about anyone. While working here, I realized that I am a people person and that I love talking to strangers about their day. One of the best things about this job was that I wasn't restricted to just my department. If a customer wanted help in other areas, I was encouraged to go. I wasn't a personal shopper, but I have met a good number of people who wanted me to help them shop, which was a great experience!"
good,overall it is an okay job but the hours are long with short breaks and management is biased and based on favorites and not the quality of your work. okay
good,"The people I worked with at Nordstrom were supportive, fun and provided a great work environment. The management still has work to do with transparency with the company in some transition. The hardest part of the job was leaving. I learned a lot over the last 16 years that will be an asset my future company."
good,It's really to fun work here. I love that we have been valued by our company. They take care of our needs. I love to work with people and serve them with the best quality that I have.
good,"Nordstrom is a great fast paced environment and teaches you customer service skill, which is very important in all work places. The hardest part of the job is having to be on your feet for 8plus hours sometimes."
good,"Sales goals are set everyday. "
good,Worked and got some experience in sales at fast paced environment. I enjoyed to work there because I like fashion and different customer relations. Sometimes little stressful but it worth it.
good,"Nordstrom shows you how to be the best sales person, very attentive with people and how to give excellent customer service. The only thing that can be tough is when your colleges are a bit too competitive and don't rationalize that they don't have to be extremist, we all have to take care of each other and work as a team, but at the same time its the way a person learns, i learned that to gain a clients trust i have to be myself and make the client have a good time, make them feel like they have a friend in the store, and some colleges learn it some other way, they learn that money is important and it wont matter what it takes, they have to be on top and don't respect the relation or connection one makes with a client."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company as far as retail goes. Compensation is better than most competitors and the company has a great culture based on providing excellent service. In general, work/life balance is not great with retail hours. Also due to the general climate of retail sales in stores, the company is not expanding as much as it once was. This means some of the opportunities for upward growth have been diminished. However the company does have a great policy of promoting internally which allows current employees to have the best opportunity for advancement without external competition. I enjoyed working for this company but eventually grew tired of working in retail in general."
good,I loved working at Nordstrom it has great benefits & competitive compensation. There was room to move around in the company. They were very flexible with your schedule.
good,Working for Nordstrom is a tale of 2 stories. On one end the pay and benefits are some of the best for any retail company. The other end comes with a stressful work environment as well as an bad balance of work and life
good,"Nordstrom provided a great, creative work environment. I was able to collaborate with my coworkers and solve challenging tasks on a regular basis. Additionally, I was able to hone my customer service skills."
good,The retail store seemed like a great environment to work. The cafe was an other story. Poor management led many people to want to leave. But when I return as a customer there are many similar faces in the clothing departments.

good,It is not for everyone. You need to be able to think on your feet and cannot be afraid of rejection. The pay is not too bad and you get a great discount if you move up into management or become an all star.
good,Nordstrom was a good place to work. They gave good hours and you had opportunity to make how ever much money you want because it commission based. So the paycheck was really up to you. It can get stressful sometimes but that's any job.
good,"Flexible, willing to work around school and overall personal schedules. It allows employees to keep up with current trends and the ability to learn about a large variety of different products and business aspects."
good,"individual sale goals accompanied with team sale goals equates for a balanced sales experience. Friendly competition to the MAX. Comfortable work environment, location at Garden State Plaza in Paramus, NJ."
good,"Customer focused company with a eye for collaboration.  "
good,"I loved working at Nordstrom because it gave me the opportunity to grow. I was constantly challenged when having to sell certain items, but it was such a great place to learn."
good,"It's a good company overall because the store manager gets involved on the floor and it's an open door policy. However, some sales people and department managers are just not pleasant to work with."
good,I typically opened the register if I started the shift. I kept my area clean and presentable at all times. I provided excellent customer service. I cultivated my personal customer base. I learned sales techniques and customer satisfaction. I enjoyed dealing with people. I enjoyed working at Nordstrom's and left only because I relocated to Florida.
good,"A very cool place to work since you're dealing directly with customers. It was definitely a demanding job, but very rewarding when done well. Coworkers are supportive and friendly."
good,Worked there long ago at several stores. It was a very fun place to work. Great clothes.  I learned a great deal about retail and was there many years.
good,"They have great pay, the work isn't too difficult, and if you're a student they work around your school schedule, no questions asked. Unfortunately, I was let go where less qualified workers were kept."
good,"I didn't like constantly standing or the management, but I enjoyed my coworkers as well as the job benefits and salary. A typical day involved logging in, heading"
good,It was a great place to work to serve people and make coffee for them. It would get busy but it was nothing to handle and there was  always sufficient staff to help around.
good,"A typical day at while working at Nordstrom is pretty slow-paced and uneventful. When you do get the opportunity to engage and help a customer your pretty busy helping to figure out their style and getting sizing down. But when your aren't working with a customer most time is spent standing around waiting for your shift to end, and talking to other co-workers for hours. They tend to over schedule people in the department so theres not much for you to do because there's so little work to begin with."
good,Great and fun job but it is a high pressure commissioned sales job. I loved this job as long as sales were really high. But other associates were fired for having too many returns or not enough sales and I feel they didn't give some people enough time to improve their sales. But it is fun if you are good at styling people and are willing to work hard.
good,"There is a lot to love at Nordstorm first being all the helpful people you will meet working there. the Web team is an okay job seeing as that you get a fair hourly wage of 12.75 the work, especially ""pulling orders"" can be fast paced at first but its easy to adjust to each department after a few days. the management  team is also helpful in the sense that , if you're not good at one particular job they'll accommodate you by finding something that you are good at and also helps keeps the team moving, for me that was consolidating."
good,"a typical day for me would be clocking in announce to your team that u are there, go downstairs check the daily sheets (schedule) for breaks and meals and tasks, i enjoy working with my co workers, its a good place to work lots of great benefits"
good,"I've been working for Nordstrom for the last year and a half and the experience for mews great! I love my team, we're like a family. I work for the cosmetics department, we have a lot of fun events, we dance,we listen to great music, ultimately showing our clientele that you can enjoy yourself as you shop and keep them coming back. "
good,"If you are a self-starter, this is the place to go.  It's commission, so it's like having your own business without the burden of paying for inventory to stock it.  It's all stocked and ready to SELL.  They give you all the tools, but it's up to you to put them to use.  If you're good, advancement is easy.  However, if you aspire to be a store manager, you are required to be a buyer first - and that position is in Seattle."
good,"Working nights, weekends, holidays, and having to arrange time off around all of those aspects. Overall a great company to work for with potential to move up but you have to be willing to sacrifice times with friends and family in order to move up. The company is moving at a slower rate then it used to so moving up takes longer and it is harder to motivate team members when business in retail has been tough and you are trying to manage sales goals and telling your team to sell more when the foot traffic doesn't match up with what you're asking them to sell."
good,My experience with Nordstrom was great. There are many opportunities to grow within the company and be promoted. I learned a lot about  customer care and building relationships with customers.
good,"Fast paced but very fun to be with fellow co workers.  Many things to get done on a morning shift, from putting out new items to getting the floor ready for sales and events."
good,Nordstrom was a great company. hiring process was 2-3 weeks. I went through 3 different interview all were virtual. and during the holidays its mandatory overtime you have to work. I planned on staying with Nordstrom work from home department long term but they had other plans for me and I was only on seasonal
good,"Nice place to work except on your feet quite a lot. I can't say much since I hadn't been employed there for a long time, but the environment was friendly and everyone was fashion forward."
good,"If you’re outgoing, passionate and love fashion - this is the job for you. Commission sales are great! Except when the returns go against you.. but overall, the employees are great, management is (usually) alright and the customers are nice (you have to have patience to work with the public). The discount is wonderful, but dangerous.... If you have great customer service skills and want to get into sales, try Nordstrom!"
good,"I loved my time at Nordstrom and wouldn't hesitate to return to the company. However there has been a lot of change in recent years and the culture is very different than what Nordstrom is known for. The ""inverted pyramid"", in my opinion, has changed and there is much less a ""promote from within"" mentality than existed previously, which I believe is a result of the new Amazon culture moving into the corporate atmosphere in Seattle. It was somewhat of an open secret that in order to get more competitive pay leaving the company then returning was the way to achieve that goal. "
good,"I was able to complete my bachelors degree while working with the company. I enjoyed my time with the company, however the pay could be much better for the amount of work that has to be completed."
good,It's such a fun environment. You make great friends. You get great rewards. You run around like crazy but it's a blast. Your feet definitely get tired!
good,"I loved working for Nordstrom. I grew as a barista into a manger, as well as grew as a person. Work days typically were not too busy unless it was during the holidays."
good,"If you're in school or need to start somewhere Nordstrom was great. The pay was good for that for instance. It's fast paced and sometimes work/life balance gets in the way but it's maintainable. Management is heavy in favoritism, if they like someone else over you the more hours will be given towards them."
good,Typical day can be slow or busy.  I learned to adapt to the fast paced sales and to be polite but competitive.  The management team was very supportive and encouraging.  The workplace culture was very positive.  The hardest part of the job was trying to rise above the return process.  Personally for me resisting the urge to make unecessary purchases was a challenge.  Completing a good solid sale and seeing the satisfied smile on a customers face was very rewarding.
good,a great place to work and the work environment  is very friendly and collaborative. The work is very repetitive  but it allows time to fly. I would consider it more busy work.
good,"Competitive and fast paced environment. "
good,i like the job it can be stressful sometimes our co workers are great and hours are very flexible as well. competitive salary. good management. very well organize.
good,Nordstrom is a very good company to work for. Although you need to work at a very fast pace because it is commission-based. The managers and associates they are very friendly. They offer very good benefits as well. And are very flexible with the schedule for students.
good,"I love Nordstrom, and worked there part-time after graduating college with my bachelors in business communication. While they have a management training program it’s very cut throat and the leadership in the store didn’t align with what the organization really represents. I left the organization to pursue a management position and felt I was overlooked by my manager because she was intimidated by me. My experience isn’t a representation of Nordstrom as a whole and I had a much more pleasant experience once I had a new manager as I was leaving the organization and wished she was the one I began my Nordstrom experience with."
good,I had one of the great bosses there at Nordstrom. I work in logistics and love every minute of it. Too bad it was just a seasonal job! Always had a 15 minute break at 9:00am and lunch at 12:30. The day started at 6:00 and ended around 2:30. Some days they ask you to stay late but when you work for great people you do not mind.
good,Big enough to eat in peace and take your break. The managers are great at communicating and react to any problems that you may encounter. Willing to give everyone a chance to be a better person by getting promoted.
good,"Working at Nordstrom Rack was quick paced and centered on sales (debit and credit cards). High attention to detail with fixtures, brands, and price points. There are many opportunities for promotion in the company. The starting pay is good for a sales associate. Nordstrom Rack is not commission."
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for if you are looking to advance your career in the retail world. It can be cut throat if you cannot handle a competitive work environment. You are constantly put up against your peers. The management can be lack luster at times where they only care about themselves and their performance rather then the teams. Nordstrom as a company cares about their employees and I think have great benefits to offer as well as their willingness to give back to the community.
good,"I actually liked this company, it taught me a lot of terms on how to deal with high end clients. I really enjoyed coming to work everyday even when it was slow. The discount was great as well along with parks for working for the company."
good,"I have had some great experiences at Nordstrom that have only helped grow my skills and advance my career. There are long days and working holidays are necessary, but it is a good start on a career."
good,"I was a commissions shoe Dog, I worked in the shoes department.   I love the constant competition.   It requires you to be driven and focus.   I loved it"
good,As a manager I learned that the most valuable of skills are excellent customer service. It teaches you to listen to the person and to put them first. Their experience with you creates their relationship with the company.
good,"Fun  Fast paced workplace, with a nice welcoming feel, friendly people and helpful coworkers. From working here I was able to reap the benefits of working as a team here and when we do we flourish."
good,"Great store to work at, people work together as a team, great location.  Good benefits and good company to work for.  Great managers.  Fun, friendly and helpful."
good,"I start my morning with cleaning shelves, racks and floor. Set up fragrance, bags, belts, and speaker display. By the time stoor open, I've everything neatly set up for the customers."
good,10 hours a day 6 days a week pay is awesome but you have no life your 1 day off you are so wore out all you do is sleep the quota of pieces per hour are too high at 200 pieces an hour some days you reach the goal some days you do not breaks are 10 min no lunch just two 10 min breaks the bosses are good people fellow employees are ok if you work here be ready to work a lot big paycheck no social life
good,"Great position, but the technical work is being transitioned to an outside entity and my position was eliminated."
good,"Fun and great atmosphere to be in when we were fully staffed and had hours available to cover our floor. With lots of room to grow with many departments to choose from. Because of the variety, there's often  change in management and we're often having to change standards in day to day operations. I still find things that I enjoy in every shift, there's always something new to learn and new products to see. Interesting days aren't hard to come by."
good,Great place for those who are passionate about fashion. The greatest part of the job is contributing to the success of one of the leading luxury fashion retailers. Workplace culture is supportive.
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom depends on what time of the year it is.  During the busy times, it is busy but that makes the day go by fast. I learned how to multi-task and truly take care of the customer. Nordstrom has a great workplace culture, they try to hear what the employees want out of their jobs.  The hardest part of the job is during the busy season, there is not much of a work live balance if you want to do well at your job.  The most enjoyable part of the job has to be the people.  Great people work at Nordstrom."
good,"I enjoyed working here, although it was a very slow business. We constantly had pressure to meet certain goals even when retail was failing to online. It was very tough to keep up with but it was a healthy challenge that I was able to fairly meet most months."
good,Nordstrom has a good culture for customers. It is very good for customer because they dont have return policy. It means you can return whatever you wear or not.
good,"I learned to work with a team that works on commission. I love my co-workers. A typical day included doing daily tasks when you arrive, then you are allowed to sell. Before you go to lunch you have to perform a ""closing"" task."
good,"It was fun to work here and meet a variety of employees, the hours were pretty good and not too stressful. It was very nice having an employee discount, and constantly being valued by management."
good,"It was a great place to work, and I met some amazing people. I felt a lot of growth at this job. The most consistent complaint all of the employees had was about the return policy. The customers returned everything"
good,I enjoyed getting a look on the inside of Nordstrom and the fashion industry. It was a great experience working with experienced people. We did a lot of training to help with future jobs.
good,It's great if you are getting into fashion but I would not say it pays enough to pay the bills. Management is very supportive and knows how to motive their team.
good,I have worked with great managers and very poor ones. They really determine the work flow and general moral of the environment. Scheduling can be a bit inconsistent which can deter people.
good,Nordstrom has a long storied culture. It has any passionate employees and a great training program. I felt empowered to anything the customer needed. Beautiful stores as well.
good,Nordstrom was a great Comapny to work for but things started changing in the retail world. These days many people shop on line so it was difficult to compete with that.
good,"Greeting Customers as soon as they walk into the department, directing the customer to product, Product knowledge, letting the customer know exactly how the product works and which is best to fit there needs. Money handling and accountability, keeping the department neat and tidy at all times. Maximizing sales, calling customers to let them know about the new merchandise we have or sales coming up."
good,"Management has favorites and don't always pay attention to the dress codes of most employees. Good pay, but not good breaks at all, not enough time to walk all the way to break room and get your proper break. Benefits are awesome though."
good,very friendly and cultural environment. Great People and family oriented. stress free work place. great management skills and customer friendly. enjoyable job.
good,The atmosphere is very fast paced over at Nordstrom Rack. You really have to be on your Ps and Qs in order to meet the needs of customers. While working for the company i was able to learn about different aspects of customer service and what it takes to truly satisfy a customer.
good,The culture at Nordstrom is something I will always use when I become a manager. The morning rallies were the best part especially on holiday weekends. Sales just wasn't for me but if it was the commission structure and benefits of working at Nordstrom are wonderful. It's important to know the managers are interested in meeting daily goals but are interested in your development as well.
good,Definitely a great job if you are interested in fashion and working with people 24/7. Nordstrom is a great company as whole and even their customers are great.
good,This role would be great for someone in high school or finishing college. You get a pretty good discount and interact with a lot of cool  people. Having Nordstrom on your resume will also open doors for other roles with teams/companies looking for exceptional customer service skills.
good,I don't have much to say let alone anything at all. It's a good place to work with good people. Some days can be harder than others. Follow directions and stay true to yourself is key to success here.
good,The staff I worked with was friendly enough to assist me with what I needed to know. Would have been nice to get a better chance to get to know management but seeing that I was only there for the season there wasn't too much communication.
good,"Working at the eBar was a great place to learn about 3rd wave coffee culture. There are many times where baristas are asked to do taste testings, calibrate the espresso machine, and try new methods of brewing. The work culture was open and allowed for an employee to use their best judgement when it came to customer service, which I thought was an interesting take on company policy. The job wasn't challenging, but in the service industry its obvious that you must be able to handle customer complaints, request, and questions. My favorite part of the job was the people I got to work with and the food."
good,working at nordstrom could be fun and stressful at the same time. there were times were customers didn't understand English and it was hard to communicate with them.You had to make sure they wrote down on paper what they was looking for in order to help them. nordstrom is a great company to work for.
good,"I found that working at Nordstrom was a great place for me to start off my retail experience. They are very thorough in their training and make sure that you have all the knowledge and resources to do your job well, and to be able to take the skills you acquired and transfer them to other jobs."
good,"Enjoyed working as a commissioned sales associate. It was a fun and highly motivating job. The management was overall pretty good, though I wasn't a fan of HR. But who is..."
good,Great company to work for. The commission is awesome if you are good with customer service and finding what your customer is looking for. Feels like a family working there.
good,"Enjoyed working as a commissioned sales associate. It was a fun and highly motivating job. The management was overall pretty good, though I wasn't a fan of HR. But who is..."
good,Great company to work for. The commission is awesome if you are good with customer service and finding what your customer is looking for. Feels like a family working there.
good,This is a great company to work for and can pay well because it is based out of commission. they take care of you with benefits and can work fulltime to part time hours
good,"Laid back work environment mostly, Up to date on culinary skills if that's your career plan. Cooperate chef is awesome. Executive chef timely professional and fun."
good,"Sometimes it feels like you're getting thrown under the bus at the customers behest. Holidays were particularly stressful, even though the company tries their best to make it less so."
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work if your have a nice and motivated manager. My old GM was motivated however she was not employee friendly meaning she would demean her employees and make people not want to work to their fullest capacity. However our DMs were nice and supportive. There should be more of that motivation going on.
good,"I enjoyed working for the Nordstrom Cafe. The management was understanding and reasonable and it was an overall great place to work. I met a lot of wonderful people in my employment capacity with this company. It is a shame that the particular location I worked at has closed down. Orientation is very professional and informative, management is willing to be flexible with scheduling, and the online portal access to all your hours, benefits status, and what is going on in the company is a wonderful tool."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for. Above average compensation for retail sales, great networking with upscale clientele, and on the job training in lots of relevant fields including luxury fashion, high end cosmetics, and retail business trends."
good,"I worked at Nordstrom part-time sales associate all through college, and because of I was paid commission, I was able to earn way more than I ever could through a part-time hourly job. You hit the jackpot during the holidays! However, business is really slow during the months of January through March."
good,"Typical Day - Overseeing the buying/merchandise distribution process of replenishment items for 90+ locations."
good,"Workplace culture - Good and healthy workplace."
good,"I loved nordstrom. If you are serious about your job you can make some great money. The company values are really good. General store manager very friendly but department managers are terrible, not all but most."
good,"Great people, very supportive and always doing the best to help out"
good,"Sales jobs are commission only, so when it's busy, the pay is good. However, slow times of year and large returns can sometimes result in wildly inconsistent paychecks. Benefits and opportunities for advancement are good."
good,Learned my best customer service skills in this company. Great health benefits and retirement plans. Great career  opportunities for those who commit.
good,"They promote from with in, great benefits, friendly but lack professional level discretion almost across the board and get tied up on petty issues. This applies to all but one manager at my current location."
good,Productive and enjoyable place to work with forward thinking culture and a serious sense to fight the status quo. Great place for young professionals.
good,Great company to work for.  I just feel like the retail business has made a generational move towards online shopping so sales associate commission numbers have decreased.  This is why i feel it is time to branch out to a new field
good,"Great Training"
good,Was a great place to work for and build personal and professional relationships with. No one day was the same and you always had to be prepared to handle a new situation tactfully. Lots of room for advancement if that is what you are seeking.
good,"Typical work day goes like this. Get to work park on the third floor of the prating lot. Then you have to use your access code to get inside, then go to your department and clock in. Greet every guest when they pass by. Usually just stand t the cash wrap waiting fora  return or a salesperson needs help ring in people up. I also manage the cash wrap when its not busy and making sure nothing is left on, like the go backs. Also making sure everything returned or put back is resealable or not. Cleaning and organizing are very essential to this job."
good,"Had a great time at Nordstrom, enjoyed the environment and atmosphere of the company. Nordstrom could give their employees more information on how to grow. Have a program for people to go through but seems some what old school to me and several coworkers. Management should try to get to know their employees better. For the company that gives their employees so much authority, at least on the sales floor, it is some what contradicting to have upper store management not even introduce or acknowledge themselves to the sales associates."
good,"It was a pleasure to work for Nordstrom, each day was what you made it. If you are competitive driven then you will go far. Your performance is measured strictly by numbers."
good,"I loved working at Nordstrom doing cosmetics and interacting with new people every day. I learned a lot from my co-workers as well as my clients. Being able to put makeup on clients was my favorite part, especially the result I got afterwards."
good,"I started with Nordstrom in Dallas and it was a Dream job. Everything was perfect: management, compensation, culture, etc. I was promoted quickly and eventually wanted to try something new in a different region. I chose the NE. Bad decision. Completely different caliber of people and culture. Just terrible. It broke my fervor for the company and my career within it. Had I chose a different region I would have probably been an employee for life."
good,"* Welcoming work environment "
good,"Fast paced and focused on selling and moving products. Driven to meet daily sales quotas but also help each customer find everything that they came in to shop for. Most of the teams are really friendly and helpful but it can get really busy during sales and on weekends. This is mostly a good thing unless you are first starting out with no experience, but they do a good job preparing you for what you have to deal with."
good,"I had a great time working at Nordstrom...I was actually at the Rack and I had a great time. I worked in both Accessories and Service Experience. I liked being on the floor and assisting people with making selections or giving advice on what would be better for them. But in Service experience, I liked having the constant interaction with customers while checking them out. Yes there were challenges, but overall, it was great working with other individuals who were goal driven and encouraging."
good,"Great coworkers, high expectation. Very focused on customer service what is understandable. Also have good benefits. They should change return policy because customers take advantage."
good,"Great place to work at, the clients are very nice. If you're going to school they can help you organize your schedule so you will be able to come to work whenever you can. Great management, work environment and parking. The only thing is I would increase pay compensation."
good,"The Management at Nordstrom is phenomenal. They have an ""Open Door"" policy that allows anyone that works within the company to talk to an Manager for whatever reason, whether it be positive or a concern. They are also very helpful in helping each other strive and help work with each other towards the company's goals."
good,"Everyday was high energy, you had to be on your toes to be prepared for what ever is to come. In a kitchen, there was a high demand for production. I learned how to immerse myself in the culture around me being supportive and all about what the company has to offer. Working with others wasn't always easy because not everyone has the same vision. The hardest thing was having all that responsibility on my shoulders alone. In the end that was worked out and working along side others as they can give aid, made the entire job much easier. The most enjoyable part was being proactive and reaching for success."
good,"Nordstrom is a very established premium retail company based in Seattle Washington.   Very open and friendly workplace with  room for advancement depending on one's desires and abilities.   Compensation, healthcare, 401K,  employee stock purchases, are good."
good,Worked there for 19 years.  Nordstrom recognizes people's potential to be leaders based on their performance rather than there education or background.
good,"Assisting Customers, working with department manager, educating employee's, processing and maintain accuracy of the safe and register funds. Safe working environment with supportive managers."
good,I f you like to sell then you will love working there. It is a very sales driven atmosphere. The sale people can be sharks and they will go through you to make a sale.
good,"Management motivates and you pushes you to work hard, great work environment. Friendly atmosphere with great customers. Always wanting you to go the extra mile"
good,"Very interesting fun place to work,. early days, and early nights out. Not your everyday restaurant operation. Hard to fill 8 hours of work for the day."
good,"Nordstrom I can tell strives to hire people who are easy going and are open minded to working with a range of diverse groups. The one thing I love about working at Nordstrom is how diverse it is and how different departments still mingle together. "
good,"The environment was definitely very encouraging and professional."
good,"Nice location, small store with personal feel."
good,"Love the company, the culture of the company, easy opportunities to grow within the company. Nordstrom really makes sure there employees are knowledge and make it a comfortable work experience."
good,"My co-workers are all unique and awesome people and the quality of Nordstrom's product is exceptional, but the management likes to play games and have a clear bias when making decisions."
good,good work environment with great management. learned how critical team work is in the workplace by working together with co workers
good,"A typical day for me would start at 1pm and end around 10pm and sometimes 10:30pm depending on the season. Working for Nordstrom Rack taught me everything I needed to know as it relates to retail. My hiring manager was AWESOME! he taught me the ropes  of the business. With his training, I was number one in sales in my second week of employment, and TOP SALES PERSON (credit/debit accounts) for several months. I was so sad when my hiring manager was transferred to another store out of state."
good,"A day in the life of working at Nordstrom is coming into a bright atmosphere. You sit next to your peers and can get help when needed. The benefits are great for the most part, and have an okay 401K plan. The most enjoyable part was being around positive people, They had a site up just for Nordstrom Employees that allowed us to view all resources, procedures, and had good communication on changes."
good,"A typical day at work was making sure we assisted our customers with whatever they needed, and making sure they left our store satisfied. I learned more about the products we carried in our store and how to do other things associated with alterations. Management wasn't the best. They were too busy gossiping instead of being leaders and actually weren't productive. Not all of the managers were like this but majority of them were, because they were very young and immature. As well as working in a commission selling environment it gets pretty competitive and as well as sharky, if not careful your co-workers would steal your sale. Hardest part was dealing with difficult customers who wanted an arm and a leg. Most enjoyable part of my job was coming to work and dressing any way I would like, I feel like fashion is a form of self expression so being able to wear whatever I wanted was pretty cool. And I would say being able to style the customers."
good,"Atypical day at work begins with making sure the product on the floor can be easily shopped. Dusting, sizing and merchandising are daily activities. Managers work closely with the team and there is a camaraderie that makes for a comfortable work atmosphere. As customers arrive, we take turns addressing their needs and servicing them. The hardest part of the day are the quiet times when there is no business/ customers coming in, but we utilize that time for follow up. the most enjoyable part of the day is being able to help someone and have them say how pleased and satisfied they are with my service."
good,"Everyday at work is different. I will work with new people and new product while trying to maintain sales and floor presentation. the job itself has given me distinct skills such as; customer relationships, sales and time management, daily organizations of customer follow-ups and purchase history, the ability to appeal to each customers needs and style preferences and i also learned how to lead other employees and direct them when it was needed. The people i work with are all awesome. They are all generally really good people that i will definitely stay in contact with. The hardest part of the job is the slow months, after Christmas and after new years. i really enjoy working with people and making them happy. I love the fact that i get to meet people from all parts of life and create a relationship with them."
good,"In my department, our manager liked us to run our own businesses. We were not micro managed. When we came into work we were in charge of following up with our customers and setting appointments for them to come in and shop. We would set up dressing rooms full of merchandise for our customers specific needs and wants. It was really up to you to establish relationships with the customers and follow up with them to keep them coming back to shop with you. For me personally, i love styling looks so seeing happy clients put on outfits i had chosen for them was very rewarding. It was especially rewarding when they would have never picked out the look for themselves."
good,nordstrom has a great culture that presents great customer service. . Just like any sales job it is what have you done for me lately but the difference is that they will work with you to help you improve
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom consists of greeting guest, menu knowledge up-selling and suggestive selling. Taking orders and cashing guests out. Making salads and pizzas."
good,"I worked at Nordstrom for 8 years, it was a great and unique experience. Being in the Special Events department I was able to see retail from a different light (setting up and executing shopping events/meetings). I enjoyed my time working there."
good,"I learned a lot about bank regulations,"
good,"self motivating environment. sales associates rewarded with special gifts based upon sales and effort. A typical day at work would be making appointments, and helping every customer that comes your way as best as possible."
good,"I've enjoyed working with the company, and have been fortunate to move fast.  The biggest disappointment is the lack of communication and inconsistent management styles that make it difficult to adapt and move forward from position to position."
good,"Nordstrom was a very fun place to work. The management is great, the rewards are enticing, and the atmosphere is overall amazing. The retail schedule can be draining, otherwise I'd still be there!"

good,"Nordstrom was a very fun place to work. The management is great, the rewards are enticing, and the atmosphere is overall amazing. The retail schedule can be draining, otherwise I'd still be there!"
good,"I've been here about 4 months now, and Nordstrom is the only retail I think I could work. The customers you work with are a higher class than most stores, the sales teams all seem to be pretty awesome (mine is) and management has been really helpful at helping me learn and sell better."
good,we were always busy throughout the holidays that was one thing I loved about working here but other then that we weren't often too busy. Everyone seemed to always compete with each other since it was commission. I loved getting to know every shoe so when I had a customer I had no doubts about giving them a shoe that fit them best.
good,"Everyday is usually spent making a clean and clutter free work environment for our customers, assisting our customers with new merchandise and any questions about becoming loyal customers, and also helping my team create great service skills. The company has great opportunities to move up in the business and is very rewarding when it comes to meeting new people and putting your best foot forward. There is a lot of hard work involved, however, with hard work, comes recognition and opportunities to move quickly throughout the company."
good,"Walking into Nordstrom for the begin of a work day, you feel liberated. You are there to meet new people and create relationships with customers, merchants, buyers and co-workers. It's not always about the sell by what you can do for that customer. Your greeted by the staff with words of encouragement and smiles. That's what makes a person feel real good about work for a company like Nordstrom."
good,"Typical day at work usually consists of phone calls or emailing customers to come in for monthly events, writing thank you notes to clients who you feel made and impact on you or vice versa or sitting customers down ""in your chair"" and inviting them to a free makeover in hopes that they'll buy product from you. I like to consider that educating the customer on makeup application and why I chose those particular products for them. I have learned quite a bit when it comes to makeup application due to the continued education you receive from the brand you work for and how to give the best customer service. The hardest part of the job was having event, after event, after event. It never seemed to end and the amount of phone calls we had to make to bring customers into these events were starting to feel harassed. Most enjoyable part of the job was coming in inspired everyday and staying ahead in the fashion trends."
good,Great environment to learn management skills. Company values customer service. Company also encourages individuality and fashion forwardness.
good,"Perfect place to start your career and learn from their renowned customer service. Co-workers here are a blast, they make the day fly by."
good,"If you know what you are doing you will be good."
good,Great company to work; plenty of oppurtunities to get promoted. Hardest part is reaching sales goals. overall experience was great!
good,"I really enjoyed learning about what happens when you order something from online. I always though is was this simple process but its not. Its a lot of people receiving your order, scrambling to get a hold of those pieces, making sure the customer will be happy! Customer happiness is always number 1!"
good,"I enjoyed working at Nordstrom while it lasted. The biggest problem I had was management, they can make or break a really good company. Typically a fun environment, but a lot of competition in sales, so that is something you need to be prepared for."
good,Some days it would be slow but I just tried to keep myself occupied. I loved my manager there! Had some difficult customers but I could handle it. I enjoyed the sales and new merchandise coming in.
good,"Great company to work for. Managers and co-workers are working toward a common goal, and the work culture cultivated a very friendly environment."
good,a typical day was always helping people. i enjoyed all my co workers. a big negative is the management. they dont listen to anything you have to say and are never there for you.
good,"Great company to work for if your looking to advance quickly. Work/life balance needs improvement. Great benefits, especially 401k match."
good,"Team work is a major priority to achieving the satisfaction the customer has come to expect from the company.  Can be hectic or slow depending on the time of year.  There are endless possibilities to learning every position even managerial roles if under the right personnel.  Can be very rewarding and even trying at times when working with many personalities in a big company, but overall a great place to work."
good,"My experience with Nordstrom, i had a wonderful colleagues who uplifted me with work. My managers were sweet they never hesitate to help me out on any task"
good,very fun and enjoyable place to work. Although it was my first job out of college I was able to make very good financial gains at times more than I make currently with 3 years of banking experience under my belt.
good,"Working in the Women's Shoes Department was a great experience and gave me the opportunity to learn how the Retail Business works, and the Knowledge necessary to run an effective business."
good,A typical day at work usually consists of talking to customers and selling different items. Friendly customer service and patience is always provided to its fullest extent.
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for. Building your own clientele is the most important thing if you want to have good paychecks.
good,Nice place to work with a lot of employees so you will always have help. The store stays busy and I enjoy helping the customers. I get along with all my co-workers. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with certain customers that may have attitudes or are unfriendly. I enjoy working here.
good,"Walk in positive with a positive attitude, attitude is big part of starting off your day and how it can effect people."
good,"I believe that Nordstrom has allowed me to consider a serious career within the company. In general, the company is keen on providing excellent customer service which is applicable to any company, especially in retail. They inspire you to consider growth within the company and offer great benefits and opportunity."
good,"A typical work day, like any other is met with various challenges that require the expertise acquired through training in order to effectively, and diligently meet the needs of our guests."
good,"learned a lot of management skills and able to work in any environment with in a team or individually."
good,"Typical day consisted keep the department floor clean, helping customer to find what they need, and answer their question for my best knowledge. I learned how to communicate with customers who lost their temper. Management was OK. Nice coworkers. The hardest part is to keep the sale floor clean all the time. The most enjoyable part is you see all kinds of people, the way they shop, etc."
good,"Nordstrom operates in a way that ensures promotion from within the company. It is a tenet that is exhibited every single day. The company is very fluid and management will definitely encourage to move up if they see potential in you. If you ask for something, you will receive it. Being a personal stylist/salesperson at Nordstrom is challenging, yet rewarding. It is a commission-based environment. In almost all departments, you do not receive a base hourly on top of your commission. "
good,There are many vendors and avenues to go down when working inside of Nordstrom. The career path possibilities are endless. Great variety of careers in store as well as corporate.
good,"Nordstroms is a great place to work if you love fashion and a retail lifestyle.  Lifestyle meaning working every weekend, and retail hours closing one night late and opening next morning.  If you have a family you will miss out on a lot.  Some days you make a lot of money because its strictly commission and other days you can work and lose money because of returns.  Great people working with and sometimes fun environment, but you all will struggle if you have a lot of bills to manage as I did. You won,t make a lot of money but if your young or live it home or single (no family) Great starting job though and resume builder and you learn a lot of sales skills and info on designers etc."
good,"Loss prevention with Nordstrom is fun and exciting, and has you looking forward to coming to work. The only drawback is you are constantly second guessing your every move because one slip up can cost you your job."
good,Overall it's what you'd expect from a commissioned work environment. It's much easier to work at Nordstrom than Bloomingdales due to less stress. If you're looking for a retail job the I suggest working here.
good,"Nordstrom goes above and beyond for their customers, and the same mostly applies for its employees. I worked in a full commission environment so motivation, product knowledge, and sales skills are KEY."
good,I love my job. The company is great. If you want to grow within the retail industry this is the place to go. Great place to go and learn how to build relationships with people.
good,Nordstrom rack was overall a wonderful learning experience. They tested my customer service skills impeccably. Each day i endured a new task with a different approach to meet my goals.
good,Its a good job to have for anyone who wants to work sales with a customer service approach. you learn to service different types of individuals and make fashion calls on their attire if needed. The opportunity is there to move up the company like to hire from inside first.
good,"Nordstrom will always be known for two assets that make the company: competitive prices and most importantly the customer service. The foundation of Nordstrom is built to ensure satisfaction and happiness among the employee and customer interpersonal communication everyday. Being a rover gives me the ability to learn and work all front end and back end positions that gives the job diversity and fun within the work environment. The environment and people at Nordstrom are friendly and are treated like family which makes the job easier and enjoyable. Management are very motivational and try to inspire the employees to do and be more of themselves. If I had to choose the hardest part of the job, I would say selling as much rewards. There is a monthly quota and it is harder to achieve when working on the sales floor rather than the cashiers. In all I enjoy the people and eco friendly company."
good,"Nordstrom was a great place to learn the ropes of business. I learned very much from nordstrom due to their extensive training and management training programs. This is a great place to work if you don't mind giving up weekends and sometimes holidays. I had many friends/co-workers from nordstrom that I remain in contact with today. The most enjoyable part of this job was the clients. It was so rewarding when a client would come in and look for you without even speaking to anyone else, it meant that I really did my job well and made an impression the first time. With the good does come the bad, nordstrom does expect you to dedicate a large portion of your life to them which is hard if you have a personal life."
good,Nordstrom is a fun fast paced place to work you learn a lot in any role. my co-workers are amazing a lot of events its all about the customers and making sure we are always providing them the best experience possible while shopping in our store.
good,Good company to work for. Co workers are like family. Nordstrom culture is dedicated to customer service. Good opportunity for advancement if you are mobile.
good,"A typical consists of styling, and serving the customers.The hardest part was competing against other employees. I gained great friends from working at this job, and was exposed to a large variety of clothing."
good,"It was a good experience at work there. It was not a fast paced work environment, but great to work in between a bunch of professional and fun-loving people. People who love to help and support each other and care for others.  a serious work place where people do their   expected job and more having fun at work."
good,A good company to work for but their stores are going through a very big change and it can get political
good,"Great for working with kids. Go from grading papers to instructing students or simply helping students with math and reading. Co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with along with the boss. Repeat the same task everyday and it's a very still job that doesn't require very much labor, just skill."
good,The company is great but the job was not for me.  Had to be too pushy when selling.  The company values and products though are outstanding.
good,"Great company, Self motivation because you work on a commission base pay scale. Fun environment and great team of individual's to for."
good,"A typical day at work is always busy, especially around the holidays, what I  learned is that sales is always important as well as the costumer the costumer is always first. Management at the time was not good. The hardest part of the job was memorizing everything single part of every menu, the co workers were always helpful and worked as a team.and the most enjoyable was meeting new costumers."
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work with many growth opportunities. It's a place you can be creative, drive business, and make what you want of it- there's no cap to how much you want to make or where you want to take your career.  The people and culture is truly what makes the company what it is."
good,"Many successful internal and external investigations and closed cases reducing the loss overall for the Partridge Creek Store, also responsible for Emergency Response and overall store safety."
good,"I have worked in several positions for Nordstrom, so a typical day at work is different from one job to the next. For my most current position as a Customer Service Specialist, I answer customer phone calls for 7.5 hours a day. I start early, 5:05am PST and have to be ""on"" from that time until I punch out at 1:35pm. The customer is at the heart of every decision that is made and it is my goal to help every customer to the best of my ability. I love my co-workers. We help each other with questions usually via Office Communicator. The hardest part of my job is when there is a service failure such as no longer having an item in stock or the item cancels off of a person's order and we are not able to find a replacement. The most enjoyable part of my job is hearing a customer say how much they love Nordstrom."
good,"Nordstrom boasts superior benefits and quality of life. However, for the ambitious restaurateur, there is little room for growth and creative business strategies. They operate on the philosophy that you should not attempt to attract new business so that there will be room for shoppers to dine."
good,It was always a different day. We had celebrities in and out so it was a busy work place. The hardest was always not knowing what to expect but i learned to work under pressure.
good,"Great Company - Typical day at work was always busy.  You need to be a people person and outgoing, or you will not excel in any role with Nordstrom.  Nordstrom is all about customer service, and you will be interacting with so many people on a daily basis."
good,"Working at Nordstrom is a great job that is based off commission. This being said, there can be days with little customers where upselling is essential or there are days where I am constantly on the move. I am never bored standing there with nothing to do. "
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for, they offer great benefits and the working environment is fun for the most part. I don't feel as though they work to help you move up, it is definitely dependent on how willing you are to push for advancement. The sales goals are realistic, but sometimes you aren't able to exceed them purely because of the amount of store traffic, however this may vary by department, I am just referring to the kids wear department. While it is fun being able to have some control over what you will earn on your paychecks, it is tough having to potentially step on others toes to get what you want. Overall Nordstrom is a great company to work for and the products they sell are always top of the line and in style, which makes it makes them fun and easy to sell."
good,The money isnt what its cracked up to be and the return policy is a joke
good,"great rewards for enrolling customers in loyalty programs."
good,The money isnt what its cracked up to be and the return policy is a joke
good,"great rewards for enrolling customers in loyalty programs."
good,"Hard work pays off, customer is # 1 priority, need to listen & be direct.  You are the expert! Competitive environment, long last friendships."
good,"As a day within Nordstrom Rack, fast pace yet good daily thinking job. "
good,This is a warehouse setting with a fast paced teamwork environment. The department that I was in was packing. I had to collect items from a chute and match them to packslips. I would them pack them in boxes and send them on the line to be sent to shipping.
good,"Merchandised the floor every morning and made sure we were ready for business. Delegated to the team what needed to be done and any follow ups that needed to get to from the day before. Called customers on an hourly basis inviting them to come back to shop with us or simply talking about their experience. Always talked about what will be happening next in the company regarding sales and opportunities to save while shopping with us. We are a company who loves to take care of their customers and strive for bigger and better things. We make sure that we take great care of our customers and always involve the best service ever. At times, there was not enough hours in the day to service everyone and working on commission wasn't always the best thing since we had to constantly meet goals and expectations."
good,"Nordstrom Is known to be the best as far as customer service and while working there mos of the emphasis was always on the customer. I truly, I enjoyed this aspect of my job and would always find ways to make connections with people. My co-workers were all very different individuals but we were a close knit group who consistently helped each other. The most enjoyable part of the job was the concept of providing something for my customer that made them feel happy and comfortable about themselves."
good,Great place to work. People oriented company. Company provides excellent opportunities for advancement.
good,"Nordstrom Rack is a great place to work because it is service minded.  The managers are servant leaders and have an open-door policy.  If you are looking for a fun, very-fast paced environment, and enjoy fashion at a value....this is the place for you."
good,"Each day at Nordstrom you had to learn your sales goal & obtain it while balancing customers, stock, returns, appointments etc. Management was always one step away if ever you needed their assistance. I learned it is always better to ask than to rely on yourself to figure out how to solve a problem & it is a team effort. The hardest part of working at Nordstrom was leaving my scheduled shift on time! I worked in the cosmetics department & it was highly enjoyable & when you build a relationship with your client time flies! There is always so much to do when you work at a counter a prestigious one at that. The most enjoyable thing about the job was coming in to do it everyday; I enjoy being apart of the beauty industry & all it has to offer."
good,"Typical day at work is standing on the sales floor, and making sure each customer is being greeted and helped out with anything and everything. I have learned more about customer service, and day to day retail sales. Management of the store is great, and each individual department manager varies. The hardest part of the job is being commission only, and making the same consistent pay check. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that you work with, and engage with every single day."
good,"-Pick up alterations"
good,Very easy to work with. Two stressful times of the year that cause staff to fight to be lighthearted
good,"Taking appointments and following up with customers. "
good,as long as your committed to selling you will get fair in this company
good,Benefits are great and the culture is great. Management plays favorites alot but as long as you get your stuff done all is well
good,"Very good enviornment, manangement can have its ups and downs, but overall good place to grow and learn. While meeting great people"
good,"Employees are the best part of the job, everyone is very social and friendly."
good,"Like working here, management and co-workers are really helpful and easy to get along with. Environment is amazing, and customers are usually really pleasant too."
good,"I enjoy the company I work for and the position I hold. I love my job I just can't afford to keep doing it. When its good its great but when its bad is awful. There is potential to make it here. If I were financial stable and could afford the bad times I'd work through it, but I need employment that would be more beneficial to everyday financial situations."
good,The job was fun. Management was all over the place. There were way to many people trying to be boss and bark orders around.
good,"Daily morning parties... we listen to music and go over the store's numbers. The departments that had the best numbers are recognized and celebrated. Sometimes there are free snacks during this morning event but, there is always free cold water which I enjoyed."
good,It is a pleasure to work there. Management really focuses on creating team unity will also having us compete for top sales associate. The hardest part is trying to prevent fraud while still providing great customer service. I have learned to say no to unreasonable requests without coming off as rude or unhelpful. The most enjoyable part of the job comes from providing a customer with a great shopping experience and helping them get just what they needed in a fun and welcoming environment.
good,I will come in to work and always get greeted by my co-workers. After I clock in and go to my department and talk to the department manger I find out what projects need to be completed or new ones to be started. I always have a good time engaging with customers and helping them find what they need. Working at Nordstrom is very enjoyable and always keeps me busy.
good,"This job was perfect for me! Lots of challenges and the responsibilities were diverse, which I always respond well to. "
good,Great experience in retail. Relationship based culture that helps develop a customer base and also helps with business management skills
good,"I was brought back to MAC Cosmetics to work for them within Nordstroms. Being that I have already worked for MAC at Macy's HSQ the job was fairly easy going in."
good,"I truly enjoyed this job, we had a great team and helped each other all of the time.  The pace was fast, dynamic and stressfull.  My favorite part was to work with the clients, I can say there was a hardest part of the job but it was on your feet and sometimes tiring."
good,"Daily duties consists of vacuuming carpets, buffing floors, cleaning mirrors and rest rooms also picking up trash. I have learned to use various cleaning machines. Management is good but can improve on better communication.Good co worker fun and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job i would have to say is cleaning two floors of the store by myself when they're multiple calls out of work. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my team everyone is friendly and easy to get alone with."
good,"Fast paced work environment, exciting exposed kitchen, menu changes and additions frequently, management very helpful and understanding regarding any work or personal issues (time-off requests etc.)."
good,"There is always something that needs to be done to update and maintain the appearance of the store.  The store is a high end retailer and I have to make sure that the store is always presentable, clean, and comfortable for the customers.  The Air Conditioners and Heating units must be functioning properly at all times.  I enjoy fixing issues as they arise."
good,"No job is perfect, no manager is perfect, but these managers are at least humane. Great pay and commission if you hustle!"
good,"I had a great time at Nordstorm. I had learn so much about being patient,and better listener."
good,"A typical day at work required me to be aware of the new products that were merchandised in each department, as well as the daily and monthly numbers, to ensure I reached my sales goal. Following up with previous clients as well as staying active on the sales floor, balancing previous and current client relations. "
good,Nordstrom is a fun and great company. The environment is welcoming and coworkers are great to work with
good,"Nordstrom was a great company to work for, as it supported its staff in a setting based on old-fashioned family business practicum. The 'upside down pyramid' is desirable in any corporate environment, while customer service is the most important aspect of the business structure. This shaping of priorities amongst all within the infrastructure leads to unique learning opportunities while gaining knowledge of business ideals and tactics."
good,"They are flexible if you are in school, overall a good working environment"
good,"A typical day at work involves:"
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is seeing satisfied customers share their shopping experience with me.
good,"A typical day at work involves:"
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is seeing satisfied customers share their shopping experience with me.
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for.  You can easily challenge yourself and they demand excellence.  I work with great people and my current Store Manager is excellent.  She supports me and my departments that I currently oversee."
good,A typical day at work would involve greeting customers and selling them clothing and custom suits while maintaining a high level of customer service.  The company puts a very high value on customer service which has helped me to become a better sales person.  The most difficult part of the job is the slow times of year.  I am much happier being busy while at work.  Management is very supportive and helps you to succeed.  I work with a great team of co-workers who are driven and ambitious.  I enjoy making relationships with customers and providing the best service possible.
good,Learned a lot about how to take care of your personal customers
good,"-Helped manager re-merchandise the floor."
good,Definitely an environment where you are on the move. A typical day includes working with customers and assisting them with decision making through product education and showing them out of the box options. Its great to have a working knowledge of trends in your given area as well as a general understanding of the store as a whole. The hardest part of the job would be the sometimes extensive hours during peak times and then the fluctuations in pay during the slow times. A great rapport with your clients is a great way to keep them happy and your pay steady. Build relationships!
good,works well with customers to keep the Nordstrom good name. Several avenues to get things done.
good,Nordstrom was a competitive sales environment that kept me on my toes in a very positive way. The most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with customers in order to meet their needs. This taught me social skills and multi-tasking.
good,"Nordstrom is not your average clothing store to work for. It is almost equivalent to a corporate environment with style. I enjoy working for Nordstrom however, you can only make so much money in a retail setting depending upon which department. However, to make what you want, you must be a person who loves to sell, sell, sell. Benefits are great! They even have their own credit union. So if you are an employee and need an account, it is available without the additional fees all the large banks charge. Overall I think Nordstrom is a great company to work for."
good,"Training classes are amazing, a lot of learning and investment to their employees."
good,"Assiting to customer needs. distributing merchandise and helping sales associates. Learned the process of making a sale and how to handle customers. Hardest part, epected to be in too many places at once by too many people. Most enjoyable:always on your feet!"
good,Sold customers shoes and kept the floor clean and organized and opened accounts
good,I am happy to be part of a wonderful company like nordstrom who is known for its customer service.
good,"1. Interacting with people and making relationship."
good,The hardest part of my job is going to lunch and leaving on time.  I enjoy what I do every day as a Certifed Fitter my job is to my a change in each woman life that I come in contact with.  I want to make her fill like a new person.  Over the years I've learned that if you have a passion for something you will give it your all.
good,"A typical day would including calling customers to set appointments for sales and new product launches. Most sales at Nordstrom don't happen by accident, every associate is actively working on a book of business and building relationships to make their numbers. Co-workers are usually really awesome unless it's anniversary sale, in which case you're too busy to have much time for anything besides driving business."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for.  They have a great culture and values which they encourage their employees to embrace.  Their hourly compensation compared to other department stores is reflective of their employees' work.  The more you sell the more you make.  The schedule is the hardest thing as is most other jobs in retail, it is constantly changing.  "
good,"I worked for Nordstrom during holiday season. It was so much fun being able to help families find special gifts for everyone they were shopping for. Managment was great, always suggesting new ideas for how to help the customer more and how to achieve my sales goals. The hardest part was trying to get an idea of who they were shopping for, and I listened to them and it was much easier to find what the customer was looking for. I really enjoyed working for Nordstrom and would recommend it to anyone looking to meet great people and work in a positive, fun and upbeat enviorment."
good,"Nordstrom is a company based on what you put in, it is a very fast paced competitive environment. With their manager program i have learned a lot about leadership and team development. Hardest part of the day is driving business during slow seasons and keeping your team motivated at those times. I enjoy the friendly work environment because it makes you want to put in more for your team."
good,Best job ive had. Great people learned alot about how a business is run
good,"worked there for 3 years... good company to work, benefits, and career development opportunities, great customer service. "
good,"You work with a wide variety of people, some are self-motivators, others are just starting their careers. It is physically demanding and requires a lot of patience as you are interacting with customers and co-workers all day."
good,"Loved working here. Amazing people. If you love fashion, this is the place to start"
good,"I've worked for Nordstrom for the last 8 years off and on. Its a great place to work if you're a student or don't mind working every weekend and long hours. At the Rack stores its very easy to be promoted. But at the full-line its all about who you know. The hardest part of the job is constantly cleaning up after disrespectful customers and having to returning anything they throw on your register. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with, very fun and interesting folks. Nordstrom is a multi million dollar company and can only offer its associates a 20% discount and managers 33%. I think that's a bit inconsiderate for all of the hard work and slaving that most employees do. But if you don't mind working weekends and are not concerned about personal life and relationships go for it. Just remember if you work at the regular Nordstrom its strictly commissioned based and if someone returns an item it comes out of your check!!"
good,"Great company to work for, mainly if you are a fashion major and would like to work hard to become a regional merchandiser or buyer and willing to move a lot around the US. You have great days and have really bad days, sales wise. The harder you work the more you make, it is all about building relationships."
good,"Routine is foreign as a Visual Stylist at Nordstrom. There is never a dull moment and from when you clock in for the day until you clock out; it's non-stop. I am responsible for the merchandising, visual presentation, mannequin/form styling, fixture placement, and lighting for 15 departments with in the Nordstrom Store. I work closely with the department managers to ensure their floors are in pristine shape and coach employees who do not understand what that means."
good,"It's a nice store, always busy and employees care bout the customers"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was learning different task and duties as I go along with training. Co-workers are easy to talk to.
good,"Grew with the company from sales associate all the way into corporate offices. Fun work environment, supportive management, and great work/life balance IF you're in the corporate offices. Any positions that are store related, be prepared to log long work hours."
good,"every single day learn something, i like follow the recipies for make a perfec job"
good,"Working for Infosys Ltd. and serving in the Nordstrom account offers a great deal of exposure into the Fashion Retail Industry. There is a great amount of learnability every day. At Prod Support we solve issues varying from petite to really critical ones, but every step offers a new kind of knowledge. Although the project forever keeps you on the toes, but team-members still find time to celebrate events and birthdays and plan and execute fun-filled outings."
good,Increase business by 12% or more daily and monthly.
good,my review overall is theat Nordstroms was a very nice place to work for the people was very friendly and i give them 4 stars overall.
good,"Nordstrom is by far the best retail environment I have ever worked it. The pay is great and benefits are nice also. If you have a desire to become a manager, this company is great about promoting within."
good,"Its all about survival of the fittest. Some days are better than others, but u have to push through the grain to be successful. This is what I love most about it! There is always something to do and look forward to. As an intern we touched the tip of the iceberg in many areas, so no day was the same but a different learning experience. From interacting with customers on the sales floor, to building relationships and forming clients to production operation management inventory, are just a few duties to help prepare for leadership roles."
good,Nordstrom's is a good company. They offer full benifits and the staff is always frendly.
good,A typical day at Nordstroms included convincing customers to buy products. With this job I learned how to be persuasive. Management was a plus because he broke the work schedule up evenly and fairly. The hardest part of the job is trying to sell something and the customer declines. My co workers were not that friendly because it is almost as if you are in competition with each other. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sales and fashion shows or special events we participate in.
good,Everybody is very friendly and professional great sales force !
good,"Nordstrom Rack taught me how to manage chaos. It was a very busy store and takes a lot of patience to work in such an environment. A typical's day of work consisted of cleaning and sizing racks. This consisted of fitting room work, along with helping customers. My co-workers were the best part of my job, very fun and loving environment. Management was extremely nice & understanding of employees needs."

good,"Working at Nordstrom I got to enhance my customer service skills along with my selling skills. A typical day of work consisted of getting the customers needs met. Therefore, this included side tasks of organization within departments. The hardest part of my job was getting large amounts of returns. The most enjoyable part of my job was communicating and learning about the many different types of people."
good,"Nordstrom was a very high class clothing store. while I worked at Nordstrom, I'd met alot of stars professional singers and as well as ball players. And I loved working with my co-workers."
good,"If one has to work retail, I am convinced this is the best place to do it. This is a culture of empowerment, where individual employees are encouraged to do whatever they feel is best for the customer."
good,"A typical day was to do some paper work first and then be on the sales floor helping our customers. I learned new sales strategies such as follow up with my customers on a computer program that they used. I also Learned all the High End designers biography. About my managers I can say that they were very patient willing to help and teach us how to make plans to reach our goals. I worked with fun and respectful people, we were like family.The hardest part of the job: I didn't find anything hard. And for the most enjoyable part of the job I would say the satisfying customers."

good,"What I learned from Nordstrom are some many things that have taken me through life to always expect the best. Expect the best in customer service, the best in products, the best in people, the best in my surroundings and the best in how I should be treated as a person."
good,Awesome place to start a career and to continue if wanting to stay in retail environment.
good,Begin each morning with stockwork and merchandising. Turn on all computers and open wrap stands. Store meeting to discuss focus and plan for the day. Open the store greet every customer. you work as a personal shopper selling your customer all items available in the store.The management team is very supportive.The co-workers really respect each other we help each other sale merchandise.The hardest part of the job is you must stay current continue to educate yourself on all the newest trends. You are really thanked for a job well done.
good,unpack and process merchandise accurately positive interaction with management and co-workers the physical part of the job is the hardest getting rewarded and shown appreciation is the most enjoyable
good,Forward-thinking.
good,"A typical day would consists of looking out for all new merchandise and signing off on the manifest. You also check up on all the customers who have bought merchandise from the past few days. Then of course keeping the department looking amazing, by organizing and cleaning. I have learned about all different designers and how to be more independent. My favorite part of the job would be meeting all the great people."
good,Each morning I check the numbers and reports from the previous day/week. Based on what's selling or not selling I communicate with the Regional Merchandiser and Buyers. Then I put out the new merchandise and re-work the floor based on the sell through. Provide the best customer service to each customer that comes into the department.
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work if you want to work your way up. But with the staff that have worked together longer, they get kind of clique-ish"
good,I loved working for the company. There were a few setbacks but they weren't with the Nordstrom company or brand. I only left because my husband and I are planning a move and a transfer wasnt readily available. They are an at will company so if I ever wanted to reapply I have the opportunity to. Overall I was very Pleased with my time there.
good,I absolutely love working for Nordstrom but unfortunately I am moving to Tarrant county and will have to soon transition into a new workplace closer to home.
good,"Commission based job, so the money is good when business is good. I live in the Bronx so travel is a big issue for me because I dont drive. In order to excel in this company you have to experience both The Rack and the Full line store. Great benefits, great opportunities"
good,There was a strong sense of team morale. Mobility within the company was highly encouraged; management is knowledgeable and well-trained to deal with internal conflicts.
good,It was a decent work experience a good company very strict for sure with lots of video cameras and gated lots of security with metal detectors with gate pass entry parking
good,I enjoyed my time working for this company. The employees were generally warm and caring people. Management was hit or miss. It felt many times that management wouldn't roll up their sleeves and help out the team when needed most.  Holidays are tough and it's difficult to get a consistent schedule. I worked on commission and could never guarantee how much money I was bringing home. However they had wonderful benefits and discount programs.
good,Extra bucks for your gadgets; Temporary while searching a fulfilling job; Work well so you may received Nordy Bucks; Friendly staff; Overtime are available on busy holiday.
good,It was a great opportunity to interact with different people and learned a lot about customer service. I learned to adapt in fast-paced work environment.
good,"The work environment at Nordstrom is really nice and healthy. The management is pretty good, too. In a nutshell, Nordstrom is a great place to work for because it promotes diversity."
good,"the break room is designed for us to relax, we have two actual couches "
good,The person who has been there the longest get most of the benefits and hour boost before the people who wasn't there so long. And getting over time is really rare in that company. And you have to work 1000 hours to gain PTO.
good,"I worked at the eBar, which is a more upscale coffee shop. This means you will learn finer details of the science of coffee, and if you're interested in that kind of thing, then this would work out."
good,Nordstrom is a great company for individuals starting their working career. The hours are flexible and if you are a student they are willing to work with your class schedule.
good,"I moved but I enjoyed working for the company, lots of open-friendly people relaxed atmosphere but also encouraged hard work and prioritizations, If anything I thought the managers were slightly younger and had certain outlooks that maybe some of the older employees that were underneath them didn't agree with and that caused a little bit of issues but I think that varies location to location still had a great time would work for them again"
good,"You must be able to not take things personally when you are helping frustrated customers. Schedule is flexible and management is very helpful. Some people aren't as motivated as others, but if you keep your motivation, you will stand out to management for your hard work & dedication"
good,"It was very interesting to work there because I learned a lot and picked up many more skills. This was a totally different job than I am used to doing at schools. Overall, great place to work."
good,"One of my favorite jobs to this day. It was competitive, but you learn a lot. Everyone works as a team, and communication is key in this work environment. You learn to become a great sales representative."
good,"every-time i would clock in for work, they would always be so warm and welcoming. it definitely set the tone for the work day. They are very open to learning possibilities and very responsive to certain situations"
good,"Styling at Nordstrom beachwood opened my eyes to the american fashion market, as I only had experience in other countries abroad (England, France, Asia). I was able to understand the minimalist perspective of the American consumer with a twist of popular trends in terms of fit and design. My close work with the manager and the visuals team helped me understand the reality of retail and the need to constantly revive the store with new concepts and ideas."
good,"I have learned a great deal about customer service and the benefits it does for a person. While working here, I also was reaffirmed about the belief of when you look good, you feel good, so you do good. Therefore, I try to always look my best and allow my service skills to do the rest."
good,"I love to work in this friendly environment, and eager to work with all friendly and helpful employees in this company.  I've also learned lots during the past year"

good,"Good benefits, strong management, fun work environment, good customer focused culture. Pay is good from commission. Flexible hours and managers work with employees"
good,A wonderful place to work. It is exciting working with so many different brands and departments. It is also very customer facing. The environment is energetic place and fast-paced.
good,Overall easy job could get busy but all in all good place to work. Good co workers lots of room for advancement too. You can move to different departments as well
good,"The team that I overlooked was a great team to work with. I’m thankful for the opportunities and the experience that Nordstrom has to offer. Upper management had some issues, but overall helpful."
good,Fast and Loud Place. I've learned a little more about production. Everyone works on there own. No one will offer Help. But I Love what I do so I manage to learn quick and get my job done.
good,"Each day at Nordstrom you are set out to build meaningful relationships with customers to help them find items they need, or may not even know they need."
good,Productive and fun place to work. There are many things I can say about my previous workplace but most important is I am so glad that I work for the company that respects people and provides a high quality of customer service.
good,"Very good company to work for, it was a very nice environment and place to go to everyday. They have a lot of benefits which one can take advantage of."
good,"While I worked there it seems pretty good.  The job wasn't to stressful, while being somewhat busy most days.  All of the co workers while being there were also nice."
good,Every one I worked with are very accommodating and helpful. They share their knowledge and strategy to help you out make a sale. They treat you as a family.
good,I loved working here over the summer. It was really fun and a great experience for someone who didn't know how to sell. It taught me a lot about selling tips and stuff like that. The week of training was amazing and so informative. The only thing that I didn't like was that I got the most hours out of everyone despite being the new girl.
good,I would strongly recommend trying job opportunity with Nordstrom they are really good company. To work for as well as they provide a relaxing work environment.
good,Easily manageable with life.  Management is very friendly and works hard to ensure that employees are happy.  The company has a great mission and always goes out of the way to make sure customers are happy.
good,Nordtstrom has a face paced environment that offers on the job training for sales and management positions. It has built in programs and progression that creates opportunities for it's employees to grow within the company.
good,"Great people, great workplace, and fast-paced work environment. Management was great. My favorite part of the job was sales and helping people buy certain outfits for numerous events; this is something great to utilize when you are in the fitting room."
good,if you are willing to work hard it is great.  commission is good.  benefits great.  stock is awesome.  probably the best in the retail business.  they only hire from within so there is great growth potential.
good,"I have been with the Vacaville Rack since it opened 2 years ago (October 2017).  It was a great learning experience to help get the store set up and ready to open to the public.  During my 2 years with the company I have been responsible for markdowns (merchandise price changes) on a monthly basis for each department (some of the larger departments occur twice per month).  I have also assisted with stock support (getting freight ready for the sales floor), sizing merchandise (making sure merchandise is in the correct location and presentable to customers), assisting customers in the fitting rooms, filling merchandise on the sales floor, and assisting with physical inventory (at the Vacaville Rack, as well as the Rack in Sacramento and Concord).  As a merchandise support associate, I typically work 5 days per week with a typical shift 6AM-10AM (before the store opens to the public).  During store markdowns the shifts can be as early as 4AM for larger departments.  The hardest part of the job is the same as most retail with employees leaving the company (or transferring to another store) and new employees coming into the store throughout the year.  The merchandise support team generally consists of 10 part-time associates, though we have gone through a period of months with only 5 team members (currently we have a team of 9 associates).  The most enjoyable part of the job is that there is flexibility in our schedules, in regards to work/life balance.  I have always been granted the time off that I need, whether I have requested the time off in advance or due to an unforeseen rare"
good,I love Nordstrom. Great company. Start young and you are able to build a career. Great benefits. Wonderful work environment. Need to be able to move if you want to advance
good,"Pretty basic warehouse stuff, above average pay and incentive for productivity. As a processor you can make a couple hundred bucks a check if you are fast and have good quality. If you have a good attitude and show up you will enjoy. Find what department suits you best. Great pay if you don’t have a degree. Most people that complain about the job are slow, bad quality workers who don’t want to work hard for their money."
good,"Nordstrom, inc. provides  takes great care of it's employees. I gained a lot of customer service experience, professionalism in dealing with people from different backgrounds."
good,Great work environment.  Fair working conditions. Great company overall.  Wish I didn't have to leave.  Good benefits available to employees.  Would work their again
good,"I enjoy working in cosmetics. The atmosphere and the people are great. Management is easy going, supportive and positive. The bad thing are the hours. You can never go over your hours and if you don't make your line assign you will most likely have your hours cut. The cosmetics floor is open sale, so all associates are free to sell any line and everything is commission based."
good,"a good place to work but the commission base can be really challenging."
good,Everyone was very helpful and polite. Worked well together in a competitive environment. My department was not as competitive therefore we adapted well together.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Nordstrom the people were nice, the work was fun and the hours were fine. Would have preferred to work more hours but they weren’t being offered"
good,At Nordstrom we use to work in a relaxed and safe environment where each co-worker care about each other with the team spirit.it is a real great place to work except the seasonal issue
good,Nordstrom holds a very high standard in Quality Customer Service. It's a great place to devolop great workplace habits. A good leader who can help you build your strenghts is the key to success here.
good,"Nordstrom culture promotes inclusion and fairness.  Ensuring employee feels heard and valued. In turn, employees want to extend this brand of culture to customers through exceptional customer service."
good,Last chance gave me the opportunity to grow and advance in the sales associates position. I gained much needed training and real world experience. I appreciate them for the job.
good,Great job for flexibility and job difficulty being low. Great place for a good discount and most coworkers are very nice and understanding. Not a bad job at all for a high school or college student.
good,Shoes is pretty demanding and tiring since you are walking so much but is great since you make commission. Make a lot of money during sales time when it is busy.
good,Nordstrom was a great place to work. I learned a lot about retail sales and the work environment was enjoyable. In-house HR can definitely be improved though.
good,Nordstrom is definitely not the place to work if you want to expect the same thing every day. Days can range from really slow or disappointing to super productive and rewarding when helping people.
good,Overall a great experience and workplace I enjoyed their cleanliness finding farmers were very easy to find and the customer service was wonderful  and the staff is helpful everystep of the way.
good,"Through my time at Nordstrom I have gained many different skill sets that I did not possess or have experience in prior. I have had great direct management in all of the roles that I have been a part of. Workplace culture is definitely team dependent, you treat others the way you wish to be treated and the moral remains high. In my position currently, I am tasked with selling, but also finding solutions to customer issues, and making sure the floor is merchandised properly and remains clean."
good,"Commission or draw job, meaning no ceiling or floor.  Most clients and customers are friendly and willing to listen and make purchases, propelling your hourly rate.  Commission structure is pretty fair, but the 80/20 rule of sales definitely applies here in the brick and mortar retail stores as well.  Most people do pretty well and enjoy working on a hustle commission based salary, selling high end fashion was actually fairly easy, and you find yourself getting more and more passionate about what your'e selling."
good,Overall a good experience. Pay increases as well as time off are the best benefits. Downsides were increasing changed schedule as new management shift towards making numbers at the expense of productivity.
good,Nordstrom was a great company to work for. Supportive of career growth and succeeding in your role. Learned management skills and sales. I recommend working here.
good,"I enjoyed the company culture.  Management was great and I always felt like they had your back if they knew that you worked hard and were proficient."
good,"Excellent opportunity, with great opportunities to grow and explore different roles and departments within the company with the support of your team and leadership."
good,Nordstrom allows you to step outside of your comfort zone and learn more about yourself through style. It's a fun yet professional atmosphere. You gain great relationships and clientele.
good,"There was a time when all was well and going to shop at any  brick and mortar store meant something. Times have changed and to be the best you have to be agile. Same with here, but agile with who you know not what you know."
good,They have fair compensation and a friendly work atmosphere. They really talk about how they like to promote from within the company so if you put in the time and effort you could see the fruits of your labor.
good,Working here was enlightening to see how fashion is sold and processed from start to finish. Team work and zoning in on tasks were elements that I and others enjoyed.
good,"Great way to learn about Customer service, great management team and coworkers. Enjoy working at the Bellevue location and helping the customers. The store had great selection items."
good,Overall it's a good environment and good pay with great benefits. The downside is you have to SAVE your money when working overtime because they do have slow seasons.
good,A really nice place learn to live in that I live in Eilat Sinaloa I will recommend this place anytime any moment fast passes luxury location limitless.
good,"Awesome job good experience would love to go back, a good company to work for, I got the chance to engage with awesome people in my experience of selling shoes in the women's shoe department"
good,"This year Nordstrom had introduced a new process in their summer internship program giving an opportunity for the interns to work in all departments of the store. It helped in getting a holistic view of the functioning of the store. The HR and company culture is warm, friendly and open. Feedbacks were encouraged and they made sure the interns get a good experience."
good,"Again loved writing my check,like the change of seasons which brought on new styles & types of shoes.Competition was extremely motivating,loved the challenge of making our sale goals."
good,"Nordstrom was a great place to work great managment  fun place to work but also very stressful especially the loss prevention part of the job."
good,Just do your job and you can avoid a lot of unnecessary issues. Nordstrom has a very nice working environment that is extremely smooth and cultural. One must make sure they want this type of job or interest can definitely be lost.
good,Discounts are low for sales jobs. Only 20%. It can be caddy at times between departments since you can sell in any area even though hired for 1 area. Scheduling is relatively flexible but you have to work 1 weekend shift.

good,"I get used to punch on time, then I start working doing picking during the first hours, then stop for a first break and then continue with the picking until the lead or supervisor let me know to go for packing and start packing single and multiples items, according the customers order accurately, efficiently and effectively according the company procedures and maintained all established company production rates, company quality and safety requirements/programs"
good,"getting to film their clothing line was an interesting side of marketing, both this their approach to stills and then the approach to motion. Id work with this company again"
good,"Great company to work for, management could use work. Service is the back bone of the company and this is where you get your bases for success. The only issue comes when management shifts. But the company as a whole is top notch."
good,Salary was great! My coworkers were amazing and I still keep in touch with my managers today. The only downside is meeting sales goals started to get tough as the amount of clients coming in lessened.
good,"The management is great, I had a great time working there. They are there to help you and answer any questions you may have. They are also very flexible with hours."
good,"Not for a person who wants to take beauty education seriously not much growth as far as education , Never the less if placed in the right location with the right leadership you can grow tremendously"
good,"if you are willing to work under pressure and challenge your self this is a place for you. I learned a lot how to manage stress level and stay calm in difficult situations related to customers. Very diverse people from different cultures is fun to work with and learned from them. Learned a lot about latest fashion and style, and become a vise shopper."
good,A friendly culture that allows for advancement. While there is support from your managers the path to advance in the system is very rigid and pay raises are based solely on time worked as opposed to skills and training.
good,Love working for a great company. Work life balance is key and they have it . Great salary and great people to work with. not stressful at all. Good company
good,"The atmosphere was open and welcoming coworkers were a big positive as where the benefits however not a whole lot of opportunities for advancement after doing cash room, sales and customer service I felt as if I had reached my limit unless I wanted to spend years waiting for new opportunities"
good,Fun people to work with and fun customers. A great environment. Management could improve but there are still many exceptional managers. Sales season can be very stressful and busy with long hours for those in backroom and high volume on sales floor.
good,"Working there is on a commission basis. If you’re good at sales and are into fashion, then it’s a great company to work for. I’d recommend Nordstrom as a place to work."
good,Very good place to work the work is pretty easy and the hours and pay are great theres always an opportunity to move up in the company if you work for it. The other employees and management are all understading and patient  when training new employees
good,Great atmosphere and workplace to surround yourself with customers and team employees. Every day is a new day to learn and engage with brands and clients.
good,"Nordstrom is very well known for how they treat their customers, and sales associates are well trained on how to communicate and assist shoppers, diners, and clients with what they need. Managers are professional, helpful, and very friendly! Overall, I believe that Nordstrom has been an excellent resume booster!"
good,A great workplace with lots of work opportunities. Management could've been better in the sense that they weren't all on the same page with managing their sections a certain way. Some managers had very high expectations for employees to meet their sales goals every single day.
good,"It’s a good job if you’re looking to work in retail. The hours are flexible and the managers are easy to work with. You make your own paycheck depending on how much you sell (usually). Overall I was happy with my"
good,It was a lowkey job as a salesperson.  You had a lot of freedom. Didn't like having to actually sell stuff because I'm not good at sales. A lot of nice fashion forward people.
good,a great place to work on my customer service skills in an environment that fostered healthy competition amongst its employees. Management was helpful and focused.
good,Mostly made sure the whole vicinity was cleaned and proper. all electrical appliances were check up and tuned. Checked with all sections in the store and made sure all everything was working properly.
good,Typical workday could consist of departmental training that empowers you with product knowledge for the clients. Management is pleasant and the workplace culture is customers first. The hardest part of the job is working nights and weekend. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping clients. Nordstrom has some of the best clients to service.
good,very cool job to have wouldn't spend more than a few years there not a whole lot of room for employee development. However it is a very safe and complete work environment.
good,"Great discounts, quarterly raises, 8 hr shifts (1hr lunch), health insurance, awesome benefits etc.. Job is fast paced and very competitive when it comes to credit cards."
good,Nordstrom's was a fun place to work at I had enough things to do good salary good employees and all its was the distance to the job site the mangers picking favorites and not caring when necessary
good,It is what you make of it. Come to work ready to perform. There are some advancement opportunities but you might have to switch jobs within the company or relocate.
good,it is a fun job but it very fast paced as well as always on your feet so it is a must to wear comfortable shoes. you will be trying to compete with other employees to makes as much sells as possible.
good,"It was fun, everyone got along. Did not really care for the politics. Learned how to make a lot of new food items. The menu changed oftten. Became familiar with restaurant opening procedures."
good,"great pay, but they limit the hours you work. I was paid good but they only scheduled me for one day a week. So I had to quit. I am an adult with responsibilities so it couldn't work."
good,It is really competitive  environment  that it's certainly not suited for everyone. The compensation it's fair to a point. Do expect some level of stress. Lots of high stake cosmetic events.
good,My time spent with this company was valuable to me. I believe many of my skills were developed when I was an employee there. It was truly a launching pad for my present.
good,good company to work for. the brick motor aspect is going away and by 2020 will be online based. great company if your part of the logistics team now .
good,good job. ill say the only bad thing about it is that you only get 2 15 minute breaks and if you want to take a lunch youll have to make it up at the end of your shift
good,A typical day at work would consist of making sure the floor is stocked with enough product so that the customers will have a variety to choose from..
good,"During my four years with Nordstrom, my initial goal was to get some management experience under my belt. I started as a seasonal employee and was able to advance to an assistant management role within two years Then after another year I applied for a promotion to an Assistant Department Manager role at a full line store, where I earned a (small) salary plus commission, so earning potential.varied depending on the time of year (summer and winter holidays are the highest). A company-wide restructure dissolved my position along with many others in the same role, resulting in my ultimate departure from Nordstrom, but I am grateful for my experience and the skills I learned while working there."
good,Working at Nordstrom was great. I had a baby and driving to Seattle became difficult as I was only there part time. If I lived closer and would probably still be working there a few hours a week.
good,"Returns are horrible for sales people, because of the policy. Commission can be really good, flexible hours and stress free environment. Managers for the most part are great"
good,I had a great learning experience. Just didnt really ike working for commision.  Managers were great and very helpful. I did like the discount though.
good,Great beginners experience. Many new skills were learned that are able to be developed and taken to future jobs. The managers were incredibly helpful and encouraging.
good,"A typical day at work would be constant multitasking, what I learned within this company is to be a good people person. The most enjoyable part in working with this company was the regulars who would shop in our location, you really get to personalize their shop!"
good,You have to be a sociable person and be able to make the connection with clients. Its a commission based environment so you make your own paycheck. The more people you get to interact with the more money.
good,great people IT can be boring. changes in management made things difficult at first but a great overall experience.  I highly recommend working here if you are looking for IT work
good,"great environment, room for improvement and growth. An awesome culture and experience. Would recommend anyone who has passion for running or cycling. Great people."
good,"Great place to work, many opportunities for advancement. Recent changes in the company have caused stress and insecurity around employees. overall a great place to work."
good,"Nordstrom culture was great , the people and environment were family like. The location i worked at didnt generate a heavy flow of traffic for sales. that was the only reason i left."
good,"Great company, great benefits , good fashion tips to take along the way , its not really for everyone unless u like the fashion industry.\"
good,Nordstrom is a good place to work if you are a full time employee. They offer great benefits and flexible work schedule but compensation is based on straight commission.
good,The typical work day at Nordstrom's is very fast paced. I've learned how to work as a team player. The management team is there for questions and resolving issues. The culture is secluded and the hardest part is the lifting of boxes. The most enjoyable aspect of he job is seeing your hard work in the matter of the number of items/ boxed you've take care of by the end of the day.
good,They will focus on customer service. Making their customers happyix their number one goal. Life long friendships. Great kickstart into the fashion industry.
good,The job itself was easy and my coworkers were helpful and friendly the majority of the time. As a student having flexible hours was needed and I felt I was given that accessibility
good,Harmony Hyundai was a great company to work for based on their attention to detail with solving employee/ customer concern. I performed tasks such as driving customer to and from their residence and detailing customers cars.
good,"i loved working for nordstrom. i learned so much while working with this company. the managment was awesome, had some disagreements but nothing too hard to handle."
good,Very easy to work here- they care a lot about their employees and their customers.  Meetings every morning (with a DJ) that go over department and personal accomplishments.  Very supportive environment.
good,Nice company to work for. If you wok hard and take care of the customer you will go far. The company believes the customer is the most important and will support you to make the customer happy.
good,A typical day at work would include a fast paced environment. Our team worked very close and had a good team work ethic. The hardest part of this job would most likely be remembering all the deals and awards we had available to our guests. However the best part of this job is the sense of satisfaction you receive from helping customers everyday.
good,"good place, great team work, great management, love coming to work. you enjoy what you are doing, keeping up with trends. Easy to develop customer relationships."
good,"a fast pace environment."
good,"Good benefits, environment and management. Nordstrom genuinely cares about their employees, they are ever changing to stay with modern trend and this is why they're the only department store still thriving in our current economy."
good,"Lots of opportunities, managers are great and they pump you up to sell. Staff is helpful and provides you with all the training needed to succeed in your everyday job."
good,Worked part-time while I had a full-time job. Many of the employees hired were young and this was their first job. Management was the same. Young and immature.
good,I can not speak to the sales aspect of Nordstrom but being part of a support department is very much a cool experience. My manager is very reasonable and hours are pretty flexible until holiday season or during the Anniversary sale.
good,"good place to work, very laid back, room for advancement, all the people were happy to help when you needed, lot of ways to make money with overtime if you needed it."
good,Lots of laughs and strong friendships!   Hard work pays off in great commissions.  Good benefits too!  Late night hours can be tough...and all weekends...so family life suffers a bit.
good,"During my time with Nordstrom , I thoroughly enjoyed my experience working with the company. Management was always fair and understanding. My coworkers were friendly and enthusiastic which made working for the company alot fun."
good,"Nordstrom has strong company culture and passionate customer service. Everyone here is very nice. "
good,I love working for Nordstrom it was a great place and environment. Everyone was nice and also you had a couple of bad seed come through every now and then.
good,"I was only really there for the anniversary sale. I am not the kind of person who can handle being yelled at by customers everyday. If you can, it's definitely worth the money."
good,"Great company to work for. They do put associates first."
good,good fun and learn experience helping people is always a good thing at Nordstrom is an environment to grow management are always willing to teach u and guide you.
good,"I learned a lot at my time at Nordstrom and it was honestly the best job I’ve ever had. They have the best company culture I’ve ever seen and they pride themselves I finding great management and passionate employees who push the agenda, work hard and help them move into higher positions. Great training, great benefits, and a lot to learn!"
good,"You learn a lot about core of industry."
good,Nordstrom has always had a special place in my heart. The people were great and advancement potential was available. Management was great at working with their employees but communication through different sectors was not consistent. A very creative place to work where could could own your business and be successful.
good,"Taught me how to build connections and contacts. Also helped me with my people skills and other things such as first impressions, working with different kinds of people and temperaments. Gave me responsibilities such as taking care of my department, making sure everything is in order, etc."
good,"Nordstrom was a solid place to work at however some of the policies really do minimize the maximum potential for commission."
good,"Great culture, learned how to manage money along with own business. Great place to network express yourself and fashions. Help people make their experience enjoyable."
good,very goal oriented.  Always a new project to work on to improve the company.  The IT departments and mail room are all super helpful with whatever you need.
good,Competitive paced atmosphere motivates employees to push past their comfort zones. Nordstrom rewards the hard workers qith generous incentives and recognition.
good,"The benefits and RRSP contributions are great; the work-life balance is quite good, especially with 5 sick days and 2 personal days a year. It has quite a good culture of promoting from within and I met several people that had worked for the company of upwards of 15 years. It was one of my first forays into the retail industry and on the whole it was very positive and I would recommend working there. It tends to be a fun, creative, and supportive place to work and three of my four bosses I had there were terrific."
good,Fun place to work and meet new people the work you love doing is what make the job great. New shipments almost every day working with new and exciting people
good,Great fast paced environment but no room to grow in my department.Pay could be a lot better  and the employee appreciation overall could be a lot better.
good,January is a slow month for them but normally we work a lot of overtime hours anywhere from 50-60 hours a week. The staff and coworkers are pretty nice also.
good,I liked the job because it was never too much of a work load but at the same time you couldn't slack or slow up because it was a consistent pace. there were 2 15 minute breaks but barley enough time to eat.
good,it was an ok company loved the benefits but to hard on employee to make sales. have to compete with everyone for a sale that in the end would be returned and commission taken away.
good,Was a great environment to work in enjoyed  my time there. The people are great the employees are awesome. You build your career here at nordstrom. Take time to get to know the costumers.
good,"I had a great experience working at Nordstrom, but working retail hours can be difficult to maintain long term.  I have great memories and enjoyed my time there."
good,A fantastic company with many opportunities to receive compensation through discounts or other prizes. Down side is the rewards turn the employees into cut throats.
good,It was a fast pace environment. I got a chance to work with good people daily. A good company to learn alot about fashion. A very fun place to work day in and day out.
good,Nordstrom is a nice place to work. They really care about their employees and customers. Benefits are great and the employee discount for managers is pretty nice as well. Nordstrom promotes from within 99% of the time but if you're an outside hire like myself into a manager role it takes some time to get used to the Nordstrom culture but once you do that you're golden.
good,Fun job that you get to help people and connect with a lot of customers. It is very fast paced and typically I would come home from work exhausted because the shifts are long and you are constantly going. Management is great they help you with everything you need.
good,I clocked in at 3pm and then checked to see where I would be working that day. I got my radio and RF and picked the items that were communicated to me through my RF. I liked being able to work by myself but could still ask questions to my coworkers around me. I liked having a goal to shoot for and being able to see my work shown to me in a statistical way. I would have my 10 minute break at 5:45pm and would leave for the day at 7pm. Because i was only part time and seasonal I did not get to experience any of the benefits that were offered.
good,"Get my schedule for day , start my shift , learned new ways of shipping , good management , good work place  and i enjoy working there .I hope to go back there and work again. , i wish i got enough hours . I worked there as a seasonal worker ."
good,This job is super fun and I made some of my best friends working here. I learned a lot about sales and working hard in this role. Truly the only down falls are the physical work (as you are carrying a lot and constantly up and down on your knees) and that this job is 100% commission based. You earn what you work for.
good,Ok place to work. very strict regarding customer service. you would work in a retail environment. you would need to meet a sales quota every month. Management is ok.
good,"Nordstrom is truly a great place to work. You pretty much make your own paycheck. the more you sell the more you make, however the down side is the returns effect you, which sometimes it isn't fair since they have a pretty liberal policy. A customer can return something they damaged and it effects you. The environment can be tense and stressful sometimes since it is commissioned only pay. However, they do have great benefits."
good,"A typical day at work consists of measuring children's feet and provide knowledge of shoes. Provide excellent customer service was the main goal. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with children. Nordstrom provides opportunity to its employees by moving up to management position. However, Nordstrom concentrates too much on customer experience training on the managers, and not enough training on how to deal with a team and merchandise."
good,"Employees were great to work with, customers were always nice. Welcoming environment as well as cleanliness. Constant change in the job helped give more knowledge about company and merchandise."
good,"Typical day, go in at 6am out by 2pm. quick and slow pace due to work load for the day. i enjoyed working on the dock area and in the shipping and receiving."
good,If you enjoy retail and able to juggle multiple high maintenence customers at once this is definitely the place for you! Lots of room for growth! Great company to start a career.
good,"Great if you are able to put in 40 hours a week, can be overwhelming for students. Hard work ethic is a must to excel in such a competitive environment"
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work if sales and fashion is your thing! You have to hustle for your pay and it can be pretty competitive but it's a great environment.
good,Great place to work with amazing co-workers. Work can be fast paced but will become easy the more you work. Learned how to use rf devices and scanners.
good,"Very fast paced environment and many long days. "
good,"Went through an extensive training regiment for 3 months. On average going through 22 different systems and 2 monitors on a daily basis. Had to analyze multiple customers financial history to approve of deny credit.  Make payments, customer service, as well as analyzing sales pertaining to certain departments on a daily basis. Many meetings as a business center and departments."
good,"If you interested in retail, this is a great company to work for.  They really do value their employees.  You don't take your work home so it is a great work/life balance.  The only con is working mandatory 7 days or 12 hours during the holidays and Anniversary season.  Also the point system should be abolished.  If you get a certain amount of points due to be absent no matter if it is an emergency like a snowstorm."
good,"Working as a seasonal sales did help me improve my customer service skills and as well as people's skills. My day-to-day consist of greeting customers, interacting with them, and cashiering."
good,"Great place to work, many people make a career of retail sales there.  People are friendly and helpful.  It has been years since I worked there as a manager but it gave me a great foundation for my career"
good,I have learned alot . great customer service. not too much pressure at work. not crazy shifts or over 8 hours a day working.  I was more self-directed. they are open to any new idea and let you decide how to manage your counter.
good,"-learned how to deal with all different types of customers"
good,Housekeeping was paid fairly and it was a good job for the time being.  Management was good as well I wouldnt have left if I didnt relocate.  Otherwise I would of stayed
good,"The cafe I worked in was a training cafe for managers, so lots of turnover and adapting to newly learned management styles. Human resources was by the book."
good,the job didn't really require a bunch from me other than to stand at the door. A bunch of services that are required for me to do my job were always not working so it was always a struggle to do some admin stuff.
good,"More times than not, you will be very busy; especially on weekends. Stay focused on giving excellent service, SELLING, be yourself and have a lot of fun!"
good,"Nordstrom the company is a great place to work, but the people that you may work for may not always be the greatest. The people are mostly friendly. You make your own pay check so what you choose to make is what you make. You get to make some really great friends."
good,Nordstrom is focused on investing in tech and moving past physical stores as the main mode of customer engagement.  I enjoyed my time at Nordstrom.  I had a lot of freedom to try new things and was able to make a large impact.
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work, in a market sector gravely challenged by modern shifts in how people consume fashion goods. As one venerable department store line after another has gone under, destroyed by the decline of mall attendance and the spread of online shopping, Nordstrom has boldly invested in visionary new models for retail shopping tech, re-assessing everything from the store model itself to the customer relationship, the nature of shopping, and how people relate to companies via social tech. If any company will thrive in the brave new world of fashion wrought by global markets and online shopping, it will be Nordstrom."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company for the times I was there. Might go back one day. Left to go to school to get my degree in Hospitality Management, and would love to do my shadowing with them."
good,"I worked on clients in my personal Spa Room.  I loved Nordstrom and the clients.  Nordstrom was challenging in that you always wanted to do your best.  Working with a team of dedicated passionate people always made you to want to strive to be a better co-worker, sales associate."
good,the management was very supportive and the atmosphere was encouraging. The people and friends I met along the way have been the best part. I gained invalubale experience working for this company.
good,"Nordstrom is a really awesome work enviroment to be in if you are passionate about awesome customer service, fashion, and determination. It helps you learn a lot of interpersonal people skills. Working based off commission there can occasionally be a real big pain, with Nordstroms relaxed return policy, but none the less you can earn a good amount of money there"
good,Fun atmosphere and collaborative co-workers. I loved working here and I would go back in a heartbeat. The managers I worked with were communicative and diligent with their work.
good,"Great company with an upscale culture. Management is understandable and the sales environment is professional and far from pushy. The commission structure is solid except for a few minor flaws through departments (none for sales in Sugarfina, Order-Pickup, Service Experience due to higher base pay than sales associates). The schedule is typical for retail -- unpredictable and guaranteed to work at least two to three weekends a month. If you're willing to take the pros with the cons and feel that you'd make a good fit for the vibe then by all means I'd recommend the experience."
good,Is very willl organized and focuses on customer service. Management did very well at working with me and my school schedule. They always showed their appreciation for their employees
good,A Typical day at work I am usually go in at 12pm do the lunch rush. We have a busy lunch in our cafe. I do a pre shift with everyone and do kitchen Demo on specials for the week. Training the staff great steps of service. You have to know nordstrom culture of the business. My management skills are very good I usually take charge and delegate on my staff and show them the success way to go.  Nordstrom was a great place to work at. The Hours were great not a usual restaurant hours. The Hours were great. Always out by 8pm every night. Hardest part of my job was dealing with crazy customers. Having a great staff to get things done.
good,"Ok overall"
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work. You are in control of your paycheck since it is commission based. A sales environment can be competitive but the competition was always friendly, since my team members had a lot of integrity towards each other. Management is structured in a upside-down pyramid, meaning that top managers work for their employees, ensuring that they do what they can to make their employees happy. Commission based sales motivated salespeople to give their best customer service, so we were driven by results."
good,"Overall, Nordstorm was a great place to work. I wished Nordstord was located in Kentucky because the web team(logistics) was able to fulfill online orders."
good,Company provides good benefits and has opportunities to grow from within. The work environment really depends on your store manager and location of the store.
good,It was your typical customer service job. I worked with 2 days off but not consecutive. Management was fair. My coworkers were from different states and we were in a chat room while working together.
good,"Great place to work at , always moving around , you gotta make sure you try not to make many mistakes or get points. Since they have a point system every time someone would miss a day they would get a point , if you get a certain amount of points you can get laid off there , also if you make to much errors that could be a problem too because they think your not learning anything"
good,"I use to like work at Nordstrom."
good,"This is the place to work if you are interested in high end fashion and retail. Everyone is friendly, there are plenty of opportunities to grow your career and move into new areas of interest."
good,I learned how to work in a fast pace invironment and meet costumer needs at the same time. We had to meet certain quotas and follow the flow of traffic thru the holiday season.
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for because everyone is very well experienced. There is not a person who cannot answer any of your questions. The managers are all very friendly and approachable. The only down side sometimes, is that they aren't super flexible with your schedule. My manager was amazing and thankfully was very considerate with my schedule, but the rest of the managers are different. In addition, the hiring process needs someone who can devote a majority of their time to Nordstrom. I also do not like the return policy at Nordstrom. We are commission based, and when something is returned, it reflects on our pay. The return policy is that there literally is no return policy. People bring back everything. Very few times, I was able to say unfortunately I cannot return this item. They are very customer service driven, which is not a problem at all because it is retail. However, they don't appreciate their employees enough. They'll  have NPG week where employees will get 40% off Nordstrom brands so you are limited. Also its always after a major sale, and things are sent away to the Rack in which employees cannot purchase until it literally is at the Rack."

good,"Working as a salesperson was always different, interacting with customers and coworkers would change on a daily basis. The aspect of working off of commission pushes you to work your hardest and allows you to earn as much money as you can."
good,"Nordstrom is a wonderful place to work and develop customer service and leadership skills with lots of opportunities for career advancement. The team works well together, developing both professional and interpersonal relationships. There are also competitive benefits, and the ability to create your own career path on a corporate or sales level."
good,"this is a great place to work and learn great customer care skills. you will always meet new and interested people as well. Sometimes, however, the sales floor can get a bit sharky..."
good,"It's retail for minimum wage, but the benefits and discounts are nice and the people at this location are really friendly and fun to work with. Many hours on your feet, some difficult customers can take a long time to deal with, but overall a good experience for part time work"
good,I love working here. Management is great and they work with my schedule. People are very nice and respectful. Very good health benefits. Hardest thing for me is when we have to transition from manager to manager so I can get to their expectations.it take some getting used to But I love it. Its like a challenge for me.
good,Good culture. Great benefits. Working really hard to evolve and is currently evolving. I don't have a lot of complaints except work-life balance. Thats about it
good,"A typical day was cleaning and filling the product in the morning then having a rally in the morning and night then taking care of the customer every time they come into the store making sure that they get greeted. We make sure that the customer feels welcome, because if not they will not want to shop there."
good,"I love the morning rallies that bring the departments together for each  new event and/or season. The rallies at times not only give you a preview of what to expect in the near future, but also can be somewhat of a surprise party for the employees; sending you back to your department with free coffee and snacks."
good,"I have not worked here in a long time so it is difficult for me to give a review. It was a lovely experience, I enjoyed my associates and managers. The hours were normal for retail."
good,"Nordstrom is a good company, I have a lot of friends from Nordstrom. "
good,Nordstrom was a great place to work while I was in college. It gave me the opportunity to have flexible hours that worked with my college schedule and have time to study.
good,People we're great to work with. Management was very Hands-On easy to get to and to have meetings with. Advancement was oftentimes considered for many employees. Relaxed atmosphere. Customer service oriented must have tough skin to deal with customers and ongoing complaints.
good,"Nordstrom uses a great philosophy for developing its employees. I went from sales to Management within 2 years of employment. I learned how to delegate, improved my communication skills, and great service values that I may not find anywhere else."
good,"Depending on the department, you make good money and you get to make connections with coworkers and/or customers. They really focus more on credit cards than they do sales sometimes."
good,Great resource for knowledge and personal growth. I would work for them again. Their maternity leave is not great and their lactation room was insufficient.
good,"I had really enjoyed my time with Nordstrom Fulfillment center. I made good pay for the work we were doing, and the benefits are pretty spectacular. They match 401k, and will also gives increase in their match dependent on the prior year's successes. The HR  and IT department were phenomenal, and operations management was caring, and kept you motivated."
good,Nordstrom has great team work and you work as many hours you want if applicable. They will not send you home unless it is absolutely no work for us to do. I like that they find us other places at the warehouse to work so we can make hours and pay.
good,I learned to place mail orders to different cities as well as communicate stock drops to other Nordstorms. The workplace was very friendly and diverse.
good,"If retail is your thing then you can definitely make a career out of Nordstrom. They promote from within, so there’s always opportunities for advancement."
good,Nordstrom is a good company that is making strides to stay relevant in the modern day world of shopping online. For the most part managers keep your best interest in mind but some of the newer much younger ones can be seen playing favorites.
good,Would go back. I don’t really have any detail other than i learned a lot and loved everyone that worked there. I left for a job opportunity and would definitely go back.
good,The work environment was positive a friendly for not only clients but the internal staff members as well. I chose not to provide any additional responses.
good,I think that I would refer anyone to work here at this company Work here is well put together once u learn wat u have to everything is and will be going great
good,"great place to meet your daily sales goals."
good,"Nordstrom was a serious retail environment that provided employees with the opportunity to move up in the company. A day of work was always busy and optimal customer service was always key. I learned the importance of customer satisfaction and the importance of hard work and organization. The workplace culture was familial and weekly meetings took place where specific employees were acknowledged for their hard work. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships I created with my coworkers, management, and returning customers."
good,"It was very fast paced which I liked because I like to keep busy."
good,"Loved the progressive, keeping with the time culture. Promote from within. Great benefits. Strong leadership in my department. The only reason I left was because I wanted a career change."
good,Nordstrom was a great company to work for. However they lacked in pay for the overall responsibility I was responsible for. Nordstrom was very much about the culture of the business.
good,Nordstrom offers unlimited earning potential for those that chose to embrace the culture and have a talent for sales. It is not a company for those who wish for a relaxed environment or that are not particularly into the sales environment. Great benefits and clear career tracks.
good,"I like the company , I dont like return policy and managers. Some managers dont have any experiences. They dont know what they are doing and they can also sale as a stylist ..."
good,"opportunity for advancement. It can be a fun place depending on where you land. Management is sometimes not up to standards. But other times can be amazing. Very diverse team,Love that about the company"
good,"When I walk into work, I know its time to get to work quick because many people enter and leave the store through out the day. A normal day for me would include heel toeing, sorting shoes, reticketing shoes, helping customers in a timely manner find/buy shoes. Since all our shoes are on the floor, cleaning and finding singles is key so people could continue to buy shoes. I also cash customers out by using a mobile device. My favorite part would have to be interacting with the customers and helping them not only like but love what they buy from our Nordstrom store."
good,When working at the Nordstrom factory it was lots of little things the managers did to help make the employees day fly buy such as: let us use headphones while we work at our stations
good,"pros: good money, great team members, opportunities to work in other departments"
good,Ok place to work. s like any other retail job that you have. Stay motivated and you should be ok. Only thing I would say is the pay rate should change a little bit.
good,"Company focused on providing good customer service"
good,"I loved working with people and assisting them but the managers could get out of hand giving out pro promotions to pets. I did not get promoted until last few years of working . You need to be in a good location in order to make good money,"
good,Good pay and benefits!  Great atmosphere to work in.  Happy to go to work everyday...potential for moving throughout the company.  Coaches give good feedback so you know what you are needing to improve on.
good,"Great company, provided useful skills and knowledge on retail skills, costumer services and etc."
good,"this was a great opportunity for me.  At the time this was one of my very first jobs.  The transition from school to the work force was easy i must say, this company made it easy for me."
good,"Nordstrom's Rack was a positive place to work, the people were friendly, the managers were all so friendly and very helpful and made sure that you understood what you were doing."
good,It’s a good job to have and they give you good benefits. You will meet nice customers and employees at Nordstrom. They will give you flexible work hours.
good,"great staff and great working environment, very upbeat company that loves to work closely with employes and customers. weekly staff meetings, weekly sales updates."
good,Its a fast working job but fun. There is always something to do. you shouldn't have much down time. The people you work with are nice and help you out a lot.
good,Tough changing times for retail - competing with online retail and maintaining margins. Big question whether the firm can transform itself fast enough to grow its online presence and stay relevant.
good,"I worked here for Christmas doing visual merchandising so I was temporary.  It was a nice place, well managed, and clean.  I enjoyed my time here and the emlpoyees I worked with."
good,I love nordstrom so much. But if your young its so hard to get back in after making a rookie mistake. Nordstrom is like the girl that got away. She was perfect but you werent good enough for her.
good,"Great place if you dont have kids, dont celebrate Christmas or have a good support system at home to help with family. Good compensation. Good worker-quick advancement."
good,Typical fast paced work day when work was available. How to prepare items for boxing and shipment. Workplace and atmosphere was relaxed and pleasant and the people were friendly.
good,Amazing company to work for. Wish i had found it sooner. Laid back atmosphere. Excited to be working for Nordstrom. Great Management staff and the most enjoyable part of the day is working with other team members.
good,"Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack are both very fast paced job environments, but easy to pick up and keep up with. The main tasks they ask you to do include signing up customers for the Nordstrom credit card and rewards program. If you’ve got that down and you are able to communicate well with customers, your time their will be a breeze."
good,Getting to know coworkers from different departments opens more opportunities for transfer or advancement. Getting word of new items arriving at the store also a plus.
good,Nordstrom is a amazing company to work for.  They support a work life balance.  Give you the tools and resources to drive your business and your hard work is rewarded by pay and recognition.
good,"Job culture was the best,"
good,"Nordstrom cares about their employees and their personal drive and determination to succeed in commission sales. Management can often be underprepared, however, your own personal ambition and drive are what will cause you to succeed in an adaptive retail setting."
good,Good discounts. Good place to work.  Fast paced environment.  Multitasking and empathy required to perform.  Discretion required to credit customer accounts.
good,Awesome place to work for the holidays. Hours were very early but the Manager made our jobs easy and team work makes any job easier. You get a fifty percent discount and awesome perks.
good,was a great company to work for. They have a lot of benefits and really care about their employees who work hard. I learned alot about clothing and how to be a good leader as well as a team player.
good,A lot of opportunity for change and growth. There are multiple departments that allow people the opportunity to find what they want to be an expert in.
good,I found that my experience at Nordstroms was exciting and challenging.  I loved working with the customers and enjoyed assisting them with their selections.  The truck shows were amazing and fun.
good,"Its a really good company with great benefits, but is really hard to grow in there, I been working here for 4 years and still doing the samething. I really like what I do but I want more, I want to learn new   stuff and just not happening."
good,You have to call customers and remind them of events coming up and check if they need anything restocked. You build relationships with some amazing people and if you love what you are doing they always have room for growth.
good,I worked here through college and was able to make incredible money with a flexible schedule. I would highly recommend for anyone who is enjoys interacting with others.
good,i enjoyed my time working there. it keeps you very busy. they focus very much on their customers which is a very nice place to be around. i would go back to working with them.
good,It felt like a home safe place because we built the floor from the ground up. I learned a lot due to it being my first job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers.
good,Interacting with new customers everyday and getting the opportunity to style them with new merchandise. Learning about new product on a daily basis.  Reaching daily goals.
good,"The culture and team are fantastic! The new store manager tends to sit in her office and micromanage over the headset walkies. The department managers are typically very understanding and helpful. It's a lot of work for not a whole lot of pay, and the customers are becoming more abrasive since I began working here [over time they've cut down our high class demeanor which makes us less capable of providing a better customer experience]. It's basically turning into a step up from Kohl's [where I've worked before]. "
good,good place to work.. I would suggest it as a great way to network and gain employment if you wish to travel; i worked with great people.  The versatility offered by the company is a bonus as well.
good,It's quick fast paced environment. There is always something to do. Always interacting with fellow employees and customers. Working on projects and tasks that are given.
good,"Nordstrom has a strong work environment, however management did need some work while I was there.the culture of Nordstrom is the best I've ever worked with."
good,A typical workday in my role like any job had its ups and downs. Benefits are well balanced for a Company and if you are lucky enough to acquire a position within the Company that you are passionate about Nordstrom may be the route for you.
good,This job is fun and great for people who are fashion forward and thrive in sales. The company provides and intensive training program that supplies you with all the tools to make sales. The schedule was very flexible and i loved the people that i worked with.
good,"loved working here, hours were always available, and loved the discount that we received. sometimes felt a bit competitive though. managers gave away my position while I was out on maternity leave."
good,Company was great to be a part of. I enjoyed the culture that Nordstrom represents. They had a knack for hiring great people that worked as a team and showed positive attitude throughout the day.
good,I have learnt a lot at this company and they helped me to explore in multiple areas.  Got good exposure in multiple BI technologies and also helped me to groom my project management capabilities.
good,"Decline in retail sales has hurt Spokane Nordstrom and retail sales in general. As a manager I did not like competing with commissioned salespeople for sales,"
good,I loved working with great people. I learned so much about customer service and product knowledge that will help me with my future for success with other companies.
good,Nordstrom was a good place to work at even though it was quite competitive at times. It taught me great customer service skills and it was enjoyable to be a stylist and dress customers up.
good,it was a fun environment and with a lot of work to do. the hardest part of the work was the rush hours and to deal with the problems that occurs in that time.
good,I worked here in between my basketball season at school and it was a really good job. They were very flexible with my schedule and never made me over work myself.
good,"it's a daily busy place full of customers on a regular basis , we never stop working and the days flies by without noticing that it's the end of the day !"
good,"Typical day at Nordstrom Rack is to provide a excellent customer service to each one of the guest. Customers are the high priority to focus on customer satisfaction.   I learned working in Nordstrom Rack is to adopt the new method and technologies in the retail world industry. For example, mobile apps, shop online and shop and drop. Employees in Nordstrom are up beat and friendly environment."
good,I worked here during college and the team was super helpful. There is an excellent culture that makes workers feel comfortable with one another. I would recommend this company.
good,My time at Nordstrom was great. It helped me grow as an individual while doing what I love most - styling people. I grew with the company and became an assistant manager. My most treasured position because I learned how to develop a great team.
good,Unlike most retail jobs Nordstrom has  a culture unlike any other. Very inclusive and diverse. They work great with flexible schedules and the managers are so fun and always trying to build you up!
good,"Learned a lot, supportive management and team! Many growth opportunities, and internal promotion culture makes it more positive for someone building a career in retail."
good,"Working at Nordstrom they stand behind the ""Golden Rule"". The philosophy is treat the customers how you would like to treated. The employers adopted that philosophy and that's why everyone loves Nordstrom."
good,Workplace culture could be very competitive at times because the pay was commission based.  Need to be comfortable approaching strangers and going above and beyond. Company culture is upbeat and fast-paced. Very encouraging managers.
good,While the company was great to work for the management was not great. A lot of the department managers didn't care about their team members as much as they should have. Aside from that it was a great place to work.
good,"Nordstrom was a very fun place to work at, positive environment. Everyone communicates pretty well, while still having a good time with customers and coworkers"

good,"At Nordstrom Rack gave me all type of wonderful experience. Such as, teaching how to provide customers the best customer service in any type of positions."
good,"Nordstrom can be deceiving in respects to how they treat their employees versus the customers."
good,"Everyday is a different day when you go into Bazille. You go in prepping your station eager to learn more about others station and how. to prep those stations. The management was very easy to speak to and when anything is wrong the HR team is there to assist immediately. The hardest part of the job is to multi task with many orders without panicking, But the most enjoyable part of the job is when you've done the best you can and know you served the food in a proper manner and everyone leaves to come back for more."
good,Nordstrom was a great place to work for. Everyone is welcoming and was willing to help me out with whatever I needed. The hardest part of the job was inconsistent pay. Most enjoyable was building a relationship with the customers I helped out.
good,The internship had wonderful potential if you wanted to be in retail management. I just decided that that wasn't where I wanted to be. Caring team though.
good,"very fast pace enviorment with great customers and customer service, with a great selection in clothes you can ask any rep and he or she will gladly help you."
good,"Over all good , I would recommend anyone to work there. Nice environment, nice people, good benefits and a warm and friendly environment. everybody is treated with respect!"
good,"I would love to keep working for Nordstrom because you can work in different departments within the company to fit your skills, but my commute there is too far and there are no openings close to my home where I can transfer to."
good,Nordstrom was an excellent and upbeat work place and I was very fortunate to be introduced to the lifestyle the presented. The team was awesome and the managers overall had an excellent understanding of coaching and training.
good,"The customers tend to express themselves more in a specialized department.  I enjoyed connecting with the customers. "
good,Great place to work! Very fashion forward. I work in the building services department and love making my store clean and shoppable for our excellent customers.
good,very good people on store level of company. Very friendly environment. work schedule was ok with the opportunity of overtime especially during peak seasons.
good,"Working at the rack was a nice, you would be able to help customers one on one. You would work with high fashion and name brands. Coworkers would help one another."
good,Its a fun place to work where you get to interact with customers and build relationships with them.  Always encouraged to perform your best.  Very fast pace during sale times and need to wear comfy shoes.
good,"Good teamwork, communication, fast paced but it was worth the learning experience. The 2nd shift lead team were fun, polite, always had a blast working with them"
good,Nordstrom provides a diverse work culture.  Opportunities for advancement are there.  Management can be a mixed bag - often promotions are made from one department to another without prior experience in that specialty.
good,Working in a team environment is awesome. Learning new things daily to be more productive at your job. Management was always ready to lend a hand when needed.
good,"great place to work with a fun and collaborative atmosphere.  everyone is friendly and always willing to help."
good,"its a fine environment, could be better, managers from other departments could be petty. can be a distraction and can cause lack of concentration and irritability"
good,Nordstrom was a great place to work. The only reason I left the job was I had surgery on my knee and I could not stand on my feet for the hours needed. Loved giving the service to the customers who shipped at this store.
good,"It was my first retail job and I learned alot, however, I was only there for 2 months due to a new job opportunity. I was put into mens furnishings which i knew nothing about, but the team was nice and helped me learn."
good,Hard to keep up with the big dogs since their clientele level is out the roof.  They make it so competitive that they don't even have time for regular customers only appointments.
good,"A typical work day is opening my department.  Contacting clients regarding special events, sales and new merchandise.  I learned management skills.  The atmosphere at Nordstrom was fun and friendly.  The most enjoyable part of the job was styling clients for events."
good,Another job that I didn't want to leave. I wish that I could've stayed. Loved working with the employees out there. They too were very friendly. Hope that I'll be able to work there again one day.
good,Long hours and a competitive place to work but if you like a challenge this is a good place for you. Would've loved to work here longer but it was a seasonal job and I didn't live in Miami.
good,"It took a little bit to get use to, but overall the experience was satisfying.  If asked to come back, I would come back with no hesitation.  Thank you for the experience."
good,"My typical day was processing merchandise and getting the merchandise floor ready, I learned how to multi task and learned about all the various product nordstrom carries. The management team was great always listen to what employees need to do the job efficiently."
good,I worked at the Nordstrom Cafe and it was fun yet tiring. What had made it worth leaving was the management. Lacks teamwork and we should be able to look up to them for advice.
good,"Nordstroms is commission base, u do have a salary that u make but every dept has its own %. I was in kid shoes and at the time I was working there kids shoes was 13%... back then it was fun, I met Michael Jordans wife, she came in there to buy shoes for her kids. The incentives where great. I won  a cannondale bike for selling the most New balance shoes. Great place to work, and positivie enviornment"
good,"I enjoyed working for Nordstrom for 5 years.  I found out my passion was rooted in visual merchandising, so I took a job to further that passion.  I would recommend this job to anyone who has a love for customer service and fashion."
good,"It was a great learning of helping clients who were looking for something a little different than what I had done in the past.  The days were really good for expected hours and how flexible they were.  I hadn't just learned about dealing with clients but stock, working their computers and helping with returns as well.  Management was more than willing to give you an extra hand learning new things and were always positive.  I'd say the hardest was just the first few days but in general it didn't seem very difficult at all.  I just enjoyed helping clients because that was my focus in school and it was just a different way of going about it."
good,Nordstrom is a good place to work. They are flexible and the environment is fun to work in. Management is good. They work with the employees. I love working with co-workers.
good,"If you are interested in working in retail whether it be for a part-time, full-time or first job; i recommend Nordstrom. Its a steady pace environment with staff that helps you. They promote within so advancement is always an option. Over all better than most retailers; and they pay well as well!"
good,"I learned a lot of customer service skills. The other leads were very fun and weren't too strict. The managers were very forgiving for mess ups. My favorite part were the customers, they were very kind and easy to talk to."
good,"While working at Nordstrom I gained a lot of new knowledge and experience. The employees are very cool and friendly, and the management is proffesional."
good,"If want to travel and move up Nordstrom is the right place to work.  Great people,  benefits and overall a great company to work for. You can move up easily,  travel. Inverted pyramid is the best.  They put customers first,  employees,  managers then corporate."
good,I learned a great deal while working there. Had a great relationship with the corporate chefs and had the opportunity to travel to corporate kitchens in Seattle.
good,had to work with your team in order to move the line as a customer service agent you were able to make commission by getting customers to establish a line of credit with us.
good,"Loss Prevention, typical day was spent filling out paper work, surveillance and answering calls "
good,"Nordstrom is a very fun and professinal  company to work for. All the employees are very nice and friendly and most of all educated and helpful. I worked at Nordstrom as a Vendor for various fragrances company such as Marc Jacobs, Cotty, Chanel fragrances."
good,"I would arrive and clock in and go into a managers only meeting. I would take notes, listen to last weeks performance/sales, compare and develop plans for the week a head. After the meeting I would get my department ready for opening by getting our cash box and starting up our register and dusting or putting new merchandise out on the floor. I also had the chance to see the operations of Nordstrom's discount store Nordstrom Rack and trained with management there as well."
good,"Great opportunity to gain or continue retail experience. Compensation is partly determined by commission, and as such you have the opportunity to achieve a sizable hourly salary!"
good,Not the job for you if you don't like the stand and move around a lot. If you are not experienced with being in situations handling different customer complaints I would not recommend it.
good,interacting with customers. solving issues. good management. the hardest part is rearranging things u already did. we had discount on items since i was an associate and sometimes free lunch
good,"This is a retail job like any other, the only difference is the pay scheme. You still have to deal with the general issues with any other retail position. The culture is nice and the people are kind, at least that was my experience."
good,"nice discounts with nice job. "
good,"I helped customers with their purchases making sure that it was a positive experience for them and that they were completely satisfied with what they had chosen. I helped keep the department organized, tidy and inviting. I gave excellent customer service and enjoyed my co-workers."
good,Norstrom is a great company to work for. I've been with the company for a year and a half and I love my experience. My team makes it that much better. The only thing I don't particularly love is the fact I have to work all weekends and holidays like most retail positions.
good,"always had a good time working  we had to drive far always, he was my uncle who gave me a lot of work and taught me a lot of cool things, i do sstill curently work with him when ever he gets work but , work has been slow"
good,"I loved working for Nordstrom. Upward mobility is highly encouraged. Sales team members do very well if they are good at their jobs. If you are not a performer, the pay may seem challenging since it is condom based salary."
good,"Fun place to work. Co-workers are usually pretty lazy and unreliable. Management doesn't trust you to get your own work done so they micromanage every second of your life. It's folding clothes, not handling nuclear launch codes."
good,"Nordstrom is a great place if you want to grow and increase your sales knowledge as well as customer service, however, you need to beware of your coworkers, sometimes it's cutthroat and it can make your work life not that great."
good,"Great place to work. Coworkers and customers are friendly. The store is beautiful. They provide good training and make you feel very"
good,Great place to learn how to provide great customer service. Nordstrom is number one in that department for sure. Learned a lot of good things and management was fantastic.
good,"Great place to move up through a company. Cross functional training with experience or not."
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom was very laid back, got a chance to meet different people. I don't believe I ever had a hard time at work because the type of personality that I have. The most enjoyable time was making the customers happy and making them want to come shop with me again."
good,This company had great benefits but the pay lacked. Management was overall decent and but the store itself had a lack of business and was very slow paced.
good,I am happy to work at Nordstrom's.  Company is very helpful to employees.  Good employee discounts and excellent benefits.  Excellent benefits related to commute costs.
good,"A typical day at work is stocking, re ticketing clothes, merchandise floor, and check customers out. Management for the most part is good. There isn't anything hard about the job."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for and the employees are exceptionally good people. Everyday you greet and meet customers quickly. You provide outstanding customer service and go above and beyond to help your customers. Your customers turn into your clients, you are considered friends in a professional manner. You are responsible for building your client relationship and are given the tool called personal book to help you keep data for yourself and save confident information. The hardest part of the job is not having enough inventory in store for customers to try on, for those who like to see before they purchase type of client. Everyday it is a joy to work at Nordstrom, the company, staff members and all around day to day tasks is truly one of a opportunity."
good,"If you love fashion you will like this company. I met lots of great people and loved going to work every day.  "
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work. The managers are flexible and care about you. Its like an extended family.  "
good,Always expect for everyday to be different. Be prepared to multitask and deliver excellent customer service. Every department is different. This job can be very competitive in terms of sales. The more you sale the more you earn.
good,"Greet customers in a timely and professional manner."
good,Nordtrom's reputation for customer service speaks for itself. Even though this was a brief part time job having it on my resume has only helped in interviews more than 5 years later.
good,Everyday was different and always brought something new. There was a good team vibe with management and other co-workers. Everyone was like a family and understanding making the atmosphere pleasant and nice to work in.
good,"Meet and exceed sales goals, lead team of sales professionals, plan and execute events to promote business.  Provide exceptional service to customers."
good,"Just make your sales goals and youll make money Selling, customer service, and great leadership skills is a must to succeed and make good money at nordstrom"
good,"Nordstrom is the gold standard of customer service and future employers love to see it on a resume.  Since there are many entry level associates at Nordstrom, some of the younger associates tend to be cut throat when it comes to sales.  The one obstacle that was difficult to over come was the return policy, or lack of.  Everyone knows that you can return whatever you want, whenever you want. The lack of return policy SEVERELY hurts associates income. Nordstrom has to revamp their return policy so that associates can be happy and make decent money!"
good,Great people family like fast pace and a place you can learn and grow but only if you are willing to relocate to other store and most of the time it requires moving out of the city
good,I was in management for the majority of my career with Nordstrom and learned so much from it from the culture they instill in their employees which I have taken with me in my subsequent positions.  The core concept of under promise and over delivery and treating customers as if it is your own business has been a valuable tool to use in any position.  They promote creating an environment of taking care of the customer at all times.  I enjoyed being able to provide the customer with great service and follow up and having a happy repeat customer.
good,"job is fine, hours are okay, a lot of standing around and doing nothing, tips are alright, small percentage goes to you, management is cool, location is good."
good,"The work was easy and I enjoyed what I do but the physical aspect of the position wasn't fully explained prior to the assignment and my duties. If some accommodations were made to my position, I would stay longer."
good,The hardest part is reaching consensus among multiple key stakeholders --  hard to pin down decisions and lots of changes to scope once projects are underway.
good,"This helped me work in a management field, address customer service needs, and gain valuable insight into the Apparel field.  It also provided additional skills I could add to my educational repertoire when teaching others."
good,"good first job. I worked there seasonally and enjoyed it. No benefits. and you have to work terrible hours. If you have flexibility it is good. Also, lots of stress with low pay"
good,"The irregularity of a daily schedule as well as not being able to have two consecutive days off made the position difficult, living like a constant jet lag."
good,"Overall, a good company to work for. Good work-life balance. Competitive pay. However, a majority of the higher paid positions are located in the Seattle offices."
good,Nordstrom cafe has a lack of recognition on employees more than capable of doing there job and more. So it leads to lack of advancement! Otherwise it is a great company.
good,"I learned a lot about HR issues at Nordstrom, they did a good job with training. enjoyed the people I worked with, they were like family. hardest part of the job was keeping up with reviews with a large staff and keep a balanced work/home life"
good,"Commission sales are never easy. You are on the sales floor with a handful of people trying to grab the customer first. It all depends on how hungry you are. The harder you work on your craft, the more sales you will earn."
good,"Good place to work. Strong sales skills needed. Lots of product knowledge. Paid holidays. Working in December is rough. Commission is paid, can be very good or very bad. Lots of up/downs. Job can be a roller coaster. Expect something different everyday"
good,"Nordstrom reached me how important is customer service in business, over all very good company, taking there business very serious, and I liked it, very good training for sales and service."
good,"Most positions are commission based but i feel that sales associates are still compensated well for the work. Pushy about opening nordstrom cards, but that is the business."
good,"Very friendly environment, learned how to prepare for customers for lunch/dinner, opportunities, relaxing music in background, always can go to supervisor, learned a lot about guest roles and how to be presentable to customers the hardest part was clean up but very maintainable. It would have been a plus for the kitchen area to be little larger. We all worked together to clean up at night"
good,Nordstrom's was a good work experience. Very professional work environment and run very efficiently. Compensation was very fair. Management was very good.
good,Nordstrom Rack was a great place to work at. I felt that there was potential to move up in the company however I left before getting the chance to excel in the corporate world.
good,"I like Nordstroms & would like to continue as a counter manager in a store closer to my home. Management is better than most companies I've worked for. Professional environment, safe & clean"
good,"This is an amazing retail company to work for, the pay is great a you determine what you make due to commission sales and advancement is always available if you put in the work and show capability."
good,"Allot of work for the salary I was given but"
good,Overall very satisfied with my employers and enjoyed working for the companies. Made coming to work very enjoyable. Was challenging  and never boring. Looked forward to coming to work everyday.
good,Great opportunity to get good experience with customer service. Gives you the ability to strengthen sales and service skills. Amazing opportunity to cross sell and learn about other departments.
good,it gets the bills paid and at time can be a fun place to work. Lately its been really slow so the pay has decrease of course with tips and the hours have lower
good,The day starts early and also early leaving the campus is allowed if it does not compromise with the work assigned to you. Learning new things is somewhat not in scope as they have been using old and legacy systems for quite some time now. Work place culture is excellent and so is the management!
good,Many opportunities to move up in the company. If you are mobile you can move up faster. Great benefits including employee discount on clothing and shoes!
good,I loved my job and most of my coworkers i planned on retiring from the company but my family moved and i was unable to transfer to a store that was nearby
good,As a sales associate picking the department and store that produces the most volume is the way to get ahead. Do not take a position in a low volume department or store with the promise of transferring.
good,Working at Nordstrom as a temporary worker helped me to understand the struggles of both a temporary worker and one that works behind the scenes. It taught me to respect those who work behind the scenes to make the life and purchasing of items online much easier.
good,"Nordstrom is a great work environment for those interested in learning the ""do's and don't"" of the fashion world. As an employee you get access to top of the line fashion advice, apparel and clientele!"
good,Overall Nordstrom has a great company culture. Teams vary however. Beware of becoming involved with a team that is not corporate values minded. Each department varies.
good,I loved wirking for the nordstrom company.. Great experence.. Learned alot with my manager gene... Real good man.. And my co-workers as well... I would recommend nordstrom to everyone.. Thanks
good,working there was good but i believe it could have been better and the pay could have been better as well. the supervisors could do better with managing more.
good,"A typical day in this position consists of waiting on customers and completing their orders in a timely manner, while also completing prep work as needed. From this position, I have learned the importance of working on multiple tasks, adapting to new situations, and working in teams. Management style seems to shift frequently, as people enter and leave the position often. However, each new manager has worked toward the same goals. The culture focuses on customer satisfaction and keeps an open environment that encourages personal interaction. Nordstrom also takes consideration in its employees, not scheduling them on family holidays and works well around the needs of student employees. The hardest parts of the job include completing all operations within the time frame set by the mall, an emphasis on quickly learning said operations, and integrating new employees into the work pace. The most enjoyable part of the job is working in a fairly relaxed environment and having a hands-on approach to all aspects of the position."
good,The best thing I learned in nordstrom was customer service.its amazing and professional.My salary was based on hour and commission.The problem is most of the customer like shopping and they purchase easy there because they know the return policy .You sell and work hard a months and few days later they return  items and it means you did nothing.
good,"Company has changed in the years i have been with Nordstrom. "
good,"A typical day at work consist of 8 hours on your feet, cleaning and oraganizing while assisting customers. As well as being able to maintain a rewards goal."
good,Working for Nordstrom is a constant rush of customers coming in and out. I have learned so much about espresso based drinks and distinguish coffees...
good,I had the opportunity to work with some fabulous people that worked as a team. I loved learning how to make the shopping experience for our customers an enjoyable one. This was a great start for me young in my sales career.
good,Communication and job expectations are clear - the people make the job more enjoyable. Retail hours are tough. A typical day includes new challenges and problems to solve - nothing is the same every day.
good,Great company to work for. Very lenient when it comes to hours. They care about everyone and their feelings. The people there are very nice and professional. The hardest part of the job is when the store is slow the money is slow so we have to improvise situations.
good,"Got amazing experience from customer service from almost all departments I loved working here but unfortunately got let go due to my time sheet, I worked in Costa mesa and my drive from corona was not always great."
good,"Enjoyed working there, got along well with staff and managment. Flexible hours and bonus were granted for credit card sales, also management acknowledged when employee meet point of sale goals, with  certificate"
good,It is what you make of it. if you're in a small market city i woulnt recommend but if you are in a larger city it's great money. But its up to you and how hard you work.
good,"Working at Nordstrom was a lot of fun. I loved all of my co-workers in the restaurant, and I made a lot of friends who worked retail as well. Overall a great place to work."
good,"I enjoyed my time and Nordstrom, the company is always doing events and extra things for the employees.  You have to be competitive on the sales floor if you want to do well.  But your hard work will get rewarded."
good,"very involved in customer service "
good,paid on your efforts. if you apply yourself and choose to learn about the business you will be successful. management is there to assist you in product knowledge and ways to help build you customer cliental.
good,excellent service. Great team work and office skills. Supervisor is great with employees. Customers are nice to work with. Benefits are amazing. time.
good,"At Nordstrom you can expect to be on the go all the time. You meet great people and make lasting connections that go outside of the your job description. The job can be exhausting especially during the holidays, however, you make your own business and can make as much money as you want."
good,Great diversity in the work place. Commission based job. Great place to work for fashion lovers and people with good customer service skills. Must be a outgoing peoples person if you're going to last here.
good,"I've had plenty of ups and downs when I worked at the Chinook location when it first opened, but I was resilient because I loved the work itself, and the employees I was surrounded with. It was typically busy on weekends, and traffic is a little slow on weekdays. It's an awesome entry level job for students looking to develop their work experience, and pay was mediocre. It's not really the best place to stay employed long term unless you have expectations of wanting to grow with the company, just because the pay is not sufficient enough for a living, and your hours can get cut if the day is going by slow."
good,"Great company if you like retail and sales. Great room for advancement and plenty of areas to advance too. Company is young, tech savvy, and energetic."
good,"Worked with the stock team and they were one of the best people to work with. Our manager was supportive and picked people who worked well together. Overall, working at 5 am in the morning wasn't so bad with a fun group to work with."
good,it's a great place to work for and the pay is good and based on your performance. This company treats their employees well and there are a lot of motivating ways to increase your pay
good,"nordstrom is awesome to work for. they have many incentives. as a parttime student, working as a server is perfect. Plus we earn minimum wage! cant beat that with a stick."
good,I enjoyed working at Nordstrom. The people were friendly and management was nice as well. The work isn't super hard to do and it's a relatively great place to work.
good,"Nordstrom is an amazing company to work for. I was given the ability to work from home which in turn provided my the opportunity to choose a schedule that worked well for me family (cross-midnight shift). Even working from home I was able to feel connected to my team and supervisors, always had support from management and our leads."
good,you get to work with a lot of colorful people on a daily basis. you can shop around on your breaks lol. coffee bar and restaurant inside. very past paced
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is having a good co-worker and the accessibility of the workplace. I learned how to deal with other people and enjoy my job at the same time.
good,Management is pretty messy. The most enjoyable part of the job is the nice people around me and the hardest part of the job is dealing with the messy management.
good,"always learned how to sell and give great customer service. the culture is young and stylish so people are always motivated to look their best. The hardest part of the job is commission during the slower months, but when you make commission it is definitely."
good,"What makes it great to work there is the flexibility of scheduling, the great coworkers, and benefits. The hard part is moving up in the company because you must have managers that prefer to have you versus a better candidate being able to do a better job."
good,"Productive during holiday season and anniversary. Great place to work, very supportive supervisors, and fun atmosphere. Loyal customers that make it easy to talk to and help with confidence."
good,Overall my experience while working at Nordstrom has been positive. The company teaches you great customer service skills and has worked with my school schedule.
good,"Ensure building security and overall store safety"
good,"great encouraging environment"
good,"Great training was provided;"
good,"typical sales job,"
good,Nordstrom is very high standard company and I learned so many ways on how dealing and approaching to management. I love working Nordstrom with respect. Kitchen staff are very helpful and we work as a team. The Chef Cook manager is very approachable and solved minor problems right away.
good,"over all it's a great company to work for. There are opportunities for advancement, if you are interested in the world of retail."
good,"Working for Nordstrom truly makes you feel like you're apart of a family.Coming to work everyday is really enjoyable, I like that the company has growth potential."
good,"Very organized and very corporate. You are constantly doing go backs, customer service, cleaning, and straightening your section. You make a lot of friends and management is awesome! they are very understanding and make the work environment very comfortable. The hardest part is finding something to do when your section has been perfected."
good,"When you walk into the office you are set up for success as you have your own work space with a computer and phone. You are always surrounded by your peers who are either on the same team or in a different department. At Nordstrom feeling empowered when making decisions was always encouraged. Management was always changing due to people always moving to different departments and or moving up in the company. Management were also very encouraging and supportive when it came down to moving departments or moving up the company ladder. "
good,"ran the day to day operations in a fast pace environment."
good,Nordstrom is a fairly decent company for anybody still in school or going to college. They pay okay for a retail company.
good,"There is so much joy that comes from working somewhere you like shopping. My time at Nordstrom was a great experience because I was able to work in a wonderful store, and shop practically all day!"
good,"Was a very nice place to work had a professional environment. "
good,"I would highly recommend working with Nordstrom, the people are enjoyable, and they have great benefits while you're working there."
good,"the work was consistent, but when we would have days that were slow, we made ourselves busy and kept working. the pay was great. everyone was friendly and outgoing."
good,"good place to work if you like general labor, breaks could be a lil longer management well address situations. the enviorment is calm and setting is firm"
good,Working here is always a good challenge.  You learn something new every day.  They encourage advancement and really want to help you.

good,Great training in true customer service. Work life balance is good and great management teams. Learned customer relationship skills to last a lifetime.
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom was just keeping the overall appearance clean while maintaining janitorial responsibilities including: replacing the trash and recycling of every cashier place, the trash cans leading out to the mall, and the bathrooms (public and employee). The employees there had an overall good attitude and were very nice to coworkers and customers. I enjoyed going around and meeting everyone, it was just a little difficult to manage work and school."
good,"When working for Nordstrom, you'll find it super organized and smoothly ran, from your department team to the Human Resources office. You will make good money if you treat your job seriously and if you are a full time employee you will even receive a very nice benefits package. The atmosphere however is super catty, in the restaurant and on the retail floor there is always petty drama, people arguing over guests and talking behind each others' backs, forming cliques and even subtle bullying. And in the regularly occuring store rallies and morning meetings, there is plenty of propaganda about how Nordstrom is the best company in the world and everything is rainbows and butterflies. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it just gets a little annoying when the upper management is so obviously faking the peppy happy attitude while letting the drama happen to openly in the backrooms, sometimes even joining in on it. But you won't see much of that unless you get more involved with the company. "
good,Working for this company was a good learning experience. They had multiple systems that we worked in at once. That allowed me to sharpen my multi tasking skills!
good,"As a Logistics Processor, you had to deal with early hours, dealing with carrying heavy loads as well as organizing merchandise for each particular department. The co-ordination of the employees there is kind hearted, strong willed and confident in their work which it shows in their proficiency  to detail."
good,Management at Nordstrom is great they really push their employees. My co-workers were very helpful in teaching me how things work in the store.
good,Work at Nordstrom was very independent based. Commission salaries made a fun competitive environment. The management and co-workers worked well as a team and understood that success came from the balance between relying on each other and ourselves. The hardest part of the job was consistently making store productivity goals during this recession. Pushing for sales was a must during times when people did not want to spend money. The most enjoyable part of the job was using my creativity to create outfits and personal connections with my clients while making good sales.
good,Work was fun and fast. My co workers were nice and easy to get along with. The managers were nice and very reasonable. I liked to start early and get off early.
good,"cleaning building store. detailing work.  great managers. great co workers. love this job til  i got layed off. hardest was walking to work."
good,Thoroughly enjoyed my time at Nordstrom in all the different positions I worked in. Had I not gotten married and had a baby during my time there I would have done more to advance to management.
good,"Nordstrom is a very exciting place to work. The atmosphere is fun and you learn new skills and apply it to the job. It is a fast paced environment with very culturally diverse people. As a sales person, you must be very welcoming and have the ability to sell. My co workers were one of the reasons i LOVED coming to work. They are very kind, helpful and outgoing. The hardest part is managing working and school. I live in Surrey, therefore, the commute was the hardest. It took me an hour and half to get to work. However, once i got there the funnest part was bonding with customers and interacting with new people."
good,volume of calls were more busy in the beginning and end of each quarter. very fun helping students with information need for their schedule.

good,"Great college job, minimum wage, competition for commission, nice coworkers, good managers, 20% employee discount, yummy food at the cafe, nice lunch room, good training."
good,Large company but runs more like multiple small businesses so work-life balance and environment vary within the company.  My experience has been good. Overall good corporate culture and benefits.
good,"A typical day at work was filled with different personalities to different types of products we handle everyday. We'd start the day unpacking/stocking shoes, then we'd jump on the shipping/receiving line and assist with packing. After lunch we'd jump in the truck and help sort and unload shipment for next day stock. During all these different tasked we assisted all store departments with floor setup as well as stocking needs."

good,a typical day included assisting guests with style suggestions and making it great experience for experience for everyone.
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom Rack would start by coming to the establishment through the parking lot. After i got inside I would put my stuff in my locker then get my headset to head downstair. I learned different ways to approach customers, in order to get the best result and I have definitely learned a good bit about fashion as well. My coworkers were usually energetic and ready for our shifts. The hardest part of that job would have to be organizing the back of the house around holidays since it would get really busy and dealing with customers that shoplift. The most enjoyable part of that job was getting the customers what they came in there for."
good,Great place to work. Very fashion forward environment. This is a great place to network with like minded individuals. They have great benefits. They work with you to relocate within the company.
good,It was great learning about new things. Very competitive environment. I just didn't agree with working on the holidays. Management made it very easy for you to excel.
good,"Maniacal focus on the customer experience"
good,Neat experience. It was a joy to work with the children. The company seemed to ask for slome what unrealistic tasks from teachers.
good,"Your basic sales job with selling and constant restocking and cleaning. The best part of Nordstrom is the culture! Everyone is amazing and always offers help when asked, including managers!"
good,"This is retail. The store does usually draw in a specific type of clientele. Nordstrom has items for every price point, but is known for being high end and having excellent customer service. It lives up to these expectations. The culture of the Job is what I like the most. The company has excellent service standards."
good,"great customers, fun co-workers, great opportunities to advance, in order to have a work life balance one must be very organized"
good,great company to work for..lots to avancement if desier.. would recommend nordstrom to anyone who is willing to work hard to accomplish what the want.
good,"I was able to make relationships with my customers the number one part of my job, which made it less like work and more like fun. I also was empowered to make floor moves and remerchandising decisions on a daily basis, allowing me to be creative and learn new things about presentation."
good,Working here can take a toll on the body and mind.fast moving place with a staff crw who knows their position and pay attention to detail.

good,"good people, structure, etc. This company is picky about who they choose to work for them, but if you are able to get on with this company there is a lot of room for growth."
good,"Great people. Its about money and time but if your willing to sacrifice you can make great money. Management can be hit or miss sometimes bad sales associates become mangers thats the problem. If you get a good manger thats about sales and team not about the quick promotion you will have a fantastic time and love it. Hr not the best very corporate so mangers can make or break you even though your a good salesman they will ""USE THEIR BEST JUDGEMENT TO  RANK YOU"" Mangers have little to much power in a sales goal customer service based business."
good,"Usual hours are 5am to 1:20pm"

good,"Once I arrive to the floor, I need to sell at least $1000 a day. 80% of my sales need to be at Clinique but I was able to help sell other counters as well. The second half of my job was to teach makeup classes. I would show and guide the customer on how to properly use their new Clinique makeup product and how to recreate the look at home. "
good,"Large, stable company. Opportunities to move around based on your interest."
good,"If you work hard you will be rewarded. You will push yourself beyond your comfort zone. Its a great place to make friends. Some pay periods are great. Some are miserable, but in the end it all equals out ."
good,"Working for Nordstrom, was a wonderful working experience. I was fortunate to work in management and  sales.  Nordstrom encouraged relocating to other stores within the company, The human resources department helped me find positions in other stores when I wanted to make a move. "
good,The job was a fast pace environment which i enjoyed. Also stand on our feet the entire day so im used to being able to work long hours.
good,I managed to learn quite a lot about providing good customer service and how to help people to the best of my abilities. My time at Nordstrom also made me more confident in talking to people and voicing my opinions.
good,"Fun fast paced working environment, supportive management, the hardest part of the job is working with customers who have very high expectations, the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting that customers expectation to the best of my ability, leaving them with a memorable shopping experience that will bring them back to my store."
good,I had worked Restaurant Management for years and decided to switch careers for better work life balance with my family.  Completely enjoyed working for them and would recommend to anyone interested in Retail.

good,I learned a lot working here. I learned about how to advance and work in a bigger corporation. I learned that you can advance with hard work and dedication.
good,"I love working for Nordstrom. It is very competitive, however, the people that I work with help make the job fun. The hardest part of the job is working for commission. Not knowing what your paycheck is going to look like can be stressful. It is all in my hands to make sure I sell enough to make a good paycheck."
good,its a nice place to work at and to grow with the company.very friendly people. I learned a lot by working with the company. The hardest part is just working holiday season.
good,I liked the company standards and how advancement opportunities were available for training. Products are of great quality and customer service is always putting customer concerns first

good,"great people, supportive, very flexible, great atmosphere, growth for more  advancement.  Management helpful.  co-workers team players"
good,A retail clothing store that has a bit of a hire standard. Expected to be fashionable and fashion knowledgeable. Good opportunities for advancement. Department managers are usually very knowledgeable of their department.
good,"Worked with people who were willing to help each other including management. Positive environment with the opportunity to grow ""your own retail business"" within Nordstrom"
good,I was the face of the restaurant when i started off my days as the greeter. I was thrilled to introduce the new faces to Nordstorms' cafe. The guests were always friendly and respectful. I enjoy learning about all the different wines and food pairings. It was an upscale yet small cafe with an intimate setting. Having to stop every hour to take the restaurants sales was probably the most tedious tasks.
good,its a good environment to work. sales are not hard you just have to be friendly with customers. customers trust your fashion knowledge so you have to be honest.
good,"A self driven, self sufficient, and extremely enthusiastic worker will thrive with this company. Furthermore, a worker who is willing to relocate is a welcomed attribute in order to develop within the company."
good,"Great company! fast paced sales environment focused on exceptional customer service. Management is not focused on micro-managing, so individuals may use their talents, and make their own choice, as to how best to serve their customers."
good,Everything is amazing Love my job the customers are greet my co-workers are amazing The management is on point and outstanding
good,"I would go into work 10 minutes early make sure my station was presentable and everything was in order then i would stand around and greet every customer that walked by, asked them if they needed help with anything. If they did i would help them if they didnt then i would leave them alone and check up on them every 5 minutes or so. I would rinse and repeat that the entire day, and occasionally use the register when people were buying things."
good,"it was a fun place to work that was fully commission based, but you also got to go home if it was slow.  all in all a fun place to work."
good,The staff were great people they were always willing to help anyone at anytime..They had great pay an benefits if you were hired on.
good,Really good benefits fun place to work. Good customers and coworkers. Love the culture that they have with the customers.
good,"Overall, it's a great place to work.  You have to really love fashion, cosmetics, and keeping up with trends in order to remain successful while working at Nordstrom."
good,"A normal day at work consists of various customers that either shop quickly or need help picking out items. Co-workers always make fun, but it's easy to get distracted when the floor is clear of customers. Commission based, so it's necessary to work hard when it is busy. Management could be better at communication, but overall a great place to work, where the company values its employees and there is room for advancement."
good,"Fashion forward fast pace workplace. Teamwork is enjoyable, but also can be tough, but I really enjoy serving the customers with the best service and connection."
good,"At the call center for Nordstrom, I am constantly taking calls regarding payments, account balances, apr, credit lines and anything to do with the credit and card options offered through the company. I have learned how to handle a big call volume and to be productive on a higher and quicker, but more efficient level. The management provided is always there to take on complicated calls, and to help support any of us customer service representatives. The relationships I have built with the people I work with has helped me be a better employee, as well as a fellow employee to them as well by showing each other support in various ways whether it is working a shift for them when needed or by answering questions we may have when we are confused or stuck on a situation. The most difficult aspect of the job is not being able to help and fix every situation that crosses your path, but it is always rewarding when you solve a problem or when a customer gets off the phone satisfied, knowing that you helped them."
good,"I had a great time working at this store. Great employees and fun customers. Very friendly staff all around. Great management, always supportive."
good,"A day at nordstrom begins with an opening duty, to ensure the cleanliness of the work place. An area to supervise is assigned on any given day to maintain and present the merchandise in a desirable fashion. Lastly the main focus of the job is to sell and style customers from head to toe, and provide exceptional customer service."
good,"•	Set appointments with high-end clients."
good,"Overall great place to work with many opportunities available, allows you to make your own decisions, I've learned to deal and work with people from many backgrounds.  I loved making a difference in  people's lives and exceeded customer's expectations where ever possible."
good,"Established and maintained superior customer service; maintained client portfolios, and followed up on individual sales, service, and special orders to ensure customer satisfaction, professionalism, and loyalty for repeat business. Retrieved cash for department register; assisted with returns, price changes, and moves of merchandise on the floor. Worked closely with all department employees showed strong teamwork towards each other."
good,"Nordstrom is a wonderful place for an individual to really realize their potential. Whether it be day to day interactions with the customer or co-workers, you and you alone are in charge of running your own business. I did work in managemnt for an extended amount of time. I learned that the sales team is as good as the managers who run the floor. I've seen managers come and go and I've seen the direct correlation to floor performance. The hardest part of the job is when you've exhausted all personal clientele business and are reliant on floor traffic. It usually can be a steady influx of customers but I've noticed that in recent years especially this past year, foot traffic has slowed down tremendously. I suspect online shopping is beginning it's takeover. When you do get customers seated and make conections with them that is easily the most enjoyable part of the job. Either way I feel ready to take my talents and learned skills to a larger more refined playing field."
good,"I enjoyed working at the Nordstrom Warehouse sale because the work environment was very welcoming, everyone contributed to a well organized team work/leadership and keeping the warehouse tidy and organized was an important task while working."
good,new problems to solve for customers everyday. a supportive environment. kind words always work best. customer service is the most important thing you can provide.
good,Very exciting upbeat place to work. Excellent emphasis on costomer service and quality merchandise. Very professional staff
good,"Great company to work for.  Lower end of salary range, but well worth it.  Need to wait for available positions or relocate in order to advance"
good,"Continuously increased revenue and customer service satisfaction."
good,I loved going to work everyday at nordstroms. They provided a great environment to work in. The managers were mainly positive and lending helping hands. My co workers all pulled their own weight at the store. The hardest part of the job was to make sure we provided the best material for the customers.
good,"Great learning experience for the retail world. Meet lots of great people from within and outside the company(customers), Teaches you to be your own motivated sales person by driving your own business. Surround by amazing merchandise with something for everyone."
good,Nordstrom is a fashion forward company the is all about the customer experience from the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out.
good,great company to work for. Long hours and holidays are major draw back. Good benefits. If you like working with people and sales this is a great company to work for. There is the ability to grow with the company if you work hard.
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom's consists of creating relationships with customers and making their shopping experience seamless and enjoyable.  Nordstrom's has taught me how to work with well with others and has made me a confident sales person.  The management at the location i work at is great!  They are always supporting me and pushing me to be the best sales person i can be."
good,One reason I did love working at Nordstrom was the friendly faces I got to be with daily. We promise exceptional customer service always and thats what I learned most from this company that I will take with me in my future career.
good,I loved how nordstrom prided themselves on customer service. I like the chances I got to take on new tasks and grow with the company.
good,Positive work environment. Appreciated the opportunities at Nordstrom and learning about the Retail/Customer Service Industries.
good,Nice people to work with.  Not very much formal training but people are willing to help you if they can.  I learned a lot about wireless LAN that I didn't know before.
good,"From your smile and your overall appearance to how you great someone and know your product, working here gives you a higher level of being professional, and customer service. Through this job I've learned how to network not only with customers but also fellow employees. Co-workers are usually helpful as long as the customer has a great experience. Depending on your location the hardest part could be making sell requirements due to low volume of customers, but communication is one of the best things about this job."
good,"The location is perfect for improving my role. The area is surrounded with lots of competition which challenges my skills to promote the business. People around me are easy to work with, which makes the company competitive."
good,Had a few different job titles for Nordstrom. They were vastly different but all of them were a great learning experience
good,Good company with opportunities to advance. The company is modern in technique. Customer service is the very first policy. I love the fact the company was started on core family values.
good,This was  a great opportunity to develop both  loss prevention and safety programs and to hire and train a new loss prevention staff.
good,"Everyday at work is different. We do everything from returns to fixing registers. My job includes training new hires, credit card issues, educating the sales floor, and assisting with the implementation of new technology. I have learned so much from working here like how to give excellent customer service. Since the company is known for their customer service, the expectations we have are very high. I would say the hardest part of the job is making each and every customer happy. I would say the most enjoyable is seeing a customer walk away with a smile on their face."
good,"If you like fashion and sales, this is the job for you. It is a commission based floor, so you essentially construct your own check. the harder you work, the more you'll make. One thing others may not say is that RETURN DO AFFECT YOU! On average, 25-30% of what you sell is returned. Nordstrom returns new and used merchandise. This is a great way for customers to try products that they aren't too sure about BUT many individuals take this luxury for granted."
good,"It's a huge company, you can ask for transfer if you move. Men's sportswear is one of the best departments to work. Dadeland mall in Kendall is one of the best !!"
good,A typical day is working your normal daily responsibilities.  If you complete your tasks you help other departments with their workload.
good,"In retail, you get back what you put in.  The salary is commission-based and you are encouraged to sell interdepartmentally and build a customer base.  I was able to advance several times which kept it fresh and interesting.  There is a lot of politics involved in management, but I'm sure that varies by location.  The schedule is terrible, but the job is a lot of fun and my co-workers were great.  The benefits were better than I expected.  My favorite job in my 20 years of work history, but after 7 years my knees will never be the same!"
good,I was paid well while working here. I learned how to use customer service as a means to encourage a sale. They literally go hand in hand.
good,I learned so much at Nordstrom about the credit card industry.It was a great place to work for and truly have enjoyed my six years with them.
good,Support and guide customers to desired product by asking probing questions and using effective communication and listening skills.  Service customers through out entire sales process from greeting to check out.  Merchandize floor to create compelling and exciting lifestyle fashion trends to fit all tastes.  Keep sales floor stocked and organized to ensure a memorable shopping experience for all customers.
good,Great job to have while you are at school or just getting started. Chances are you will work a lot of hours but you will be compensated fairly
good,prepping my salad and soup station from scratch and then delivering the food afterwards
good,I had fun working at Nordstrom. The management and coworkers were fun. I worked for the call center and loved that my calls were different from one another.
good,"Making sure that I and my co-workers have every needed at the register so that we can focus on the customers and their needs "
good,"professional environment / friendy co workers. Getting to know lots of celebs and working with them is so much fun. Over all I met lots of intersting people which some of them are going to be my lifetime friends.Fashion has always been a part of my life and I truly"
good,"I am  Seasonal worker, On a typical day we are packed with costumers who are currently looking for the best gifts for the lowest price. My coworkers are very friendly and helpful. There is always work to get done. We are really big on costumer service and hope to sell as much product as we can and leave our costumers satisfied. Most enjoyable part is being able to find what the costumer is looking for at the best price"
good,"Working for Nordstrom for the last year and a half has been overall a good experience. Working on the sales floor and in a support role I had the opportunity to see both sides of the coin. The customer service that Nordstrom teaches and emphasizes is a great tool. The level of professionalism working in the customer service department was something i really enjoyed as well as dealing with the daily problem solving and responsibilities  I was given. It was also a nice steady pay which was great. Working on the sales floor was a different beast entirely. The nice part is your have the ability to control what you make and your pay check by how hard you work but the other side of that is that your pay is a roller coaster. Working on the floor your have to factor in returns on a daily basis, competition with other associates, your ranking on the schedule which determines your hours, and the time of year it is which has a direct effect on how high sales are. They say that if your have personals and appointments you can increase your sales even in slow times or when you don't have any hours but realistically its very difficult to create your own business unless you've been there quite some time. One pay check you can make 600 dollars and work 30 hours total and the next work 70 hours and make 2,000 dollars. So the stability of the sales floor is not something I would recommend to most. The management is promoted from with in so sometimes you have a manger who has been doing it for years and others who've never managed join their life which creates challenges. Also nordstrom doesn't"
good,"I learned in a commission type of job environment, the competitiveness grows and there becomes almost tension between employers."
good,"Working at Nordstrom was a great experience. It really is a great company to work for. The pay was decent for retail, the scheduling was flexible and almost everyone was polite and friendly. The managers also seemed to be on the right page when it came to procedures and policies. I honestly don't have any real complaints except the fact that because it was commission based, depending on your rate and whether you got an hourly plus commission, the environment could be very aggressive. I worked in the fine jewelry and watch department and our pay was straight commission so the environment was often very harsh and competitive. I usually referred to it as a ""shark tank."" That was honestly the worst part about working there because since it was sole commission, you truly see the greed and selfishness come out in people. Making sales also became a huge challenge after the holiday season which greatly makes a difference in your pay. That was another challenging aspect of working at Nordstrom. Overall, its a really good company, I would recommend that if you decide to take a job there, make sure you prepare yourself and know what you're getting in to."
good,Great advancement opportunities and relaxed environment
good,Sometimes it is difficult to get management to back you being that the customer is LITERALLY ALWAYS right.
good,"What you put into your work is what you get out of it."
good,"Exciting place to work. Heavy emphasis on training, safety and following procedure. Excellent management with opportunities to advance."
good,learned a lot about customer service skill and how important it is to make sure the customer is 100% satisfied
good,"Assisting store and department managers with daily store and department goals, answering and directing all incoming calls, assisting customers, assisting with new hire orientation and daily office functions."
good,Working at Nordstrom is a little different because you're not just working a register or folding or hanging clothes; Your interacting with people. You get to know people on a different scale.
good,I currently work in the kids shoes dept. at Nordstrom's. its very hands on. I work with customers to make sure their needs are met. whether for a special event or just for hanging around my customer is sized correctly and put into the shoes of their need. I strive to make my customers happy and build a relationship with them. I work hand and hand with their children and make sure everyone leaves the store happy.
good,"Great place to work, a great company where you can grow. Many people you can learn from."
good,"I really enjoyed the self teaching about all different items that would walk in the store and how to negotiate a for a fair price."
good,Good place to work. I learn some of the principles to manage a crew of poeple. There was nothing dificult about my job I always have everything executed in a timely mater.
good,Working at Nordstrom Rack was a great experience and I absolutely loved it. I was positioned as a Rover. Which means I was rotated around the store in different departments. But overall the service was awesome.
good,"Nordstrom was had a very diverse and knowledgeable employee base. Opportunities for advancement were available for every department division. Normally this would be ideal, however, their management seems to only respond to ""Yes Men/Women."" Add that to the fact that they have zero respect for their support staff, coupled with unrealistic expectations."
good,It is an good job. I worked there when I was in high school. I was a cashier.
good,"Interact with customers providing excellent service."
good,"On a typical day I worked within in my department to maintain and gain new clients from my client book. Some of the duties included: calling for transfers, shipments and holds, personal styling and opening and closing the store."
good,"Great company to work for. Fast pace, meet some of the most interesting people. Team I worked with was awesome."
good,"Achieved a 15% store volume increase 1 years consecutively.      Tripled division revenues for each sales associate."
good,"Typical day consisted of selling and helping customers. Learned many skills, such as selling, customer satisfaction, and other skills. Co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part was to do inventory. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping and seeing satisfaction in customers."
good,"Ring up customers, answer questions in regards to products. I learned how to listen to customers needs and wants, also lots of patience and a good sense of humor.Management was great very friendly,flexible easy to work with. Co- workers also played a big roll when I first started I didnt know too much but they took the time to help me understand the system.The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers however I learned how to cope with that and still mantaina professional attitude.The most enjoyable part was seeing out regular customers come in and chat about their day."
good,"Typical work day includes receiving the shipment for the day as well as shipping out any product from the previous day. Once received the shipment gets broken down and separated into proper categories. Management is well placed and guidance is given when needed. Friendly work environment all co workers are well informed. "
good,"Nordstrom is a strong and economically flexible company that cares about its employees and customers."
good,"Nordstrom provides a great work environment. There is ample opportunity to sharpen up your skills as a sales person. Management is like most other companies, you either love them or hate them (tolerate them). Co-workers are great but it can be a very competitive work environment. Hardest part of the job was working commissions in a very seasonal environment. The most enjoyable part was the rallies we held most week day mornings before the store opened."
good,So nice to work in a nice place like this.  management was alright until they micro managed you
good,"Assist customers with brand awareness, product location, description and purchases."
good,"Great place to work wouldn't change anything about the company."
good,"fun working place meeting new people and learning new things "

good,"My job experience at Nordstrom was a truly great one. I really learned how to work with customers and coworkers. I had a great management team that was always there to help with any of my concerns and encouraged me to improve in which ever areas I needed to and gave me the support I needed. A typical day would be finding out how the department did the night before, know the numbers we needed to get to reach the day's goals and how much we would like to increase our numbers for the day. Find out what new merchandise we received and learn about the product. Greet customers and help them find what they were looking for and show them our new items. I truly enjoyed my whole day. I really got along well with my coworkers and looked forward to working with them each day."
good,Is a great place to hone sales skills and develop good customer service. The lifestyle can be distracting for those truly after bigger and better things
good,"Just like with any company, the manager can make or break your experience. "
good,Customer service has become my stron point because of this company!
good,"There were no two days that were the same, which is something I always liked."
good,"good place to work"
good,fast paced fun environment with lots of room for advancement. However some managementdi not take responsibility
good,Working in a place with great food is perfect on your lunch break!
good,Helped customers on a daily basis. Small departments promoted family environment with coworkers.  Every employee was friendly. Learned to be tolerable to all customer concerns and requirements.
good,"Worked on a great team where everyone worked together to provide a great product.  "
good,"Loved this job. Co-workers were GREAT, atmosphere was happy and fun. Loved that the company was so client orientated as far as making the customer feel at home and leave the store LOVING the products purchased. If dissatisfied with purchases the customer is able to return/exchange (within reason) with zero hassles. We were, for the most part, able to build our client base and follow up with them to ensure they're satisfaction in the product/shopping experience, I was able to send the customer samples of new fragrance which people LOVE and would come in to see you for doing nice services like this for them, people greatly appreciate that and they definitely show they/re appreciation which is very nice. I would still be at this job if it weren't for the extremely deceitful manner in which my immediate counter manager acted. I was not properly trained, on my 45 day review I did great in all, but 2 categories - 1 of which I was not aware of until that very day! I had not been trained in the particulars of that category and had been continually advised by my immediate manager of the error in ways of my ""competitor"" as far as her disregard for doing any aspect of the job BUT selling and how she would be reprimanded for ignoring all other duties, but if I had also been advised of my goals & particular #'s in which I must meet I would have known to scavenge other counters rather than completing my other required duties.. I would then have had a perfect review score and likely been offered some sort of permanent position. The assistant Dept manager, who conducted the review, acknowledged"
good,"Nordstrom Rack is one of the best places to work, a lot of hours to give and the co-workers are the hardest working people I've ever met. I've learned so much from working there from how to merchandise apparel to planning the schedule, leadership skills and beyond excellent customer service."
good,"Nordstrom is a fast paced, customer service oriented retail store that provides a personalized experience for the customer. In sales, you are completely commission based, which means you create your own paycheck and it's up to you to drive your own business."
good,"Management transparent. Commission based position. Various projects. Various merchandise. Tailor/Seamstress on the premises."
good,"Stock position is not that easy, having to be at work at 4 am and ready to knock out 300+ boxes is sometimes difficult; especially when half of the products needs to be out on the floor before store opening. As a Lead you are responsible for more than just processing merchandise, you are also responsible for sending out products to customers, help manage a team of 4 or more, help train the entire store on new safety guidelines, and you must knowledge in all departments."
good,"As a salesperson at Nordstrom every day is different, it has its ups and downs like any job.  For retail Nordstrom is definitely the place to work."
good,"great workplace, great benefits, great co-workers and customers, management available to help"
good,Great place for sales experience. Managers show lots of favoritism and clique enviroment. Work hard and it pays well. But retail is tough anyways
good,"my time at nordstrom taught me A lot about luxury fashion and great customer service. despite the fact that my previous manger honestly didnt know what she was doing, i would go back to the company. the pay was great the people were great and the opportunity to grow was immense if you love fashion then try your hardest to work at nordstrom"
good,A typical day of work is opening the register and getting your department ready for the day. After that make sales and add on sales while keeping department looking one hundred percent. My co workers at Nordstom's were great and fun to work together we all helped each other with sales and keeping everything looking great. The hardest part of the job was slow days and trying to keep your sales above negative on those particular days. The management staff at Nordstom's were strict and professional.
good,It was a fun and steady job but I felt like I wasn't going anywhere. All around though it was a good working environment.
good,"Nordstrom is a very sound and positive retail environment. There is always a sense of evolution and a strive to improve the shopping experience for the customer. Employees are encouraged to work with a sense of urgency and commitment to the customer. Promotions are achieved through consistency in selling achievements or, if in a role of support, through recognition of performance above and beyond the role of the position."
good,Many opportunities for advancement once you get your foot in the door and continue to work hard
good,"We offer Mobile check out with exceptional customer service.  As a manager I am in charge of checking timesheets, reviewing reports and merchandising the floor.  the store has an incredible staff throughout every department and we all work well together to provide the customer with great customer service.  at the rack you are constantly busy whether it be ringing customers up on mobile, assisting them with shopping help, running go backs as customers try on things or decide they do not want them anymore and filling in merchandise on the floor.  There is never a dull moment at the Nordstrom Rack."
good,"Tho my time there was brief, I looked forward to  working daily in an environment where you truly made a difference in peoples lives by enhancing their appearance."
good,"Great company, sometimes a bit hard to work with. Typical day of selling would be conversing with customers, pulling items and outfits you feel would look great on them. Management was great, although they can be worked a lot harder than their salary pays. There is a bit of healthy competition between coworkers, as you do work off commission. The hardest thing about working for Nordstrom would be making the slower days very productive, and the most enjoyable part would be knowing that you actually worked hard for your paycheck and it is a direct reflection of how much work you actually did."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of side work, serving guest, running food, ringing up orders, and most importantly, providing amazing customer service. Management I was NOT pleased with but my co-workers were amazing! The hardest part of the job was in my opinion, was the management. The most enjoyable part was the look of sincere satisfactory from my guest."
good,Nordstrom is one of the best companies I have ever worked for.  The people make all the difference!
good,"Set and achieved personal sales goals while supporting the goals of other team members. Greeted customers in a timely, professional and engaging manner while providing honest and confident feedback regarding merchandise style and fit.

Worked as a team player to ensure each customer received the best service possible while performing daily department maintenance tasks including stock work, re-merchandising, display, price markdowns, merchandise transfers and light cleaning."

good,"A typical day in my position at Nordstrom would be mainly remaining on the hard-isle, greeting customers with a smile and being knowledgeable of product so that we can help customers find what they need. Management is amazing. We are given requirements, goals, and stock-work each day to keep us busy. The hardest part of the job for me would be creating a memorable sales experience for the customer and building a relationship with them so that the next time they do shop, they will look for me. The most enjoyable part of the job is being genuine and pushing yourself to basically create your own paycheck."
good,It has been a great learing experience and would highly recommend working here to learn job skills. They promote from within and you can rise to management quickly if you have the drive and desire.
good,"I get to help customers pick items that are fashionable and comfortable. I have learned how to use different software on the computer system, and how to recommend accessories. Management is very supportive and the co-workers are always happy to help. The hardest part of the job is when you just cant find the right item for a customer. I do enjoy being able to help customers with a wide variety of tools."

I've learned about great customer service and the importance of providing the customer with a great shopping experience and building relationships. The management and co-workers are very supportive and kind. There are no hard parts of the job and the most enjoable part is seeing the appreciation from customers after giving them great service and watching them leave the store satisfied. "

good,"Everyone is helpful and fun to work with. The management is awesome too. They make sure they provide all the necessary information and help that you need. I love that we have a meeting before opening and closing the store and discuss how we did for the day (sales, performance etc.) I really enjoyed working here because I always felt motivated. Me and my department manager had a healthy competition in meeting our goals so it was really fun especially when i beat him sometimes."
good,there is always fun rally meetings to get the employees spirits up.
good,Awesome place to work for hard-working and go-getters. Your in-charge on running your business; pay-check is up to how much you want to work.

good,Great job to hone mgmt skills. Good culture and values. Lots of options once employed.
good,- Employees are required to stand all day while cleaning and providing customer service.
good,"Nordstrom is a great company that values their workers as well as customers but as a person whos family lives out of the state, with so many months that i am unable to request off it makes it very difficult for me to enjoy and balance a healthy social life with my schedule. It is also not very flexible with me wanting to go back to school full time."
good,Excellent teaching and molding of sales associates into specialists.
good,"active, fun, great people, an awesome evironment, joyful, tons of work"
good,"Love skincare, I started working at Nordstrom to get into skincare sales."
good,"Nordstrom will set you up to succeed or fail. It's what you basically do with it. If you embrace the culture, which is working together with other departments with the end goal of supporting the customer, you will do well with the company. Sometimes, management may have a subjective view at what the customer wants, but with good people at the company, it's usually easy to come to a good end result."
good,Nordstrom is strictly on commission base job. Tough not to know what your bring home at the end of a pay period returns go against your pay. Finding it tough trying to pay for college expenses for daughter on one salary. Customers come first its a fun and friendly atmosphere co-workers all get along. The hardest part of the job are the returns. The most enjoyable are the great customers I have made over the years.
good,"My day at work starts with clocking in and looking at the product the department received that day in shipment. During the 8-10 hours that I'm there the day includes selling the product, making sure the department looks its best, cleaning as much as possible and of course providing the best customer service. I've learned a lot in the 3 years that I've worked for Nordstrom including how to sell everything from clothes, to shoes, jewelry, accessories and perfume. I've learned how to team sell and how to make a sale my own. The management team at Nordstrom are all very dedicated to making work enjoyable and how to make responsible decisions and use your best judgement in every situation. My coworkers are definitely amazing. We've all become very close, we see each other 5 days a week and team selling with them is the best part of my job. The most challenging part of my job is definitely working on commission."
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work at especially if you love working one on one with customers and clothes, everyone that worked with me knew how to put there differences aside and work as a team when needed. The management was also good they always helped when it was needed though I don't believe they were always fair when it came to promotions, overall Nordstrom was an enjoyable job experience"
good,"Working for Nordstrom is great, when youre working with the right people. I really think that they need to really train the people they put as managers. We need leaders not bosses there is a HUGE difference"
good,"The culture of Nordstrom Inc. can best be described as as customer service. Its what we do, and who we are. There is always opportunity for growth and development and it is supported by upper management. The entrepreneurial spirit is encouraged and celebrated. You are running your own business. I have learned a lot working for this company and I know it has only enhanced my customer service talent."
good,"I loved working with the customers as well as my management team, they were very helpful and very motivating."

good,Achieving the stores expectations. I have learned experiences on various levels of store and departments. I have trained and participated with the managers. Team players. Hardest part of the job was relocating to my current state. Most enjoyable part of the job was the different experiences and growth.

good,"Spa Nordstrom has some great therapist. It is a hustle, hustle, kind of job as a 'client coordiantor.'"
good,I really learned what customer service means with Nordstrom. They have great benefits and great salary. You get incentives and recognition for the hard work you do.

good,great place to work in college-sell to satisfy in order to avoid returns.
good,very nice place to work.good benifits.veryclean nice people
good,A typical day at Nordstrom was making sure customer service is our number one priority. I learned how to effectively service customers so that they were completely satisfied upon their departure from the store. Management is always supportive and teaches on the spot. My co-workers always work together as a team. The hardest part of the job was when merchandise is no longer available for customers to purchase. The most enjoyable part of the job is building good relationships with customers so the would return.
good,"Lead Projects that require evaluating carious factor. Work with third party vendors. Performed special assignments for leaders which required researching and collecting information to produce successful events. Working in a team environment to establish strong working relationships. Also handling difficult issues related to customer complaints. Making each customer feel beautiful, confident, and satisfied."
good,Great store to work for.
good,"managers are great to work with ,i loved the atmosphere and it made me great friends ."

good,"You can make a good living as a salesperson if you are willing to work hard and can handle competition. However great the experience you earn if you accept a management role, it is definitely a pay cut."
good,Enjoyed working in the shoe dept. Lots of sales and hours to work
good,Norstrom is a fun environment to work in. There are many departments so you have the opportunity to switch departments. This company promotes from within. If you ever have a problem they are more than willing to help.
good,They pay 14.25 but it isnt  full time you at least get 32 or better. Flexible work hours most people are willing to switch shifts with you and you are given weekends off
good,They offer a wide variety of jobs. The support was great. Within 3 months I had room for advancement and training. A lot of scheduling options were available and also schedule trades.
good,Always something to do.  It is a very good team of employees and the management staff is very supportive.  I would suggest anyone looking for retail experience to look into working for Nordstrom Rack.
good,I was working on the shoe floor and the daily task is to sweep the floor and make sure there are no shoes on the floor as well as heal toe the shoes that are displayed on the rack. Sometimes customers would have questions about sizes and/or style of a shoe and I would have to check the inventory to see if we had it in stock. We could also direct them to another rack location if our store didn’t have what the customer was looking for.
good,"When I first came to HauteLook my new role was great and the opportunity from growth was tremendous. I really enjoyed the company’s energy and the projects I was assigned to were challenging and rewarding. "
good,"I learned how to do a bit of everything I’ve had a taste of working in every department. Wether I’d men’s , woman’s, registers, shoes and stock team. I’m a flexible worker"
good,The pep standard is too high and hard to obtain. Some jobs were too repetitive. The pot lucks were awesome. The communication through building meetings keeps employees well informed.
good,"They value their employees and their customers, but especially value their customers’ money. I didn’t enjoy working here personally because I felt obligated to make sales even if a customer could have gotten something less expensive to serve the same purpose."
good,Great place to work with lots of opportunity for advancement. Progressive work environment with lots of employee interaction from all departments within each store.
good,vary friendly place to work great group rallies with goals in place .activities for break time and special events where set in place for the holidays.
good,"Everyday at Nordstrom was a productive and positive work experience. People are genuinely happy to come into work everyday. Reliable coworkers, supportive management."
good,"Great place to work if you like a fast-paced working environment. Lots of bending, lifting, and standing. Great management that care and fun employees. Downside: Lots of mandatory overtime, on and off."
good,I love my job. I love being able to train and coach my employees and watch the secede at their job. Our company is very inclusive and diverse. We have great 401k program.
good,"Lots of presell in Cosmetics. It can be stressful to meet goals. Nordstrom does have good training programs if you are interested in moving up. The store I worked at was a training store for young managers. Which could be difficult, due to lack of maturity as a new manager for some taking over a large group or department.  The hardest part of my job was preselling on a monthly bases. Due to high goals, and nowadays most people shop online. So this can be pressure.  The enjoyable part is the nice people I worked with and pay is okay in some departments.  "
good,"I truly enjoyed working for Nordstrom.  They had fantastic sales and product training. I was given a schedule that met my needs. My manager was helpful and showed my growth was very important to her. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers. I built many wonderful relationships, and was able to use all of my creative skills."
good,"Gained knowledge of online shopping, Computer Advancement, Incentives, training when necessary, payment via phone, data entry, compose e-mail to send and receive"
good,"I would have loved a place with a little more job security.However, Nordstrom did offer great benefits and employee discounts. The culture was very nice and management were great as well."
good,"I was hired as a Monday thru Friday employee.  It was a seasonal position, which turned into a longtime seasonal.  Soon after, they no longer offered that as an option.  This forced me to change my days I was working.  I am now having to work on the weekend, which interferes with my family life.  It has affected me and missing events/activities stresses me out while at work."
good,"Management was great, helped assist in times of need. They were very knowledgeable about the productions and customer service. Always willing to help."
good,Cosmetic retail as a whole is dying. Nordstrom is one of the better department stores. It is stressful though due to all the eventing you do every single month. You really have to work to build up clientele.
good,"Loved my experience with Nordstrom. Great benefits and great management. I would recommend this job to anyone who has patience dealing with difficult customers, worth the pay."
good,"Having worked picking, packing, shipping, crediting, and inventory, I can honestly say i prefer crediting go anything else. The work is simple, with quantifiable goals and plenty of autonomy. The management changed by department and like anything else there's good and bad managers. I will say that most employees will be willing to tell you who to work for and who to avoid. "
good,If you love a very busy and fast pace environment with a lot of excitement great music and a live DJ then Nordstrom is your place. Be I must advice people to visit the E-Bar cafe on the fourth floor if you enjoy good food and  delicious desserts trust me you won’t be disappointed.
good,Loved working at the Cafe. My manager and staff were great to work with. Miss them all. Any problems we always solved them with each other. We were like family at the Cafe ❤
good,Great environment and everyone in you department is like family. Training is great as well. Typical work day in the kitchen was roughly 7-8 hours but it was enjoyable.
good,One of my favorite parts about working for Nordstrom was designing certain clothing areas and making them appealing to customers. Having my mangers trust me to design it made me feel accepted. I was more willing to discuss with the managerial team about what was selling well and what wasn't and how we could fix it. I love problem solving.
good,"Nordstrom offers the opportunity to learn about different all retail divisions. I started as a sales associate and within 9 months was promoted.  I worked at 2 locations in the past 9 years and managed in 4 departments.  You have amazing co-workers and can make life long friends with customers. If you understand the commitment of being a dedicated Retail associate this is a great company.  "
good,"- gained a lot of experience of the opening of a new store"
good,"The company atmosphere is fun and inviting and there are always people around to answer your questions. "
good,"For retail they will compensate you well.  If you work hard, understand the products and interact with customers properly making a large amount of money is not difficult."
good,"While working in a higher end retailer is nice, but it can be tedious dealing with customers for long extended hours. This position showed me that even though the position is fast paced, the work involved is menial the vast majority of the time."
good,"It's a retail sales job, but it is what you make of it. If you're good at sales, you can ask for opportunities to advance or learn new skills such as merchandising or styling. Moving up in the company can be hard though as it can be very political with department heads trying to steal employees from other departments. Just be ready to sell and stay positive."
good,"I was attending USF in Tampa, FL while working at Nordstrom Rack in Bradenton, FL. The managers were very flexible, allowing me to work two days per week on weekends while still attending school. I made a lot of great friends at this job, people that I still remain in contact with years later. After work we'd go out and get drinks or appetizers, bonding over funny customer experiences. I remember this job fondly and I'm glad that I worked here."
good,Nordstrom is a good place to work to learn basic communication and problem solving skills. I must say it is easy to get stuck in the structure of how the company is run if you do not verbalize your need to advance your career.
good,Great atmosphere. I appreciate the experience there. It taught many things in which I use on the daily basis. Order and organization and key elements of class esteem and character.
good,"Nordstrom is a rewarding place to work with a good culture that puts emphasis on personal responsibility and productivity. The hours are long, but the pay is good and the work is demanding but easy. if you are physically fit enough to walk an average of 15 miles a day, going up and down ladders and tossing around heavy boxes and totes, this job is for you."
good,"I did enjoy working for Nordstrom, and yes, while there were a lot of difficulties with the work and life balance, it was honestly worth it. So long as you were responsible, did your work, and didn't act out, you would be fine. People are really easy to get along with, and I feel like the people that say this is a bad place are people who haven't really put their all into it. I feel that there is some fair treatment, and that irresponsible actions are punished fairly. "
good,"Nordstroms is a good company to work for if you want to get started in the fashion industry. Benefits after 90 days of employment. They acknowledge their employees. If they're doing a good job and meeting the sales goals, you get extra benefits."
good,I enjoyed working at Nordstrom. The management was always very employee first and i feel like many places can learn from that. Sales goals were easily achieved.
good,"Great culture and worklife balance if you are a student in college, usually easy to get promoted if you give effort to your work. "
good,Nordstrom Rack is a great store for a seasonal working positions. End of the year holidays and summer time is a great time to get recruited. It’s not a great store if you’re looking to advance in a high paid career.
good,At nordstom cafe I did feel like I had adequate training but there was never any consistency to my day as most of the employees were also hot heads with management lacking in direction.
good,"Although working retail sometimes sucks, the people you work with make things fun. When the store first opened I had a great time but once people started to show their true colors it wasn't the shoppers who started to upset me it was the employees. But overall I had a great time with helping customers find what they needed. And I loved the employee discount."
good,"I worked at the Ebar so I made coffee and worked the cash register and opened and closed the Ebar. It would get busy and if I was there alone, I had to really practice patience and time management."
good,"It was a alright job, only worked as a seasonal employee. It’s great pay, but when there isn’t a truck to unload is get boring and slow. I would recommend it as a seasonal job, not as a full time position."
good,"Worked here in college and gained a lot of life long friends, but retail is retail. You have to work long hours and make your goals or you won't make the cut."
good,"A typical day at work involves consistently engaging customers from every walk of life. "
good,Young atmosphere with lots of inspiring fashion people . I really liked the employee benefits and the way that management encourage sales through competitions.
good,It was a great place to work. The staff in the other departments were great and both the LP and main manager were great and driven people. However at the time Nordstrom was condensing loss prevention at my specific store and the oppurtunity to advance beyone Loss prevention employee was just not possible.
good,"Nordstrom was a good place to work, everyone was friendly and taught me the necessary skills I needed to work efficiently. I also got a good amount of hours to work at reasonable times during the day."
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for. Nordstrom has an inverted pyramid and focuses on customers and employees. There are a lot of growth opportunities within Notdstrom as well
good,"Having a long culinary background I learned most of my administrative duties working at Nordstrom. I learned how to do invoices, PNL's and all the ins and outs of running a restaurant, front of the house and back."
good,"People are easy to get along with, I was only seasonal and we had a lot of people on every shift so we didn’t have too much work so we cleaned a lot. Need more work."
good,You make good money but it can be stressful if your not used to working overtime around the holidays! A lot of overtime in the summer as well if you're not used to that
good,Flexible schedules great pay and even better pay when you hit your sales goals.  Very sales orientated job.  All in all a good place to work.  Great benefits.
good,"A typical day consists of helping customers find items they want, putting things back in its proper place and putting out new product. I learned how to help customers on a daily basis. I learned more about shoes, how to properly care for them and figuring out what shoe fits a person and there wants/needs. Hardest part of the job would be having so much product and not enough space anywhere in the store to put it. Most enjoyable part would be coworkers and finding the perfect shoe for your customer."
good,"Different challenges this job has to offer. I have learned a lot being with this company for 3yrs. Also, I learned 3 different parts of Nordstrom starting from Nordstrom Rack, to a full line store and a new warehousing experience they providing the year for the New York store in Manhattan (Men’s shop)"
good,"I loved working at Nordstrom. However the store I worked at was going to close down so I started working in Car sales (customer service) The work is very competitive but in a good way, it keeps you on your toes to pay attention fully to each of the customers needs."
good,"Nordstrom is a competitive place to work, but one that offers career opportunities if you are interested and driven to grow. They offer great benefits, along with the opportunity to travel/relocate."
good,"Great work environment. Performance is based off team work. Hardest part of working for nordstrom was my schedule at the time. Most enjoyable part of working for nordstrom was helping out customers. This company taught me how important customer service was, specially in such a competitive business like retail."
good,"Working for Nordstrom literally kept me on my toes. Always on the go, helping customers, organizing the floor or working in the back room. "
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for. They are flexible and great to their employees.The staff is friendly and management is fairly decent to their employees.
good,"I have learned how to sell multiple types of things very effectively, I have made friends and had many fun times and I have developed a routine at work to maintain my time management skills. The hardest part of the job is keeping a routine and scheduling my social life while working such different shifts everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job is the funny conversations I have with my coworkers and the sense of camaraderie we’ve developed throughout the past year."
good,"Very supportive staff for security. High pay is a plus. Good managers to work with. Benefits are pretty good, especially at management level. Can be stressful but all retail work can be."
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for. Working from home is amazing if you are okay with not being around people. The part I loved the moved was being able to interact with people about things pertaining to fashion. I felt like i was at home. We were able to get lots of over time even if we didn't want it but it paid off.
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for especially while in school. Most managers are very flexible with time-off and are very accommodating to each persons needs.
good,"Great place to work, all managers I have had at this job were fair and great to work with. They're flexible with your schedule and want to create a good work/personal life balance. Great for those wishing to have a good career in retail sales as well."
good,"Loved working for Nordstrom's, they really care about their employees. Work environment was relaxed, fast paced as well, but also very professional. Managers were encouraging and helpful, very understanding. Co workers were awesome and always professional and all worked as a team."
good,Loved meeting new people and helping them to look and feel great. I appreciated the opportunity to move up n the company and move around to different departments.
good,"I love working for Nordstrom. The experience with managers vary, but the people are worth it. Most coworkers will help you when cross selling, which is encouraged. If you really like being involved with the customer experience and helping them to their fullest extent, this is the job for you! Management will do their best you help you get to where you want. A few difficulties would be keeping work and life separate. Often times on days off customers will text you wanting something. Making goals when business is slower. However it's all about being a strong team player and all about the customer. Also, store meetings have free breakfast. And some days the store will have contests where you can win coffee cards :) And if you miss your sales goal you only get hourly pay (no commission)."
good,Amazing experience with an amazing group of co-workers. Very supportive system from the managers to the employees themselves. Enjoyed my time working there
good,"Nordstrom is a great company for the possibility of advancement, high earning potential through commission sales, and job benefits. The position of sales can be hard and requires thorough practice in customer service techniques."
good,"It is a company that is task oriented, customer service based, and competitive. Managers push and help you achieve sales goals. Always offer help to train you in other departments."
good,great company who overall supports you in whatever you want to do and if its move up win the company they will help you in any way they can. You can move up quickly if you just create a good rapport and have a great work ethic.
good,Every day starts with a pep rally for the store where we congratulate top sellers from day prior. Managers were very clear what expectations and goals. Closing was very proficient
good,You work off of commision so the drive to sell is hard. The managers set an even floor schedule so workers have equal opportunities to take on clients.
good,it is a great place to work but my direct manager was not very understanding to anyone personal situations. I asked to change my schedule a few times because I lost my car and was not able to get home at the times he was scheduling me for so I put a two week notice in and left.
good,"We would unpack and organize new merchandise for managers to put on their respective sales floors, clean and organize stock rooms, steam new merchandise, and take markdowns. Do web fulfillment orders."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Nordstrom and would actually go back to work there. I left because of just one manager and he's since moved on to another location. But I would go back and work for this company in a heartbeat. They give great discounts to employees, the staff itself is top-notch, the service is incomparable, since Nordstrom's prides itself with it's second-to-none customer service. Employees are taken care of and there is room for growth, if that's what you're looking for."
good,"They had continual training for employees"
good,worked for the company for several year at multiple locations in full line and rack. times have changed in the retail environment. Overall I enjoyed my time at Nordstrom. Competitive pay and best benefits package around for a retail job.
good,fun place to work..good upper management team..cares for employees.   Good place for internship and to learn good customer service..offers good employee discounts and flexible with hrs
good,Selling shoes at Nordstroms was fun and fast paced! I loved helping families find what they needed and sometimes mediating between kids and parents for a happy resolution.  I also love teaching kids to tie shoes with my shoe fairy!
good,"A typical day of work consists of smiles (whether genuine or not, its retail) and finding something to do. There is always something to do, and if there isn't, you have to find one. My managers were quite friendly, and my co-workers were mostly warm and happy to help me catch on to the work. Job positions were extremely fluid as I was constantly learning how to do something new that ranged out of my initial job description in order to increase productivity. Nordstrom is extremely customer focused and competitive. From my first interview, they were pushing me to learn how to sell credit cards. This was the hardest part of my job as a sales associate. You're always supposed to push the card to everyone over 18; they say if you're doing your job right, you'll sell one a day. Despite the incessant reminders of credit cards, the culture was enjoyable. My work team was quick to congratulate you on a job well-done"
good,"Excellent place to work, especially if you like friendly competition. Management team is fair and often helps out on the sales floor when necessary. Culture: highly competitive."
good,"I loved working there because of the customers and managers. My coworkers, on the other hand, were stuck up, rude, snotty, and needlessly bitter. A few times, they'd try to steal my sale."
good,"Most days are exactly the same, the only thing that is constantly changing are the customers.  It is more competitive for yourself, as you are trying to make as much money through every sale as possible, but it is also fun to see who sold the most on your team on a specific day."
good,"Throughout my time at Nordstroms I learned about sales, engaging the customer as well as creating an experiance for the customer while shopping. It was a great learning process for me."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the customer and fulfill their needs by interacting with them as well as incorporating selling methods to increase product sales. I learned a lot about different products and the art of a successful retail business.
good,Nordstrom is wonderful company with good benefits and wages. It is clean and organized with great work ethics. I would recommend it to anyone looking to work there.
good,"As with all commissioned jobs, there is a high demand for performance. During the slow shopping seasons is it difficult to make sales goals without stepping on each other's toes."
good,Great place to work easy environment to work in constantly moving time goes pretty fast you get 2 10 min rest periods and you can listen to music in the warehouse
good,"I really valued working as an Assistant Visual Manager at Nordstrom.  The visual team is a support team that supports the store and requires a lot of collaboration with various teams through out the store.  I enjoyed coaching and developing our team of stylist and the teamwork that is required to work in visual.  Visual has a lot of fashion and creative outlets through styling, but also technical and tactical skills, such as, meeting deadlines for many projects."
good,"While the commission system was competitive, I made great friends. Employees were generally friendly."
good,I enjoyed the job and working as part of a team. The job demanded extreme focus and was physically demanding- the challenge was rewarding. I always came home at the end of the day feeling accomplished. Management was very supportive and encouraging.
good,"Nordstrom where I come from has such a reputable name. Everyone wants to work there and it is a great company. The management when I worked at the Nordstrom in Las Vegas, was not up to the standards I thought it should be. I know now they are under new management and I hope that they are doing better."
good,"I developed great communication skills while working at Nordstroms. Working in a sales/comission environment dealing with the general public is not easy, but may be very rewarding. You will meet many wonderful people and will build your network. The problem with Nordstrom is that, the retail world is thriving only in the online spectrum. People are not shopping in store anymore unfortunately, due to effortless and efficiency of online shopping."
good,"Easy starting day, usually come and have a chat with coworkers and managers about the days tasks. Slow buildup to the daily afternoon and early evening rush. In an 9 hour shift you're provided 2 ten minute break and a one hour lunch. Common for you to stay after your scheduled time to help clean area."
good,"Very fun place to work. The focus at Nordstrom was always customer service. They c=value customers and their needs. During sale time, t can be extremely hectic and intense!"
good,"Nordstrom is a place that is good for College students looking to work in an environment that is busy and social. Making sales is what made your pay check so depending on you’re work effort is how you can determine your pay. Not only is it a good job to start a career at but if for those who are even just looking for an occupation to keep them busy, Nordstrom was a place that never seem to be slow compared to other retail jobs. I would recommend working at the Nordstrom in Walnut Creek, Ca. not only because that was my prior store but for the enviroment and management. The business was always steady and the employees and management was always there’s to help when there were struggles."
good,"I loved working at Nordstrom before the mall implemented paid parking. Our business decreased significantly, and it became stagnant. "
good,Wonderful culture.  Wonderful managers.  But low pay for analysts compared to industry standards.  Many opportunities to move to different divisions and learn different aspects of the business.
good,great place  to be at lots of opportunity to grow and  growth with in the companys  also has a good care package and great attendance  this is something i perfer for those who are in school o
good,Everyday was different and exciting. Training was in depth and self propelled. Teams were helpful and there are many avenues for advancement. Great pay for a work at home position.
good,i'm very please to be working there. i come from a previous job that was very stressful and over demanding. my current position lets me have creative freedom which make my work very enjoyable. the staff are nice and everyone is on the same page of relaxing and doing their job well.
good,"While I worked here at Nordstrom, I picked up and learned a lot about Management skills, The work at Nordstrom was your like ever other retail work. Load and unload trucks of merchandise. Monitor the inventory, and make sure the store did not run out of supplies,"
good,"Very fun place to work, I would go on sales floor and pick items that customers purchased online. Then we would bring them to the back and wrap them up to be sent out to the customer."
good,"Great place to work. Fun and welcoming atmosphere. Great management and team environment. I really enjoyed my Nordstrom experience, I learned a lot and grew as a person."
good,"The best job anyone could ever have if the support and management is there. One must show daily positive attitude and be a strong seller if you want to move forward. It is about politics, but if you know how to sell and your manager likes you, you shall be fine. You won’t always have the best manager because there is constant promotion, but when you find the good ones make sure you hold on to them no matter where they go they will always vouch for you."
good,"Typical day would include going through the back entrance to clock in and heading down to the sales floor. At that point my shift would begin and helping customers find what they are looking for in the jewelry department on a commission salary."
good,"stressful environment, commission job. You can handle if you sales oriented person."
good,My job at Nordstrom was pretty relaxed most of the time and it was nice working in a small restaurant as I got to know all of my co-workers pretty well.
good,I enjoy working at Nordstrom Rack because the employees are a great group of people to work with.  Everyone is very helpful and the managers have great dispositions.
good,"Nordstorm had a great work environment. I liked my coworkers and we all helped each other out as a team. I left for personal reasons related to a family member's death and while Nordstrom was very accommodating and even paid bereavement, I could not continue on at that time."
good,Im not writing anything iabout them because I honestly dont care. This is just to submit all the questions I did answer so this isnt a complete waste. Good place to work if you must work retail but returns suck. The end
good,"Nordstrom Rack in Sugarhouse was a very fast paced and often stressful job. Despite how chaotic it was on a day to day basis, the skills I gained from the experience have proven to be beneficial in many aspects of my life."
good,Great place to work but has made some major changes in its structure. Full-line stores can get hard due to commission issues. Rack environment is good but can be stressful.
good,"i loved this job and the discount is awesome, i loved the fast paced environment on weeknds and the employees made the work days fun and go by fast, i would work there again"
good,"I learned alot "
good,"The atmosphere is generally positive. The benefits at great, especially compared to sales associates positions in other companies. Nordstrom believes in hiring from within, which is great, but just be prepared, that before you get to corporate, you'll spend 7+ years as an associate, assistant manager, and then managememt before you can apply."
good,"I learned customer service. What Nordstrom stands for is customer service and how to make the customer happy."
good,"Very exciting and enthusiastic environment. "
good,"while working at The Nordstrom Rack was very intense and fast pace at times, it was enjoyable to g to work and was an amazing first job.  It taught me so much about how to manage my time and how to keep calm in stressful situations.  There were MANY stressful situations and it would get extremely busy.  Despite all that it gave me a confidence i never knew I had an the people that work there are nothing short of amazing.  they were definitely the most enjoyable pat of the job."
good,Had fun and learned a lot.. Worked my way up to the number one sales rep on the floor while still remaining fair and professional.  I only had to leave do to re locating.
good,"clock into work. greeting everyone on the floor.. check for new products & placement of new products. I check to see how much in returns I have for the day so I know how much I need to sell. Even tho its a job & commission based, it was like I was working with my family."
good,Good Culture Any one can enjoy working here. Good work life balance. Fun at work includes  Foosball tables and ping pong tables. Provide great  technology as  well
good,Really cool job but i didnt have a car and the walk from the bus stop to the store is really far to walk every day back and forth but the customers there are awesome and some of the management is great. one of the male managers  had a habit of flirting with the employees but i never had a problem with him
good,"I was able to learn a lot through my experiences at Nordstrom. It was the closest thing I had to a ""real company"" experience. The job culture is very competitive as most people work on commission."
good,"the hardest thing about the job was a lot of work done within short time. Also it was a week contract, i wish they offered a full time or part for the staff worked for there for a while."
good,Working at Nordstrom has been a blast. I am learning allot since I've started working day. The managers each have their management styles. each employee has their own spark.
good,"I love the Nordstrom culture. They make sure customers are always first and management is there to support their employees. The benefits are amazing as well. The hardest part of the job would include a difficult work and life balance. Due to being in customer service, you must sacrifice family events or any event that will fall on a weekend or holiday. However, it is very rewarding to see that you can be the best part of someones' day by providing wonderful service to them."
good,There are some talented and hard working people at Nordstrom. Most of them are very friendly. Overall a good place to work. I left due to health reasons.
good,"Working as a counter manager helped me become better at planning day by day sales, and managing my own counter. The managers were very encouraging, and were always happy to provide the tools we need to succeed. We all worked as a team, and respected each other. I would definitely want to work for Nordstrom again."
good,"its a good place to work. there is a lot to  learn. its fast paced but the food is always good.the hardest part of the job is cleaning the kitchen, its a high standard but you feel proud to work there."
good,"As a caveat, working at Nordstrom will not be everyone's cup of tea mostly depending on which department you are placed in. That being said, overall I really enjoyed working with the full line store although I worked in the women's shoe department during the anniversary sale. The environment was friendly, overlooking the standard hiccups of retail. Management was good, friendly, and approachable. I personally did not enjoy working in the women's shoe department as it was not my cup of tea, however, I would most definitely love to work at Nordstrom again in a different department. If you wish to apply to and or work for one of Nordstrom's full line department stores, go for it."
good,A typical day at Nordstrom is so stress free because it is like you are basically running your own business. It can get competitive because it is commission based. The hardest part of the job is not having enough products to sell to customers who want to spend. The most enjoyable part of the day is getting paid to help others spend their money in order to help them look great.
good,"I truly believe in the Nordstrom culture.  As a single parent, it was difficult to work for Nordstrom.  The schedules were created  two to three weeks ahead making it difficult to maneuver around my children's schedule."
good,"I've been with Nordstrom since 2014 and it has been a pleasant experience. A lot of opportunities for cross-training in different roles and departments within the company."
good,"Working for Nordstrom was very pleasant and meaningful. I learned a lot about customer service, initiative, snd how to deal with unorthadox situations."
good,High fashion environment.  Company is forever changing. Promote from within mentality is motivating but like in most business who you know makes a huge difference in you level of success and speed of growth. Great training programs.
good,"Typical day at work was very smooth. The coworkers were very nice and dedicated. The store manager was very caring and made the store feel more comfortable. The pay was GREAT, just the job in general was good."
good,"Great work environment, also have plenty potential to grow. You must actively let management know if you would like to grow with the company. The con is the commission is not great because you can have a really great check or a not so good one."
good,"Nordstrom provides an engaging and positive workplace environment. Work life balance is valued highly and there is a strong emphasis on building and maintaining strong relationships. The open door policy is consistently used, allowing all employees access to all management levels."
good,"you have the opportunity to make endless amounts of money"
good,You had better be prepared to work for yourself. Fast pace and always looking for something to be done. The chance to be successful fully depends on you.
good,"Possibilities of advancement, you must have a very sales-oriented, ambitious personality to be successful.  Like most places managers pick favorites, so make sure you are the favorite."
good,"If you enjoy sales, this is a great place to work, a super positive environment and a team of people that genuinely care about their customers. The better you are the more you make, its commission based but usually even an average salesman has a pretty decent check."
good,"I enjoyed working with  the public in an upscale department store.  I worked with a great group of guys who  always made the job fun.  I was on commission. This meant that my income level was limitless.The hours were good and fair to  me.  I also enjoyed dressng in men's latest fashion."
good,I loved working at Nordstrom Rack in San Francisco. The team was great and the management was outstanding. The environment was fast paced and energetic.
good,Nordstrom is a very fast pace environment that gives you the opportunity to build relationships and improve your customer service skills. The company has an open door policy and management is always available to guide and assistant you with any issues.
good,"Having fun with customers"
good,"I worked here for 4 years until the last year, where things got tense because of all the changes and not making our sales. the employees did not feel supported by the company"
good,"Due to a strong in-house hiring programs not all managers were as qualified and suited for their positions as should be.  A hands-off culture, you do not get micromanaged."
good,I am in charge of stock for both men's departments. I also help the sales team with ringing up their customers. It is also my job to take care of RACKING and other merchandise that is supposed to be transferred out of the store.
good,"Nordstrom Rack is a good place to work. The management is well-trained and exemplifies what the company stands for.  The benefits are great if you want a career out of Nordstrom.  As a student, my bosses were always great about accommodating my school schedule."
good,This place is a lot of fun if you like to work with people and play with makeup! Be sure to be sales savvy or it will be a bit of a struggle. Not meant for people who aren't energetic.
good,"My hard work was always rewarded and I was able to move up very quickly with this company.  They also made it relatively easy to explore different options if you were looking for a career change.  The training was minimal for most jobs I held and I was thankful for my previous years of experience in sales management to get me through.  But there was never any shortage of resources to reach out to if I needed help.  Most positions I held also involved the freedom to manage my department and my team how I saw fit, with little micro managing...provided expectations were being met, of course.  In my time there I saw many people leave to pursue other opportunities and eventually make their way back to Nordstrom which I found to be a true testament to the company's culture."
good,"The customer service experience is top notch at Nordstrom. They employ dedicated, genuine people who truly care about helping their customer. Seeing this relationship as a customer, I had to be a part of the team to help me sell more effectively. The management does a really good job at communicating ways to effectively increase business and improve the relationship with the customers. The commission sales environment is a challenging one because the compensation is reliant on the seller's work ethic and willingness to adapt. I learned that I have to be consistent every single day in order to make enough money to survive there."
good,"As a student, it is hard to find a job that works well with a busy school schedule. Nordstrom has never complained or denied me time off for being in school. Even if an event comes up last minute, my managers have always worked with me."
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom for me would involve doing the necessary daily tasks that will support the sales floor with selling the product which is coming in early, scanning the sales floor for ay sale items, processing merchandise and bringing them to the right department, stock items and make sure every aspect of my job is up to standard."
good,"This is a great place to work. The pay is good, benefits (as a part time employee) are also good, and the employee discount is nice. I enjoy going to work."
good,Great place to work. Typical day is working with a great team. You learn to help all types of customers. Management for the most part appreciate the workers.
good,"Nordstrom was a great company to work for.  My only suggestion is to do as your told and let your work show for you.  It takes time to be promoted, but if your patient it will happen."
good,"Nordstrom was an experience; and anyone whose worked there in the past or currently works there now will tell you the same thing. The environment is very diverse and you could actually make some good friends there. "
good,"It was a good job aside, Easy, learned personal life lessons. "
good,"Productive work environment. Preparation is key for handling your day to day clients, customers, and presentation of the merchandise. I learned how to be versatile with each of my clients needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and networking between customers and coworkers."
good,"Absolutely love the company. They like to promote from within which is great, and they give you the tools to do so if that is what you want! Everyday is a new day and theres always something fun to do. Selling clothing is a blast and the people you met are awesome."
good,Great place to work I've managed I've been a personal stylist and a sales person here.   They are very fair and believe in family values and offering the best customer service a company could ever ask for .
good,"The people there are great!"
good,"The company believes solely on customer service and expects every customer to be treated as the main priority. Constantly learning new selling skills to encourage sales and motivate employees. The company is based on commission, therefore it has a very strong competitive environment. Competitive environment does create tension between employees but it also help each person overcome obstacles and improve weaknesses. Nordstrom is always an upbeat company, constantly finding ways to get everyone interested and to participate in activities into improving the company."
good,"Overall, friendly environment with people who were willing to help when clarification was needed. Department manager worked with schedule and co-workers supported each other during rushes, restock, and prep for the following day."
good,Nordstrom has a great work environment with supporting managers and team members. It is also a competitive work environment where you have to meet daily goals.
good,"Nordstrom is a great starting job for any fashion/retail graduate. Management was very easy to work with. The job is commission based,  so it can be stressful to work with other employees when you are constantly competing for sales. Nordstrom rewards employees with promotions."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for this company. I had to ability to easily relocate from a store in Philadelphia to The Grove, Los Angeles. After a year and a half my skills, dedication, and interest in styling were recognized and I was promoted. With commission you have the opportunity to advance your salary with your own efforts."
good,"Various responsibilities in management and project implementation.  Collaborated with a extensive group of managers and end users on a daily basis.  Purchased, tracked and communicated equipment needs vital to implementation."
good,Nordstrom empowers their employees to be curious and seek opportunity especially when associates are mobile. They offer competitive benefits and are very transparent in the development of their talent.
good,It was a great job to learn from and to grow from. Every day was a new opportunity to make more money and to meet new people . I learned a lot. I used to be a very shy person thanks to nordstorms I'm more open and sociable .
good,"Fun place to work and great compensation. Overall, a great company. The managers are fun and energetic. Upbeat environment."
good,The work environment was very productive always kept myself busy. I enjoyed interacting with customers and building up my client tel book. It also gave me chance learn and know the products we sell.
good,Nordstrom is an excellent place to work! It is fast-paced and busy which is always nice and I've built a family with my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I've helped someone find the perfect shoe and make their day. Working here has been such a wonderful experience for me.
good,"great benefits such as paid time off, and health care benefits as well as a 401k. flexible schedule and fast paced commission sales pay. commission sales are very stressful because while your pay check is different every month, your bills stay the same. not only that, but when a customer returns a product they purchased from you, you are in negative sales and have to sell even more to compensate for the return. it has been a little bit slower these past few years since everyone has made the shift to online shopping so the in store employees are earning less money."
good,"Nordstrom really values its customers and makes working there feel like you are part of a family. It was fun to work, because everyone was so friendly and willing to help you. The managers are very fun to be around and know a lot about their area of expertise. I absolutely love this job and the community it has while working."
good,"I worked for Nordstrom for 6 years.  I loved it there and still consider it one of the best places I have ever worked.  I worked on the support side in many different roles at both The Rack and the full line store.  Unfortunately, my last position moved to Seattle and I tried to get many other support positions before I eventually left the company.  I have considered going back over the years, but I make more now doing similar tasks for another company.  I did receive some great experience there though and highly recommend working for the company if you are just starting out."
good,"A great place to work for a call center. Management is extremely helpful. Advancement is based on individual performance. Co-workers are all willing to help out. A typical day consisted of answering inbound calls and resolving customers concerns. Management believes in a one call resolution approach, not how many calls you can take in a day. Give out a lot of perks for not missing work and/or helping out with overtime as needed."
good,"Working with Nordstrom ECFC was really nice. The pay was good, the co-workers from each department were very easy to get along with as well as the managers/supervisors. My only real complaint is that the hours start EXTREMELY early if you're first shift. You can start your shift as early as 4am. The opportunity to grow is very real with the annual raises based on performance and productivity initiative also their hiring process within the company."
good,"Working at Nordstrom gave me the opportunity to excel in being a better sales associate, by teaching me patience and determination."
good,I learned a lot from Nordstrom. It was the battleground and effectively shaped me into the customer conscious and aware customer representative that I am today. This was also the point in my life where I worked the hardest for compensation that was not very competitive when compared to other comparable High end retailers. With ever increasing work loads and pressure to maintain increases for every year the company often times does not accept ebb and flow as a reality in the often volatile retail market.
good,"Definitely a place for young fashion forward individuals, fast growth but needs more work life balance still great place to get inspired."
good,Working here was fun and I loved it because I do love fashion. The company itself was pretty great; we had great benefits. The only downfall was the management within the department i was in.
good,My typical day would be a store meeting with staff before the doors open..Ive  learned so many procedures in 20yrs its a lot to write down.Developed a lot of long standing friendships.The hardest part of the job is when your preordering and getting ready for triple points selling answering phones.The people and the products but I always go back to the people.
good,"we worked together as a team,long paying hours,and great hours. Manager micro-managed which was a little annoying. staff was great and great work life balance"
good,"This a great place to work if you are able to understand the competitive work environment. It is a high selling commission environment that is either for you or not. I thrived in this environment because I love helping people, and would find that it was a great work life balance while making friends as well. "
good,"I absolutely love the atmosphere at Nordstrom, makes you feel at home but yet at work. The managers I've come across have all been very understanding and flexible. although at times the sales can get very stressful and hectic, meeting goals and all, you can still find a way to overall enjoy what you do."
good,"Working in the Nordstrom has taught me skills that I will take with me to further any career path I chose. The Nordstrom culture teaches the importance of relationship building in the workplace to drive business, and also the ability to be yourself to put customers at ease and build a relationship of trust."
good,"A typical morning shift consisted of building or moving fixtures, planning out displays for new merchandise. Day shifts would usually focus on filling in stock, cleaning, running go-backs, assisting customers, answering customer phone calls, re-ticketing items."
good,"All in all its as good as a job in retail gets. However there is no work life balance. You are working part time but are working 5 days a week  and even though you are only getting paid for 7 hours you can be there for up to 8 1/2 hours. The problem is there are no ""morning or evening shifts"" You can be asked to come in from 12-9 all week, so you end up doing absolutely nothing."
good,I love interacting with customers. Educating them about coffee. Having them leave with a smile on their face. Expert multitasker.
good,"During my day of work i will help all members of the staff if they have any questions, customers as well. As a lead im always turned to for answers and without a doubt Ive always had an answer"
good,"Working at the rack is great, its just the people that make things a little hard. Shifts go by fast. I work with great people. this is the first job where i felt like i belonged"
good,Shifts are typically 6 hours long with a lot to do. Store management is very social and friendly however the in-store cafe management left a lot to be desired. Coworkers were friendly and helpful. We worked as a great team. The hardest part of this job was prioritizing efficiently to get all the work done. However the benefits package came with a discount on merchandise.
good,"What a great employer! Good benefits if you want them, very flexible, professional with employees and customers alike, and promotes from within."
good,"Absolutely love Nordstrom. Great people, atmosphere, and a healthy competitive environment. They really want to see a person succeed and build their own business."
good,"I've been employed with Nordstrom for almost 6 years. It is a fun place to work. I've worked at both the full line store as well as the rack. The full line store is great if you love really interacting with customers and building relationships, its also commission which means the pay can be up and down. The Rack will be perfect for you if you like working in a very fast pace environment( it gets REALLY busy) the pay is hourly but the hours aren't if you;re not a manager or sales lead! They do focus ALOT on opening store credit cards but you get paid for it. My coworkers are cool; management.... eh!"
good,"Great company if you are able to move around the US for advancement. Not a good place for you if you like your nights, weekend, summers, and holidays."
good,This has been a great place to work while in college. Management is understanding of my school schedule and works with me when things come up that are priority.
good,a typical day at work would be to help customers in the apparel dept. and lingerie also working with commission it was always a competition. What i learned at Nordstrom was how to sell items .
good,"While sales in retail is usually seasonal, associates are encouraged to create lasting relationships with their personal customers."
good,"My co-workers are amazing; helpful, friendly, caring and compassionate.  Whether I need assistance or advice at work or outside of work I can count on them.  I have to say, Nordstrom handpicked some of the best people whom share the same morals and values."
good,"I play an integral part in teaching and coaching new service experience specialist processes, procedures, daily task, and initiatives. My work ethic and speedy approach to addressing all customer and employee interactions sets her apart from the rest of the team. I balance department responsibilities without impacting service and coaching, and share ideas that will drive service and volume. My knowledge and expertise is invaluable! My Team is fortunate to have my energy, passion, and commitment to leaving the store better than i found it."
good,"A typical day at work would be educating and fitting customers in bras based on their every day lifestyle."
good,"A balance is required from each of us throughout our shifts, stocking, organizing, connecting with customers, and of course, setting ALWAYS the most desired place to shop because of the experiences had when inside our doors."
good,It was always a pleasure working at Nordstrom. The management is usually very competent and understanding.
good,Sense of teamwork in my team. Analytical skills required. Open door policy. Good communication with manager.  Your team and your managers want you to succeed in your role. Open to talking about future jobs and career goals.
good,"I enjoyed working for Nordstrom for a couple of reasons. First and foremost I had many fortunate opportunities for advancement that allowed me to grow as a professional, shop keeper, and leader.  Secondly, I learned more about the fashion industry than I had ever hoped for."
good,"Nordstrom as a company is by far one of the best companies I have ever worked for. The company has outstanding standards with all employees and for customer satisfactory. Ultimately, I learned how being engaged with coworkers makes working at a company a lot easier to go to everyday. My typical day at Nordstrom started at 4:00 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. and having the responsibility to ensure that the store was clean before 10:00 a.m.often times 8:00 a.m. or 9:00 a.m. for the delight of making this company look like the bright star in the sky for customers to look to for fashion service. Although, I am in disregard of my personal manager, he often was a good manager. From the store manager to each individual store manager, they all treated the support and sales team as if they were happy to see you.There was a balance with coworkers was great, we all worked to cover all open spots to ensure that the job needed was finished before the store opened. We all communicated effectively if we were running late or not coming to work at all. The hardest part of the job was getting to work on time with few hours of sleep."
good,Your earnings are unlimited and great way to meet new people.
good,"A typical day at work is first and foremost is to make sure the product is on the sales floor so each customer can have the best shopping experience.  The main priority each day is to make sure all my customers have the best shopping experience by going above and beyond to make sure they get the right products for their needs.  Spending quality time with each customer and make sure I understand clearly that their needs are.  If we do not have what they are looking for, I would try to find it in another store and have it shipped to them. I helped my customers with fashion ideas when it is needed. I would also follow up with my customer and make sure they are happy with their purchase.  I learned that the customers are my boss and they are the ones that keep the business growing.  I worked with a great group of friendly people including my boss.  I had a very good relationship with all my co-workers.  In all my working years I never consider any part of my job to be hard or difficult because everything I do at work makes me more successful. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my customers.  I treated all my customers the way that I would like to be treated and that makes me feel rewarded.  I also like working with my co-workers because team wins."
good,"Consistently give outstanding internal/external customer service. Set the bar for my team by continuously achieving personal productivity. Meeting monthly/weekly deadlines by reporting all pertinent information to account executives and coordinators. Writing monthly schedules, calculating revenue, counter and personal/team goals. Maintaining steady communication with buying office to guarantee appropriate stock levels. Event prep and execution, booking and following up with clients. Striving to create an efficient and effective style of management to generate maximum revenue and maintain a healthy counter morale"
good,"The company is good about keeping employees excited about the company direction and success. It is not unusual for quarterly business meetings to include a recap of the quarter's success with some sort of fun video or slideshow presentation that keeps the audience engaged and intrigued, especially in marketing."
good,"I would help customers to find the perfect pair shoes, build relationships with them, and try to sell sell sell. Had nice customers 85% of the time. My co-workers and I were like family, probably the best part of my job. My department managers were great too, always encouraging and willing to help the employees."
good,"• Sell, sell, sell"
good,Overall a great company to work for. Hours can be inconsistent and expected to work weekends and most holidays. Great company culture and opportunities for advancement.
good,I like how the management lets the worker to be cross-trained in their jobs.
good,Nordstrom Credit was a nice place to work. Great pay. Very nice working environment and benefits. The only minus is the hours you have to work could change daily.
good,"This is a very fun place to work with great customers. It can be a little competitive among sales associates, but overall Nordstrom is a great place to work. They benefits package is a little tricky and based more on the hours you work."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of reviewing the previous day's reporting in order to see how sales were in the department. This would include looking into top items sold and top vendor performances. The majority of the rest of the day is spent of the sales floor teaching and coaching the team, and most importantly, selling to customers and providing exceptional customer service."
good,"I held this job while I was going to school, and they were great about working with my school schedule and knowing that school came first, but still giving me hours to keep me at a full time status. They are also great with advancement, and while I didn't personally participate in the program, they do have programs that you can go through to advance to the next level. I loved the customer interaction with helping them find what they need. I had great co-workers and there were some pretty great managers that were at my store as well."
good,Nordstrom is a high end fashion industry in which they go by the inverted pyramid which means Customers always are the first priority then it goes down from there to employees to the management. I loved this job because it was actually all it said it was it wasn't a lie. They showed how much they cared about customers daily not only that but the management shows care towards the employees there is not one time i felt uneasy here. Nordstrom is the best place I've likewise they have the best benefits.
good,"I maintained the department, made costumer purchases, and trained new employees."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at the E-bar. It was a flexible, fast paced environment that provided me the opportunity to network with a lot of different people on a day to day basis."
good,"A typical day involves helping sales associates ring up their sales, opening new accounts, and primarily taking care of returns. I learned to deal with customers who are less than polite, and how to work hand-in-hand with the managers. The hardest part of the job was definitely having ten people all wanting to get their purchases either rung up or returned, while dealing with telephone orders and online orders. The most enjoyable part was meeting all sorts of people and conversing with them while taking care of the transaction."
good,"I was initially apart of the opening when the Arborland location opened so I have been with this Nordstrom Rack since it's beginning. Starting off as a temporary rover, I wasn't guaranteed a full time position. But with hard work I was placed into the Service Experience Team. I worked there for half of the year, and then moved into shoes and accessories. I wanted to be a versatile worker, knowledgeable about everything that I could get my hands on. "
good,"Love working and dealing with customers. Management is great, you learn time management. The hardest part of the job is being able to multitask and service customers efficiently."
good,As each customer came into your department we were to greet them and asked if they needed assistances. We would also assist customers who would call in have troubles on the website or wanted to know if we had specific items in stock in the store. I learned a lot about customer service and how to work within the work environment. Each employee was to work alone along with trying to be the best for the store and the company. Management was there to guide you if anyone needed assistance. The hardest part of this job was learning how to interact with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was that it was so rewarding helping someone find exactly was they wanted along with some extra items.
good,"Great atmosphere to work in. Nice co-workers, nice customers, and a relaxed setting."
good,"There's a lot more to being a shoe sales person than most people think. It takes a lot of patience, and hard work. It's a physical and emotional job because there are flights of stairs, which we have to take in order to get the shoes. That gets draining after a busy day, which is one of the hardest parts but also maintaining the right amount of patience with each customer. You must listen to their needs and requirements no matter how out of range they may be. There are times where I will have four customers at once and I use multitasking skills to my best ability. "
good,"Since my time at Nordstrom Rack it has been a rewarding and great experience. I learn something new everyday and there is always work to be done. The rack is very fast paced having a lot of foot traffic comes through our doors than at full-line Nordstrom. I work in customer service so I deal everything customer related whether it be ringing purchases on the register, offering our fashion rewards program, dealing with customer issues and information, or always providing excellent service. It's nice to know that I look forward to coming to work and exceeding expectations but also sharing the same amount of effort as everyone that I work with. Communication is very important from all departments, team members, and management. Without it confusion would unfold. Management are motivated and show they care about their employees and store environment. I am still learning everything about my job. There are times when I have to use my best judgement in a situation that may take place. If it becomes too big for me to handle thankfully management is there to help. I enjoy when customers leave our store knowing that they got the best service done with a smile and thank you. Customer service is definitely my calling and I love it. I am hoping to grow with the company and move up in leadership when the time is right."
good,"Good place to work, can listen to music, have phine. Best break room ive seen at a job. Everyones friendly,"
good,"A typical day consists of assisting with floor merchandising of new products. I often help with the daily schedule, filling out sales and projected goals. I'm personally responsible of making sure I contact clients and update them on purchases and inform them of any news that I feel benefits their needs. As the day progresses, I need to make sure I'm properly greeting customers, relaying informative product knowledge and making sure my personal sales numbers reflect my goals. I must also follow-up with clients, engage with new customers and make sure any projects my manager issues are fulfilled by the end of my scheduled shift."
good,"Nordstrom is renowned for their outstanding customer service reputation, and I was truly honored to be a part of the company. I met some incredible clients and learned a lot about how to be a gracious and tenacious professional. I was able to offer our customer every possible perk of the Nordstrom experience, which is a great privilege. "
good,"My favorite part of this company is their motto ""use your best judgement"".  I can solve customer complaints within my best judgement without having to ask permission every time.  I truly feel like a small business owner."
good,"It's ok, great benefits though. MANAGEMENT COULD IMPROVE ALOT!!!!"
good,I learned how a company builds a store from the ground up. It was a great experience and I loved my co workers.
good,"My everyday Tasks included making the schedule, Merchandising, Processing daily reports, Creating goals, selling, and teaching new hires selling techniques."
good,"A typical day at work involved intense organization. Each person is to keep up with customers/clients. Management does a great job of allowing you to micro manage yourself, but at the same time guides you in keeping up with your goals as a Nordstrom employee. Having a strong but positive personality is always key when working at Nordstrom because of the competitive nature of the job. That would be the challenge for some, but it definitely pushes you to succeed in a healthy way. The most enjoyable part of my position is working to please my customers. I found my satisfaction in giving my customer something to smile about after they made their purchase whether big or small."
good,Everyday is a fun productive day working at Nordstrom!
good,They hold a high standard but they pay pretty good. I learned to be efficient at all times in the workplace. Management is really helpful and they train employees thoroughly.
good,"I always felt comfortable at the job. I always felt respected and was treated fairly. I had great management, although I can't speak for everyone when I say that. There were plenty of opportunities to advance which I would have taken advantage of if that were my field. I was disappointed to leave the position."
good,"Responsible for creating and maintaining customer relations through verbal/written communication and marketing, in order to optimize sales and meet department goals. Also periodically analyzed market trends and adjusted merchandise accordingly."
good,I absolutely loved working at Nordstrom my only problem was some of the coworkers are catty. I am no longer working there because I got into it with a coworker but I love the job my manager was awesome I love the pay
good,"Keep customers number one, and you can go far with this company."
good,Great place to work at if you like warehouse jobs. You can learn alot in one day.
good,"As a sales ""rep"" for Laura Mericer at Nordstrom I was very interactive with the public everyday. Explaining, demonstrating and teaching the products to people is what I felt I did exceptionally well. I loved the people that also worked at Nordstrom and we all got along well. The hardest part of the job was meeting your sales goals on the slower days and making up for them. I learned more skills on how to connect with people and maintain that relationship."
good,"Nordstrom Direct has been a wonderful experience. I feel comfortable asking questions and being able to speak with my management team about any concerns. My co-workers are more than willing to help out others when in need. It is wonderful being able to go into work and getting the job done, plus having fun at the same point."
good,"Working at Nordstrom was great, I had a very supportive team and enjoyed the people that I worked with. We were encouraged to run our own business and really built our relationships with clients. The pay was great and the only downside was the retail hours."
good,i learned how to manage time with doing so many things all at one time. the staff was very nice people very helpful. i did enjoy my time there
good,"Typical day at work: Open store, drop tills in the registers,cash room procedures, customer service"
good,I love my job a t nordstrom west county (kid shoes) i enjoy seeing big smiles on the children faces when they receive their favorite nw shoes and a balloon. this job has taught me patients.the managment at nordstrom is amazing i like the fact that that they promote within.
good,"This company is not just a department store, but a large and intricate machine that provides positions in all facets of fashion, retail, merchandising, procurement and sales. Focusing on promoting from within and at times the individuals success is driven solely by positive sales numbers no matter what the cost. Customer service and customer relationships are pivotal within all aspects of the company."
good,Customer service is provided between departments as well as external customers!
good,there was a lost child in the store and his parents were no where to be find for 30 min the parents were looked for. When the police dept was called the parents had already called in stating that they have reached home but lost there child at Nordstrom. The police department then came and picked the child up and drove the child home.
good,"customer service responsibilities. Prioritizing sales to hit daily goals; demonstrated flexibility and problem solving with customer service issues, while maintaining a professional demeanor; prioritized scheduling of department events, worked with manager on facilitating new team members, and their individual sales goals. Ran hourly reports for manager on sales goals for the day and for the week. Helped organize department meetings, and teleconferences with other departments. Displayed leadership skills, providing input on sales of employees and ways to improve sales goals."
good,Nordstrom's offers a friendly enviroment to work in. It is honestly like a small family. I have made some great friendships there. The hardest part of my job is making sure every department is keeping merchandise organized and in the proper place. Of course the most enjoyable part is being able to see all the hottest fashion and trends first hand.
good,love working and shopping at Nordsrtoms.Developing team and Delivering great results.
good,- Consistent communication with RDM on needs of business
good,I love working here! Benefits are awesome even for part time associates. Like any other work place though it is best to keep work and personal life seperate.
good,"A typical work day consisted of completing any side projects that needed to be accomplished, checking sales goals for the day, meeting and exceeding daily sales goals, restocking merchandise, keep the sales floor organized and clean. The management is helpful and knowledgeable about product knowledge, and encourages you to sell, and move up in the company. One of the best parts of the job is the co-workers they become like family. The hardest part of the job, might be the open return policy, on slow days to turn around returns into sales."
good,Basically you sale merchandise. They would like you to meet your quota because its based on commission.
good,"Great company to work for. Left to get out of retail, otherwise, I could have worked ther forever."
good,"Very focused on the customer, fast growth in business and technology, additional training offered, opportunities to work in different areas, family oriented, many good managers."
good,"Everyday had we had a goal, the team was on time, the vibe was easy going, the job got done. It was a great atmosphere to work in. I think the hardest part of the job was knowing when to quit."
good,"I was a top earner at Nordstrom and the money is competitive. However, it's not for those who will not give their best effort. You need to be outgoing and motivated to work there."
good,"Great place to work with a really good management , I do recommend people to apply and try their chance with Nordstrom , they have flexible shifts hours"
good,"-Following a specific routine on what needs to be cleaned and when."
good,"This company has great people, benefits, and job growth. I grew an amazing foundation of retail experience over my 5+ years with Nordstrom. Would highly suggest working here."
good,"A progressive company with a great culture and an adaptive retail experience. Learned a lot about team building, exceptional customer service and how to run a business."
good,Once you work at Nordstrom long enough you start to get PTO as well as eligibility for a 401k that they will match. Lots of other benefits such as discounts for phone plans.
good,I’ve appreciated the flexibility that Nordstrom has had for me to sustain my work/life balance for my child. 401k and health benefits have served me well.
good,"Set and achieve sales goals"
good,great environnement. everyone there is friendly it's just nobody shops there tbh. it's so empty most times. the manager is cool. the dress code isn't too strict as I expected. sometimes getting to ur sales goal is a bit nerve wrecking just because nobody really acknowledges or shops upstairs.
good,Fun and easy place to work in my position.  There are the occasional rude customers but compared to the last retail jobs I’ve this is by far the best and easiest one.
good,Great place to work. Sales goals can be tough to meet when not in season or if you have a poor client base. If you are a go fetter and fluent in sales this job is perfect for you.
good,The hours were great. There were some amazing people I met working there. I enjoyed working one on one with my customers. I learned a lot as well as pushed myself to do my best.
good,Nordstrom was good at taking care of their employees. The staff usually melds well together and you have a chance to be creative when helping customers. Working on commission is the most stressful aspect especially when you are just beginning.
good,"Overall, positive experience working for Nordstrom though in the specific area I was in opportunity for continued growth was limited. I would recommend this to others."
good,"Great workplace, but company overwent a few position changes and cuts in return made it hard to progress and move forward. Loss of enthusiasim. Lack of consistency with managemt employment; therefore, making it hard build trust and find a medium with team. amazing staff and the ability to make as much as possible financially. Without a base pay to accomadate commision made work life balance obsolete-- constant work weeks to meet sales goals made it hard to have days off."
good,The workplace culture was amazing. All the employees seemed happy to be there 100% of the time. Great organization to work for. The most enjoyable part of the job was reticketing returned merchandise.
good,management was helpful. great to build relationships with customers to establish good sales  for commision sales. workplace culture is fun. great place to be creative
good,"It was easy to get along with my coworkers which made it a fun environment to be for 8 hours. It is sometimes hard to recognize which customers are shopping with which sales person, and you don't want to step on anyones toes. I wouldn't necessarily say there was a ""hardest"" part about the job, but the inconvenience of being on your feet for 8 hours can get to you at times. My managers were fun and fair. It was a seasonal position and I enjoyed my time there!"
good,"This job consists of lots of face to face interaction with customers. weather its at the register, on the sales floor, or over the phone. the culture is modern and fun. the management team is always looking to find was to improve moral with giveaways and parties. there is also incentives for well performing employees. they also take care of their employees by only promoting within  so that they grow in their abilities with the company. in short nordstrom could be classafied as a career retrail buisness."
good,I think they are definitely the type of call center I would have s stayed at if I didn’t mind working for a call center career wise . I was always being up lifted and they always consider my needs.
good,There is no rule book.The one rule is 'Use the best judgement'.. Employees are empowered to make the right decision in behalf of the customers and the company. Employees are efficient and handle issues themselves and  involve managers when they are unable to diffuse a situation.
good,"It's a great place to work if you love fashion and like meeting people, the biggest problem is the return policy, it works for the company but not for the employee, fairly good compensation, you would have to earn it though because it's  commission based."
good,"I was hired during their summer sales season, a notoriously frantic time at the store due to the massive quantity of customers. I was placed in great departments with great managers and staff, and as I was looking for any bare minimum summer job before college, I got much more than I could have asked for in terms of paycheck and work environment."
good,I've been with the company for almost 10 yrs off and on. I loved each experience I had there. The only negative is the management and sometimes the team. Management is not professional. I feel as though sometimes decisions are made based on personal feelings. Some people are not team players or don't want to see other employees succeed or even do as well as themselves. It's more or less ever man for himself.
good,"This is a great summer break/ winter break opportunity. The work is what you expect and the commission keeps you motivated. If you are new to retail, you generally start in the BP/ Topshop department."
good,"Worked there seasonally. Fun team, fast paced environment."
good,"good benefits and great team work, I was crossed-train in all different departments and when work was slow they sent us to different departments to completed our hours."
good,"Work hard and Nordstrom thanks you. I love that they promote from within. Makes working there inspiring and opportunistic. I was there five years during college, most people quit college and stayed with Nordstrom."
good,Working at Nordstrom Rack had it's ups and downs. As an entry level retail job it was nice to have weekends off as the stock only arrived on the weekdays. I would take occasional weekend shifts when needed. Workplace culture was relaxed and fun once you get to know your coworkers and the management team.
good,A decent job that pays minimum wage but has bonus pay based on commission and how you meet your daily sales goals.  Good pay if you don't get many returns which will lessen your bi-weekly commission. It is interesting to learn how to sell and figure out what the customer wants.
good,Very good experience. Great colleagues at work. Kind and caring management and employees. It is for sure an amazing experience and a great opportunity for my first job in San Francisco
good,"a typical day at this job would be standing at the front of the store and maintaining constant surveillance of the store and merchandise. The workplace environment was all around a very relaxed and great place, break-room and store were always kept well maintained."
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work. You will learn a lot about fashion, merchandising, customer service, sales, and store management. You will be really successful if you are genuinely try to help people"
good,"A Professional Place , really clean and friendly. Where quality is #1 ."
good,Nordstrom is a highly competive with environment. You control your paycheck. It's either base pay or commission and if you are willing to work and put in the time with your guests and listen to what they want and need then you have the potential to bring home a lot of money.
good,"My time and experience working for Nordstrom inspired a lot of confidence in me that I didn't have before I worked there.  Even though the company chose not to reserve my position for me when I needed to have a surgery, I still have the upmost respect for my management team at the full line store in the Clackamas Mall as well as my incredible manager/coworkers from my time working for Nordstrom Rack.  The level of dedication the employees give to their customers has ultimately promoted growth within myself as an employee of other companies as well as a personal growth that I attribute to working for this company."
good,"My contact with direct supervisors, upper management and store managers were professional and supportive. Holiday business driven, food is a secondary business so at times resources were scarce."

good,"My contact with direct supervisors, upper management and store managers were professional and supportive. Holiday business driven, food is a secondary business so at times resources were scarce."
good,"The workerss are amazing very family oriented once you get to know them or when you've been there some time. the workers range from high school, early college kids to seniors so there quuite a crowd. the benifits are great. myself i was advanced 3 vtimes in my first year. i think the communications could be better as well as the switch in management. but over all grewat place  to work and learn. good perkss for holidays."
good,"I interned at Nordstrom in college & continued to work there seasonally after my internship. The managers were great & the commission structure was really nice, especially for a college student at the holidays."
good,"I just started and absolutely love working there. My coworkers are extremely helpful, management is very understanding and fun, and the pay is great. However, some shifts are long, but the job pays very well."
good,"My management team was extremely understanding and flexible. They took care of their employees and listened to grievances. The team that I worked with was easy to get along with, coordinated well, and had excellent communication."
good,"If you don’t have a degree, this is easily one of the best places to work. The pay is great and once you hit 1,000 hours, not only do you start accumulating paid time off, but you get a $2.50 raise. The cap is $18/hr."
good,Solid place to work overall. It s great to be surrounded by people who are positive and want to do better everyday however the hours required to maintain standards can be strenuous
good,Nordstrom has a great inclusive and diverse workplace. They support minorities and participate in their community. They provide great tools to create an excellent customer service experience.
good,Worked at there for four years and can honestly say it was the best job that I ever had. Met some amazing coworkers that I have become lifelong friends with also met my husband there.
good,"I don't have any cons about working at Nordstrom. It has a very streamlined approach to do your job and that is to ""always use your best judgement"". They trust their employees and there is a work life balance despite it being retail."
good,"Very fun place to work, always fashion trend forward"
good,"I've enjoyed my experience at Nordstrom Rack thus far. I really enjoy my coworkers. Overall, the customers are very satisfied with the items and services the company provide. The management team are great at executing a plan and able to communicate the goals to the store."
good,This job is always fast paced and requires patience many times. I loved to be energetic for each and every customer because it was a new and different experience with each one.
good,"I have worked for Nordstrom for 25 years and have loved it.  The beginning of my work was sales then I went into management, I loved teaching and leading and excelled at it.  I did leave the company in 2002-2005 and went back as a sales associate not a manager and have loved that role as well.  I love the people I work with and every day is different.  I get to meet so many different people."
good,Nordstrom really cares about its employees. They do a great job of listening to every employee and creating advancement opportunities for every employee there
good,A very nice and friendly environment. Managers are more than willing to show you what to do. Handheld devices make it very easy to ring out customers.
good,"It was truly an amazing experience working for Nordstrom! The company itself is worth a try. Just be a team player and be very clear of your goals and stand by them. If you want to be promoted, make it known to everyone and get to know your manager's managers as well."
good,"I overall liked working at Nordstrom.  I love the company and their values.  My specific manager wasn't the most professional, but there were good things about her too.  Everyone there is very hard working.  I worked in BP which had unrealistic sales targets which means no one ever makes commission.  Me and my department coworkers would just make the $10/hr every pay period."
good,"Commission is hard to deal with. Stay positive, be honest, and try not to lose yourself. Your team could be a second family if you keep them all at the right distance."
good,Nordstrom showed me how to have elevated customer service. They used the film The Devil Wears Prada as a model for how nto suggestive sale to customers.
good,Great place to climb up the corporate ladder. Fun and loving staff really family oriented. Great seperation between social and work life. Managers are great.
good,Pleasant job to work for.  Meet people from all walks of life.  Fun place to work.  Get along with everyone.  Friendly environment. Provide outstanding customer service.
good,This company really helped me expand my retailing skills and allowed room for growth. The only reason I left was to go help a friend out with his company.
good,The Nordstrom Rack along with Nordstrom online sale has helped Nordstrom Inc to remain profitable. The Rack offers a fun working atmosphere and the work is physically demanding.
good,"Great place to work whether seasonal, part time, or full time. Workplace is always changing and as seasons and fashions change so does the store. Just beautifully."
good,Everyone at Nordstrom makes it a happy place to work. Both the customers (for the most part) and fellow co-workers were kind and made working there worth it. It was so fun to work with and style customers!
good,"I worked at Nordstrom while I was looking for other positions. Easy and Fun Environment, Great People. Exceptional Customer Service. Surprisingly, you have quite a bit of autonomy."
good,Nordstrom Kenwood has a strong team work environment. When working in commission sales you need to be competitive but a team player as well to achieve the highest level of satisfaction for the guest.
good,"Nordstrom is a great work enviroment, management is typically good at what they do. The hardest part of the job would sometimes be unsatisfied customers. The most enjoyable part for me was my manager and my coworkers."
good,"I absolutely loved working at Nordstrom Rack, but Nordstrom was different. During the week, traffic was slow, so you're basically hanging out and not getting paid. If you go above and beyond, the other employees just look at you like you're crazy and stay on their cell phones."
good,I liked it a lot but it was a temp job they give me all the over time that I wanted for three months and the manament and staffing was great and the company
good,If you are looking to start a carrier in fashion or anything for that matter especially right out of college Nordstrom was a great place. You can advance in your career fairly quickly. I also do think that the culture and environment heavily depended on the store manager and what store and even department you work in.
good,"I have worked directly with departments and with the store as a whole. I am given a list of tasks that need to be done for the day for either the department or the store. I learned a lot about multi-tasking and working with others to fulfill the goal. There are a lot of different personalities at Nordstrom that have required me to be open, have clear communication skills and problem-solving skills. The management is very flexible with scheduling and is always supportive. The workplace culture is friendly but fast-paced and competitive.The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines but that was also the most enjoyable part. I like challenges and Nordstrom provided that with presenting problems that needed to be solved with thought and creativity."
good,"the work was very repetitive, all day standing in the same place and trying to meet your quotas was the hardest part at first. but of course the longer you did it the easier it got. Great benefits, fun people to work with, nice and caring supervisors, promotions from within. Overall, Nordstom's is a great place to work."
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work in Seattle Headquarters office. Management is great, and the very supportive or your career goals. I would recommend Nordstrom to anyone."
good,I enjoyed working at Nordstrom. The sales floor was competitive but working with and building my clientele was very successful. Nordstrom promotes from within and they offer great benefits to their employees
good,"I worked as a Beauty-on-Call (BOC), mostly in cosmetics.  Got to learn a lot about makeup by working with knowledgeable employees, and enjoyed going to work. Was kind of like a kid in a candy store! But a lot of the salespeople can get pretty catty when there's a commission going around, and some of the customers can be pretty awful.  Pretty usual of a retail environment, but I've had employees steal sales and then try to make me look crazy for saying they did. You have to have a pretty thick skin for competitive retail like this, especially as a beginner with no experience.  Upper management was wonderful, positive! You feel like you can be open and honest with them."

good,Great place to work especially as a part time while going to school. Helps get your foot into the workforce and teaches you essential skills that can be applied in many fields.
good,"Nordstrom was a great base for my sales training. The management always ensured that we had the sales tools needed to meet our goals. I was very happy with the work culture, it was overall very positive and I looked forward to going to work. The only downside was being on only commission (there was a draw but it was not much) so the income was not always stable. Even being a top sales person on my team my paycheck would range frequently."
good,"This job taught me a lot of patience, teamwork, and efficiency. I was able to handle lunch and dinner rush with the help of my team, and I am thankful that I got to learn that."
good,"Everyday I clock in and got straight to work until it was time for my lunch then repeat till I clocked out. I learned work related things as well has life lessons from mangers, coworkers and even consumers. The work place was real comfortable, people got along no matter what department they were in. The hardest part about the job was learning the stock room, but quickly got familiar with it the more I worked. The most pleasant part about working was getting paid on my down time because of how fast I would complete tasks."
good,"Good company, everyone is open and helpful. I get bored as there is little to do to fill my days. Benefits are okay, and the discount is nice. Good managers."
good,"Nordstroms culture creates a wonderful customer experience, but does create a cut throat and stressful work environment. The tend to promote from within. This is great if you are trying to move up the corporate retail ladder, but manager turnover can feel high as they all move on to better things. Hardest part of the job is the commission/ work hour/ insurance structure. Can become extremely stressful if you have to be out sick for a period of time. Did loose my insurance there after becoming ill. However, the company culture makes working with clients so easy and seamless."
good,A good job if you like to do lot of walking. Management is good very good with hand on hand training. The hard part of the will be when it cold outside and you have to pick up trash.
good,"At the Ebar I would arrive and make sure food prep, cleaning, and the cafe and cash register  setup was done and ready for the day. I would make a house brew and then get the espresso machine up and running. The stocklist was  constantly being monitored throughout the shift to ensure we had everything we needed at all times. I ran the cash register, made drinks, made sure everything was stocked, cleaned, prepped food and had to work in a pretty tight space with sometimes 3 other people. I had to be quick and efficient and constantly on task. There was never really a moment when nothing needed to be done. Being on my feet and moving constantly and thinking constantly about the managing of the cafe was not easy by any means. I had to think back and look ahead a lot and make decisions about things that could either negatively or positively affect me or the cafe. I was fortunate to have a great managerial team and worked with people who wanted to build me up and help instead of tear me down. I love working with people and interacting with people so having making connections with people be a part of my job was really fun and enjoyable. I grew in multitasking, quick decision making, memorization, and efficiency in high stress situations."
good,"It’s a fun place to work and helps teach you business skills. Has a good work life balance except for around the holidays, which is to be expected. Definitely a place you should work at!"
good,Nordstrom Rack is a good company to work for you can learn a lot from the people that work there. Good pay the hours aint so bad. The bad part is overnight.
good,"High class environment, respect full staff, take very good care of there employees. very strict tho so take you job serious. There many benefits in this company."
good,"Working for Nordstrom you get all the aspects of retail and competitive commission-based selling. Cut-throat would be a good way to explain it, but in a positive way. There was a lot of positive competitive selling. Numbers are very transparent. Everyday sale numbers are posted, so everyone in the store has access to all your selling information. This makes for a very positive selling basis, I think. Nordstrom is a very renown, higher-end department store and the word ""expensive"" can be pinned to all aspects of this job."
good,"I did work during their anniversary sale so it was a little more hectic than normal, but the environment was fun and joyful and there are amazing managers their which made working pretty fun."
good,"Great pay, Great people. They make sure you feel welcomed and take time to teach you everything you need in order to succeed. They have great managers that make sure everything is good in the working environment."
good,"the year I spent here was greatly positive, and I regret leaving"
good,Every role is essential to getting the best products on the store floors/website. Very fulfilling to see your efforts contribute to the greater success of the team and company.
good,The only bad thing i could say is working on commission is hard.  we could shop with customers in other depts.  but those employees did not approve all the time.  The pay was excellent and had insurance benefits .
good,"A great company to work for.  The most rewarding job.  Loved the staff, benefits and opportunity to grow within the company. Mandatory to work weekends, holidays and evenings in order to grow.  Hard to maintain a work life, family life balance."
good,"This was my first retail clothing job. I worked service experience in Seattle WA and loved it. The overall day to day attitude in the store was always uplifting and very fun. I had great team members that would gladly step up and help when needed & my manager was the sweetest. Accommodated any schedule requests I needed the best she could. Nordstrom is a great company to work for, they will definitely take care of you."
good,A typical day at work is looking for customers to greet and make feel comfortable to shop while still keeping in mind my goal for the week. Iearned a lot about patience and timing. The hardest part of the job was making sure checkout process is smooth.
good,"The companies structure is solid, from the week of training upon hiring to the leadership at the stores to the corporate offices. Nordstrom offers an honest, worthwhile, and rewarding position. There really isn't anything negative or unacceptable about this place."
good,"A very fast paced, fun, energetic, an competitive work place. Every day you are faced with new challenges and making new/meaningful cliental relations."
good,"• Skillfully o ering an authentic shopping experience for clients while successfully creating a stylish look"
good,"Nordstrom technology's culture is on of ""Nordstrom nice"" but, as with the rest of the retail industry, it is under great pressure to accomplish more, faster. Some people stay after work to play ping pong--and there is a foosball table on one floor--but most go home to their families after work: the culture is family-oriented."
good,Fun workplace environment with good management and people who really care about your wants/needs. Fast-paced environment with friendly services and great customer service.
good,The employees are looking to get ahead in any way possible. If you're looking to get to a management position without having any other credentials except working hard go for it. This company is very much like living in L.A what would you do to get fame (management).
good,"Opening/closing cash registers, promoting and selling high-end fashion products, sharing wardrobe expertise while offering helpful incentives to maximize customer’s purchases described my typical day of work at Nordstrom. I learned how to open and close cash registers, promote and sell clothes, and handle online orders. The management was friendly, and the work culture was unique. Competition within departments to get highest sales could be daunting at times,and commission could be hard to sustain. Otherwise, I loved being a part of Nordstrom's reputation of excellent customer service, and being able to showcase that within the everyday duties of this job."
good,I worked at Nordstrom for 4 years and my only complaint was micro-managing and distrust in employees. I would've stayed with the company longer if it wasn't for my manager who was rude and negative.
good,"I worked from 5AM-1PM everyday. I unloaded the truck as soon as I got in, and sorted through the merchandise as well as placing them in their correct departments. The managers were really hands on and helpful with any questions I had. This particular Nordstrom is in the top 5 of the country, so the workplace was very fast paced and held a very high standard to their service. The job wasn't necessarily hard, I always pushed myself to defeat greater tasks. The best part of the job was the people and the culture of Nordstrom. I was always busy which never left me bored at work."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for. If you are self motivated and are ambitious this is a place for you to make a good income. Being a team player is a huge attribute to have if you are looking to avoid strong encounters with co workers, as it is commission based pay. Management is always wiling to teach and help you grow. You just need to have patience and be willing to take advice."
good,"Don't get me wrong Nordstrom is absolutely amazing to work for. You meet so many great people with different backgrounds, but everyone loves what they do. Most retailers it is hard to fine people as passionate as the people I have met at Nordstrom. The pro there is potential to build your business and make some great money doing it. If you work at a small store you struggle a lot of the times to make money and see a high turnover typically. Bigger store brings in more customers with more money to spend. My day to day is pretty laid back because during the week we are pretty slow. But you always have something to do. I think one of my favorite aspects is the fact that management has an open door policy. I can email the CEO, or just walk into hr office and feel welcomed. They really make it so easy to talk about issues and they care about what you say."
good,Great job to have while in college to learn about the industry and the importance of connecting with the customer. The team was a joy to work with and getting to know an unfamiliar product assortment was interesting and really peaked my interest in retail! Very friendly place with very fashion forward people (in a nice way).
good,"Clean place to work with nice people willing to help out. Your typical warehouse position, but with less clutter and noise. More organized and maintained than other places."
good,A typical day at Nordstrom Rack is providing great customer service and working as a team to achieve the company and store goals. Making sure that it is easy and quick for the customers to find what they want

good,I love this company and the culture. The employees are like family.  Flexible schedule but long days.  Great opportunity for advancement if your willing to work hard.
good,Working at Nordstrom taught me the value of quality customer service and how to work in a stressfull fast paced envirtonment. The hardest part of the job was standing and walking around all day and only having one 15 minute break in my work day. Other than that it was a great place to work and I learned a lot from my time there.
good,"Nordstrom was so nice to work for - their policy to take care of their customers spills over in the best way to their employees as well. Every employee who works there is helpful, and truly cares about what is best for the customer."
good,"typical day at work, setting up your station, having all your utensils, look at your prep list, mix and fun cultures to work with, hardest part is trying new and changed orders,,most enjoyable is making new friends get to listen to music"
good,I worked in the warehouse receiving packages and putting clothes on hangers and tagging them for sale. I also packed clothes and other items for shipment.    I worked full time there.  There were no hard parts of the job.  Management was very good to me.  Benefits were good.
good,Overall its an work environment that values each sales person and customer. Fast pace and looks to build long lasting relationships with each and every customer .. if possible
good,"My opinion of nordstrom is that it was a fun work place that really took care of its employees. We had great discounts excellent benefits and were really well payed of course depending if you worked hard due to the fact that you made commision."
good,"My schedule was generally  8 to 5 pm and two closing shifts per week. I would come into work and check sales from the previous day,assign goals and delegate tasks as needed. I would merchandise new product onto the floor five days per week. All product received had to be out onto the floor so we were ready for business when the store opened. Once store was open we would start following up with any customers that needed to be taken care of as well as reaching out to new customers to set appointments for styling. I would partner with the team to help sell in order to help their business as well as the departments. I learned that every person is different, you have to be able to work with that individual person, that people work for people. The reason I worked for Nordstrom was my customers and delivering great customer service. I also love to merchandise all the exciting new product."
good,The culture is great. I love my managers and people I work with. I believe that the company could improve on the pay structure. Most positions are commission based and I think there should be some flexibility.
good,"Help customers try on or fit merchandise"
good,Its very hard to have a set schedule for this type of job(Retail). Great company and great benefits. Hardest part of the job is not having a set schedule. My co-workers were great and overall I love this company.
good,"General cleaning to the apartments on the floors and carpets of the store. Make the store look beautiful and clean in restrooms, bathrooms, and dressing."
good,"Nordstrom is a productive, supportive company. There is always room for improvement and associates are mostly helpful. Flexible with schedules. They are a family run business and always provide answers to questions or concerns within the workplace as well as moving up in the company. Human Resources is always helpful and available when needed."
good,"Wasn't too hard being a hostess here. Pretty chill job, little bit of stress when it got busy but that's to be expected in any job, really. The managers are helpful and willing to work around your schedule. Not a lot of people know that there's a restaurant inside of Nordstrom or that each restaurant is different, so if you end up working for any of their restaurants, expect to hear how 'amazing, and unique' it is to have a restaurant inside a retail store. And the confusion when you try to explain why we don't have the same dishes as the Nordstrom's in another location."
good,Amazing company to work for if you enjoy working on commission. The work environment is professional and you get to sit down with your customer. My only negative experience with Nordstrom is their poor management skills. At the time i had five different managers and at times it got kind of confusing because when one manager tells you to do something another manager tells you the complete opposite. Anyways good company to work for.
good,"Nordstrom Rack is a great company to work for! It is always an interesting day filled with laughs, great people and high energy. Love working for this company."
good,Great job if you get into right department. They promote from within so you can go far if you try hard. A lot of work goes along with selling.
good,"Working for Nordstrom has been a blessing. They over their employees benefits, 401k, and other perks. It is a friendly but professional environment to work in. They taught us the importance of customer satisfaction. Most departments here are commission based, that means you make money off of what you sell, and lose money from the returns. That is the toughest part about the job position. You are putting so much trust in the customers hands to love every item they purchase because what they buy is what you are making a  living off of. When you do sell and have little returns, they paychecks are HUGE! Nordstrom really does take great care of their employees and it shows with every little thing they do for us. I would highly recommend anyone to work for this top employer."
good,"Nordstrom is great because of the inner advancement opportunities. Yet there are at certain times, work place disagreements that managers are not always equip to deal with but try their best."
good,"Treat their staff exceptionally, I would work here again. Strong hours, good pay and great benefits. Management is professional and patient when training."
good,This Company is awesome. So many opportunities will be waiting on you. This company is organize and keep there trends up to date.
good,one of the best places to work in the US!! they will help you be a better employer and truly believe in investing in their employees. they welcome all employees with open arms and you truly have a support system. i've learned some of my best skills from working here
good,A great company to work for. Management is very helpful and understanding. Coworkers are very friendly and  willing to help one another. I have learned how to give quality customer service. The hardest part of job is when I cant find what customers are looking for.
good,"It was a great place to work, with great customers. The hardest part about the job was when the employees decided they could do whatever they wanted, they did. Either they didn't show up, was late, or didn't work. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing what you were supposed to and always getting the recognition. It makes you feel like they really care."
good,It is a great place to work. Exceptional salary and benefits. A place that helps you improve your communication skills. I made a lot of friends here from my employees to my customers.
good,"A very modern fun, fast past environment. Decent hours, and also commission based. Although it is retail there it gets slow around certain times of the year which means hours get cut as well, i need consistency throughout the years to be able to manage obligations outside of work. But, the most enjoyable part of the job is working with the people and making them satisfied."
good,"it was fun place to work, great atmosphere if you love to be in fashion environment then it is a great place to work for you. many opportunities to grow"
good,"It was overall a good job, I was paid fairly, and i enjoyed my job. The only thing i wish was different was that people got a 1/2 hr lunch."
good,Fun work environment with product knowledge provided by veteran colleagues. Monthly goals created unity amongst coworkers. My favorite part of the job was working with coworkers who quickly became outstanding teammates enabling the company to reach monthly goals!
good,"A typical day of work would include always checking our emails prior to going on the floors. Once this is completed then the mobile company phone is assigned to the employee at all times as the employee must always be around the store and cannot be in the office always to answer. A few rounds of store walking to ensure all is going smoothly among the store and assisting any employees or customers that need assistance. Typically many calls will come in during a floor watch and the employee must answer and help all customers in a timely matter. These calls usually involve credit issues, logistic issues, account issues, and as well as employee issues in the store that the service experience specialist must respond to. The entire shift up until the end is usually handling customer and employee related problems but if the employee is the closing employee then around 9 the employee must make the closing announcements throughout the store via speaker and announce the store has closed. Finally once the store closes the employee collects all money bags issued from the morning with all the cash transaction from each register from the day. After securing this all in the vault and helping the manager in charge write the daily report the employee has finished a typical shift at work. I learned many things from this position which I will always be grateful for. I honed my craft in customer service, learned great communication skills as an operator, understood the business from the operations point of view and gathered a vast amount of knowledge in dealing with customer issues and technical"
good,Nordstrom is the ultimate experience to work for and to learn from enjoyed the culture and became the best I could be in Sales and customer service because of them.
good,"Typical day at work, busy, energetic, fun, my coworkers were fun, great employees. Great compensation and benefits. I learned a lot about myself and things that I have improved on"
good,"The company does care about it's employees and overall, it's a decent company to work for. They have a good job balance and life balance which a lot of companies don't offer right away."

good,"The company does care about it's employees and overall, it's a decent company to work for. They have a good job balance and life balance which a lot of companies don't offer right away."
good,I would fulfill all online orders / when I sold I would come in and basically stay on the floor and assist anyone who needed help
good,"Having worked a few positions within the full-line stores, it can be said that management is very supportive of pursuing other opportunities. The interaction with people on a daily basis makes going to work an enjoyable experience."
good,"In short, Nordstrom creates a highly enjoyable work atmosphere. Management was reliable and responsive, and my fellow sales associates were professional, helpful and genuinely friendly."
good,"Working at Nordstrom is great. When I start my day I usually go in and set up a goal for myself, and see where my department is at so I can get a good idea of how busy that day has been. Shortly after going into work I start to walk the floor to see if we got any new merchandise in. After that, I proceed to approach customers and provide them with excellent customer service. What I've learned while working at Nordstrom is to be completely responsible for my own sales and how much money I make because it is Commission based. The management is supportive and let their employees be independent and their own leaders. My co-workers are professional and fun to work with. The hardest part of working at Nordstrom is that it is a commission based position so if there is little foot traffic it could affect your paycheck. The most enjoyable part of my job are the people I work with."
good,A typical day at work required patience and communication. I learned how to become a stronger sales associate working here by constantly pitching the Nordstrom Bank opportunity to customers. I enjoyed competing to be the top opener of the bank accounts.
good,"typical day at work would be stocking clothes, selling items to customers, always  have a positive attitude and operate cash register. i learned a lot bout the fashion industry which was great! Managment was awesome! and so were my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was the competition with my coworkers because the pay is mostly commision but it pays off in the end!"
good,"Every day is different, because no customer is the same. Some days, business is slow, but that does not mean that there is no business to be had. I utilize Personal Book to contact and follow up with past customers who may be interested in a sale event or opening up a new account. My co-workers are competitive, but we go about each sale with a team-oriented attitude. If my department (Salon Shoes) doesn't ""make the day,"" then no one is happy. The hardest part of my job would be the returns. It is difficult to sell in the first place, but adding several hundreds of dollars of returns (that deduct from my paycheck) doesn't help. The most enjoyable part of my job is having the privilege to meet wonderful people who i would not get to know in any other situation."
good,"Healthy work environment with good professional boundaries. Great communication. Plenty of opportunity for advancement. "
good,I learned that the customer is always right and to greet and treat each customer with respect as they talk to me. My co-workers were very friendly and nice people who kept the work environment friendly and nice. Hardest part of my job was making coffee drinks in a fast pace for customers. The best part was being able to get to eat and drink what we wanted. Great Management also with friendly managers.
good,I absolutely loved it here the managers are great and the co-workers make working here so much fun and the customers keep those long days worth it!
good,Love the upward mobility and fashion forward lifestyle promoted by Nordstrom. They also give back to the community and are voted one of the top 100 best companies to work for for a reason!
good,Wonderful work place and a very good job if you're new to the sales field.
good,"I really like the company. They have good morales, pay great and the people you meet on a day-to-day basis are really interesting. In most positions you get paid commission, this is good because you can make a lot of money. But, the down side to that is that people get protective of their sales and their is a lot of drama on the sales floor, which is really annoying."
good,I provide direct service to customers in my department; kids shoes. It is a wonderful company to work for. Very open minded and confident in employees decisions toward different situations. Co-workers are amazing. Management is hit and miss. There are good managers and bad ones. The hardest part of this job is that it is commission based. I do love working with kids and being able to get the one on one time with customers.
good,"Nordstrom has been a great company to work for. It is an expanding company that allows for growth and training within it, for advancement and specializing skills. A typical day at work entails checking numbers from previous days, communicating with counterparts about what is, and what is not working, re merchandising the department(s) in order to incorporate new product that was received. Communicating with visual to help outfit mannequins, and make sure the integrity of the department(s) remains intact and the trends are clear. Making sure that the manifest matches the new product- and that none is missing. I would then spend the rest of the day communicating with the store manager, other department managers and team; coaching in the moment, and managing difficult situations when dealing with fraud, coaching, etc. and making sure that customers are getting high quality customer service. My favorite part of the job is helping customers find product/what they are looking for, and outfitting them from head to toe. Outfitting them with an outfit that they never knew they needed, and building a repeat customer relationship."
good,"Great place to work at. At Nordstrom Rack, there is never a dull moment as there is always something going on and you always have something on your agenda."
good,Love the company and the people. Working hours are not so ideal.
good,"Very productive, proactiveness, busy, funto work with, always multi tasking."
good,Very productive work place. If you are looking for a place to grow with Nordstrom is that place. I love the fact that the company hires from within. I learned about fashion about the business background that taught me so much. I worked with so many talented leaders in this company and for that I am great full.
good,A typical work day consisted of working hard to meet commission goals in a very high paced environment. Each day I tackled different customer complaints and requests for certain merchandise. The pay is competitive but worth it and there are opportunities for career advancements within this company.
good,I loved my clients and enjoyed my co-workers very much. I enjoyed learning and growing in my profession.
good,"Nordstrom is a great company that takes care of its employees knowing they will in turn take care of the customer. Nordstrom strives to advance its employees to ensure they find the right position for them. Selling is straight commission, which can be stressful at times and is probably my least favorite part of the job. However, as a fashion major I do enjoy the company's ability to stay on top of trends and encourages employees to stay on top of current trends. All in all Nordstrom will take care of you."
good,"Help my clients find exactly what they need. Set up future appointments and keep in touch with old."
good,"Movement is very fast, however if you are looking to stay within the region where the corporate offices are it can take much longer than anticipated. "
good,"A typical day at work involves exceptional customer experience, and educating sales people to build their confidence.  I was the stores advocate for using the POS (point of sale) experience; encouraging employees to use Fashion Rewards, mobile registers, e-Receipt, Personal Book, and customer privacy.  I learned how to seek out and identify other potential leaders in the store.  My coworkers were a strong, energetic group of people who worked together to support the department as a whole. The hardest part of the job was trying to diffuse customer situations and provide a resolution to customer's standard.  However, I enjoyed every other aspects of this job, including being seen as a ""go-to"" problem solver and educator by employees.  Having the opportunity to take initiative to lead new ideas within my focus departments was also one of the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"Our busiest days were weekends, and holidays, so it was a given you'd worked at least one day of the weekend. Typical day would start with numbers and our daily given goal for each dept. we even held pep rally's to boost our energy in the morning. i learned the importance of customer service, through Nordstrom and i absorbed that passion from them and its what I took with me to future positions after working there. Most enjoyable part of my job would be shopping with my customers. i help them find what they're looking for and maybe introduce them to new items they never thought would try on, and it was definitely hit or miss, but a good feeling, when they embraced something new and loved it."
good,Great company to work for. I was able to advance from part-time dressing room checker to a management position within 1 year!
good,"Nordstrom has impeccable customer service. After working here for over a year, I have found that there is no other retailer that cares so much about their customers. When I go into work, I know that my ultimate goal is to have every customer leaving with a smile. I will spend copious amounts of time helping a customer with anything from a difficult return to selecting a new wardrobe. Providing easy and friendly help leaves me with a great feeling at the end of the day."
good,The managers of course have their favorites so favoritism is very highly practiced. During the holidays be prepared to be busy and make a good bonus. I did enjoy working there though and the environment
good,A typical day is busy. Constantly moving and on your feet all day. I've learned how to work independently and recognize when things need to be done on my own without direction. The most enjoyable part of the day is lunch time when I get to have fun with my coworkers.
good,"I would say that working for Nordstrom was a very different retail experience. The benefits including dental, PTO, medical, and paid holiday was awesome."
good,"soo many opportunities within one company, constantly competing with high numbers, you can shop throughout the entire store as long as you have the customer for it, management team works great to coach you on any struggles"
good,"Great, trustworthy, motivating crew"

good,"soo many opportunities within one company, constantly competing with high numbers, you can shop throughout the entire store as long as you have the customer for it, management team works great to coach you on any struggles"
good,"Great, trustworthy, motivating crew"
good,"very good company to work for, hours worked would be hard if you have a family (retail Hours)."
good,"Great place to work, however, working with younger management can sometimes be a struggle, especially when they are fresh out of teen years."
good,"Typical day: Come in and un-box merchandise and place on racks, tally each merchandise to see if it adds up. When store opens, open and fill registers. Answer phone calls, arrange stock rooms, clean the department, keep clothes neat and folded."
good,The hardest part is making your goal when its slow. I love all of my co-workers... Benefits are great.
good,"I enjoyed working here, until I was fired for not being able to perform certain work because I was well into my pregnancy. You have a wonderful working environment. Great pay and benefits. Great team work and management. We had holiday parties and store benefit events for ranking #1 in our division or all existing stores period. I had the honor of attending one. Prizes, money and raffles were given and awards. Seeing my team members and getting to business was my most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"Part time student, always flexible with my school schedule. Great benefits and co-workers are all freindly."
good,"I would arrive at work clock-in, sign in to check if I had any returns being that would affect my sales for the day if I was in the negative. Check my personal goal, department goal and store goal. Check which sections I had to maintain for the day and then proceed to assisting the customers. I would fully commit myself to the customers needs, assist them in shopping, grab things from other dept.if needed, open a fitting room and grab additional sizes if the original didn't work out. Once they were finished I would ring them up and add them to Personal Book as a client so they can shop with me again. I would send them a thank you card or follow up with them to make sure everything was okay with the items they bought."
good,Helping customers on the floor with purchasing decisions. Suggestive selling and customer service.
good,Nordstrom was a great company to work for me at the time. I did sales and clienteled while I was with the company.
good,Its a great company to work for if you have a strong sense of fashion or are willing to learn about the fashion industry. Great benefits and if you work hard you will get promoted fast.
good,A very competitive company to work for. You will make very good money here if you are ready to sell. This company takes great care of their employees and there is tons of room for growth.
good,"I have worked with many different managers and every single on that I have worked with has shown me patience and kindness. Nordstrom is very flexible with their scheduling. They can give you a lot of hours if one would like, and if you need a lot of time off, they are willing to do that as well."
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for. They promote a great work/life balance and great incentives to help promote the success of your restaurant unit
good,"Meet lots of people here. Learn more about new products. Change Department when available. Love looking at new merchandise, and the Beautiful displays. Especially at Christmas. Great Resturant. On third floor. They will work with you if you become I'll. Great Managers also. Keep up the good work"
good,"Came in and started cleaning/Dusting the area, making sure all the merchandise was in the right area, everything had to be neat and clean for customer's when they came in to shop.  Help customer's with answering their question 's on items.  When my day was done made sure my area was clean and neat for the next sales associate."
good,"Very fun and collaborative workplace, a lot of career growth, mentorship, competitive, good compensation. Would recommend. Love Nordstrom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,Worked as a sales associate in the mens department. I learned a lot about the industry and a lot about customer relations. Very young and fun place to work while in college.
good,"The atmosphere was great, but it is a contact center and you will need to abide by metrics.  I personally dont work well like that and I separated with the company, but of all the contact centers I have worked in, this is by far the best."
good,"Norstrom is a great place to work. Meet a lot of different people. Its a competitive work place. They do give commission. Flexible with hours, good for college students."
good,"I loved it here and if I hadn’t moved, I would have stayed. I could’ve transferred but I wasn’t sure if I wanted to do that with school. But if you do a good job, you’re given a lot of respect and options for transfers, raises on reviews, etc I loved this location the most of the St Louis locations. The company truly cares about their employees."
good,"Working as a Security Ambassador was fun and exciting but also unpredictable, everyday is different when you don't know who enters in the store and their motives."
good,"Nordstrom, The company has excellent customer service. very friendly. Shipping and labeling boxes to ship out clothes that they ordered. Used IPod touch to scan clothes to see if we have them in store or if they are available at a different location of Nordstrom."
good,I had fun working at Nordstrom. It wasn't too hectic and my managers were really fun and understanding. At first the hours were a pain but I adjusted them by talking with my manager and it was smooth sailing from there.
good,I learned a lot of things regarding boh duties. Thanks to this job I learned how to become a line cook. It was also a fun learning experience and everyone was very nice.
good,Nordstrom is place to grow and a place to move up. This was a great place to work. I appreciate the level of professionalism every manager had. I’d work there again.
good,great environment to work in. Co workers and managers are very nice and chill.  Theres is a no return policy so it gets in the way of commission. Very professional place to work in.
good,Great environment and coworkers. Flexible schedule and potential to grow with the company. Training and recognition to new and previous employees. Good  benefit package.
good,"Nordstrom was a great company to work for.  Great benefits, good people, great environment.  The pay was very good as well.  It was overall a wonderful experience"
good,"I enjoyed working here! It was a seasonal job for me and I learned a lot about working in retail and interacting with the public in a retail setting. The management team was helpful and patient as I was learning the ropes and supportive throughout my time working there. "
good,"I believe Nordstrom is a great place to work, but you need to have great interpersonal skills if you want to be able to sell effectively.  My only complaint was feeling like I had to compete with my coworkers to make a good check."
good,Just a lot walking around and the slow season is really slow.Management can be good depending on how motivated you are.You have to get into the culture of it. Learn as much as you can about the company.
good,"Great opportunity for advancement and climbing the ladder! Loved working here! If you're super into the fashion industry, Nordstrom offers a year-long fashion internship program that I highly recommend!"
good,This was my first retail position and I feel like they did an excellent job with training.  Management was friendly and always helpful when you had questions.  The only downside I felt was that some co-workers are very competitive which sometimes creates issues in departments.
good,you'll work 60 hour weeks. The management is very friendly and makes sure you stay on task.  You get 3 10 minute breaks which is stressful to eat your food in 10 minutes.
good,"Nordstrom is a place for people that can talk the talk and walk the walk. If you are thinking of joining the retail stores of Nordstrom, you must be competitive, comfortable with talking to people, be able to troubleshoot issues and have a strong sense of a customer service."
good,"the autonomy to run own business, make own decisions using best judgment"
good,"There are many opportunities to learn and grow with the company depending on your manager. Some managers are excited to guide and mentor you if you are wanting to increase your sales, learn more behind the scenes, and move up in the company. Others are more focused on busy work and micromanaging. It is important to be in the right department and talk about your future goals with the hiring manager before you get stuck in a department with the wrong manager."
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom was not typical at all. I worked in the sales team, as well as, the customer service team. Having to work in both realms helped me understand and communicate better with customers in a great way. This helped me develop skills that i didn't know i was capable of. It pushed me to better understand myself and others in a more positive and fulfilling way."
good,"I worked in the Nordstroms Cafe and I enjoyed my job. But, the management was not up to par. I had to search employment elsewhere, but I did learn a lot of kitchen skills."
good,"I've worked at two different Nordstrom locations, one wherein I was a rover so I worked in many different departments, and I've had great coworkers every time. It's a fun and beautiful environment, but it is commission based so there is some pressure and the occasional argument about whose sale is whose.These kind of arguments will occur in any commission environment though so I don't think they're deal breakers; just stick with your customer as best you can. I don't think people are as catty or sharky as other commission retailers seem. My managers never got mad if I didn't make the sales goal that day, they were supportive and understanding. However, they do expect to see you work harder to try to make up for it. Nordstrom prides itself on great customer service and their inverted pyramid model which puts sales staff above corporate staff so there's almost always a positive atmosphere on the sales floor. There's a lot of opportunity to advance within the company, just talk to your manager."
good,"Constantly being taught new things with a great attitude to a new Conner with no experience. Rude customers were handled in a polite and respectful manner, as well as an extremely clean working area. The only problem I had was the stress of making drinks just as fast as everyone else when you’re a newbie.."
good,"i enjoy working at nordstrom. It was a good job. But, I do have to say, the schedule is all over the place. they will switch schedule often so it was hard to adapt your life to different schedules. i got fire because of that reason, but as far as the job it is nice and fun and i enjoyed working there."
good,The typical day is exciting and is never the same twice. The management is always there to help you succeed. The hardest part of Nordstrom is the commission.
good,"It's retail so there will be busy days, crazy days, slow days, slow weeks, it really depends on the season. But the thing about Nordstrom's customers are their loyalty to the brand and even loyalty to you as their sales associate. At Nordstrom, it's not about the selling it's about the customer service and relationships FIRST. They would rather you give a meaningful customer service experience than make a huge sale. Yes, sales are important because your pay is commission, but Nordstrom really cares more about you talking to customers and getting to know them."
good,"I enjoyed working at Nordstrom Ottawa, they provided us with great one-month training (Fashion trends & customer services) , great work experiences, and also great employee discount"
good,"Nordstrom is a very diverse company. Great environment, well respected , and everyone has equal opportunity to grow in the company. I’ve been taught to work with inventory numbers, help manage my team, and work in other departments."
good,"I had the best training in regard to corporate training and advancement. Hands on, visual and video training. Fast promotion when you perform the best."
good,"A great learning environment on customer service, relations and sales skills, how to merchandise, manage and going the extra mile. Utilization of scheduling, working with people and multi-tasking."
good,"Must have sales experience, be willing to interact with all walks of life. Styling clients, and making reccomedations in personal book to build clientele is key"
good,"Loved working at Nordstrom, event did the internship program. I loved the people that worked in my department, and although the job could be stressful at times, I enjoyed coming to work for the most part.  "
good,Nordstrom is very fun working environment the employees are fun a welcoming the customers can get a bit crazy but that is any job if you focus on ya work and the needs of the customer you'll be fine
good,"I started out as Christmas help, it was temp, but the manager of the Visual Display team asked me to work be part of the team permanently. At first, I had to learn the standard styling that corporate wanted for wolf forms, I've learned a lot how to display windows which was awesome. We took regular trips to see our competators, study holiday displays, learn about products. Many times, the department managers would request what to be showcased which wasn't an issue with me. Overall the hours were not bad."
good,Great hands-on training. Managers do a good job of developing employees. Co-workers were helpful. Flexible scheduling. Great benefits and fun work environment.
good,"As a S.E.S., my tasks and responsibilities were spread throughout the entire store (3 floors). This leadership position did not just isolate me to one particular section of the store but instead had me roaming the entire sales floor and back rooms/offices helping with whatever I could throughout the day. This consisted of sales transactions/returns, stock, customer questions/concerns, resolving minor computer issues, and offering guidance/assistance to the sales stylists. I was partially in charge of coaching/challenging the sales team making sure that they are all up to par on their customer service and were fully aware of all up-coming events. I would constantly be answering transferred phone calls with a mobile phone that I kept on me at all times responding to any/all customer inquiries and delicately handling customer issues/ concerns regarding sales transactions and/or their personal Nordstrom credit/debit card account information. Service Experience is an all-in-all HUGE support role within the company helping customers and employees with most of their questions and concerns. This required me to retain an ample of information on product knowledge and company guidelines. I would also help with the ""operator's booth"". In this scenario, I would be sitting at a desk answering incoming business calls and directing them to the requested departments. Sitting down as the operator also indulged me in. a plethora of paperwork that needed filing and constant updating."
good,"I learned a few things while at Nordstrom, mainly new practice and techniques of preventing loss and effective ways of communicating and being an effective leader."
good,"I thought the seasonal sales rover position at Nordstrom was great! The managers and co-workers made the workflow a pleasant experience. Plus, the training you get really helps out when you start your first day. Overall, the training and the shifts were exceptional and I would recommend my friends to work at Nordstrom."
good,My overall experience with the stock team at Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack was great until we received a new store manager and my department manager left. It's a great place to work with opportunities to advance.
good,"I love the job, nordstrom rack has a friendly environment, good management, we can get a good discount, and overall it has a productive and safe environment."
good,"It depends on the management and your coworkers, but working at nordstrom can be very fun. During the holiday season you can make a lot of money but it can be very slow during other months. One thing to look out for is the pay which is purely based off of commission."
good,in the mornin we are split up into group according to our job position. each group stocks and clean their area befor opening. i learned how to work with people with assistance and making their experience shopping as easy as possible. the most part i enjoyed about working at Nordstrom is working with the costumers and taking my break walkin around Destiny USA mall.
good,Overall great place to work for the past 10 years with the company. Management was supportive and workplace culture was outstanding.  The best part of the company has been the people that I've worked with and have gotten to know.
good,"Overall I loved my job and working for the company.  They had great work advancements, training programs, and health benefits.  Hours were decent, some overtime but was not permitted.  Discounts, and events were good.  Team members were awesome.  Have to be very outgoing and enthusiastic."
good,"I liked Nordstrom. LP was fun. Dealing with shady people will wear you out, but other than that, it was great. You can make a career of it, if the sketchy people dont wear you out"
good,A typical day at work would be coming in before everyone else at 8am and opening the cash room. I had to count the revenues and expenses from each registar and input them in Glory. I made sure the safe was balanced and all the register bags were ready to put into the registar the next day. I learned how to lead at this job which is one thing I'll happily take away. The relationships one can build here are endless because they make an effort to hire good people. The culture was diverse and a good ambiance. I think room for improvement is being more selctive on who gets hired. The hardest part would be when things don't go as planned or tasks wouldn't get completed because it gets too busy but it means the store is making a profit so that is always a great situation. The most enjoyable part of the job would be meeting new people. Realizing that all costumers want is to leave happy. If that is accomplished then everything else falls into place.
good,"great company to work for, management is friendly and opportunities to move up in the company are great. benefits have improved drastically and are reasonable with the hours if you are a student"
good,"I love and continue to enjoy working for the company, great opportunity for growth and advancement. Was able to get promoted a year and a half after employment. You can make a lot of money when working off of commission because it all depends on how hard you work."
good,"Ensure customer satisfaction at all times,hourly pay was decent for the time being.Enjoyed working as a team and exceeding the sale goals for the day shift.Great company for growth and opportunity."
good,I absolutely loved working here and love that it is a great friendly company to move up in. The staff was great very helpful and always there when needed to be taught new things. They also took upon to try to incorporate your ideas on the floor as well with there.
good,"the schedule and shifts changing your life balance, if working on weekend and working until 10 pm is not important for you it is really a good place to start with."
good,"The work days were not as long as i hoped they'd be, and they went by pretty fast. Management was never really needed. Do your job right and we don't have to tell you how to do your job was the overall flow of the place. I would have to say the hardest part would be making sure you had an order in order. The break room was nice."
good,"My review was excellent just that seasonal employee so they dismissed me., make sure they use the tokes correctly safety and health care, Safety First"
good,"After 4 months on the first position as sales associate I was offered a promotion to another position and have been there for almost a year. "
good,Truly amazing company! Work life balance and management is great to promoting those who put the work in. Discount is a plus. Be prepared to start at the top of the pyramid and work your way down. One rule is to use you best judgement and take care of the customer.
good,Great company to work for. Great benefits for its employees and for the most part the store works as a whole to achieve its goals.
good,"- Make Relationships"
good,"Very fun place to work!! If you enjoy a nice discount, and awesome managers this is the place for you!! The coworkers are great, and was an awesome first job for me!!"
good,Job is easy once speed is accomplished. Pay is every week and no weekends or holidays. Typically a job for part time work or moving up to management. Promotions are available to move up.
good,"I loved working here wish I could return, I never had too many issues they are organized, the discount was good enough for me, lets you get lots of experience"
good,"My day consisted of helping kids find the shoes they want. I would have to get my get and keep my own client base, so when they return they only ask for me. working here help you understand the importance of repeat customers.I believe this job was very enjoyable    especially getting to meet the whole family and helping them choose gifts for each other."
good,"I enjoyed working at Nordstrom I was able to advance from within. I was always encouraged to build my knowledge and seamy future within the company, They had excellent training from management."
good,"A typical day at work was checking to see which routine we were all on and getting to it.  I learned how to communicate and coordinate with my team members to efficiently get all our work completed.  Management was fantastic, lots of motivation and help when we needed it.  My co-workers were so friendly and very hard working.  the hardest part of the job was balancing work and personal life since the shift went all night and then i would sleep through the morning and afternoon.  The best part of the job was all the people i would meet in the morning when all the day workers would come in, everyone was so great there."
good,Great company benefits and opportunity for growth.  Company culture is based on employee growth and training.  Must be willing to work weekends and holidays.
good,"Employers like Nordstrom and Hilton are very recommended in my book, they have job security, great benefits, and a positive atmosphere. If you like great discounts then these jobs are great for that as well!"
good,"Nordstrom is an amazing company to be a part of. You meet amazing individuals as coworkers who make the day fly by. Its a build your own business so be prepared to make connections with customers and build upon them for events. Department Managers are always looking to promote their employees through the Future Nordstrom Leader Program and will happily nominate hard workers with a great, positive attitude. The hardest part of the job is working on commission. Be competitive, build your business and your clientele but do not steal sales or jump on to anothers' sale unless asked. Doing those things will create a bad atmosphere between coworkers and the department. Promotional opportunities will become more available, the better the team works together. The most enjoyable part of the job is honestly being in Nordstrom. You learn new styles, new trends and get to see everything firsthand."
good,"I worked as a building services employee. The job was tough and there was a timed schedule to accomplish every day, but the job was rewarding. The job consisted of cleaning bathrooms, cleaning rugs, maintaining the outside and inside, small jobs such as light replacement, and numerous other odd jobs within the store."
good,"WORK EXPERIENCE:"
good,"Take customers' orders and make drinks accordingly. Before handing drinks to customers, ensure their order is made accurately and efficiently. Stock all pastries, food items, and all necessary products to make drinks. Tend to eating area and condiment cart. Maintain a clean work environment. Complete all daily tasks as given on Task Sheet."
good,"Great place to work, comfortable and clean environment, with great management. Plus a nice food court and great management."
good,"Learned selling skills in selling the client no matter what the price tag is. Co- workers vary since everyone mostly keep to themselves, some are nice and friendly but do not step on anyone's toes if they have a regular client that purchases with them. Commission based position that has some cattiness. Employer is great, and seems like they take care of their employees except if you get injured on the job. Knowing a few co workers who are no longer with the company due to workers comp issues."
good,"A typical day at work included meeting and exceeding departmental sales goals, establishing relationships with clients to ensure returning clients, and signing up customers for company credit cards. I acquired interpersonal skills and a more extensive training on customer service."
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom consists of doing stock assignments and selling shoes to customers while also creating lasting relationships with each sale.  I learned that making each interaction with customers special and doing things with integrity led to more customer satisfaction which meant less returns.  The management at Nordstrom was supportive and pushed me to keep customer service as my highest priority.  Being that our paychecks were based on commission however, this led to competition in the workplace.  It was for the most part healthy competition so overall, it taught me to work tenaciously for my paycheck but also in a way that encouraged a great team environment."
good,Management staff is great and is available for assistant. Managers make sure that they provide all the help they can to ensure that sales associates have all the information and product to efficiently assist customer. Management is helpful in letting associates know about possible promotions in the company.
good,"Best education I ever received with some of the best leaders in a company. Challenging but also very rewarding."
good,"I have been with Nordstrom for over two years, and it has been a great experience. They compensate well, the department and store managers I have had have always been awesome and supportive, there is always the opportunity to move up if you're willing to work for it and the work environment, although competitive, can be very fun."
good,"This is a great company to grow in and to learn the true definition of hard work. It is a 100 percent commission which gives you the drive to be a better sales person and remain focused. They employees and management make coming to work pleasant, and a pleasure. They offer services that will bring you growth in the company which they will continuously state as one of their many goals. Best work experience thus far."
good,"By far the best company Ive worked for yet. Compensation is great, professionalism is always at its highest, everyone works well together and management is very supportive, caring and willing to help."
good,"I work in the shoe department. It's a fun place to work at and since your paycheck is of commission, you make a lot of money. However, sometimes you have to deal with stock assignments that mess with your sales per hour. Also, depending on the manager, they are usually flexible with the hours."
good,Met people from different backgrounds. Very customer service oriented. Management was very close and friendly and people knew you by first name. It's one big family ready to bring a smile to a customers face.
good,Company takes care of it's employees and is a great place to work.  Good environment to work and advance.
good,A busy day at Nordstrom was during the holidays. I learned how to multi-task and also be fast at it with no mistakes. I learned how to management my time when dealing with more than one customers at a time. I dealt with my co-workers as co-workers. My personal life out of work was never discussed while working. We always talked about what we could do better to get our department goals. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I get paid by commission and knowing how good my check is going to be bi-weekly.
good,"This is a great company to work for, the hours are flexible but then again it is retail. The pay is good, as long as you can sell and add on to purchases. Moving up in the company was difficult, it took a lot of butt kissing :)"
good,"This is a great company for growth.  I learned that in order to get what you desire in your paycheck, you have to be able to put a lot  into your job.  What you put into it is what you get out of it.  I meet new people everyday and my team is amazing.  I have learned and excelled in my previous position."
good,A typical day at work would be putting out new merchandise and doing markdowns. I learned a lot about fashion designers and how Nordstrom started. I also learned about fashion houses and the positions can be earned in the company. The management was great because everything with the company was well rounded. My co- workers were nice and hardworking like me. The hardest part of the job was securing that the clients wouldn't return there clothes. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was walking through the departments looking at all the latest fashion and the annual sales.
good,"At Nordstrom was a good experience in my job list i have learn so much about fashion,designers, culture , and diversity ."
good,Its a great company to work for the holiday hours are just extremely long
good,"I was working for Nordstrom Bank as a temp to perm CSR in their Santa Ana Call Center. The company is wonderful to work for, everyone treats their coworkers/managers with respect. They always advise to use your best judgment in all situations, keeping in mind that we are advocates for the customer. The only down side to the job was the hours and days off. Every week the schedule would change based on call center needs."
good,"Job advancement opportunity"
good,Competitive work environment. Commissions based. Friendly co-workers. Daily interaction with customers.
good,"@ Nordstrom daily it is fun filled journey. I have learnt many things mainly Again methodology and API stuff. Management is very understanding and supportive. Co-workers are very cooperative and friendly. Most enjoyable part is working for customer mobile apps team in tech savvy environment.   "
good,"I really enjoyed working at Nordstrom. The people I worked with were great and I appreciated the emphasis that is put on customer service. I enjoyed helping the customers that walked through our doors and I learned so much about myself and realized that I am capable of reaching out to others. Being put in a retail position made me step out of my comfort zone and learn to deal with customers in a more personal way - not just from behind a counter. The hardest part about working at Nordstrom was working on commission and making daily goals. Never before have I had a job like this. It is a difficult thing to deal with when you aren't making your daily goals, especially on slow days or when you get hit with returns. Numbers mean everything in the game of retail and it is a hard game to play. But through it all, I learned a lot from working there and I met some great people that I still keep in contact with."
good,Nordstrom treats their employees extremely well.
good,Learned all aspects of retail fashion industry in terms of sales. Great company to work for if you want to pursue a career in retail.
good,"A typical work day is getting in, prioritizing my daily tasks and then assigning daily tasks to my sales people and stock person. From there I make sure that my floor is merchandized upto Nordstrom's standards and ready for daily business. I make sure that all stock has been ran in and the stockroom is clean and ready for business. Throughout the day I will write reports to my Regional Managers and review business with these Manager. I give updates to my Store Manager about daily and monthly business and vocalize any concerns or needs."
good,"Nordstrom is known for its elevated customer service and prides its self in that. As a salesperson it can be an excitable environment and its ever changing, much like the world of fashion. Learning the product and being able to outfit a customer for any occasion is very satisfying. Being commission based, there is always a healthy amount of friendly competition. The benefits are also the best I've encountered so far. Nordstrom believes in promoting from within and its really nice to hear other peoples stories on how they started."
good,Nordstrom Rack's Management team is the best team I have had the pleasure of working for. The hours were consistent and I enjoyed working with 99% of the employees.
good,Es un lugar muy bueno para trabajar y las personas que trabajan hay asen un buen trabajo
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Bazille, I made good money and befriended the whole staff (both FOH and BOH). I learned to work well in a stressful and a fast paced environment well maintaining high customer service standards."
good,"Helped me prepare for jobs in the future. Also, help me with social skills that i didn't have. The co-workers i had at the moment was very helpful and always tried teaching me new things and history about the company."
good,Enjoyed working with company had fun found a new love for high end fashion I worked full time and balanced life. Management was great and supportive always.
good,"I enjoyed working for Nordstrom. I had great management and staff. It is not your typical ""retail"" job. There is always something fun and new going on when you work for the company. People are always willing to help you learn also."
good,"Absolutely loved working at Nordstrom, very sad to leave! My daughter was going to start kindergarten and my husband and I decided to move to a small town, which was over an hour and a half one direction. Will return if we moved back to a city with a Nordstrom."
good,Working at Nordstrom Eaton center has taught me plenty. I personally love working here. the best part of working here is their HR Management team. i believe that they have a genuine helped everybody the best way they can.Truly a phenomenal culture built into the work environment! Be Flagship!!
good,Ensure quality customer service is given to customers by providing a good service during the Sale Anniversary of Women/Men sales Depts. Performing multiple tasks by using an automatic equipment capability
good,"Working at Nordstrom as a rotation specialist was a relatively laid back job. Occasionally, I would be brought up to the front to check people out, when the line got really long and customer service needed help. The managers were really friendly and understanding of wanting as many hours as possible, without allowing me to work full time, my manager would provide me with 39 hours per week. I would work in the dressing room often, and I would be in charge of ""go-backs"", in which I would return the items from the dressing room to their respective location."
good,Very good work atmosphere friendly coworkers  easy-going  respectable Store great customer service Well can be hectic at times but over all great company to work for.
good,"I really liked working at Nordstrom, the associates were very helpful and friendly at the Cash Wrap and I loved working in the Stock room by myself and helping the cashiers when every they were backed up."
good,"I enjoyed this job a lot as my first ""real"" job.  It was definitely nerve racking at first because there are a lot things you need to learn about customer service and using the register, but I picked it up quickly once I actually was on the sales floor and not in training.  Nordstrom is a fun place to work and everyone is usually friendly, but sometimes can be a bit cut-throat when it comes to sales and customers."
good,"it is a great option if you need a break from restaurant hours! Scratch kitchen, wonderful specials, great management and plenty of room to grow within the company"
good,"A typical day at work would be to come in , do your opener before you come onto the floor to sell. You would then work on the floor until it was time for your lunch. In between the start of your shift and the end you would have a task called a stock assignment that would be completed in the back. When you finish that you would proceed with your shift and before you left you would do a closer before you leave. I learned patience, patience was the biggest take away from Nordstrom especially working in women's shoes. Management was great , they almost always worked with my school schedule and they were very understanding about emergencies that caused employees to call out. The workplace culture is very friendly and welcoming. I will remain friends with a handful of people that I work with from there for a lifetime. The hardest part of the job to be completely honest was just dealing with difficult customers or just flat out rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was also the same thing. Seeing the looks on the faces of customers when you have their size or when you suggest a shoe that they may have overlooked and they like it more than the one they chose."
good,"I was an overnight cleaner at Nordstrom's my tasks was to getting the store ready for operation for the next day which Intel's vacuuming cleaning the floors dressing rooms cleaning the cafe high quality cleaning. I've learned from Nordstrom's is there a very customer service. Nordstrom's is very diverse, the hardest part was making sure that everyone came to work. I have enjoyed my 17+ years working with Nordstrom's."
good,"It's a great company, a great workplace. Managers are very supportive (at least based from my own experience). Performance review happens mid-year and annually. If ones have his/her means, there are many ways to learn and many opportunities to career advancement. Although retail industry is struggling (in general), the management doesn't skimp with benefits and stuff like that."
good,"A typical day as a Stock Controller was to get in the door way , sign in (because i was temporary) , walk clear through the back of the warehouse, sign in again, start working an/or wait for instructions on where to start working. I've learned that you can get a real workout with moving those boxed because they are all at least 35 lbs and above.  The management team are great leaders and I couldn't ask for a much better team. The workplace culture was usually extremely loud because of the machinery, but if you had headphones and a Mp3 player those troubles were resolved easily."
good,If you're willing for work for your paycheck then you'll love it. Everyone is mostly friendly and the customers are mostly nice. Your coworkers keep you afloat and your paycheck will reflect how much work you put it! If you love working with the public and not having the pressure of super demanding managers then Nordstrom is good for you.
good,I loved serving and preparing customers drinks at the espresso bar. It was a fun place to work. Always busy and something to do. Management wasn't always the best but Gina and Asan was awesome. The hardest part was dealing with mangers.
good,"Nordstroms Warehousing is a great place to work through Staffmark. Our supervisor through the temp agency was Vanessa, she was really nice and made her daily rounds to ask us if we'd be able to work the next day or not. The temp agency and Nordstroms however had some missing communication. Through the temp, they had you do a 500-1000 day quota. But the company didn't acknowledge that and kept asking me to do more than 1,500 per day. Other than that, it's a great place to work. The hardest part of the job really is just figuring out whats where. But there will be people there to help you with that."
good,Nordstrom is a really good company that gives a great customer service experience and does helps to develop each employee skills on their own. One of the greatest things I have learned so far is to give a great customer service experience to every person and customer that comes inside the store. On the other hand they have a really good communication openness between managers and employees.
good,"Customer interactions, meeting lots of new people, different customer experiences everyday. Great opportunities for promotion within the company. Motivational salary."
good,"I moved and had a long commute.I continued to work at my location, driving 80 miles a day. It's an amazing company to work for with wonderful people and fantastic customers. I know every company has bad apples but overall Nordstrom is a great place that I can only recommend to new hires, anyone in school or looking for a place they can really grow as a person and find new networks would do well to start here. As a server you can get an hourly wage, benefits and a guaranteed lunch break."
good,"if you are into sales nordstrom is a good company. they motivate you in many ways and they promote from within, the customers are the best part of the job."
good,"Very fun environment to work in! Will give you great customer service skills. The managment was very catty, but fellow employees were fun. I suggest working in a high traffic store."
good,Great entry level position amazing for students flexible work schedule determine your own pay amazing management  opportunity for growth
good,Am not yet employed with Nordstrom but i know  it would be a blessing as it would help build me and my career. It would be an every day challenge for a better professional Sales Person.
good,"They hired people to open the store but as soon as they open the begun to lay out the people, because they are not making the sales they expected."
good,"I've been working for Nordstrom since Septemeber 2013. The work culture is great and I have definitley honed my sales skills and professionalism. I owe a great deal to this company for my growth as a salesman! I've learned a great deal about fashion too. I am constantly trying to increase my sales numbers from last year, as that is how I rate and compete with myself."
good,"Super fun work environment and customers are amazing! Great pay in addition to incentives and commissions! Great music, fun people and great experience! Would work here again in a heartbeat! Plus PLENTY of room for growth and skill development."
good,"A typical day included packing and unpacking shipments of high end fashion to be repackaged and mailed to patrons of the Nordstrom online store. Little to no socializing occurs as in this warehouse, employees work mostly alone on a line."
good,"A typical day in my position at Nordstrom consists of walking the floor to aid in the growth of selling employees, answering questions on orders, technology, and customer situations.  Management is strong, mobile, and are knowledgeable as well as passionate about the company.  Co-workers range from different backgrounds and goals but all are at work with the soul purpose to continue to help the extraordinary company continue to grow.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with difficult customers who try to commit fraud, work the system, etc. But the most enjoyable part of my job is being surrounded by fashion! In an ever changing field, fashion is what makes Nordstrom and it is fun and thrilling to see the changes while the company remains strong."
good,"Call center environment, inbound/outbound calling, multitasking, credit card verification, billing/shipping, inventory, knowledge of UPS tracking and website, mentor, chat trained, mathematics, availability, and reliable. Loved Nordstrom open door policy."
good,Always had a task to complete and all employees were helpful and willing to aid you in any tasks.
good,work together with mor persons learn something good for each is very important
good,i loved it there it was family orineted the people where great
good,"Nordstrom is one of the best companies you would want to work for, for the simple fact that they keep the employee in mind as well as the customer.The company has been around for a very long time,and has expanded throughout the U.S. therefore you won't worry about job security.They offer full benefits and retirement plans for full time employees, and must I say that there is definitely room for advancement within the company. Overall its a great company to work for."
good,Nordstrom was organized and the people there was always in a happy spirit. When I came to work I felt welcomed. I never really seen anyone upset which Made it more of a comfortable place.
good,Working at Nordstrom was a delight but also a handful. I would normally take the morning shifts so my day starts at 6 am. the store normally opens at 10 so we have a good amount of hours to prep the store. Alot of planning and organizing where different brands would be and making sure the store was kept up to regional standards.
good,"The one thing I enjoy about my job is that I have control over my work day. Each morning I meet with my manager to receive my daily goal, and then I have the flexibility to determine how I will achieve it. Over the past 14 years I have built an extensive Client Database, which allows me to give each customer a more personalized shopping experience. The hardest part of my job is competing with the current retail trend of online shopping. The most enjoyable part of my job is, interacting with people from all walks of life, and meeting each individual need."
good,learned to communicate and speak to customers professionally.Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new customers daily and old customers coming to return.
good,No complaints I was very happy and leaders were very respectful fair and they did everything right by the books. They are very attentive to their customers and employees.
good,"Good place to work"
good,"Make sure you are ready to work fast paced, and are able to tend to customers needs when asked. You also need to make sure you have great communication skills."
good,"A typical day at work was very fun and upbeat."
good,It was great going to class and learning about this new company. I got to see the ins and outs of each employee. I am glad that I got pick to be in the Fashion Ambassador program.
good,"Friendly atmosphere, working there makes you feel apart of a family, and good upper management to guide you. Full time hours, 20% discount and larger discount during Christmas, full lunch hour, great lunch room/break room, getting to know the clothing and about fashion, no working on Christmas or Thanksgiving."
good,"When asking for a day off or any other requests, management will help you with urgency and be understanding. A typical day at work consists of helping customers, making sure departments are tidy, keeping the back stock area well-stocked."
good,The management was very very helpful and accomodating and understanding. the co-workers were all very friendly and very welcoming.Overall fantastic place to work.
good,Nordstrom is the go to company if you're looking for fashion retail companies that offer great service and products to customers
good,"I  would start the day checking to find any single shoes an then call customers when shoes have been found. I would also size the floor, do floor moves,ring up customers, order produce for customers, open accounts, place payments to customers account. I learned that if you have a good leader your team can be afactive. The hards part of the job is that dealing with people that can give a nasty behavior back. I enjoy dealing with people an helping people findwhat they need."
good,The employees were very helpful which provided a great working environment.
good,Its an all around graet environment everyones opened arm to anyone the co-workers are great an love to see you succeeed.
good,Great company to work for.Caring about people and how they feel about themselves.Fun and exciting place to work.
good,The worst place Ive worked in my entire life. Would not recommend not even to my enemies.  Human resource is and was useless. There  was alot of injustice and favouritism in the department
good,I loved working there because I got to see lots of new faces every day and I got to help the customer with any question with an item in the store.
good,"Ok place to work.  Flexible schedule and very easy work.  The managers at the rack are nice, but the managers at the Full Line Nordstrom are awful, right up to and including the Store manager."
good,"My counter manager (cosmetics area) didn't give me the trust to do my job in a way I know I can do my best. I have been in this field for more than 15 years! Always interfering on the conversation between my client and me and giving them advice when my client didn't ask for. In the end, clients stand out and go or buy wherever my manager force them to buy. Then after a few days, the customer end up back, returning the product and wanted it the money back.  If you were ""lucky"" you will get the product seal, not used which at the end you could resell it. She as my manager and working there before of me is expected that she will have more clients than me but she always wanna ""keep"" the sale even the client didn't ask for her and as soon as she saw I was gaining clients she wasn't happy at all. She always said, ""she is my client"" hoping that I will put that sell on her name. My manager counter is very pushy and she doesn't seem that she really cares about clients needs it's more about making the sale and hit the target. I didn't enjoy working under her micromanagement which was a shame because I loved everyone else around. I wanna a place which will allow me to grow but Under her management, That wouldn't happen at all. I loved the people, I love the brand except for my Counter manager."
good,Superior customer service after becoming a manager I was not as happy as an employee based on the pressure associated with the job position. I would recommend the company overal.
good,"There was no work life balance, when you work at Nordstrom you practically live there. Compensation was good in the beginning, once you start getting return your paychecks are horrible"
good,I have nothing good to say about this company some people like some people hate it. Terrible place if your looking for full time managers have there favorites
good,"A great place to work if you are eager to learn about fashion, brands, and new fashion lines. It's physically taxing because you will be standing on your feet all day. The ability to network is convenient and you will be able to work as hard as you want too."
good,"This company needs to have better training for their leads/managers.  They aren't very good.  I didn't get the same answer twice.  If you ask one lead they tell you one thing, and ask the same question of another lead and get a different answer"
good,"the culture there isn't friendly, when you first start out its ok by=ut he workers aren't nice and they gossip and they anent nice people to be around"
good,My previous manager respected each of us and allowed creative control over certain areas in the department because we were great at doing so. No micro-managing until inventory which is perfectly acceptable. I learned that possessing soft skills and empathy are a must to be able to lead a successful team. One also has to be directive and firm but not mean-spiritedness and be knowledgeable of ways to convey information across the board to all levels of the company.
good, Received many awards and bonuses for productivity
good,"Nordstrom is the cream de la crime of working retail, however it’s still retail. Hours get cut during slow season. 20% employee discount which is helpful"
good,"helpful employees as well as management"
good,"selling cosmetics"
good,Loved the people that I worked with. Very friendly and helpful. Always there whenever you need them. Working with people you love makes the job more enjoyable.
good,"Excellent People and pay, very important to build a strong client base for yourself."
good,"I loved working as an Office Assistant at Nordstrom. The Nordstrom team was amazing to work for and really gave me recognition for the responsibilities I was to complete. I was fortunate to go through training with another contractor from the same Agency, however we quickly were separated and I was left to my own initiative to figure out complicated company-specific issues. I also noticed that the overtime I was required to work in order to complete the Client's expectations were not adequately compensated for by the Agency, and often would discredit my logged overtime and not pay me for my work."
good,Great places to work with great food but management wasn't the greatest. Most managers at my location didn't have any restaurant experience and were promoted from other departments. It made work frustrating sometimes.
good,"Mac is a great place to"
good,It's a company that is supposed to work together but there's no working together it's every person for themselves because it's Commission and there's a lot of people that when you start they don't like you especially if you're doing well.
good,"The work days were long but rewarding at first, towards the end I had a manager that treated me differently and it made me physically ill as far as having to be admitted to the hospital. I learned a lot about how to handle high end clientele. My first two managers were great, I think my third manager let the power go to her head. Most of my coworkers were great. The ones I did not get along with I was civil to and friendly on the floor, customers do not want to see that and honestly do not care. The hardest part of the job was it was commission based so you could never guarantee what your paycheck would be. The most enjoyable would be when I received a large paycheck."
good,"Assist clients with all fashion needs, organize section assigned, assist clients at cash wrap, show clients to fitting room, open close department, open nordstrom credit card accounts for clients."
good,A typical day as a Service Experience Representative is being the go-to person for every salesperson and customer in the store and over the phone and knowing all of the promotions and deals currently happening. The hardest part of the job is how to make sure to minimize issues we hear from happening again. The easiest part of the job is helping every customer and make their experience easy and enjoyable.
good,"Nordstrom remains a  great company with potential and they are trying very hard to stay relevant and shift with all of the changes happening in brick and mortar retail and e-commerce.  High marks for the continued tech innovation; poor marks for leadership.  Its a very hierarchial company and there is very little room for professional growth. In some departments, management by fear reigns and leaders are threatened by talented team members who are quickly sidelined so as to not ""outshine"" the leader in this hero-based culture. Sadly, style definitely outweights substance here."
good,Enjoyed working here although I felt like management was very unfair . Some of them bring personal issues to work and take it out on certain associates
good,"As an employee of Nordstrom, lovely working for that company.Great people to work with,good pay.Finally I wanna thank this company for letting me working here &etc."
good,Great company that offers training and opportunities within.  The team meetings allowed recognition to those performing and reaching goals. This is a great career to start in business and will teach many aspects of being business minded.
good,Its okay as a side job. Not really much of a job you would be able to grow with. Managers don't like when you try to be creative. Was one of the better retail companies I have worked for.
good,I loved my Job selling Jewelry until a new Manager took over and started stealing all the Sales and cutting my hours down even though I was one of the top sellers in the department. There was a conspiracy to get rid of me. I was given shifts that made no money and at times I was workinh 1 day per week.  I was written up for things that I did not do. So I resigned.
good,"Not very friendly environment ,but loved the actual work .Not many advancement opportunities ,great pay,lot of layoff days"
good,"The hardest part of this job was also the most challenging and the most rewarding.  Finding the perfect fit for a special occasion that made the customer feel like a million bucks! I found this part of my job the most accelerating! "
good,This is a friendly place to work part time due to not enough hours giving due to store profits. The management keep changing so with every new manger new ways to learn their ways.
good,"On your feet for 8 hours, but received a one hour meal break every day. It was a lovely place to meet people from all over the world. I also enjoyed meeting representatives from other vendors while working there. Customers love this store & appreciate a price matched sale with other competitors. Associates & management were pleasant to work with."
good,each day was a new adventure seeing the different styles being put together and the merchandise was great . wonderful company to be apart of
good,"its been a privedge to work for this company because of their standards, customer service and their committment to excellence."
good,Very good team and nice people to work with. The environment is very fast-paced however is a very good place to work. The people and staff are really nice and helpful
good,"The Nordstrom company does take extra care employee interested people and treat them right.  On the flip side of the coin because I am starting or was trying to start a career in fashion at an older age, the time it takes to advance is a disadvantage.  I new starting at a sales positions and wanting to advance with a narrow focus would not work.   If you are an open book, and don’t mind being sifted, this is perfect"
good,I think overall the company has lost sight that the employee is the most important person in the company. I think it’s stated out with great intentions an it was fun but now it’s all about mangers hiring their friends
good,"Nordstrom has a lot of turnover with managers, which can be stress full because each of them has different priorities and are too power driven."
good,N/A I don’t have anything to say about the company. They have nice benefits & they have nice items at nice prices. Very poor management. That’s all I have to say
good,"Mostly a typical day at work was good. I learned how to work with women who had the need for prothesis and that was very fulfilling just to see a customers face after the terrible ordeal that they had gone through smile and thank you for your help was just a great day,"
good,"The culture of Nordstrom and typical day is making the customer experience a great one. "
good,Nordstrom work culture is great. They really give you the freedom to make your own salary. The management is very helpful to get you to the next spot in your career.
good,If you plan on being seasonal then it's a great job. Other than that you will experience the lowest of the lows for retail salers. Employees make me love my job and so did fitting the customers in the lingerie dept.
good,"Great place to work and awesome benefits."
good,"I've had notice that store visitors use their mobile devices before making their purchase. Indeed, today’s online shoppers are looking for a variety of flexible options from retailers and overall, satisfaction with online shopping is high. Online sales is hurting my job in the retail business.  "
good,Another fancy name for call center. a typical call center work flow. This is definitely not a job for everyone. Customer service is definitely needed here.
good,"Took the time to teach me numerous skills, an work ethic. Eventually the attributes that i received allow me to advance to a more secure position in the work force."
good,"I learned alot about customer service, sales, and developing client relationships."
good,"Nordstrom, overall is a great start at a career in fashion. The money is nothing to sneeze at neither."
good,"besides being understaffed towards the end i enjoyed my job.  unfortunately they cut hours to where i was barely making my bills so i had to seek other employment there expectations was growing while trying to minimize the employees and hours.  "
good,"I grew very fast with this company, confidence is key as well as being educated about your product, family life is non existent while working full time so young eager professionals will thrive."
good,"Great company to work for. There are a lot of benefits including discount on merchandise, PTO benefits, and much more. I would recommend Nordstrom to anyone looking for great benefits."
good,very exciting work place and very well experience managers are there to help you along the way to further your work path with the company. The pay is good as well.
good,"I enjoyed my years with the company, however there is still a huge issue with favoritism. The growth opportunities make it unbearable after your first year. I worked there for 3 years and feel replaceable. Hopefully this issue gets straightened out because you should not have your most experienced employees feeling useless."
good,They have an amazing atmosphere . Working at nordstrom was a great experience. I really enjoyed my time. Very respectful people. They give you flexible hours as well.
good,"learning new things everyday as I go. very friendly people I meet everyday, new opportunity. very helpful. I enjoy the environment and the people I work with."
good,"Nordstrom is a fast paced, customer focused environment.  Employees are friendly, engaging and always smiling.  Employees also work hard and are passionate about their jobs."
good,I loved the experience. I learned so much and they provided the best training. The people are respectful and professional and very understanding.  Definitely recommend
good,"Great place to build connections and grow skills. Nordstrom also has a nice benefits package. There is also opportunity to grow within the company, as they have a strong theory of promoting from within."
good,"Top notch company with high degrees of integrity and character. I highly recommend working at Nordstrom. You will benefit from in depth training, daily learning, and valuable customer interaction."
good,"Chance to work a lot of hours if desired but building shuts down frequently if work is caught up.  Although trainers are very helpful, the time spent initially is ten minutes to a half hour."
good,Great company to work with it has it flaws sometimes  but at the end of the day it’s a good job to do pay very good and hours are great I would rate a 9
good,Loved my team they were great! Very welcoming. New team that was figuring out things together that helped to create comradery! Worked on a project that would help all internal shipping. Very exciting.
good,"Working retail and strictly on commission was a perfect experience for my age. I was able to meet and connect very successfully with customers, plus I built great relationships. I was very proud of my work with Nordstrom and was the top seller in my department."
good,My first retail job and it helped me learn a-lot that I still use years later in the industry. By far my favorite company I have ever worked for. Everyone was so helpful and sweet.
good,"I have only worked for the rack . As far as company value, they are prided on focus they give customers. However, I don’t feel as though employees get the same appreciation . This may be different at the full line, but rack isn’t as enjoyable as I’d thought it would be...compensation isn’t enough for the amount of work one has to do ."
good,Nordstrom supports you as individuals and wants to help you grow your own business. The company gives you all the tools you need to be successful. Nordstrom matches 4% in 401K benefits. Which is great for planning for the future.
good,"It’s a fantastic place to work at. Got really good experience out of it. It was my first job and I got hired. Learned some essential skills, such as communicating with customers."
good,I learned to be self motivated and aware of all things while working at Nordstrom. You wear many hats as the manager and you must be proactive and consistent at all times.
good,Great retail job for the holiday easy to learn and get retail customer service skills fast pace job stock experience learned goals for the store met really fun job to work
good,My days at work are really nice I just like to come to work in get the job done it don’t get to stressful because the manager make sure we have everything to make the job easy
good,"Make the customer experience quick, easy and fun — helping customers uncover the great deals they’re looking for, providing a fast and efficient checkout, answering the phone, making sure the store is clean, clutter free and easy to shop. Share your love of fashion and a great bargain with customers. Tell customers all about upcoming events, our Nordstrom gift cards, Rewards TM program and mailing list"
good,"The management at Nordstrom was amazing. The job was fairly easy, yet so entertaining. Looking at all the new inflow of product everyday was great also, I loved their flexibility with breaks and lunches, if it had been a long busy day at work, management would offer incentives and extra breaks to those who needed"
good,"great company to work for, what I love most about this company is the level of customer service that is provided to both internal and external customers"
good,A new venture in a productive and fun workplace. I enjoy the teamwork it takes for a specialty store to thrive. A typical day includes making sure that the customer is taken care of in an amazing place with the best products and services. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping clients to feel and look their best. Communication is key. I always have a favorite story at the end of the day. I have learned that what I put into Nordstrom I get back in equal measure. From both corporate and my clients.
good,very energetic and fun hardest part is the holiday season fun people to be around and a fast learning environment hardest part of the job was the rush hours and helping multiple people at a time
good,I have janitorial experience about 30 yrs. Prefer to work by self to keep my mind on work and to to fully complete the job in the proper amount of time needed .
good,Norstrom is a family owned company that treats its employees as family.  Great company to work for with great benefits including maternity/bonding leave and counseling services with paid sessions.
good,I loved working for this company. The sales and customer service experience that this company expects of its employees only produces the best kind of employees.
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work if you have an interest in the retail industry. It is fast paced, and 100% commission, but you are rewarded for your hard work."
good,"Great place to work. I was an assistant to one of the stylists during the sales. Long hours, but fun and got OT a lot. Everyone there was nice and helpful. Learned good customer service."
good,I Love these people everybody came to work happy everyday made the job a lot easier.Love the benefits that come with the job. Really enjoy how there’s holiday pay as well !!!
good,"I lived the overall job. I worked the overnight shift from 3 am to 11:30 am and I did it for two years. Things started being unsafe coming in those hours so I tried to switch to mornings. They wouldn't let me so I left the company. Overall the company has great pay and benefits, but I felt like they cared more about the company wants before the employees."
good,Out of all my jobs Nordstrom is one of the few companies that actually takes care of their employees. I genuinely enjoy working for this company. I would recommend taking a position here.
good,"Good place to work. Diverse culture and they like to promote from within. Not difficult work. If you are punctual and give effort, you will succeed there."
good,good place to start careers and get your feet wet with the world of retail. They have room for growth and deffinitley promote from within. Also has a nice work culture
good,I had an excellent experience working at Nordstrom’s. This is a suitable environment for individuals who conduct themselves in a professional manner. A majority of customers are highly qualified individuals.
good,Working here was a great experience. Learning new people and representing this company was buy far the greatest learning experience. While working here I learned all the great qualities of customer service.
good,"In my previous position at Nordstrom, I have learned how to provide outstanding customer service while maximizing sales.  How to  easily make connection with various kinds of people by asking open ended questions. How to stay calm in a stressful circumstances, They are customer obsessed and goal oriented, I will make sure all of my clients walk out of the store with a smile face."
good,I was with Nordstrom for a total of 23 years in management level roles. Supervised up to 160 sales and support people as a Regional Manager. Outstanding company.
good,Learned a lot about sales here and respected how hard every employee works at full line. Very competitive but it makes you want to work harder. Great discounts as well.
good,definitely had a great working experience at nordstrom. the only thing that I wished they did was hire from within their department as opposed to grabbing new managers from other departments.

good,"Manageable job, sometimes hectic which keeps it interesting!"
good,It’s a great company just not a good store if that makes any sense at all just going downhill basically they dropped the pay but added more job duties which will never make sense to me
good,They do not expect you to work long hours and are extremely accommodating.  The culture is very supportive of people and their lifestyles. I would highly recommend working at Nordstrom.
good,I loved working in Nordstrom. It was a fantastic experience and I enjoyed my years there. It is the best company to work for if you want to make a career in retail industry.
good,"It's been a while since I worked there (going on five years now), but I actively enjoyed working at Nordstrom.  The coworkers are fun and likable, and if you're driven to work hard, you get rewarded.  I would have liked to keep working here, but I wanted to focus on my education, so I didn't return after my first summer.  Still, I would recommend it as a summer job!"
good,Nordstrom is an amazing company. They focus on work/ life time. They listen and care about their employees. They also give you training in all areas needed to help with development in the company.
good,"The only thing I don’t like is the little 10 min breaks but everything else is good there , I really love the overtime pay at NORDSTROM . Great place to work"

good,This location is probably one of the best locations to work. Always a lot going on creating a fun and eventful work environment. Management here is pretty good as well.
good,The experience provides insight to the operations of Nordstrom at the customers point of contact. You learn valuable information about how to succeed within the company and how the company has faced such success. The work load is expected and the co-workers and approachable and willing to help.
good,Nordstrom rack was a very fun and exciting job to work at. Everybody is like a family. The discount is well appreciated. When you sign somebody up for a credit card you get $5<
good,Retail has its pros and cons just like any other job. If you enjoy working with people and being a team player this is the job for you. If you love fashion and shopping you should apply.
good,I loved working here many chances to move up in your career and chances to travel and explore other stores in the world .. they take great care of you and your needs
good,Lovely all around. A strong company culture that really sticks with ideals in order to make each person happy. So much room for growth here.  Customers are understanding
good,Great job enjoyed working here very structured. Great access to the cafe. Lots of busy work never standing still. Learned a lot and expanded my skillset
good,Great company to learn sales skills as well as customer service skills. Everyone is friendly and pay depends on how much you sell. Great work environment and the company seems to care about its employees.
good,"this location was amazing, I worked at 3 different locations. had about 3 managers in a 1-1.5 year period. 2 of 3 were great. It is about commission but making personal relationships with your buyers benefits much more.  The pay varied because of the location. pretty fair base pay. Towson location only focuses on commission. they also have the highest return rate so beware. If you're part-time, it's much harder to meet the selling goal"
good,"Working here was amazing, managers are all understanding and co-workers are such nice people. Definitely sad that I had to quit. Would hesitate about returning!"
good,"I worked at one of the highest fast paced store in the county in Mission Valley and it was constant moving up and down. I really enjoyed the atmosphere everyday when we went over our daily goals where we stood compared to other stores. Because of the nature of the job, there is a lot of overturn but the company does offer great benefits and great hours as well. I would highly recommend it as a company to work for if you enjoy retail."
good,"I would arrive for my shift, check the book to see everyone's breaks and daily goals and then I would browse the floor to clean up the merchandise area. During this time, I would look to customers browsing the merchandise and ask if they need assistance or help to find something they were looking for. I learned a lot about the merchandise I was selling, how to approach customers and confidently speak. The management was great in providing tips and feedback on how to better myself and how I could improve my way up into higher positions within the company. The most enjoyable part of working for this company was my coworkers and the community and friendship it brings from working as a team. My coworkers were helpful in teaching me many different things such as the computer and knowledge of the merchandise."
good,I enjoyed my time working for Nordstrom and helped me gain experience and knowledge that would benefit me in other careers. The ability to drive myself as a business as well as develop great customer service skills has proven beyond valuable.
good,"Good place to work at while going to school/discovering your true passion. Commission based pay. Benefits after three months. Vision, dental, and healthcare. Lots of opportunity if you go above and beyond. Customers will trust your opinion. Only designer stores have a good selection of items that customers truly want."
good,I worked at Nordstrom while transitioning between jobs. During that time I had three different managers and many coworkers leave. I wouldn't say it was a bad company or opportunity to work there but there is definite room for improvement for the management team.
good,Working here is great but a lot to handle. The company is really understanding but at the same time isnt. They care a lot about the employees but sometimes are not always fair.
good,fashion driven - fun - exciting to work there if you have a passion for fashion and design. there are many opportunities to learn sales skills which is great
good,"very fun job i was super happy there nice place everyone was happy "
good,great company to work for everyone is treated fairly work life balance is what i love about there and the managers are all great to work for they really helped me get further in my career
good,Flexible scheduling. Supportive management. I was hired for seasonal and kept full time. Worth it for the full-line and on-line discount. Would work there again.
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for."
good,Nordstrom only promotes from within and I wish I never left. If you don't have a manager who supports you then you can be kind of squeezed and not grow. I should have hung in there! This is in regards to the Rack side of things where there is more opportunity to grow. I never worked on commission at full line!
good,"Great company. I enjoyed all the chefs that were brought in from all over the country. Everyone being in one place doing what we love to do, magical. I got to learn a lot from the leaders put in place to be the face of Brazille as well as Nordstrom’s first concept in northern Texas."
good,I loved working at Nordstrom. The company is extremely dedicated to its mission of providing the highest level of customer service. The work environment is high energy and lots of interaction with your co-workers.
good,Workers are friendly and pay is great! You split tips with your co workers and usually you make tips which is good! Managers are nice and you get disscounts.
good,"This was a good starter summer job for a college student looking to get a start in working retail or with fashion in general. The job itself was like a seek and find job everyday, and you were always doing and learning new things."
good,I would definitely recommend them as a place to work. The employees are all very friendly. Good benefits and decent pay could be better though for the amount of work.

good,It was fun to work there. Everyone is helpful with locating items and making sure the job was done well. Everyone also has a smile on their faces and the environment was stress free for a fast paced job.
good,"Working at Nordstrom has been both fun and also extremely challenging. Interacting and building relationships with customers and the ""family"" you build with coworkers are among my favorite parts of working here. It is very fast paced in any area you work in, whether it is support or sales. The hardest part of the job is keeping a smile on your face, even when dealing with the most difficult and upsetting customer situations and not having a set schedule. Another difficulty is dealing with the management here. During my time at this company I have only ever had one manager I have enjoyed working with. The best part of this job is having the ability to make a customer's day simply by being yourself which is a big part of the job and integrated into training. Overall, I would recommend this company to a friend."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of the sales person greeting and creating relationships with customers, while ensure the customer is satisfied with your service, and adding on to their purchase to ""complete the look."""
good,"I learned time management and that has also helped me in other jobs as well. Learning how to build relationships with the customers so that when they come in again you know their name and what their style was like. It made your customer feel important  and also feel as if you're their friend! Of all companies, I'm glad to have learned these skills with Nordstrom."
good,"I was a customer service/cashier team member, so I was always at the front. A typical day at work was making sure the bay stayed clear of clutter, we called on a timely matter for go-backs and check out customers and do returns in a timely matter. I learned a lot about team work and how to handle the money and work under pressure during the peak seasons. Management was very easy to communicate with and the workplace culture was pretty relaxed. The hardest part of the job was sometimes being on my feet for too long. The most enjoyable part of the job was my interaction with the customers."
good,Nordstrom has been an amazing  company to work for. Their benefits and overall care towards their employees have shown that they truly care about their employees and their work environment.
good,"Buyer, manager, and sales person for 10 plus years love Nordstrom for its Customer Service and the whole team supports all sales associates to give the best service always!"
good,"This is a super fun program that I would one hundred percent recommend to anyone interested in fashion, marketing, or retail.  We learned the ins and outs of fashion and I met so many cool people."
good,Great place to work. Lots of room to grow and commission was a great bonus. Learned a lot about sales and the merchandise that I was selling. Managers were very supportive.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Nordstrom, I made many new friends and learned a lot of new things. My job was temporary, I was seasonal for their, ""Anniversary Sale,"" that they have every year. Everyone was super awesome and nice, but the work environment could get very stressful."
good,Overall Nordstrom Warehouse is a good place to work. You clock in and go to your section and get started. Supervisors are easy to get along with and pretty much none of them bothered you while you worked.
good,"Nordstrom has a fast paced, innovative work culture. There are many opportunities for growth within the company as well as innumerable ways to get involved in the community and in different industries such as marketing, sales, visuals, and buying."

good,i just need something full time the work is not hard i am a very hard worker also i learn very quick it dont take long for me to catch on how to do anything
good,"Many days stocking, merchandising, cleaning and rallies before store opening. Customer service including Point of Sale and mobile device checkout, finding merchandise,stocking and back stocking, sizing and merchandising.  Management was very hands-on and helpful.  Variety of cultures in this working environment and the shoppers also.  Hardest part was unsatisfied customers (unfortunately) and language barriers.  A lot of interesting and fun co-workers and customers."
good,The training was a very simple process which I liked because training classes can be boring. I also like the way everyone interacted with each other regardless of status.

good,"I really enjoyed my time here. As long as you are good with sales, you will flourish with this company. They are a well-established company with great benefits and tons of opportunity for growth and advancement."
good,"The environment was very relaxed and tailored to fit my skills/abilities. Though it was a retail position, there was no pressure to make sales and each customer was given the same opportunities and treatment. The managers were very helpful and never exceeded their boundaries in terms of dictating workers to perform duties. Everyone on the sales floor knew and understood their role and played their part in ensuring a successful day. I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and environment of the job as it allowed me to learn and progress at my own pace. However, the hardest part of the job was learning the products well enough so that I could answer any customer's question, but it got easier as I gained more experience."

good,"I loved it when I worked there and I'd definitely do it again. If you have the chance to work there then do it. Just do it. I met some of the coolest people there who are still in my life and its a helluva job. Sometimes stressful if youre not making your goals or sales because its commission based, but once you get there and learn the hang of the place after like your first month then you should be fine as long as youre not lazy and willing to get it. Excellent place to work."

Through Nordstrom's inverted pyramid (business model) I was given outstanding support from all department managers which allowed me to produce high volume and meet my sales goals. The best part of my job was developing long lasting relationships with every customer while providing them with outstanding customer service.
good,"Plenty of training classes,all employees produce the highest level of customer service."
good,Nordstrom has industrialized the retail world and continues to be the leader with regard to customer service and offers fast growth for each employee 
good,"I've been with the company for almost 8 years and I love it!  The people you work with are really like your family. We not only take care of our customers, but we take care of one another. "
good,"Its a different kind of retail environment, but its amazing. Working in lingerie can be tough, but seriously the harder you work, the better your paycheck."
good,Nordstroms has the best customer service training for employees that I have ever attended.
good,"I learned alot about skin care products, makeup applications and trends."
good,"Loved the job, but managers can be tough. Sales are the biggest deal to this company. The cafe and Bistro is delicious. Has very good selection of fashion,"
good,"*Commission Sales"
good,"Hard works pays off, especially when the more you sell, the more you earn. It's almost as if you have your own business. "
good,Nordstrom is a very cut throat environment. Its every man for himself. Its a tough place when the others in the store want to see you fail instead of helping you succeed. I learned to be tough here. Management has horrible communication skills and poor work ethic.
good,"a typical day for me at work is being busy at all times, this company is filled with a variety of open opportunity, I've learned so much about Mechanical Engineering and how to be very detail with the smallest things that the eye can't see, management isn't very good and very unstable, my co-workers are great team players.  The hardest part of this position is making sure that as an assistant manager your team complied with their duties on the daily basis the best part of this position is that there was never a routine."
good,"Always using my best judgment at all times has gotten me to the top 10% in the company in sales at Nordstrom.  Giving the customers the best customer service is what I strive for day in and day out.  Every day is different with new success stories and new challenges, but at the end of each day, I want to give the customer a positive experience."
good,"I came from working for another retailer and felt a little jaded with customer service/burnt out but once I join the Nordstrom team I felt the same passion and appreciation for customers coming in as I did before. They really value their clients and it rubs off on the employees, theyre genuinely happy that youre there! The Nordstrom team is a group of strong leaders who must prove their abilitities because every person starts off as an entry level employee. "
good,Its fun seeing all the new clothes come out before everyone else. it was also fun helping the customers find outfits and the discount was nice
good,I love it.
good,Nordstrom provided me with all of my training in customer service and laid the base for my retail experience while I was in fashion design school. Though my knowledge of designers was vast- Nordstrom taught me how to apply my knowledge to assist and style customers most efficiently.
good,Typical days at at work consist of coffee runs and lots of laughter. I learned how to gain personal relationship with customers. The management team was very fun but skilled at there jobs. A few co.workers and myself gained personal relationships outside of work. There wasnt really anything hard about the job because i had a passion for what i was doing.
good,"A work day at Nordstrom Distribution Center was a steady pace, but during the sales could get very busy. Going to work each day was a pleasure for me because I had a great team of co-workers and our management treated us well. Nordstroms is where I first learned about good customer service and I have carried this knowledge on to my other jobs. I think the only real thing that was hard for me there was that I sometimes had varied hours and because of that it was hard to make plans with my family. The most enjoyable part of my job there was being able to work most every area of the warehouse. That gave me some variety and made the job there interesting."

good,"Very professional setting, which was my favorite part about Nordstrom. The hardest part for me was finding a FT position that was hiring. That is the only reason I'm not currently employed there. Timing and a good interview is crucial,m but once you do make it in, many opportunities open up to grow into your career."
good,"While working at Nordstrom, I learned about building a clientele, providing excellent customer service, and selling many different products and services. I loved working with all my co-workers, we were able to have fun at work while still being productive. The hardest part of working at Nordstrom was finding new innovative ways to sell products. The most enjoyable part of working at Nordstrom was interacting with customers to help them find the perfect product for either themselves or someone else and seeing their joy."

good,Great Staff and coworkers
good,"A typical day of work was greeting customers, figuring out what they were looking for, finding those items and bringing them alternatives, and giving the honest, fashionable advice. I learned how to style a variety of people with different styles, how to communicate effectiviely, and how to create lasting relationships by caring about the person instead of a sale. The management was great there and my co-workers were good workers. The hardest part of the job was working on commission, the most enjoyable was helping people look and feel good about what they buy."

good,"This position was in the retail store environment providing counter management for a major cosmetic company sales force. The coworkers, store management and cosmetic company management was supportive and fun to work with. I enjoyed the awared and banquest to celebrate the accomplishment of goals and the recognition of being in the elite Customer Service All Star Club."
good,Nordstrom has always been a wonderful company for me. They compensation & benefits are good. If you thrive on customer service & understand that your commission is a big part of your paycheck you will do very well.
good,Excellent company with great opportunities for assertive sales people. Employees are encouraged to grow with the company and to set goals for entering management. Great benefits and flexible hours are available.

good,"A wonderful work environment, opportunity for job advancement, extensive training."
good,"Great people, very productive and fun to work there. loved being customers personal shopper!"
good,I learned a lot from working at Nordstroms. I went into the job thinking I knew a lot about sales and the tecniques it took to sell. The knowledge I gained from working there was enriching as well as it was fun and challenging. It was always good to go to work and have contests and play games to learn more about how to be better at my job. I highly recommend working for this company.
good,It was a very good place to sell and work in retail. Excellent employer and great environment. Clients starting buying merchandise online and the business changed
good,"Over night stock team was great it was only 5 of us in the back. And the Manager was horrible he left all the work on us , took all the credit for himself, used to be locked in the back office with another female employee that should be helping us unpack the loads to get them in there proper department. This female employee showed up for work when ever she felt like it never got fired just promoted and the real workers got blame for everything that went wrong."
good,"Depending on the organization, there's different work culture at Nordstrom. Infrastructure was a very fast paced - mitigate fire ASAP environment and lacks dev work, so if you're more of an operations person this might be the place for you."
good,"Nordstrom was a fun place to work because there was always an event going on or coming up to prepare for, there was plenty of room for growth, and the people you work for and with eventually feel like family. One of the most enjoyable parts were the discount and the holidays."
good,"easy going day, how to be patient, thorough management, we all get along, standing on my feet for 8,9 hr shifts, Going from coworkers to being friends"
good,I enjoyed working at Nordstrom and felt pretty confidence discussing quality of merchandise with customers.I felt Nordstrom value their customers and provide ultimate service with pride .
good,My experience at Nordstrom  Rack started out as a pleasant one ..But over time it became increasingly stressful due to my position  as a representative in the Loss Prevention Department. Their policies are not helpful to the position that you're put in to do whats required of you to be successful in the position that you're put in to do your job
good,"An amazing place to collaboratively work and make friends. Great communication and relationship will all departments, coworkers, and managers. My needs were always top priority!"
good,"Overall pretty good starting job, if you are looking to become a stylist or you want to have nice things without paying exspensive prices. They promote within but the competition is intense. The CEO’s are very aware and personable."
good,A very fast paced job. Don’t get paid enough for everything I have to do under my job title. No paid sick days. You have to be very patient when there are very mean customers. Most of the managers are very nice and understanding. You have fun if you make it fun.
good,I really enjoyed working at the e bar. they made sure you were very knowledgeable of the products and if you weren't they would help you get there. I liked that it was higher end.
good,Great place to work. Nordstrom is a phenomenal company and is excellent for people who are mobile and willing to relocate to advance their career. They truly have a promote from within culture and is the basis for all they do. People matter here. You must get use to people coming and going but it also affords the opportunity to work with new people all the time. Has a long standing employee retention rate.
good,Nordstroms is a great starting point for the basics of a job career guide. It is also a great reference on resume. Holiday discount is bonus. Discount is included for designer/premium goods. Great insurance and benefits program.
good,I think this is a great company to work for in terms of part time of seasonal work. The pay was well and the work environment was a nice pace as well.
good,I enjoyed the people that I worked with because they were well trained on their jobs.   The training was long and repetitive but it equipped me well to do good in the future.
good,"I had a great experience at Nordstrom. I definitely have carried my skills over to my previous jobs and they teach you how to be the best at customer service. Pay was good. Cosmetics pays hourly plus commission so I made good money working there part time and made good friends that I will have forever. Lots of pressure but worth it, great bonuses. Great benefits."
good,"Nordstrom was a nice place to work. Everyone is very kind and understanding. "
good,"if you are highly driven to work in a fast pace environment, and community friendly to work in this is definitely something to consider. once you build your clientele you will have returning clients for life"
good,"I really liked working for Nordstrom, great discount and the team was comprised of like-minded, awesome sales associates. I was only temporary after college, and would have stayed on except the commute wasn't so great."
good,"What Nordstrom is failing to do is put the right people in the right position. Too often people are promoted simply because they are well liked or know someone. Pay is not transparent, when a manager finally does tell you the pay scale I was shocked to find such a wide span, with absolutely no reason for being paid on the low or high end."
good,base pay is not great and even with commission it's still not that great. I made about a thousand bi weekly in commissions and was one of the best that worked their in my dept. I was always consistent and was still not very impressed with their pay. Sales be cut throat their making it kinda stressful. They should start you out at 15$ an hour so you can afford their clothes. Their is no way you can afford clothes their with the discount making what I made and also afford all your bills. Its not possible.
good,Majority of the departments are commission based only. So if you’re not a go getter you will not enjoy. I know in beauty it’s hourly plus a very small commission but counter goals are ridiculous.
good,This job is not very demanding and is just like any other retail position. You are required to open credit cards at the register and be courteous to customers.
good,"I enjoyed my time there, but it is retail.  Just like most companies, they want you to do more with less.  If you are a driven individual, you'll go far.  They didn't seem to be happy with people who were satisfied in the position they were in.  They pushed you to move up the ladder or out the door.  Good people to work for, just a little too PC driven."
good,"I worked in the Ebar portion of Nordstrom and would start by clocking in, tying my hair up, tying my apron, and washing my hands. I was commonly a closer and work started with helping customers if there were any or starting my checklist for cleaning and closing. As any other barista job, it could have its fast-paced times that helped me hone my quick decision making and reaction time. Typical goal was to have each order out within a minute of the order being taken and to be friendly and welcoming to customers."
good,"Nordstrom is a wonderful company to work for. It is a great starting opportunity for anyone interested in learning about a retail career and a great place to grow and learn. The company works on an inverted pyramid concept so they promote from within. "
good,"The best department store that offers by-far the most out-standing customer services. I love the store decor, selections and customer service policies."
good,"The start off pay is fair, the hours given when you first start is fair as well. After the holidays the hours were shortened and I was eventually laid off. Benefits for part time employees are a joke."
good,Aside from lack of job advancement and constant management change the pay and benefits are good so I would recommend the job to others looking for a place to start off at but not as a career unless you come in as management.
good,it definitely could have been a better environment for me but at the end of the day I liked it better than any of my other jobs and I was treated more fairly as well
good,They are very customer focused which makes it a great company to work for if you are looking to please the customer.  They have a great management role models here as well
good,"Nordstrom is great mostly because of its established name/brands. Managers and employees tend to find favoritism. It can be full of drama, always remain to yourself and on guard and aware. Great security, fun events like the Anniversary Sale, etc. "
good,A typical day at work is nice and smooth throughout the day. I've learned a lot about how their unique culture and how differently they treat their customers. Management is also great. You always know where you stand with you work productivity. They offer a lot of help.
good,"Great company to work for. Decent pay, good discount, clean workplace, fun co-workers. Management typically listened to concerns and did their best to work around employees' schedules."
good,Commission based sales that allows you to maintain a clientele and own your own business. Management is not necessarily a priority unless you are interested in it but you can make as much money as you want through sales.
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was the customer relationships that you build with so many types of people and having a personal, but different connection with each and everyone of them."
good,Very clean fun professional environment. I enjoy working there. The schedules are very flexible. I am very appreciative of my opportunity to work with them.
good,I love my job for the most part but I believe we're a little underpaid for the work that's put on us. My only problem would be that some of the managers feel they don't have to put in as much effort as the sales associates.
good,"I worked for that company for 6 years. Through good and bad. In 2009 business was still booming. pay was very adequate for commission base. Then it started to decline and the store structure changed. They offered customers a easier home shopping experience. Which cut off our commission. Very fun place to work, met some great people. Friends till this day, non of which are still employed by this company"
good,On a typical work day I enjoy greeting and assisting customers with finding items that we have in our store. Coworkers and managers are awesome and great to work with.
good,"My typical day at work is I start usually around 11 am and I help finish opening side-work in the restaurant and also help with portioning if needed as well.  Then from 12-4 pm I usually help process to go orders, seat guests, help run food and or buss tables if needed. Then around 3:30 I do my closing side-work in refilling to go utensils, drinking cups, and soup bowls and lids. I feel I have learned a lot about how the restaurant Industry works and also dealing with the stress of working in a restaurant when we get busy as well."
good,All is good experience to develop and learn more about customer service and sales. Very happy to work with excellent quality garments and interact with skilled Tailors and Sales associates.
good,Nordstrom is an awesome place to work. It's a wonderful starting point for someone who is maybe in school and looking for a job with flexible hours.
good,"A typical day at work consists of searching high and low for online purchases.  If a customer was to order something online it was my job to look throughout the store thoroughly, bring the item into the web hub, box the item, and make sure it gets shipped!  I've learned the back end of shopping online and what the people 'behind the screen' have to do.  The management and co-workers are under control for the most part."
good,"typical retail environment,  selling and providing customer service! "
good,I really like that they are family owned and I had the option to work at several locations. They have a certain air and culture of there own that I believe draws workers as well as customers
good,my co-workers are amazing. everyone works together as a team. the hardest job is meeting your pep. its enjoyable because everyone is nice and they all get along together.
good,We show up for my shift at 5 am.The stock team from the night crew  gets our shipment and leaves it for us for the morning then we simply start opening every box and restock it on the sales floor. Ive learned the overall operations of a retail store. Honestly our management needs work but I love all my co-workers they are all good working nice people. the holidays would be the hardest part about the job due to the mass amounts of product but its nothing we don't handle. most enjoyable part of the job is the people the laid back work and the pay.
good,Great company to work for.  Management is either great or not so great. It is a very competitive work environment.
good,"Now not all stores might be the same, but the one i worked in, at coral gables is a great store.i learnt a lot working there for the few months i did. the company is definately known for its outstanding customer service, which made me a better individual. also product knowlegde and shoes has improved alot.the management is greta and the co-workers are excellent. the most i enjoyed about the job is that, one is noticed and acknowledged for their great work effort and also given a compensation for that. which is a great feeling."
good,wonderful placet to work. managemant was okay and my co workers were great
good,"I like working at Nordstrom. Promoting from within needs some work. Overall it works, mind your job. Stay alert and focused on Customer service. Been at Nordstrom for nearly 5 years. Managers & teammates are kool."
good,I liked worked at Nordstrom Rack its a very delightful atmosphere friendly environment clean mangers are very helpful and easy going they help when needed to.
good,"I love my job, however, lack of management during my past year has made it difficult to learn and advance in the ways I was promised. Overall, friendly team, great equipment, flexible scheduling."
good,"Overall Nordstrom Rack was an excellent place to work but when it came time to advance, the opportunities were not so black and white. Advancement was based on how much you were liked by upper management."
good,"I had a great experience as an employee at Nordstrom, managment was fair and the office was filled with positivity. This job was very fast pace and sometimes dealt with tough customers."
good,Good money if you are willing to work hard. Lots of side work and can be very corporate but overall a good experience. High expectations. Schedule can be biased on whether or not the manager likes you
good,"Nordstrom was a fun company to work for and enabled you to grow within the company (e.g. move into management, through different departments, go into corporate, etc.)"
good,My experience at Nordstrom was a one where I was able to develop meaningful work relationships and build on base professional skills that have aided me throughout the beginning of my professional career.
good,"The retail work life, especially at Nordstrom, can get overwhelming if it’s not your only job or if you are also in school. It was a great experience for me during my time in the Nashville area. I loved the relationships formed, and learning all of the fashion knowledge!"
good,Good company but there going more online . I love working there the employees are great . some of the mangers are great. Logistics and men's furnishings are awesome. Downtown flagship.
good,There wasn't any real growth in the company as retail and if you were hired for retail you had to go to the register and still had to finish running your racks.
good,Productive fun place to work. A lot of growth with the company. Gaining knowledge and experience on customer service and loyalty. Fashion forward and digitally enabled.
good,i like the company a lot it gave me a chance to succeed. very fast pace and drives sales. commision is great and it is very stress free. you basically your own bosss
good,Had to be there at 4 am and out some time at noon. Fast paced on the feet. Not much customer interaction for logistics. They get on you when you are not moving fast enough.
good,"i enjoyed learning from my managers and co workers. i would open or close the store, met nice customers and enjoyed my time there.  it was easy and  i miss the work i did."
good,Best part about working at Nordstrom was meeting an amazing chef who taught a lot about not only everyday life problems but also about cooking amazing dishes
good,"Nice place for work, fun, friendly atmosphere,good discount for employees,very competitive,met different cultures, the retail hours it’s the hardest, because sometimes you miss family engagement"
good,Good management and highly capable peers.  Holiday hours can be very demanding.  Store ambience and company reputation for customer service is excellent.
good,"Nordstrom was a great experience but will only go back if i'm in dire need.. the pay isn't consistent return can kill your entire check and Nordstom is very flexible when it comes to returns and depending on what Nordstom location you work at you might not make as much as a flagship nordstrom... i would say work at the best nordstom in the city, work in another department ex: visual or HR, or go work at nordstom rack the pay isn't all based off of commission"
good,would like to return--excellent opportunities if can deal with normal corporate shenanigans. Only left due to circumstances beyond my control and company policy.
good,"Nordstrom is dedicated to its people. They provide outstanding benefits. There are many people working in the call center who provide the best customer service in the world. Unfortunately, some managers believe in following business fads and holding these customer service gurus to metrics better seen in India. As a result, some of the best in the world look like they are taking too long on a call when they are really providing legendary service. Nordstrom should make sure its values are in every metric in every way."
good,"A typical sales job on the floor of a department store. Great people to work with, but pure commission environment can be very difficult. Work hours tend to vary as well."
good,"we have different departments  i work in the service experience department which is the best department in the store its and overall great company to work for also you  can grow, great benefits"
good,"Nordstrom is a strong company that values all of its employees. Except for the rare instances in which poor management results in intimidation techniques and an overly high-pressure atmosphere, this is one of the best retail environments one could ask for, with fair pay and fantastic benefits."
good,Fun place to work. 100% commission and the commission varies depending on the department. Very diverse and plenty room for advancement. I love the work environment.
good,"I learned a lot about how to talk to people. Depending on which Nordstrom you work at and which region can make or break your opinion about working at Nordstrom. I've worked at both a lloyd store as well as a flagship elmer store and the vibe from both are completely different. In the elmer store, employees were happy and motivated. I believe everyone loved coming to work because they were making money and management allowed us to run our own little business inside of Nordstrom. It was a lot of freedom. At the lloyd store, not much business and only one or two people on the floor at a time. It's kind of depressing making commission with no customers. Then, your manager sends you home early to save your SPH and now you're only getting a few hours. While, all this is happening you're having trouble saving for your vacation and you're not accruing PTO hours regularly because you don't work that many hours. It's stressful at a small store, number one reason I left the company :("
good,Opportunity for growth if you want a commission based sales career.  Opportunities for career advancement through sales readiness programs. Internships available for college grads.
good,"I can say I love the set schedule and how it gave you the corporate freedom even though you  were consistently on your feet. I worked in Men's furnishings and I loved my co workers but, I didn't care for commission . Great place to work if you don't mind working that hard to get a decent pay check."
good,This company has awesome benefit but the management wasn't always the best fit for the department. Great 401k and a descent PTO plan. I would go back.
good,I started working at Nordstrom as a seasonal employee. I loved the atmosphere! it was very upbeat. Everyone was excited to come to work! There were meetings every morning. We were always aware of what was going on and who to go to if we needed assistance. I will definitely consider going back this holiday season! I just wished the pay was a little more!
good,The job was fast paced. We greet a lot of customers and some can be a little difficult. The hardest part was learning what you were selling. The most important thing was satisfying the customers every need and getting them out as fast as possible
good,A family affair!! Employees were like family! The company culture is awesome! The customers are demanding because we give top nothc wervice. One of the best retail place to work
good,Professional company. Would recommend to a friend. The only reason I left was because I needed more of a flexible schedule when I had a baby. I always return to visit my old bosses.
good,"Very flexible hours, great work environment, management is very helpful. The staff you work with is usually very collaborative. The discounts you receive are also a plus"
good,"It was a great place to work however no one can survive on the salary offered w/10 an hour"
good,It was a very fun place to work with also learning knew things as the store was a brand new store. The hardest part of the job was learning the cash room because I didn't have experience dealing with money but it taught me a lot.
good,A typical day at Nordstrom is pretty much just what retail is depending on what department your hired into.If your have never worked retail and are interested I would recommend Nordstrom Rack before applying to Nordstrom full line.
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work."
good,"To meet sales goals while offering personalized customer service and maintaining long-lasting relationships with customers. Job duties involve suggesting products, explaining how products work, demonstrating how to use products, performing makeovers, and operating the cash register.  To build strong customer relations through follow-up calls and mailings, recruit new customers, order new products and manage inventory.  Throughout the day and at closing I was require to stock shelves, clean floors, and organize sales areas."
good,Nordstrom Rack is a fast paced to the fullest. You look up and the lines are out the door. Being a Rover you go to whatever department needs help. It was a fun environment.
good,I need a job I'm 52 years old an I have very high standard s.an when it comes to work culture I appreciate an English speaking environment.days shift only.nordstroms is a job I can do an do it well.i want full time work that will last
good,Was trained in becoming a manager with the company. Did not stay with position because was not willing to relocate. Decent hours and pay. Management hours typically Monday through Friday with some weekend shifts.
good,"Overall excellent company to work for.  Very competitive. Beautiful merchandise. Great management.   My sales manager was always approachable, available and understanding."
good,"I loved working at Nordstrom but a couple things like commissions and too many people working in your department could get in the way of a good paycheck. "
good,"At nordstrom you never get bored, there are a million different jobs so you can find your perfect fit. In order to move up it does take a lot of schmoozing. If you talk a good talk you are more likely to succeed at nordstrom."
good,"Loved working here, but I hate pushing credit cards.They have a great policy for customers and probably one of the last companies to have such a great service."
good,"Many good people working with people with disabilities, many not. Management worked very hard to bring in the best people possible to help enrich the lives of the clients."
good,Good opportunities to move around and learn different aspects about retail in general. Great management team that listened. Working nights and weekends took away from family life. Young staff.
good,"Fun , helps you grow into professionalism, Promote within "
good,Typical day was stocking the men's shoe department and selling.  Learned how to deal with multiple sales at one time.  Management was wonderful.  Hardest part of the job was working on the holidays.
good,love people and customers Nordstrom nurtured positive all fronts from customer service and allowing  us the highest customer service very proud to work at this wonderful company
good,"Customer service was main goal, either you had it or you did't. Nice retirement program. A variety of departments to work in. You can move up in company. A person was allowed to transfer to another store in another state if they liked."
good,"Fun, decent place to work. My only complaints are that it is really hard to get time off and they aren't very flexible with scheduling. My coworkers were great, the store manager was pretty accommodating and understanding. Nordstrom takes great care of their employees and it's fairly easy to move up in the company."
good,Productive place to work but is very stressful at times. They are very pressed about making your sales goals.Management is terrible. Not very encouraging.
good,"Great company to work for, with plenty of room to grow within. Benefits for full time employees, with a reasonable hourly wage."
good,"Constant change in processes kept us busy learning and never a dull moment. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is excellent customer service and high customer satisfaction must start with understanding customer expectations. You need to know who your customers are and what they want.
good,"Working for Nordstrom you are expecting to provide legendary customer service, which is exactly what I provided. As a server the regional managers would come in every 2 weeks to test performance and product knowledge which was both nerve wrecking and informative. Weekly tastings and pairing to ensure both associate knowledge of the product and confidence to deliver."
good,"Company was wonderful to work for, customer service is number one however the excessive amounts of returns by customers hinders the moral of the team from time to time. Sometimes it can be a loss/loss situation. When you do what the customer wants (a return without POP) management will scold you, but if you do not do the return management will scold you. "
good,"Love working here pay is good, hours not so much but overrall great place to work just wish it was full time and not part time and the discount is a bonus."
good,"I loved working with customers going above to fullfilling their needs.  A very clean store and loved to dress professionally.  Co-workers were a lot of fun, and we are all still good friends."
good,"fast paced process 200+ items in a 8 hour day. LOTS of daily overtime plus several times a year working 6 and 7 days a week. Management was GREAT, if wasn't for them pushing to fill out accident papers i would have been SOL. Very PHYSICAL job, lifting, pushing, pulling, repetitive motion constantly."
good,merchandised clothing for customers and kept floors clean and organized. Checked out customers and also helped them find anything for them.
good,"The store would always be busy, although it can be stressful, the playing of music, sooths the human mind."
good,Fun environment to work at but I wanted to make a career in either Marketing or Finance so I decided to go to school.
good,"As a salesperson I had an amazing experience with amazing customers. Easy to build relationships. Managers are so unfocused and don't train you nor are available when you need them.  Overall the people you meet there are competing for customers, can sometimes get out of hand. Co-workers are friendly but only from different departments. Hardest part of the job is having a manager that is always there. Mine was always off early or on vacation or sick.  I enjoyed it for the most part. Great pay, but NO base pay. ONLY COMMISSION."
good,This place was okay. The only thing I disliked about the company was not getting enough work hourd but the atmmosphere was marvelous.
good,Great company to work for a real high line retailer. I really enjoyed assisting clients with the full service shopping experience. Customers had the full attention of the sales associate thru out the whole store.
good,"While at Nordstrom, I wore many hats.  The money was good, but  I had no life outside of work."
good,"If you love fashion and commission then this is the job for you. From the customers, to the shoes, all the way down to the watches is something that will drive you to work every single day "
good,"Work started at 3 pm, nice enviroment. Was a busy place in San Francisco, so lots of tourists."
good,I love working there with the friendly people. I was working there as a temp.
good,"Nordstrom is overall a great company to work for, they offer great healthcare benefits and 401K benefits. This company is always about putting customers first and going above and beyond to service the customer. The most enjoyable part of working for Nordstrom is satisfying the customer and making sure they have a great shopping experience."
good,Commissioned based employer with a relational based sales to customer experience.
good,"Busy day usually at lunch time in Nordstrom Cafe. Through observation as well as proper training I learned many techniques dealing with safety, prioritizing and cleanliness. Co-workers are great and very friendly! Hardest part of the job was learning the touch screen P.O.S. system when I began training. I definitely enjoyed meeting the new people but mostly getting to know the regular customers and other Nordstrom employees who ultimately became my clientele."
good,Probably the most fun I've ever had at any job. I was very well trained. This job is very competitive. You can really make a lot of money while working here. They only promote from within. That is a great way for your company to run more smoothly.
good,-Servicing customers with different products
good,"overall my experience is very pleasant, I grew a lot as an individual , I also learned a lot but I wasn't growing within the company so I parted ways to find more opportunities."
good,"Excellent place to work, flexible hours, management was poor, but the employee was excellent. There is not much training usually they tell you that there is an opportunity to move forward and have a better position but you can not apply without permission from your direct manager that usually if you are a good steward they tell you no because they do not want to lose you."
good,My manager was awesome. My team was a dream. The job was seasonal and I had fun. I did not stay because I did not have any interest in the available positions.
good,A great place to work.  You learn a lot and fast.  It truly was a learning experience that I will definitely remember in the future.  Working with different cosmetic lines helped me grow as a sales associate. I was able to connect with vendors to create relationships to improve sales and experiences with clients.
good,"Good place to work.  But not for everyone.  Must be mobile to succeed.  Goals can be unreasonable  bonuses are elusive. Management changes happen often (usually due to"
good,"I love the company but require more. I like the people, areas of work, and the work that I do but I would like more money and benefits because I have a dependent at home."
good,"Management in the Tacoma area plays favorites and since working there, the turn over has sky rocketed. Probably bc he doesn’t know how to hire good workers. When I’ve come to a problem, there are no unbiased opinions, and I highly recommend going straight to HR with your problems. He does although try and give you your time off if need be. I never wanted to leave, and was driven off the cliff. I miss working there and the people"
good,Very fast paced work environment. strict attendance policies. slight favoritism. hit or miss with supervisors and management. great pay and great benefits. No handbook so rules vary from sup to sup.
good,I find it appropriate to be dressed up and find that you’ll attract more people’s attention. Beware of excessive pride and vanity from co-workers and try not to let your easy going spirit be crushed by competitive and over valued employees! Other than that go get them!
good,"Being a seasonal position the training was good and the help on the floor from my supervisor, mentors and perm employees was great. They set you up for success."
good,I loved my job at Nordstrom and working there was definitely a experience of a life time its where i learned i love customer service and retail stores
good,You are in good company. Quality people. Most employees have been with the company at least 3 years. Generally high morale. Professionally competent bunch.
good,My manager at the time was horrific. I wish i would of been able to moved to a different dept. I loved the pay & benefits they provided.  Even the coworkers were great.
good,"Nordstrom Rack was an overall that was exciting to work at, although there was an issue.  But the good outweighed the bad.   Excellent Managers.  Most co-workers was great to work with as a team."
good,"Overall great I’d go back if they’d have me. Some bad months stacked up on me and I was unable to perform basic daily tasks. No excuses, I wasn’t up to par literally at that time and I can admit it. They even did their best to help me whenever possible. Thankful for great management and apologies to those I may have let down over there. Believe me I let myself down too"
good,"This was my second job that I had when I first got into working. As an 18 year old this was an amazing place to work, I met and made great friends, the culture was inviting and comfortable, and we were just a big happy family. I wish they offered more, as maybe a full time position with higher pay and benefits. As they have some older employees that deserve it, and they shouldn’t have to become a manager to receive those benefits."
good,Good company culture. Decent benefits and HR department. Love the people I work with. Working in cosmetics can be physically and emotionally tiring and management gets very serious during events. Planning for event after event can be exhausting but they pay better than most.
good,overall good company. very friendly staff. clean and organized. days end pretty quickly and employees are urged to keep a positive attitude even during stressful days.
good,Great job! Very fashion forward & customer service. They have morning rally's to get the crew excited! Our e-bar is right outside our doors with amazing coffee & treats to keep you full of energy the whole week lol.
good,"Walk around store, be on the look out. Assist store with any help I can provide. Its exciting at times when we catch cases. but when the store is dead it gets a little boring at times but we try to make it work. Move around and walk around the store."
good,I don't Really have anything to say at this moment about the job because i know they're all not the same its a different settings and style depending where you go..
good,I had a generally good experience with my time at Nordstrom. The family is very much involved in the day to day operations of this company and they are doing their best to adapt to changes in the retail landscape.
good,"Nordstrom is definitely a good company to work for. There is loads of benefits for all employees, and the culture really cares about making sure you come to work happy and ready to contribute. My only concern is that it's hard to get into move up and into more fulfilling roles without knowing the right people, or having the right pieces of paper."
good,"Nordstrom is an overall amazing company to work for. Nordstrom not only prides itself in customer service, but in making their employees happy by providing a safe, fun work environment."
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for. Nordstrom sticks to their mission of providing great customer service for their customer's and also offers great benefits for their employees as well.
good,Productive and self learning provides a safe and challenging environment. Co workers are fun and have a lot of high energy.  And look forward to moving up the company ladder and taking on more responsibilities
good,"awesome place to work great opportunities for advancement. difficult work hours and requirements, but you learn a ton and sets you up for success in the future"
good,While It was a pleasure working at various Locations across our Capital Region. There were several opportunities with establishing a work life balance.
good,You get to be around a lot of different people. Customers are great and its great to help them out. You have to make sure the store is kept clean and ready. Some days are tough and others are very rewarding.
good,"Nordstrom is known for best customer service and quite true because we aimed to please our customers. I worked there part time for almost 3 years and enjoyed working in the women’s apparel department.  Their hiring process began with an online application with an assessment. If you pass the assessment, recruiter contacts you for phone screening then an in-person interview. It’s best to dress professionally but also fashionably."
good,I joined this company as a valet 20 years ago. Never did I think it would turn into a career that I would never leave from. Great company to work for.
good,It was a okay job there was not really anything bad there. The work was fairly easy and pay was decent as well. we had enough time at our lunch to eat.
good,"It was not a bad place to work at they paid pretty fairly, and I did learn a little more about customer support. They also gave us the chance to work on the floor."
good,"A typical  day at work would consist of giving fast, friendly, service! I learned a lot from both customers and co-workers including communications, perspective, integrity, oneness, and willingness. The management used to be consistent, but due to change that was going on in the workplace, it caused some frustration. The workplace culture was amazing, it was like family! We supported each other in many ways like listening to each other when one needed and ear and we also supported each other if we were short change of lunch money! The hardest part of the job was not having time for myself and the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing people smile and making their day. My joy brought a lot of people joy!"
good,Very friendly environment and great company to grow with. Many opportunities to move up with the company. Great learning experience and company to work for.
good,While working as a server at Nordstom Cafe I was able to give customer a full customer experience. I ensure the customer has everything they asked for in terms of purchases of food in a timely manner.
good,It was a great job! Anyone who is looking for one should apply! Also great pay roll . The people made the job very easier on me! Learning how to do different things was the best part about Nordstrom
good,"This job can be bad are good. You will learn about fashion they also offer Internships. They hire from within but they also show favoritism with these promotions. Commission is only good if the customers don't return, which is a high percentage and it will hurt your pay checks ."
good,"I enjoyed working at Nordstrom.  They gave me first shot in the beauty industry and I was able to become a certified Bobbi Brown consultant.  I enjoyed the hours and the team building activities that we shared.  "
good,"Very physical job, worked in picking and packing. I worked seasonal but good way to earn extra money. You have a short lunch and 2 short breaks with a lot of walking."
good,"It was a great job, just super competitive and management can be petty and childish. especially when competing with unsalaried employees for commissions when they receive a salary. can be cut throat but super fun job."
good,"Nordstrom is a fast paced work environment when it is busy on the weekends and holidays. Nordstrom offers employee purchase discounts.  Nordstrom also offers its employees personal services for personal problems such as: grieve counseling, help to find employees housing."
good,Teaches impeccable customer service and provides management with additional HR trainings other companies do not offer. Managers work on base salary and commission which is not ideal.
good,Great people to work with and most managers are great. I worked third shift so we sometimes ran out of work and with no scheduling was a bit tedious to say the least.
good,"Great opportunity and wonderful staff. Truly enjoyed learning a new aspect of the restaurant industry. I had never worked in this field and the management was patient and understanding, yet pushed me. Sad that the company closed down the downtown site, and the possibility of switching locations wasn't very productive for me."
good,"Family owned, entrepreneurial environment. Great benefits, young IT management when I was employed, this was good and bad. Overall the experience was one to remember."
good,The most enjoyable thing about working at Nordstrom is working with a fun and diverse group of individuals that you can honestly call friends and family AND meeting the needs of every customer that crosses our threshold.
good,"Nordstrom has amazing pay and benefits. It's a great place to work. However, the main draw back is that they promote people that are not qualified. They are so anxious to promote from within that they are promoting the wrong people, leaving bad people in charge. My department manager when I left was a nitwit. She's still there."
good,"Good company bad management, too much favoritism. They only look at you if you have a friendship with management not based on your performance. Good pay"
good,"Nordstrom has been a great place to work for over seven years. I've been loyal to them and they have returned the commitment. I have good benefits, job security, and a set schedule. Not everyone is so lucky. You have to ""land"" well from the start and have good guidance to help you grow."
good,Awesome company & great work environment. I loved working there. Very good people who I worked with. I was very happy working there. I met a lot of great people.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Nordstrom greatly but if you are in an area or in a time of year where customers aren't shopping, it shows in your paycheck being that it is commission based."
good,"Great company for you to go to school ,They help you with speed and it show you how to work with people. Its a very good back up job. It helps you with time management."
good,You might like it more than others you are your own individual it’s only an opinion I can give. So enjoy your experience and make the best of it . Bye
good,"Overall, great place, great deals, great pay. "
good,I enjoyed my time at nordstrom. Most everyone was easy to get along with. They could be a little more organized. Some of the workers were not friendly or welcoming
good,I would typically show up at 5 am and grab a markdown gun and printer and go through a particular department scanning for mark down price changes. I would also help with unloading the truck and working on the floor as a sales associate.
good,"I worked in the Individualist, ViaC, and designer departments.  I had the opportunity to work with 3 associates who had been at that location for 20+ years, so it was a great education, in fashion and customer service.  "
good,"If you're really driven and self-motivated, you're able to be whomever you want to be at Nordstrom.  The only catch is that you've got to be pretty thick-skinned, as it's a very cut-throat environment.  Most everyone is looking out for themselves, their advancement and their commission.  The products are phenomenal, the culture is great, you've just really got to ""buy in"" to it all in order to succeed."
good,"Typical work day at Nordy was fast paced. I learned a lot about customer service and sales. Management was always great and willing to develop employees. Workplace culture was awesome, really worked a team to get sales. Hardest part of the job would be working weekends and holidays. I enjoyed working in Fashion and being able to make my customer fell confident in what she was buying/wearing."
good,"I have worked for Nordstrom for two years as a holiday employee and I found it to be an excellent option to make extra money around the holidays! They have a great selection of fine jewelry which is the area that I worked in. Their cosmetic and beauty department has everything you need. They hold trunk shows for their jewelry departments and have workshops within their cosmetics department which is always fun. I would recommend shopping in this store, especially around the holidays!"
good,"Come in, complete morning tasks. Greet any employees or customers I come across. Monitor store. Complete closing tasks. Perform package checks.Close store."
good,"I Love the management, the discount for employees, very fun environment, I recommend this company. The staff was great I wish it wasn't commission base."
good,Nordstrom was an excellent place to work and i enjoyed my time there.  The good thing about this is that I can go back to work there at any time that they might have an opening.
good,It was okay management was horrible hours wasn't so bad either I got good hours but management drama on the floor with other sales associates it was a mess.
good,"An extraordinary place to work and thrive in the retail sector.  You build your business as you go and the sky is the limit.  I was confident in my tenure there and proud to say that I was able to sell a 3.14 carat canary diamond at $65,000 - by far the most expensive item to ever be sold through that location."
good,I loved this job. I love all the products Norstrom sells. I enjoyed my work and was very  succesful. Manager level sales is the best way to sell in my opinion. The 100% comission schedule is grueling and pits sales people against each other.
good,It's an easy job and good pay if you're into retail .just a lot of micromanaging but every store is different . It's a good starter job very fast but easy .
good,"It's a cool and easy place to work for. The pay is definitely worth it for some people. It is based on productivity so if you're not a good fast worker, don't bother."
good,It's a good place to work at as long as it's just temporary. Hard to make a career out of it and live comfortably. It's a good work environment still.
good,"My favorite job, the hourly pay is ok but best commission job I have ever had. Worth my time and discounts were great. Managers didn't micromanage and everyone was sweet"
good,"This is a great place to work in Sales as long as you're comfortable with 100% commission based salary. Good company, just hard for a work/life balance when working weekends, but that's the industry."
good,"Nordstrom was great because if you are a good salesperson you will be successful, and management is great for encouraging you and giving sales tips. The internship was hectic as our supervisor for the internship was promoted mid summer."
good,Un lugar de trabajo donde tienes las opciones de crecimiento a tu disposición.
good,"Strong focus in customer service and satisfaction.  Excellent training opportunities, great rewards programs, strong incentives for excellent service."
good,"I worked at Nordstrom for 5 years. It was always a fun job. Lots of high energy. I'm naturally customer service oriented, so it was a good fit for me. The best time to work at Nordstrom is during the Holiday season. At the time, the merchandise returns are directly taken out of your check, which always sucked. However, I understand the return policy has recently changed. Kudos to Nordstrom for looking out for their employees. It was far too easy once upon a time to get taken advantage of."
good,"Learned how to communicate with people from all backgrounds. Enjoyed the different events Nordstrom hosts, they sometimes bring d.js which made the working space more enjoyable."
good,Retail is changing and everyone is shopping online. Less foot traffic at brick and mortar stores caused management to panic. The beauty department had the most cuts.
good,Amazing place to work and grow within the company and be promoted. Very diligent place focused on customer service and being a place of intergrity. Great people to be around.
good,"Nordstrom was a excellent company to work for, the management was very helpful and assisted you whenever possible. This was a seasonal position my only regret was that the job ended. My position entailed assisting online Customers with their shopping needs and filling their orders including packaging labeling, shipping and receiving. The culture was very upbeat and the employees worked together to assist one another in completing tasks. It was my pleasure to have worked there."
good,"I worked here as a stocker behind the scenes. It was like magic. You would unload all the new product off the truck in the correct section and put it all away before the sales people would come. It was like watching a lovely dance happen once the sales group showed up. They would go around their sections and make sure everything was perfect. "
good,"The work is fun, there are many interesting people to meet, and the store is beautiful. Management is engaged with what is happening daily, they keep employees motivated with positive words, and are always willing to help with any questions. Highly recommend employment here. The only downside is getting in - parking at this location can be very tricky and frustrating."
good,My internship for nordstrom although it was brief allowed me time to really see the inner-workings of the nordstrom job experience i was very intrigued by how their market research was operated. i would say maybe the saddest part of the internship was when the internship was over. it would of been great to of been offered an entry level position but at the moment they were full staffed
good,It's about what you put into the job that makes you money. Being 100% commissioned based you need to utilize the programs Nordstrom has to help salespeople reconnect with customers
good,Working for Nordstrom was quite enjoyable as they have an extremely customer based culture. My way of customer service not only fit in with Nordstrom it also improved.
good,"Overall experience at Nordstrom was enjoyable. They had great work system, decent benefits, and made sure everyone was trained to do what they need to do."
good,"Love my current job with nordstrom great company to work for. However if you get stuck with a bad manager like i am it makes working for a company that preaches job advancement since day one  very unattainable. That being said other than that it is a great company fair benefits, and great starting pay."
good,"Great company. Hours are not good. Work life balance is possible. But, It is still hard. All in all Great company. and would recommend."
good,Great pay for the amount of work you do nothing difficult .Management was great ! but very difficult to have school/family life when working a lot of hours
good,"i love working at nordstrom, the company culture is so cool. always fashion forward and i am able to get first pick of sale and non sale items"
good,"- Come in 10 mins before the store opens. Shine costumers shoes in the back if I drop offs but the costumers that sit on the stand are the priority "
good,the best customer service at Nordstrom with great products and sales.It is fun work place too with many rewards when your customer is happy
good,"Really great place to work  if you love fashion and helping customers."
good,"Best job to have. You can move up fast and they are really flexible. Their benefits are amazing. My co-workers are the best. HR is on site and willing to help with any problems. Everything that a person will need to know about nordstorm, once hired is online to view."
good,"Fun interaction with people."
good,Fast paced place to work. A lot of variety in work day.can be challenging but also can be fun.Co- workers are great. at time it can be hard to build lasting relationships because turn over is very high.
good,"A European style quick service cafe, Cafe Nordstrom was part of a chain located in Nordstrom department stores. All dishes were prepared fresh, including salad dressings and sauces. There's a lot of pressure on the cooks to work quickly and efficiently while maintaining very high standards. I learned a lot about real food and real cooking in just a few weeks. Nordstrom has excellent benefits, including employee discounts in the store. The pay is good for Chicago food service. The crew while I was there were dedicated, knowledgeable and fun to be with. Lay-offs in the winter sent several new hires home."
good,It was sufficient and an experience that will advance me in my ongoing career. It provided balance and stability; wonderful staff.
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom Rack involves a lot of promoting sales, customer service, tasking, and communication. Very fast paced environment."
good,"I met a lot of leaders while working for Nordstrom, I enjoyed my time there. I struggled my first couple of months there but I learned about fashion and became a top salesman in my department"
good,"Brewing coffee, making specialty drinks, providing fresh food and pastries, and cleaning were all in a days work. I learned a great deal of information about coffee, and different brewing processes. My co-workers were great and we always had a good time. Cleaning was by far the hardest part, always up and down, using very strong chemicals. The most enjoyable part was making drinks, especially when it was busy."
good,"Working at Nordstrom I learned a lot about customer service at it's best! Everyone that works at Nordstrom are top sellers and they have the best customer service you can imagine. I built my customer service skills by working here and I learned how to multitask very well also. A typical day at work was assisting all personal stylist with any retail therapy their clients needed, water, different sizes, shoes etc. It was always a fast pace environment with a lot of movement during the day. All the managers was helpful and very friendly. I really enjoyed working at Nordstrom."
good,Old Company with a great future. Really takes care of their employees. Would highly recommend working for this company.
good,"This is a company that has been in business for over a century. It is still family owned and publicly traded. The online and off price business has steadily grown over the last decade or so. The work life balance is difficult at this company, but management has always been great."
good,This was a busy department that required excellent patience and service.  Dealing with the general public who shop at this store was always intriguing to watch.  The expectation level is high and thus the demand for quality service higher.  It was a fun energetic environment.
good,"We work on commission, Able to move up, great workspace and nice people"
good,i loved working for Nordstrom. image great money at young age but was only seasonal. the hardest part of my job was a knowing it was going to end. The most enjoyable part was helping my clients with garment selection and having them leave my dept. satisfied.
good,"we were known for our customer service, upper management cared more about the customer then the employee."
good,"Great place to work if you're into retail and have the drive for it , the possibilities are endless."
good,"A typical day would began at 7am, I clock in and  print prior days reports. Then I would go out to my sales floor to see all new merchandise rolled our by out stock team. Depending on how many racks of new merchandise I have I began rmerching  the floor to feature out the new product and make room for the old as well. This requires plenty of movement and new ideas. This process can sometimes be an all day process that has to be delegated to other employees through out the day, if our truck was a lot of units. The goal is to have it all done by opening which is at 10am. Once we open customers become the priority. immediately we have customers coming to shop as soon as the doors open. Between myself, 1st asst. and manager have to run our department which is the largest department of store. Our department is responsible for the fitting rooms, and putting back all the merchandise customers try on. we are also responsible for ringing up customers on the stores mobile device, as well as to customer service them, manage our pads, and keep them clean. A typical day at our store is 90% constant movement and multitasking."
good,"* Provided a unique shopping experience to all customers via in person by phone or online. "
good,"My day starts with looking at emails and then I head out to the stores and do a Business development with my managers. We watch the interaction between our team member and customers. On the spot coaching and have some solutions for issues."
good,Love this place! Employees always score great deals and my co-workers are awesome!
good,"if you love fashion or would like a career in fashion this place is for you. Everyday you work with customers as their personal stylist, you merchandise the floor, stock the floor, and sale your favorite looks to your customers. Although working here is very time consuming, really won't be able to spend too much time with family or friends."
good,"Great company to work for, promotes from within with a strong concentration on customer satisfaction. The most challenging part of my career with Nordstrom were the extreme work environment/ long hours ext. The most enjoyable part of my job were customer interactions and team playing management."
good,"Nordstrom, the Company, I really liked and respected.  The Management that I worked for were wonderful people and I got along well with all of them  "
good,A very fast paced working environment that included team work as well as individual. Typical day consist of contact with customers with any concerns regarding transaction and making sure that their overall work experience was  a good one.  Make sure they were aware of their daily job assignments s. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the task done and being ahead of myself on my job assignments.And working with customers.
good,Working at Nordstrom Rack was an enjoyable experience for the most part. It was the whole working from opening to closing basically everyday that took away from the fact that I was not allowed to take care of any personal needs outside of work.
good,This is the perfect place for someone that is a people friendly person. If you is not easy for you to talk to people and ask them what the needs are then it will be hard for you to fulfill the customer service expectation.
good,I enjoyed the customers as well as employees.  I had a great time meeting and building new relationship with people.
good,- A day in the buying/planning offices at Nordstrom is extremely fast paced with a high expectation of output.
good,"Fun enivornement, learned how to be task oriented, learned to work well with others, learned to communicate well with others"
good,Retail hours were difficult with small children. Workplace environment was great though. I had an excellent manager and very fun co-workers.
good,"The company is amazing to work for however the compensation and work/life balance are not appealing to me anymore. I am looking for a more stable schedule as well as advancement opportunities with further education. I love the aspect of working with and around people occassionally. I have advanced to management within a year and a half of being with the company, I learned how to coach and train a team and run a very successful business. I had consistent increases over LY figures every month for the last year."
good,it was a fun enviroment to work in. I enjoyed the job but had to resign for school... I loved the hours and the co-workers in my department.
good,I enjoy working with the clientele in getting them fitted in the right bras and / or prothesis as it is amazing to see what a change a bra can make in their demeanor. They stand straighter and almost always walk out w / a smile on their face. I particularly like working w / the prothesis clientele as this can make them feel like their old selves again. I've seen many happy faces especially among the older people who had surgery years agao and are not aware of some of the items that are available to make them feel so much better about themselves.
good,Working to improve hiring and recruiting to be more inclusive. Benefits including paternity leave and working to stay competitive with other big companies close by. Updating a lot of data analysis tools to improve work flow.
good,The work atmosphere is encouraging. The supervisors are friendly. The benefits are pretty good. As long as you work hard you’ll find nothing to worry about.
good,"Extremely fun to work in. Lots of great people to meet and work with and you learn a lot about the fashion and sales side."
good,IT WAS OVERALL A GREAT COMPANY THEY HAVE MULTIPLE BENEFITS. The compensation for getting sick or needing time off is great the pay was great and they are very lenient
good,"Working retail is hard work, but Nordstrom makes sure that all of their employees feel like a big family. Managers are friendly and efficient. Requires lots of patience and adaptability to difficult situations."
good,N people are friendly helpful considerate benefits very nice 👍 upper management very accessible to everyone who is working there and happy to talk at any time that is asked for an open door policy to all
good,"Great job,great benefits and great customers! Parking in the garage is perfect. The hours could be better,but its retail. Great networking opportunities."
good,"Manager needs to be revaluated and not lean hard on some workers but altogether"
good,"This job is hard but once you have earned a core position it is a great place to work. If you take advantage of the benefits and dedicate yourself this company can take you any were, it is unfortunate I could not continue working for Nordstrom when I moved to Spokane."
good,I've been with Nordstrom for 5 years.  The company culture is overall good. There is a general sense of looking out for their employees. I've had a few disappointments (including an extremely poor raise last year that was both merit and COL and was under $1/he despite me being #1 on my team).
good,This is a great company to work for while in school . They were really accommodating. The pay was decent for the area and the work load was light . Great company culture and love their open door policy .
good,"A typical day at work is not that busy since we’re located in the mall of America ,were mostly busy on the weekend then on weekdays. It’s a pretty stable pace it’s mostly returns from online coming in"
good,"As a Regional IT technician I would support the infrastructure of the company and served the people within, which included support for all hardware and software related issues."
good,"I was hired as Cashier for Holidays. The uplifting of holidays"
good,"Great job! Loved working there, they take care of their employees and I didn’t leave because of anything negative. I decided to pursue other endeavors."
good,I liked the department I worked in. I got along with management as well as fellow coworkers. I focused on the aspect of cleaning the department when I needed to focus on selling. I am not the type to push people to buy things that are overpriced and out of their budget. Its somewhat competitive with sales and promoting credit cards to be opened.
good,"Was a fun environment to work in! Flexible scheduling, Albeit not many shifts. Fantastic pay for the work that you’re doing though, not much you can complain about"
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work. The environment is really fun and there is always an incentive to work towards. Its hard to be on your feet all day but meeting nice people is fun
good,"Nordstrom really cares about its employees and that was my favorite thing about them. There was a lot of teamwork involved, and I made so many lifelong friends there."
good,Your salary is commission based so your salary is highly reliant on your performance.  It can be competitive with other sales associates working alongside you but this encourages you to work harder and achieve your goals.
good,Nordstrom is a nurturing culture where I was provided the opportunity to pursue skills I was interested in. Meetings are a minimum and work-life balance is healthy. It's easy to connect with people from around the company.
good,"I didn't officially work for Nordstrom, I was a part of their Nordstrom Fashion Ambassador program. High School students in the Cincinnati area came to the Kenwood location to meet with faculty to learn about fashion forecasting and up and coming trends. We also did assignments like helping with the display cases and giving feedback about what their target market is looking for."
good,"I loved it so much but it was a lot to handle. The fashion industry was hard being at the register, being involved was not good in the long run but I tried it overall"
good,The downside is a lot of favoritism. The customers were really nice. I had an issue at my old apartment were the wire was old. My old apartment agents refused to fix it. Even though it was seasonal it cost me getting hired permanently. Otherwise I love the hours I worked. I was able to be home with my younger kids and still have my 100% professionalism at work.
good,really enjoyed my coworkers and the customers however they kept cutting the managers hours until we lost our insurance and I had to have it do to my health.it was a pleasant place to work
good,Manual labor but we'll worth it. The pay is good with full benefits. The shift is a morning shift so it requires a morning kind of person. It's starts a 2am I the morning.
good,In my work at Nordstrom I had my first experience of becoming a barista. What I have come to learn about the job is that the hardest part is not even learning to make the coffee. The hardest part is mastering how to please every customer that demands something from you.
good,"Great experience with staff including upper management. "
good,Working at Nordstrom was a great learning experience. I'm very thankful for the opportunity to have worked with such great people. Nodstrom's emphasis on providing unparalleled customer service has been a part of my whole work persona even after leaving!
good,"Lovely company to work for, department was a little unorganized due to new management. Not treated fair due to favoritism, some workers can be unprofessional and make it harder for you to finish your work. No tattoo/piercing policy. depending on department and what management can look like , I would highly recommend"
good,"Nordstrom cares for there employees! One of the best companies I’ve ever worked for, I love the diversity of people here benefits are great,if u getem"
good,I was able to dress in comfortable clothes and go find clothes that were ordered online so while looking for clothes customers didn't know I was an employee so it was pretty great not having to talk to customers and just work on my own time.
good,"Nordstrom is great place to work if you are outgoing and love servicing customers. The hours vary weekly, and most employees don’t have a set schedule, meaning days off are different every two weeks. The work culture is very high which provides for quality friendships to develop among coworkers. Having the ability to work well on a team and be motivated to drive product sales is key for success."
good,Fast pace work but Is still fun to work there. Very easy to get into groove or good work flow. Managers/Shift leaders are very respectful and give great positive criticism.
good,I enjoyed working at Nordstrom ! I enjoyed the freedom they gave to make decisions. I loved the training that helped me to become the sales expert I am today .
good,Great place to work and really easy to move up. Productive meetings. Definitely a company that can teach not just to be a great sales person but also prepare for other types of great opportunities .
good,Great Company..but online is killing the position.  Its Retail Sales ..up & down..checks. Very Flexible.  It's not for weak at heart. If your not good in sales or shu wrong job for you!!!
good,"It’s a great place to work! I love sales, and I recommend it for anyone else who wants to evolve their own sales expertise. I’m just not into the fashion business, so that threw me off, but I took that as a challenge and it made the job much more fun. Unfortunately Health Problems arose for me where I had to quit. "
good,Working with Nordstrom was a blessing in disguise. It exposed me to people from different cultures from all over the world. Being a Nordy allowed me to truly learn the definition of customer service.
good,It was fun and not to stressful working at Nordstroms fulfillment center because of the diversity of employees. Always met people with cool backgrounds on where they are from and how they lived. the hardest part of the job was standing for 8-12 hours but I don't really mind it. Also the management is very friendly and do a great job in training. The only downfall I have is that it was a seasonal position.
good,"It's a great retail job, I would recommend working at Nordstrom if you're starting a career in retail.  I enjoyed the people I worked with.  As a manager, you're guaranteed 40 hours a week."
good,"I love how diverse Nordstrom is. From the different age groups to ethnical backgrounds. Nordstrom has its own little world inside itself, the rest of the mall does not really matter because Nordstrom has separate rules and security and hours. I will say that the department manager can either make or break your experience."
good,Great place to work if you are willing to put in the effort and work hard. The environment can get competitive and lead to conflict among co-workers. Management will also pick favorites.
good,"great place for benefits and pay however its a lot like high school"
good,"Working at Nordstrom is all about building a business or client base to continue success. But due to increase in online sales they have shifted their focus there as well, obviously. Not a bad place to work by any means but as days go by less and less people are coming in to shop making it more difficult to create a rapport or customer retention with customers."
good,I really enjoyed working at Nordstrom's I was there for almost five and a half years I was cross-training all positions I was never given the opportunity for advancement and management even though I was told over and over again I would get the position got tired of putting in all that work with no benefit for advancement pay was also not at what it should be for the years of experience and the amount of work I did on a daily.
good,This is a great place to learn how ro interact and with people. You are able to sharpen your emotional intelligence. Learn how to be service clients by going above and beyond your expectation.
good,They have great opportunities. You can build yourself from the ground on up. Majority of the managers treat their employees with respect and fairness.
good,great place to work. very competitive. flexible with schedule. The challenging part is standing on your feet. make sure to have comfortable shoes. typical day is recommending or selling to customers and customizing so they feel good about their purchase. also its paramount for your paycheck.
good,"Great work place! Just a lot of time put into the work, tiring work days. The commission is nice, during the busy season. Wish there was shorter work days, but understandable."
good,I liked my time at Nordstrom. I enjoy the fast paced work environment and the feedback from management for overall performance. I would and definitely do recommend it to anyone interested.
good,Although I enjoy the personal that work for Nordstrom I do not fully agree with their theft deterrent safe guards and follow through. I do feel Nordstrom is a great work environment.
good,Great work hours.  Great quality of life.  Fun people.  Great customer service.  Quality food.  Mostly required to move around or relocate in order to move up and get promoted.
good,I started working for the company in CA and I loved it. I relocated to WA and the management was horrible. Everything I worked for was lost. So I left
good,"I loved my job. I got to spend my day selling clothes to people and helping them find whatever it was they needed. And you can make A LOT of money. It does have a little bit of chance but if you can find the right things to say, you will sell a lot of stuff. However, there may be 5 salespeople in a department that are fighting over customers, especially during a slow day. Most salespeople are courteous and ask the other salespeople about a customer before they approach but it can get very toxic. Also, a lot of management is ""drinking the Nordstrom Kool-Aid"": they are basically mindless drones to the corporate machine, without challenging or creating their own ideas."
good,"The workplace culture is really what made the difference. To be able to collaborate ideas and questions from anyone on your team was great."
good,"If you have a passion for customer service, fashion, and people this is a great place to work.  The company offers many opportunities if you have the flexibility to re-locate."
good,"Lots of opportunities to learn here as an intern. If I ever have a question, everyone is super helpful, but there are also a lot of resources such as NedX talks and active Slack channels."
good,I left it better than I found it. I do not know what to write! I loved my job job moved to a locatythats too far from a local Nordstrom. Wish I could work another 20 years
good,"The ebar lacked consistent management. They moved managers around too much, so there was little support and training. Other than that I loved everything about working there."
good,Nordstrom was and is one of the BEST places to start a career. Loved the direction of the business and the team I worked with. I think the exposure to such incredible brands and items are well worth it.
good,"Very friendly and enjoyable, fast-paced environment with a mixed culture diversity and age group.  Very competitive arena, with great bonuses to come along with the challenges."
good,Great place to work but depending on  commission sales is very stressful.  The cultural is cut throat and tends to put sale people as odds with each other.
good,"Nordstrom Is a great place to work. I look forward to coming to work. The other employees  are friendly and inviting. I learned to be patience, to do my very best, and to use my best judgment when assisting customers. My most enjoyable part of the job is when we're busy. I have to stay busy and meeting customers. The hardest part of the job is when I have explored all options to assist customers and they are not satisfied or There is nothing else I could do to make their experience with us a great one. Management here is fair, They all communicate well with us and each other."
good,"Working at Nordstrom is a Love/Hate relationship! I Love, Love Nordstrom! I love the merchandise, design, and feel of the stores. I love that working for Nordstrom is all about the customer! I loved that part of my job. It was also a very stressful job with the rapidly increasing goals and my personal drive. I always strive to be the very best at my job and keep excelling. So, at times, (lots of times) it was very difficult. But there are so many aspects of my job I loved! I loved my clients first off. Then, as a makeup artist, there are lots of perks if you love products and experiencing new things you get cosmetic gratis. You can earn as much as you want if you want to work hard for it. I know retail is changing, but I would work there again in the right circumstances."
good,"A general great company to work with, very educational. They really promote learning helpful skills like record keeping and organization that can easily carry over into other careers. This is a company that truly values all its employees no matter what your skill level or pay grade. Opportunity for internal promotion is high and quality of service always top notch."
good,Very good place to work meeting a lot of people from all walks of life people will even ask you to come Work for them because of the way I kept the building was clean and comfortable
good,I would consider myself lucky to have had the Nordstrom way of customer servcie taught to me. I use it daily in my current role. The training and level of excelence is something i charish.
good,Nordstrom is a very relaxed environment to work in. It does require a go-getter personality. While working there I learned to be persistent and to work with a smaller team to get the job done. The hardest part about the job is gaining customer relationships and having a regular clientele.
good,"It's a good place to work overall.  The people are very nice, and the company does a lot for the community.  The only downside is it is hard to live in Seattle on any salary less than $50,000.  But a great place."
good,at Nordstrom everyone strives to meet customer expectations and it something that everyone was willing to do without blinking an eye. All employees that work or have worked for the company have always grown into other positions. It is a great place to start a career.
good,Good place to work at; very competitive. Working in the accessory department never really got busy considering not a lot of people purchase accessories.
good,"A great place to play full out and give it the best you've got everyday!"
good,"While I was in school, I would work at Nordstrom over the summer. The work environment was very friendly and everyone was working together to get the job done."
good,"I worked in the Café and we served a lot of employees and families.  Everyone was very nice and polite.  Weather it was just getting water or grabbing lunch, everyone was always very nice and loved the company.  I had a great time at the Seattle location."
good,I had the pleasure to attend the Future Nordstrom Leadership program and experience an in depth training for management. Nordstrom takes the time to educate their employees throughout their own management training which is exceptional.
good,wonderful place to work and provides opportunities across North America. Nordstrom's culture is contagious and provides a safe environment for its employees.
good,"Such an amazing workplace. I worked there for the summer of my senior year of high school.  It helped me gain discipline to be on time, work well with others, and respect my co-workers and managers.  I made amazing friends in the few months that I worked there."
good,"Nordstrom provides a great environment for their employees and their customers. It was a great place to gain experience with customer service. The pay was fair and the interactions with superiors, other employees, and customers were almost all good."
good,"Nordstrom desires serious focus on sales and customer service. One is expected to keep up on their customer ""book"" and make many follow-up calls to clients."
good,"I truly enjoyed my time with them.  Fairly new location.  High turn around in people.  Several changes in management. Overly hired, hours cut.  Call in system for next day shift could use work.  They have enough people and data to set up schedules differently."
good,"The departments can be clicque & management hardly ever can agree between shifts. but overall a great place to work with great benefits & good pay."
good,I enjoyed every aspect of it. I enjoyed my co- workers and customers. I was able to identify the needs of my customers as well as sales associate. I learned how to work with different and difficult customers to resolve issues to ensure customer sastifactory.
good,This job is quite fun. It is fast paced and everyone is kind to eachother. I would highly recommend this position to a friend. The pay is competitive and the company offers many benefits.
good,"Nordstrom promotes internally, which is great, unfortunately if you're not young and fresh out of college, they hesitate.  That said... overall I would recommend anyone whos interested in retail . The culture is nice and the customers are the best. Other retailers do not compare."
good,"buy since it was during the holiday season, but overall fairly simple. I had already worked at a similar place (Macys) so the job wasn't difficult. I enjoyed it and then left."
good,Managers are attentive and help employee achieve department and personal goals. Job requires basic knowledge of cosmetics and the ability to apply cosmetics in an aesthetically pleasing manner. this job helped me develop my retail skills immensely
good,"a typical day i would set up the salt and pepper shakers, sweep, buss tables, serve drinks occasionally run food talk to customer about there experience and food at nordstrom cafe"
good,"Fun competitive young culture. "
good,I worked part-time at Nordstrom and made about $30/hr because of commission.  Truly a place where you write your own check. The harder you work the more money you will make but it is competitive. Can have work place drama if you engage but you can steer clear if you focus on work. Benefits aren't the best and any major job advancement requires that you move to Seattle where headquarters is. Good for students or some one not looking to advance. Good work to life balance and flexible schedule.
good,I was trained by a guy who had recently been told he would be let go due to tardiness and he didn't really care to show us the ins and out of the job.
good,"From the first day, work was fast paced. You learn as you go. Some of the software used on mobile and register devices is outdated and would be a pain to use, slowing down the experience for the customer. You're pushed to sell the Nordstrom Card, which can make customers angry during a transaction."
good,"I'm only working for a contract role with nordstrom but my team were filled with former contractors(including my manager!). Overall everyone there is nice and very helpful, really a nice place to work. The managers there appreciates curious and eager new hires so its important to be proactive. "
good,"When you work at Nordstrom the employees become your family. I met many of my best friends working for this company. There are a lot of opportunities for growth and store managers are willing to get you where you want to go if you make them aware of your goals. Benefits were really good, 401k company match and the discount it a plus!"
good,Its a easy job with huge benefits if you have a car and time.I would recommend it as a first job. Just meet expectations and don't slack off or break rules.
good,"Great perks- say good bye to your paychecks. Management isn't great and there isn't much staff appreciation. But, pays well and benefits are good. Comission isn't bad depending on the department."
good,"Overall great place to work, room for advancement as quickly as 6 months, great commissions, bonuses, employee discounts, not as easy as one would think, however overall great company"
good,I love my job and the environment. It is one of the best companies to work for! The company is very balanced as well as very fair. It's fairly easy to grow and each and everyday there's something new to learn. I would recommend the company to any and everyone looking for a productive work environment.
good,"Excellent working environment, fun place to work, challenging, and competitive. Quick paced environment.  Lots of creativity. Great opportunity to move up in career advancement.  Great co workers and management."
good,"I am a rover and have even for many years, this company is flexible based on my needs and their needs.  My pay is quite low for the amount of years I have worked and the energy I put forth in this role.  I stay because I enjoy the role and co-workers."
good,I enjoyed the job the pay and the quick advancement its a fun place to work and the people you work with are cool management could be better but overall enjoyed my time there
good,"Fun , fast pace  environment  . The customers were great and I enjoyed working with them. I am a people oriented person who actually enjoys engaging with others. I enjoy helping people."
good,"I will start out by saying I'm pretty bias when it comes to Nordstrom, because to me its still the best department retailer out there, and my experience working there was good."
good,"Managing other cashiers, logistics, assisting 20 other sales associates with managers and customers while answering the phone with multiple lines. Cleaning, heavy lifting, organizing the cash wrap"
good,"Good job, fair pay, fast paced. Days go by fast and Ive been trained to do many different jobs at this location. Opportunity for advancement if interested."
good,always on your toes customers are great managers are approachable once after working it becomes more like a family atmosphere would definitely work for the company again!
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for. Learned alot about entrepreneurship and designers. Management really cares about employees. Hardest part of the job was commission.
good,a great job where you can expand your skill set while working in a forward thinking environment. Holidays are tough but that comes with the territory.
good,"Norstrom is a great place that will teach you teamwork, leadership, people skills, customer service, and ethics. Entering the Nordstrom world is entering a whole new dimension. It's a different culture there. Depending on your manager, your life could be easy or awful. Luckily mine was a friend and a coach."
good,This is job where one can absolutely move up and become manager. The most enjoyable part of the job is the different events that Nordstrom holds for children. Customers are treated just like family and so are the associates.
good,"Nordstrom holds up to their reputation not only with their customers but especially with their employees. They provided top notch customer service training for their employees which ensures happy returning customers, daily. I enjoyed managing the Womens Accessories Department. I worked long hours as I was there to help unload new merchandise to the floor, open the store, provide customer care and service, and closed the store in the evenings while getting ready for the next business day to arrive. The sales were always great. The return policy is outstanding. The quality of their goods and wares was always high end."
good,"Great company overall, able to advance your career very quickly if mobile. The company really provides excellent customer service and gives its employees the necessities to connect with their customers."
good,"Overall, Nordstrom is a good company to work for. I just need a change in my career since I've been working for them for 13 years. I am ready to see what other opportunites out there for me."
good,The work is fun. You get to talk to people all day and build relationships with both your customers and coworkers. I learned how to understand a customer's need quickly and efficiently and help them find a solution.
good,"I had a great high quality customer service experience  in retail."
good,"Great place to work, wonderful company with great benefits. Can be held responsible for the molding of wonderful professionals in the workplace today."
good,"Nordstrom is one of the best companies I have ever had the pleasure to work for. Their customer service, training and attention to details is next to none."
good,Always had a lack of lateral communication would receive information last second. Management was very helpful except the loss prevention manager he is very personal.
good,"Good benefits and perks, would highly recommend this company.  The only thing i dislike is that you start off as a seasonal employee and therefore your contract can be terminated at any time"
good,The benefits are good and the work environment also good. Just have to know how to balance work and personal life and don't let them over work you. Overall is a good company
good,Great company to work for if you're hard working and reliable because your production and attendance is constantly monitored. Good compensation for the work you do. Management does its best to keep employees happy. It is perhaps one of the cleanest and most comfortable places I have ever worked for. They go above and beyond to make your work environment comfortable.
good,"Great place to work. "
good,"Great company , Very fast paced . A days work would include working in assigned departent , helping customers with what they needed and being friendly at all times"
good,"I've been working here since the summer and I really like it, it's a good job for students and young adults. It's a really good transitional job if you want to transfer and work somewhere else in the company."
good,"This is a family oriented company from top to bottom.  Meaning diversity is truly valued and it is possible to have a work family here while working towards a common goal.  If anything, I wish there was more visibility to my own metrics and how I'm performing as a highly competitive individual in a base level role that is customer facing."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company, has room for growth and also a good starting job for any one interested in retail! working for the company i have learned how to work with others and take that experience to the next level of coaching others in the role ahead. one awesome fact is they make it easy to transfer across america and stay with the company! when it comes to management at Nordstrom there is a little brushing up to do, across the bored equality and appreciation everything the employee brings to the company. The hardest part of the job for me was the scheduling, effecting structure in your outside life and the work overload in some locations. Last but not least the most enjoyable part depending on location, the team work involved every day to drive numbers and always putting the customer first!"
good,Enjoy working at Nordstrom.  Able to concentrate on team and team development. Have been training sales associates for eight years.  I am in management.
good,Nordstrom gave their employees the ability to quickly move up through the chain of command.  The people within the company were amazing.
good,"Very fast paced environment, huge store with many different employees/co-workers. Variety of people including customers & staff."
good,I enjoy assisting customers by providing exceptional customer service and working with my team to achieve positive results. I learned that a team is not just having one person to stand out but if we all collaborate together and every employee stays accountable to daily goals we will all stand out as successful team.
good,A typical day at work is anything but that. You see and learn so many new things that it is impossible for your day to become routine. The people you meet along the way are so diverse. No one looks the same and that's exactly what building a strong team should be like. We all brought something different to the table which ultimately rewarded us with success. There were some difficult days especially around holiday season when business picked up tremendously. All hands were on deck to service the customer. Whatever your skill level there's something for you within the company.
good,"A typical day at work for me is very basic coming into work on time clocking in and seeing all the customers waiting to shop around.i learned new things everyday with this job like the people and what they like to wear and the how to be a great employee.My managers i just loved them , this job made me feel like we were a family they cared alot. As well as my co workers they were all loving.The hardest part of this job to me was working at a retail store because i love to shop as any one would. The most enjoyable part was to see the customers shop around with their family and enjoy all the new merchandise that was out."
good,"very well organized, high class clientele and caters to customers and , constant competition with coworkers for higher payer, customers, and goal requirements. learn to merchandise and  become apart of the logistics team"
good,"Fun place to work.  Sometimes the 100% commission pay can be very competitive.  Other employees can be very cut throat and not work fairly when it comes to taking customers."
good,Best customer service experience you will ever get shopping! You walk in to Nordstrom and you get a personal shopper. That is how they train us to work with customers. One of the best experiences
good,"You are the entrepreneur of your own business. Nordstrom supplies you with the tools to achieve any goals you may have. They have a very supportive management team. If you are a hard worker, you will really shine with this company"
good,"gain knowledge of nordstrom store culture "
good,"Very flexible and a lot of room for growth. A typical day at work is very busy, assisting customers with sales, purchases and doing markdowns and inventory. Management is always resourceful and available."
good,great experience I'm just having a bit of trouble balancing family and work with what they ask of me at the counter i am at.
good,"Great work place with supportive colleagues. Many ways to progress within the company. Definitely a fun and exciting environment to meet new people and to grow as an individual, as well as a team member."
good,seasonal position that required me to come in every morning good people great work environment  only wish i stayed longer besides that i enjoyed the food and coffee discounts
good,"Working at Nordstrom was a great experience overall for me.  I enjoyed the people and the fast pace.  The pay was high for retail, as it was commission based. I had been with Alaska airlines for 6 years prior to working at Nordstrom so I had a strong foundation in customer service, which helped tremendously. The hardest part of the job was the fact that when a customer returned a pair of shoes the commission you earned was deducted from your check. Working weekends proved to be a challenge as well, since I had young children at home. A typical day was basically just running back and forth to the stock room and retrieving shoes for customers.  Sometimes I would have two or three customers at a time, which was  good for improving my memory skills.  One must remember size, style and who wanted which shoe. We were expected to bring out additional pairs for each customer in addition to the pair chosen. We also did inventory, stocked and ordered shoes from other stores.  Once I even hand delivered a pair of shoes because a customer needed them as soon as they came back into town for an event."
good,"I loved working for Nordstrom and worked my way up from sales associate to assistant manager of Studio, to manager of Studio and Collectors, then on to assistant buyer for the NW region.  I prided my self and my business with the attention to detail and the service opportunities we offered our customers.  Managing a department of 14 women all on commission had its challenges."
good,Nordstrom is a great company to build and advance your personal skill set. Their standard of customer service translates and comes in hand with any future employment position you may take on.
good,Nordstrom is one of the few company's that still promote from within. They insure the continuation of the culture they have set forth for 100 years
good,"Nordy's is great! You will be hard pressed to find a workplace which puts you first. Whether it be needing to call out because your kid is sick, switching days with a team employee, or needing a day off for a doctor's appointment, Nordstrom is very easy to work with. The customers are generally very nice. They do expect a certain type of atmosphere because it is a higher class store. It is also expected you dress in finer brands of clothing or at least look like you do. It is not out of place to see an associate in Kate Spade. It is also not out of place to see an associate in 5 inch heels. A wonderful perk about the workplace is it offers a reasonable discount which can be used at both its in house cafe and its in house restaurant. Associates will often take a 5-10 minute coffee break and run to the E-bar to grab a latte. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a healthy sales per hour. Because they pay more expect to have a higher sph requirement than most other places."
good,Working here was nice but the only thing I did not enjoy were customers that were exceptionally rude to me and other associates.
good,I enjoyed the co-workers and the environment in which I worked.  The management could be a bit inefficient at times but always had the employees best interests.
good,Work culture at Nordstrom is incredible. Upper management goes out of their way to make sure that a thorough knowledge of policies and procedures is understood and adhered to.
good,Hard to find a better company than Nordstrom. Most managers will do anything to help you advance or help you with any issues you may have.
good,"I had a lot of freedom, would stock the shelfs, wrap produce for customers, learned to have good customer service, co-workers were great an helpful. Hards part of the job was parking in the mall parking. Management was great, she was my friend."
good,"Loved the culture at Nordstrom, especially during the seasonal hiring times of the year because it really forces everyone to be on their best behavior, simply so they can try and out sell one another. Obviously since its seasonal your probably just working here to make a quick buck, and it definitely serves that purpose. Odd of being kept after the sale... not usually very good (but not impossible)."
good,"Love working with Nordstrom!"
good,It was great ! great pay and also always very busy with many thing Sales were awesome.
good,"The compensation was good you were guaranteed a 4 figure check every two weeks. The management was not very good they all drunk the kool-aid of running lists and putting employees in the back for stock work. That would've been fine if my job title said stock person. Most of my co-workers were awesome. Some of them would lie and steal your sales, so watch out!!! The politics wore me out by the time that I left this God forsaken place my mind, body, and soul was TIRED!!!!!! "
good,"Nordstrom is all about customer service. Working for Nordstrom is an experience like no other. The people I would interact with every day were always cheerful and happy. Sometimes the work days could be long, and the preparation for events could be stressful, but at the end of the day the hard work certainly pays off!"
good,"Managing the counter was beyond pleasant experience. The department was a wonderful place with every resource necessary for running a profitable business. Responsibilities included making sure the counter was always impeccable, keeping up with current clients as well as searching for new clients, executing successful events, extensive knowledge of all brands available, and a huge focus on making your sales goals. Co-workers were wonderful though very tough competitors. Management was variable with how the department was doing."
good,"Responsible for help managing the Accessories and Shoe department while also building strong teams through positive, proactive communication and coaching. I am also still responsible for personally taking care of customers while exceeding company expectations and standards."
good,"An average day at Nordstrom was like a day with people I know very well. We were taught to treat customers like family and that ""the customers are always right"". For the time that I was there I realized that there was always room for people to advance."
good,"I started off working as a cashier, after a couple of months I moved up to sales in women's shoes. I then was promoted to Assistant Manager in the BP Shoe department. After all that hard work, I was then promoted to Kid's Shoe's Department Manager. Once again I proved to them I was an amazing Manager and was promoted to a bigger department to run in BP Shoes as Department Manager. I then decided to step down out of the Management role and become a sales person again, but in the Lingerie department."
good,"Everyone that you come in contact with has something to teach you. In some places, the store manager is always behind the scenes but at Nordstrom you can always have a conversation with the store manager. Although commission is not for everyone, the better you are at selling, the more you make."
good,"Achieve personal sales goals while supporting the goals of the team."
good,"- Great place to work"
good,"I have been able to grow with the company and have learned many accepts of running a company along with maintaining and growing my own personal business. The hardest part of my job is not being able to have enough time in each day to talk to all my customers. There's a balance that needs to be learned but only through personal growth can this happen. I enjoy every aspect of my job. Meeting, greeting, selling, and cultivating customer relationships. Management is challenging at times but so is every part of sales. As a good manager you can grow and try to have the best team possible. As a great manager you do have the strongest selling team!  That comes from knowing how to hire and developing the best salespeople which in turn will give you the best results. Hire, develop, trust and empower"
good,Did a lot of phone calls and worked along side a great work staff.Coworker always helped out and had my back.
good,"Usually long days, 8+ hours, for 5 days a week sometimes 6. Steady breaks. Helpful staff."
good,To be successful with this company you must be customer service oriented. Everything revolves around the relationships you build. Depending on what your position is typically the hardest part of the job is when you're new and trying to build your clientelle. If you work hard at it and dont give up you will be very successful.
good,If you can handle retail hours this is a great company to work for.
good,"I loved Nordstrom. However, the downfall was 100% Commision. I was in school and needed guaranteed funds. A typical day at work was coming in and calling clients, then planning seminars and sales for the day. I did the Retail management internship with them and it was the best."
good,Helpful and cooperative staff who all give  excellent customer service.
good,Nordstorm is a great comoany but they only want single people to move up and who are able to pack up and move to another store. I'd like to move up but also need to stay in KC with my family. 
good,"very busy, checking out customer and giving great service"
good,Customer service all the way! Sell because it is commission based
good,"customer service, th hardest part of the job was standing on your feet for 8hrs sometimes more"
good,I loved working in Customer Service at Nordstrom. It was a fun and challenging enviroment and all the people there were amazing. I learned so much and feel my experience and what I learned there created a lot of opportunities in other careers I am interested in.
good,"I sold kids shoes. I helped parents and young children pick out shoes, measure their feet and went into the stock room to find them, help try them on, and rung them up at the register. I worked on commission. It was a very demanding retail job, lots of hours but it was fun and I did well with top sales. I answered phones, fulfilled out of store requests for orders. I processed returns. The hardest part of my job was when we didn't have shoes in stock and couldn't find them at other stores; displeasing the customer. The most enjoyable part was assisting the customers and finding everything they needed."
good,As a counter manager we are responsible for a business within a business. It is up to us to build clients and build our business. Each day we are able to give ourselves goals that are acheivabe for the day as well as our weekly and monthly business. Each day I check the business from the previous day and compare it to that of last years numbers. It is important to maximize sales by greeting the clients and ensuring they are being properly serviced while building a successful relationship with them. The people I work with are able to help me do this as well because we all help each other as a team. I am very fortunate to work under reputable and positive management that helps me with my business. We are able to help customers in an enjoyable environment that is both healthy for the client and the employees.
good,"Loved working for Nordstrom..Great Customer interarction,great Management interactions."
good,"I loved going to work, and being around different types of people! I learned how to sell really well and my boss was just ok in my opinion. Hardest part of my job was pleasing really picky customers. Most enjoyable part was just being apart of a atmosphere that felt like family!"
good,A typical day consist of knowing your personal and department goals. Development marketing strategies based on clientele wants and needs by utilizing company tools. The management is based on the open door policy where co-workers can speak to any upper management as they see fit to solve problems. My co-workers and I work as a team to provide excellent customer service. I have managed and mentored a team of 9 sales associates and 1 was promoted to manager. I enjoy the ability to manage my own business by promoting new products and services. There are not hard parts to the job
good,Nordstrom is one of the best companies to work for in the country.However they value the customer more than the employee. I understand its a business however without the employee there will be no one to fulfill their values.
good,Co-workers and store managers were always a pleasure to be around.
good,"You have to make your goal everyday to accomplish your Monthly Goal,"
good,women shoe sales. as a sales associate you can sell in every department. relationship based sales.
good,"Working in retail is going to be hard. You can’t work full time, so your hours are always different which I don’t like very much. You never have a healthy set schedule. But the managers are kind and I’d like to think understanding. The employees are really nice, they try their best to let you know that you can move up."
good,I've worked for the company for a total of 6.5 years.  Good company nice people.  I am not at all comfortable giving this review but the Indeed system will not let me advance without it.
good,"all days I worked at Nordstrom are the same and all of them were typical days for me. I learned a lot working with groups in four to five people in team, I learned that working with people is very exciting and I really enjoyed. the management with very good and I had much freedom to work and side by side with managers. The work at Nordstrom not that hard and I would able to deal with it."
good,some of the sales people look down on you if you're a logistics team member. it's really easy to make friends with other coworkers. often get scheduled 9 hours with a one hour lunch.
good,The pay is great for a commission employees. The hours are flexible for student-workers. There is a possibility for growth within the company. No experience needed.
good,"Since it's a commission environment you can only make money if you hustle. So if you don't plan on working hard this place isn't for you. Management can only help you so much, you need to be highly self motivated."
good,It was good experience where I got to learn more about the company and myself. Opportunity for growth is in the company if you are willing to relocate
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for. As a 21 year old college student with little to no work experience, I was fortunate to begin my career at Nordstrom Café. I learned so much about customer service, as well as the inner workings of a restaurant."
good,"While only a warehouse job, it was one of the best jobs I've ever had. Done by 1pm, friendly coworkers and a sense of camaraderie made it an enjoyable workplace. I left for a high paying sales job elsewhere and  regretted that move."
good,I was able to work on a variety of projects that allowed me to expand my skill set.  I also had a lot of ability to give input on projects and equipment purchases.

good,"Good atmosphere. Fast pace. Friendly Management. High expectations but never sure where you stood on the company. I would have stayed last time, if they didn't count me out at the end of seasonal. I applied to be on the phones but all of sudden I was picking and then packing. I would still be there had they put me in the phones."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Nordstrom. I gained my customer service skills there, learned the importance of follow up, listening to customers and the confidence to add to their shopping basket."
good,"Lovely place to work, the employees are very friendly and the environment is welcoming. Even had its own cafe instead of an open on to the public. Great please to work"
good,"I loved working for Nordstrom as a chef in the Cafe Bistro. It was a fun, classy, and competitive environment. Our leadership team always pushed us to be better and better. We were a strong functioning team that helped each other and pushed one another to be better everyday. The pay wasn't bad at the time for the type of job I had. However when working in Palo Alto California the cost of living caught up with me and I had find a new career in order to pay my bills. It was my first real job out of high school and it taught me a lot of goods lessons on teamwork, pushing myself, and how to be a hard worker."
good,Great place to work with plenty of opportunities just a big workload .Great managers great corporate leadership as well great work environment also great benefits and very respectful management.
good,It was tough the first week or so because your brand new and you have to learn many things. Th people around you however are great at helping you out.
good,You work in your department off commission. It is a good way to learn about sale and the tactics to use in a future sales environment. You also get to connect with customers who come in.
good,"The benefits for this company are pretty great, they start after your first 90 days.  The hours can be stressful sometimes with the early morning inventory shifts but that’s only a problem when scheduled late the day before.  The management is very friendly and very understanding of health complications.  Very diverse staff so it’s easy to get along with some coworkers.  Breaks are great and with a nice break room.  They even have on-call counselors for mental health."

good,I really enjoyed working the Anniversary Sale this summer at Nordstroms. It was a fun and fast paced working environment. Learned a lot from my co workers and managers.
good,there was never a dull moment. such a diverse place to work.i was a friendly environment for the most part. i learned to be patient with people. and  the most enjoyable part of the job was helping people and seeing there satisfaction.

good,Somewhat of a challenge at times as it is a very fast moving job working in womens and salon shoes.  I was however a pacesetter so I was the top 1% in sales within the company. Great place to work with decent benefits.
good,Productive workplace. Sometimes stressful. That was the peak season though so it was already expected. But there’s something about the schedule that is hectic. Like when you work closing today and then work opening tomorrow.
good,"Working at Nordstrom's was a great experience .  You get to interact with the customers and have a great time. Every day was not the same, even though you applied for a cashier position you could end up working in the shoe department, shipping and receiving, fitting room, sales floor, etc.  it just depended upon how many associates were scheduled to work and how many that actually came to work. Working in the different areas of the store was considered a win-win.  I liked the fact of being able to work in so many areas of the store, more experience the better."
good,"Constantly changing environment, room for growth, peer support, high quality products and services. Fantastic benefits and discount policy. Fun to work."

good,"Hard life and work balance. Need a better system. Benefits are great. Match 401k. Maternity and Put leave. Takes 6 months to get benefits. You work hard, you will make money. If you don't work, you don't make any money."
good,"Fast-paced environment, you can make decent money with commission but the return policy makes it difficult to get ahead. Store management listens to employees."
good,I learned and grew from my experience at Nordstrom. Nordstrom will push you out of your comfort zone and has an ever changing environment. I will be forever grateful for my time I spent there.
good,It was fun working in a good and friendly work place and I improve my team working skill over there.Also I improve my coustemer service skill as well.

good,"Nordstrom is the  only retail company I would work for. Great pay and great people. "

good,"Nordstrom is a very competitive company when it comes to benefits, salary, and work-life balance."

Working on the register and answering phone calls helped with my problem solving, in order to resolve any and all problems to the best of my ability."
good,a nice place to work and to be. I liked to be there and be around the people . it was a nice energy and flow to the store. everyone was nice. they were all welcoming
good,"I loved working for Nordstrom! It was a great environment where you had the opportunity to grow and earn as much as you want. The key is you have to put in the work! I learned a lot about managing a high performing team, merchandising, and overall leadership skills that have proven useful to me in my career."
good,"There is room to brach out, as long as you are clear and able to say what you have in mind, career or experience wise. Managers are very open and able to work with your needs."
good,Very motivating and fun environment. Energy varies from department to department same with the competitiveness however it was a fantastic place to get started and allowed me to grow professionally.
good,The best part about this job was that it was always joyful. Because you get to walk while doing work and communicate with others. Their was never a time that this work was bored it was always good. a good feeling.

good,"Wonderful company and a culture between customers and employees. "
good,Inspirational working environment; Team oriented.  Keys to success are a strong mix of art and science; learning reporting and how to dig in and analyze business.
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for that provides around the clock support for their employees and customers. There is Overtime available if needed during the busier seasons of the year and they provide most of the equipment to work from your home office.
good,This was a seasonal position.  I enjoyed working with a great team and meeting fun customers who became my friends!!! Nordstrom is a very flexible place to work and the discount is not too bad!
good,"You must be able to multi-task. Diffuse customer situations and provide resolutions in a timely manner. Acknowledgment of cash room, store deposits and money bag preparation for store registers."
good,"Sales can be intense, but if you're competitive and love working with people and making them happy, Nordstrom allows you to run your business as if it was YOUR own store. If you can grasp this concept of owning your own business, the sky is the limit if you are in sales. Great management team who have worked many years with the company.  As systems and methods change they try to preserve the culture that makes Nordstrom special. I loved helping customers in person and over the phone. How can you not love a job that your number one goal is to make the customer happy???"
good,"This is a very good company to work for if you have any interest in sales. There is a department for everyone, and upward mobility is very possible so long as you're dedicated to the job. You can move to any of their locations as needed or wanted, and have the ability to work in many realms of the sales and fashion industry with this company."
good,there was a regime change at Nordstrom managers were leaving to the full line and with the new managers that were promoted from a regular sales position I feel like there as a power trip and people didn't know how to handle or deal with the great responsibility. which made it uncomfortable for myself and others.
good,"Me working with this company was an awesome experience, I would love to return to Nordstrom Rack. I worked the early, early morning hours, ticketing merchandise place it on the floor."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for, you are allowed the opportunity to grow within the company and supported in your effort by the leadership teams. The culture tends to appreciate the sales floor teams more than the support teams. The support teams have huge jobs, and very limited resources to complete them with."
good,"I would greet customers, assist them with their purchase, inform them about the different brands of handbags.  hardest part of my job was the amount of returns which I had no control over but it affects your income.  I loved talking to new people"
good,"Within my position, I was on the front line as a Customer Service Representative. I dealt with a very fast-growing line of customers and different issues."
good,"Worked with great people and enjoyed the job, it was fast paced but fun. Lots of customer interaction which was nice. I learned a lot about retail and the fashion industry."
good,"Floor people get advanced quickly, housekeeping is consider ""THE HELP"". Training instuctor was excellent. Want you to work the foor with customers after the store is cleaned."
good,Amazing time working for this company so many opportunities to move up in the company many available locations and amazing co workers in the company never a dual day at the store always new product and new faces
good,A pretty good place to work. The work environment is pretty casual. Management is attentive and listens. You'll have more overtime than you'll know what to do with. The dress code is very lax.
good,it job culture is different for me. i just took this job while i go private school as both full time. i learn something there as stocker clothes and shoes.
good,"They are easy to work with.Very nice lead and they are understanding and friendly, easy to approach when you have a questions and needed to find in the warehouse."
good,Competitive commission environment. Not lucrative unless busy location. Benefits are great. Excellent opportunity to promote from within.  Several sister companies to consider for potential transfers
good,"Nordstrom is a retail company that relies heavily on relationship building and commission sales, so pay is not great unless you are a rockstar salesperson. Some people do it for life and make a great living. Just like any retail position it's long hours, nights, weekends, holidays etc., so work-life balance is not great, but that's to be expected in the industry. However, the company has a great culture. Very collaborative, supportive, fun, energetic. Lot's of teamwork and incentives for performance."
good,"Great place to experiment with how to build business. Company usually allows you to try new events/ways of running business. You're allowed to fail but you need to have a backup plan if your plan falls through. "
good,"Great job culture, hardest part is very competitive, althoguth encourages one to work ad strive harder. Learnt customer relationship skills. Enjoyable part is fun working environment"
good,Good employment.  Would love to work there again. Management was very involved and made sure you were comfortable.  As well as the employees at both locations I worked at.  Like i said I would love to be employed there again.
good,"I enjoy working at Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack.  Both workplaces have their strengths."
good,"I loved working for Nordstrom, it's a great company with amazing ethics, fun, and creative place to work. I enjoyed the daily interaction with fellow associates and guests."
good,"I worked the Nordstrom Cafe but we weren't treated any differently from the sales floor. The store manager was great, he knew all of us by name and even took the time out to talk to each of us and help any way he could. Profit sharing was fair, 401k was great and easy to manage. Only con was the constant changing managers of the cafe. Some were the exact opposite of the culture Nordstrom was trying to maintain."
good,"Working in the Cafe kitchen was much the same as any other kitchen. Instead of a dinner rush, you had a lunch rush but otherwise, it was the same. The people were nice and the atmosphere was easy to work in which you can't say about too many restaurants."
good,Great place to work.  Flexible hours and time off available. Great team environment with great management.  Each day employees are provided with a detailed work guide to ensure all duties are being done.  It is a customer first environment while maintaining the completion of all task.
good,"It was a great experience, the staff worked as a team, helpful. I learned a lot from other workers. The managers was very supportive and helpful. I helped set the store up and open it."
good,"I worked in a Rack location. This is a different atmosphere than a full line store, just keep that in mind. Learning about the products and designers was a lot of fun. Great company"
good,"Learned that positive motivation, working together, and keeping open communication is key to a successful team!  Keeping an Open Door Policy is the best way to stay connected with everyone, including upper management."
good,commission as always can be tough at times but is always to be expected. Client background is your best bet to get the most out of the workplace. Overall great company ethics.
good,Great Place to work better than most retails store at work at and great job if you are looking for work while your going to school. The Management can be stressful around inventory.
good,"The environment is great. Customer service is the main focus. Smiles from cheek to cheek are noted throughout every department. The General Manager from the Aventura location would always dress so elegant and work hard. No matter what was needed to be done, she was their to help. Very pleasant atmosphere."
good,Loved Nordstrom but it is time to move to something new. I love Nordstrom’s culture and how they keep evolving with the ways they serve customers. I had one of the best times at this company.
good,"This is such a great company to work for. I have learned so much over the past year of working here. I've met amazing customers and have had great coworkers. I would recommend this job to anyone that loves retail, and overall an amazing company in general."
good,A great place to advance my selling career. I have worked with some of the greatest and hardest working employees and managers.What a great place to meet people and create a profitable selling environment.
good,Good people and a positive culture make nordstrom a great place to work. Advancement is competitive and can be few and far between with zero tolerance for error in upper management.
good,"Felt like a family at work, love the energy! I wasn't a big fan of the district manager ( Mary), but I enjoy all my department managers. They always made my schedule adjustable, never show favoritism and very easy to communicate about anything"
good,"I enjoyed working for Nordstom, however there is zero work / life balance.  Expect closing shifts, late hours are required for inventory and closing procedures."
good,I loved working for Nordstrom. It was my first professional job. They trained me on how to conduct myself in the customer service setting. It’s been a long time since I worked for them but their reference still helps me with new job opportunities.
good,I would recommend if you love face to face interaction with customers this is a great place to work. Friendly environment and everyone works as a team.
good,my typical day includes both employee and guest interaction. ive learned just because yo cant please some one don't get angry.
good,Answering and directing customers to appropriate departments. Assisting Department Managers with Store information. Opening and closing store. Advanced selling culture to increase store volume. Hardest part of the store is leaving because of eliminating our position. Greeting the employees and providing information to employees when they needed it.
good,I honestly I am very thankful that I started with Mac Cosmetics at Nordstrom. Nordstrom is everything that you hear about as far as customer service training and it was the perfect segue to engage my team and lead by example on giving the best service and watching productivity follow.
good,"It is very fast paced, so you got it be quick and good at what you do. Making people feel there best should be what your passionate about the most in order to strive towards tour absolute best."
good,Very friendly place to work everyone is easy going. Management is wonderful there willingness to work with you on things makes it worth working there.
good,"I would love to keep working for Nordstrom because you can work in different departments within the company to fit your skills, but my commute there is too far and there are no openings close to my home where I can transfer to."
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work, although at times the commission could suck but it does make you want to work harder so that you are able to make more."
good,"I'd highly recommend working at Nordstrom to anyone who is fairly interested in fashion. The job its self is nice, one of the only cons about working there to me was the competitiveness. Most departments in the store are commission based so if you aren't an aggressive sales person you might drown in a retail company like this one. On the bright side, for every sale you make you will receive a percentage of that, so your hard work does pay off, and you honestly have the potential to make as much money as you want. Working there is almost equivalent to running your own business because you are highly encouraged to build up your clientele!"
good,Excellent company to work for with benefits and flexible hours. High standards for sales and customer service and requires lots of time to study menu and company policies. Clients are usually the best part of the job.
good,I loved working at Nordstrom. Everyday was a pleasant experience. The company makes sure to serve their employees just as well as they service their customers.
good,It was an easy 8 hour shift. I learned the basics. Management was non existent. The workplace culture was fun. The hardest task was public speaking. The most enjoyable was being independent.
good,"It is one of the best company have ever worked for. The customers challenge me for the better, advance my fashion sense, challenge my experience and push me even more to strive."
good,"I liked seeing the new clothes before It hit the floor. As a night stocker, I was responsible for putting security tags on expensive stuff. We pulled the truck and then we separated the items. We put everything on racks and then we tagged them and scanned them to make sure they were in out inventory. Sometimes items were supposed to be marked down so we had to do that. But overall it wasn't hard. We had a team of three, and if one person didn't show up it was noticed. It was hard work sometimes. And if there was a lot of stuff to do, then we didn't finish. Management was very strict on hours. They didn't want us to have overtime. We worked every other day about. But we blasted our music all night to keep us up. And it was easy peezy"
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to build relationships with customers and receive repeat customers, which in turn helps the company grow and it's associates."
good,"Fun place to work for, Managed a staff of 30, worked with all department heads to improve customer relations. Great people and great hours of operation."
good,"Nordstrom Rack is a fast paced, enjoyable environment to work in.  I currently work in the role of stock team. I unload the delivery truck each day, then process all item for delivery to the sales floor."
good,"A typical day at Nordstroms was very fun. All day we would talk and get to know the people that we worked with. I learned that it is an environment where you need to be a quick learner. New products come in all of the time and you need to educate yourself so that you are able to sell. My manager was amazing, he was very understanding, helpful, and all around a great person to work with. The hardest part of my job was selling so that the product does not come back as a return. The most enjoyable part of my job was hitting a new sales goal."
good,"It can be very busy or very slow at times, and has a high turn over of employees. I worked here for 8 months, and had a wonderful manager who cared about her performance. since employees are on commission, money can be scarce or good depending on the season."
good,"I worked in the cosmetic department"
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to be social and learn from the bottom. It fosters an environment for ""certain"" individuals to do well in. If you are an out-spoken or opinionated individual, this environment may not be for you. I have experienced a great deal of success within this company's walls, however; when it is time to move on, it is time to move on. For anyone starting out in retail, I encourage you to work for this company for at least a year of your time. You will learn vital skills, and if nothing else the time will teach you patience."
good,"Changing shifts, wonderful people, sales expectations. "
good,Great place to workif u like to be on the go a lot . They worked well with me regarding family issues and are very encouraging. As an employee u will really feel appreciated and valued .
good,Great company to work for. Clear path into leadership for those who show interest and potential. Open door policy is great but people who use it are admonished quietly for doing so.
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom Rack consisted of running the women's fitting room for 1 or 2 hours, working the floor, and cashiering for an hour or 2 during the evening. Early morning shifts were unloading the merchandise trucks, staging the floor, and running the fitting rooms until you left. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping others find an item they love."
good,"I loved working at Nordstrom! It was an absolute honor."
good,I have worked for the Nordstrom company for more then 2 years now. I have been blessed with the opportunity to with some of the greatest people I have ever met. Nordstrom prides itself on it's equal opportunity work environment giving everyone an equal shot at advancing their future.
good,"Excellent customer service to both external and internal customers! Growth potential if you are willing to move to HQ.  "
good,"it can be stressful, because your only paid by comission so if you dont sell you wont make any money, so you really have to be tenative and aware of customers around and build relations so they come back and look for you."
good,"Nordstrom has one of the best business practices.  They promote from within, seek talent and promote, reward high sales, train and best of all is family owned."

good,"This company is known for best customer service in industry."
good,"taught me most of what i learned about commission. The Woodlands store was an amazing place to be you made the customers feel special and hard work was so appreciated. it was a wonderful experience. Lots of praise from even the store manger, it made me happy be there."
good,"The work at Nordstrom is the easiest job I've ever had. The managers, however, are young and inexperienced. Many staffing issues at my location. The job is good as a temporary solution, but I see many issues with advancement. The company itself is great with lots of benefits. They also encourage health and volunteering. Overall the benefits are what make the job worth it."
good,"Management is great, it's a fun fast paced environment with a lot of awesome benefits. I get paid commission on everything that I sell. They are very flexible around my upcoming school schedule as well."
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for I've learned so many thing from working there whether its my customer experience or leadership skills that have grown from working there. Nordstrom's has taught me to work hard for whats mine.
good,Nordstrom is a company that allows employees to grow from within. All managers learn how to successfully guide each individual to achieve the most as well as help them become better sales associates.
good,A positive experience with several lessons learned. Through working at Nordstrom I have learned how to efficiently use my time to complete multiple tasks.
good,I enjoyed working in that environment. Provided me with allot of added skills as far as working in a kitchen environment. Was happy to put out appealing and tasteful dishes that were all made from scr
good,Nordstrom is a Great company to work for they gave a great work life balance and they promote within and have very good mentors to help you succeed and grow with the company
good,Overall such an amazing experience for a first job. Hard to manage as a high schooler with what was required. Good company to work for great benefits! :)
good,"Great place to work, lots of pros such as nice people, dress casually, long lunches, respectable positions, flexible working hours,"
good,"My time with company was short, due to the ever changing management teams, and over turn for employees, Within a short period you team could be completely different from one week to another."
good,My experience at Nordstrom has been positive. I have held different roles and was able to master each of them with the support of management and peers. Attention to customer service was the leading driving factor in the success of every department. I am interested in being challenged and growing a career in a like-field.
good,"I first worked at the Nordstrom rack Newbury, which was great just very busy all the time. I got promoted and became an assistant manager within the company and moved to Braintree. The moral was very different and draining due to the fact that the entire system of the store changed. Everyone either seemed unhappy or dissatisfied."
good,"Been working with Laura Mercier for 9 years. Believe in her phylosophy, and who she is. Totally love the line for its products that deliver and the fact that every woman can identify with this line. Is for the everyday woman whether she wants to be natural or glamorous. Love this line and have passion for it."
good,"basically, how to cook, maintain different types of food, how to check tempatures, i didnt have no hard time only trying to cook food that i never cooked before."
good,"The training was consistent but often in short segments, due to the floor managers'  time always being stretched between several issues at one time.  The existing staff assist all new employees with the transition, creating a well-rounded experience.  The hardest part of the job was volume of customers during the Christmas season, but that is to be expected in the retail business."
good,This company was amazing to work for. The staff and team that surrounds you was positive everyday. I would suggest this company to anyone if they are looking for a great sales job.
good,"I enjoy working for Nordstrom - a majority of the people you meet are successful, positive individuals. The company also offers great benefits and tends to promote from within."
good,"From the customer, employee and culture standpoint, Nordstrom leads the way in retail shopping. Consistently changing style and trends. It was my second time with them and I would recommend them to anyone who asks. Great way to network with like minds in a commission sales role,"
good,Great people and management. Care for the working person. Kitchen is small and you must be a team player to enjoy working there. I really like the environment.
good,"I made a TON of money for a summer internship because I sold a lot because it was commission! Also you got paid hourly for times you were not selling. The downside is it is not a corporate internship but it does lead to a job if you want to be an Assistant Department Manager after the program or even after graduation. Great company culture but obviously retail hours are not the most fun thing and make your work/life balance a little difficult. Highly recommend for anyone, its a great learning experience even if you do not want to be in retail."
good,"Was a great place to work, with an amazing energy throughout the environment. I honestly felt the customer service skills in which I learned will be ones that I can use in every position at any company I work for."
good,"im a very hard worker. never miss work.i really need a job as soon as possible. i just moved down to the area, im starting my life over, an im willing to do anything for a job"
good,"Great people to work with, new experiences everyday. Managers help you move up in you occupation if willing. I love and stand behind the products we sell. We have an amazing customer relationship that they prepare you for as you are hired."
good,"You have to have drive and determination because this job is commission based. So, if you don't work then you don't eat. The people are fun and everyone is like family."
good,"Nordstrom is a grate company who I'm proud to work for. Nordstrom had taught me good work ethic, respect for all types of people, how to engage with just about anyone in conversation. I am very independent, self starter and I owe most of my discipline to Nordstrom being that when you work hard you are compensated accordingly."
good,"Collections - Facilitated Collection Calls in a very fast paced collection department.  I responded to customer service inquiries and resolved collection issues.  We also worked directly with the stores to extend lines of credit, and worked with the fraud department on lost or stolen cards."
good,Retail definitely has its downsides but Nordstrom is such a great place to work. Every high level employee would love to help you and HR is great.
good,"the staff is like a family. great hours and pay, great benefits. uses good communication and very lenient with you. respects the employers and customrs to the ut most. great customer service!"
good,"Nordstrom rack Emeryville was a very fun place to work. I would've loved to stay there for a very long time , unfortunately some of the relationships between employs caused the work place to become unsafe leading to my resignation."
good,Great events with skin care product....with skin care advisor...happy clients...great working environment ...great managment
good,I really enjoyed my time working for Nordstrom.  I would have stayed if i could afford the slow months.  It is a great fast paced environment and the staff there are so much fun to work with.
good,"Great company to work for if your starting your career. If your able to relocate you will be able to grow fast in the company, only downside is that they don't always pay for relocation."
good,I like Nordstrom because they worked with my school schedule to where my work did not conflict with my schooling and at the same time I still made enough money every too weeks to where I couldn't complain. Only think I do have to criticize is the store manager who was kind of a jerk and brushed off any concerns or complaints you may have.
good,"Flow of customer traffic can vary, being most busiest on weekends. I've learned a lot about patience, understanding, and always giving great customer service. I've met a lot of great coworkers who have taught me a lot. Overall I wouldn't say it is very difficult to work at Nordstroms and the people and service there make it most enjoyable to work for the company."
good,Very interesting to meet and service customers daily. Being able to speak to fashion trends and help clients with their selections. It is fun to connect with new clients and build new relationships through follow ups and special events.
good,"•	Ensured Nordstrom’s preferred customers’ expectations were met in an efficient and professional manner at the point of sale;"
good,"Nordstrom is a fantastic company to work for and has served as an excellent platform for my career growth throughout college. However, retail is a tough environment and working nights and weekends for not a crazy amount of money can be tiresome."
good,Nordstrom was a fun and energetic work place. I love the face to face interactions with costumers. The co-workers were good to work with and so were my supervisors. Love the company and would work for them anytime.
good,"This place has non-stop business, which creates the fast pace atmosphere. The company holds a high standard to serving the customers. The co-workers are great and the management is too."

Custmers got the newest trends and cosmetics products,insider tips and tricks,skincare and fragrance consultations,free samples and exclusive gifts with purchase."
good,"It is a very fun and fast paced place to work, they just give an overload of a schedule. You either get thirty eight hours or twenty two."
good,"Nordstrom was a great company to work for through my college years. This company taught me responsibility and how to drive my own business with a strong customer base. Nordstrom sales employees work on solely commission so the atmosphere is very competitive; however, this has helped me develop excellent team work skills under high stress situations. The fact that the pay is not consistent and there are numerous slow times through out the year is the most stressful part of the job. However, working for Nordstrom as help me build my team work skills and communication skills because I am consistently conversing with others and it is important to make strong connections."
good,"On a typical day I clock in, grab a walkie and mobile check the daily to see when my breaks are and head out to the floor. I check in with my managers to see how it has been and what needs to be done. At the rack I have learned how to be more of a team player, it teaches you how to interact with your co-workers and drop what your are doing to assist others. I would say the hardest part of the job is maintaining cleanliness on busy days. The most enjoyable part of the job would definitely be my co-workers and customers they make it worth my while being there."
good,"helped me a lot with everything, work life and personal life. They were always understanding of everything and helped me a lot to accomplish what I wanted to accomplish. Extremely professional and helpful people on the team."
good,"For Retail this is one the greatest places to work Top Notch Company. Such a classy place to work. Great benefits competitive pay incredible employee discounts.I learned so much working there. It went from just a job to a career. I met so many great people, made a lot of friends there and I even met my wife there. I would not be the person I am today without Nordstrom. Awesome place to work."

good,"easy to love what you do when going to Nordstrom. managers were always great, training always. room to grow. lots of pressure to open credit cards, but flexible with scheduling is nice,"
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work for. They try to accommodate you if they can and the pay is more than minimum wage. You learn to work as a team in your department and in other departments as well. They give a good discount and and they always want you to be motivated to be promoted. Overall it is a fun environment to be in.
good,Packing and boxing makeup products for Nordstrom. I enjoyed working here because the work was really easy. the hardest part was trying to keep up and not be behind. Co-workers were really nice and helpful.

good,"The job was great, i loved the people. I met different people everyday and i enjoyed the employees also. i honestly did not have a bad day there because everyday was a great experience and amazing energy."
good,"I learned that you can have fun, as you work. "
good,"Nordstrom has exceptional managers and overall employee training and processes for a retail company. I cannot say that there are many days that I came home in a worse mood than when I left. Being retail, job security is not great and unless you make an effort to network advancing to corporate office is not easy and can take a bit longer than you are willing to endure. "
good,"I loved working for Nordstroms. It was fast-paced, but everyone is willing to help each other. I learned how to best service the customer and provide a fun shopping experience."
good,"The commission compensation fosters a competitive work environment, encouraging you to continue to foster positive relationships with both coworkers and customers."
good,I really enjoy working here. not only do I build relationships with the people in my department and all the employees but also with my customers. a lot of customers I have worked with become close acquaintances. they always come say hi to me and a lot only want to shop with me.

good,"Fast paced, and organized store to work. I enjoy working for the company, and for the management team. Great perks for employees, and amazing customers."
good,The time I spent with Nordstrom provided me with an understanding of identifying and exceeding customers needs. It also taught me to excel in a competitive environment.
good,"worked as a shoe sales associate assisted customer in finding the perfect shoes for their lifestyle, party, wedding, birthday, etc. Learned a lot about different people and their styles of dress. Managment was very helpful and where great leaders. co workers where helpful and friendly. Hardest part was the change of season and adjusting to people change in style. Most enjoyable was meeting new people."
good,High expectations but can be very rewarding. there is a high turnover rate because they hire a lot of college students which causes room to move up in the company.
good,"Nordstrom's culture of service is legendary."
good,"Great company to work for, supportive staff and management, allows  for flexibility and provides advancement within the company or movement to other departments"
good,My co-workers definitely made it worth working there. Down to earth in a well payed environment so who's to complain? I only worked there seasonally so the hardest part is to push above and beyond in order to keep it after the winter.
good,I learned how to assess women's shoes according to the size of their feet. I enjoyed making people happy and knew how to sell them multiple pairs of shoes and accessories because it was fun.
good,If you are looking for a great place to work Nordstrom is it! The only bad thing I can really say is that many of the managers were great salespeople but poor at dealing with employees.
good,"The typical day at work is serving specialty coffee to customers, and giving great customer service. On a daily basis I worked with making sure that there was enough product to make beverages. The best part of the job is watching the customers coming and the employees enjoying their jobs. The employees have a great time while they are serving the customers. "
good,Loved working with this company! Even though it was only a seasonal opportunity I had the chance to learn all aspects of a retail sales environment and put my best foot forward.
good,"Great work environment, where customer service is a priority. The company gives you the opportunity to grow and sell in different areas of the store."

good,"Managing two departments Men's Sportswear and Rail"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of ringing customers up and also returning items they didn't need/want. I learned the different systems that Nordstrom uses it changes at least once a week (it feels like) The management there is very understanding. They are very honest, and willing to help out. My co-workers are very down to earth always willing to help if someone doesn't understand something. The hardest part about my job is getting yelled out by angry customers. Ive cussed out too many times to count. The most enjoyable part about my job is making the customers laugh and enjoy their experience."
good,"Work at Nordstrom is a place where there's no telling what tomorrow will hold when your dealing with people. I learned ways to be progressive in company sales, relationships, and logistics of a large industry."
good,"inventory prep"
good,"A typical day at work for me  is to come and and greet all the co-workers and start looking for things to do like checking for things that we may be missing in the line station, after the line is full and neet i will star helping my co-workers on new task that they may have and of course ill will help our customer and at the end of the day ill help everybody clean all the stations and make sure were all ready for the next morning."
good,Great place to work. Very little benefits. Keeps your hours under 35 in order not to pay benefits
good,"Nordstrom's is a fantastic company to work. Management is fantastic,   you have the ability to express yourself in anyway, and they truly care about their employees. The only way one will thrive at Nordstrom's is by securing interpersonal relationships with cliental."
good,"I get to interact with all the Nordstrom employees and make connections with each one. I also get to make connections with mall shoppers and employees that work around the mall.  I have been promoted within my position to a ""Lead Barista"", which essentially is the step below an assistant manager.  I train new employees, make managerial decisions, take inventory of the espresso bar and order new products.  "
good,"you have the opportunity to grow and move up. this is a CAREER company, not just a retail job."

Strong orangizational skills in merchandising and dressing manikins. Completed inventory in a fast-paced environment in a timely matter."
good,Really like my stay in this company. Encourage productivity and provide employee opportunity to fun at work.
good,"Typical days of a person in stock: we open up product, organize it, and pull displays. We also are in charge of making sure the products display the correct prices and bar codes. And depending on the price point of the item, we make sure it has the correct sensor. My co-workers are diverse, meaning we can work as team and we can work individually. The hardest part of my job is only when our shipments are large, so its a challenge to open everything quickly and on time. The most enjoyable part is when we get recognized for all of our hardwork and get rewarded with breakfast or outing funded by or manager and store manager."
good,"I left because I found my work life balance was getting out of balance. But I would say overall this is such an awesome company to work for. Great benefits. The company culture is strong, but fun. Everyone is family, and if you like that, then you will love this company."
good,fun place to work.  Fast paced.  enjoyable coworkers. Always work and they take the time to train you thoroughly
good,retail sales associate for baby and kids department. Loved working with the different customers day in and out!! 
good,"A typical day at work is helping the customers that walk in the door or customers I had previously made appointments with. All commissioned based pay which gets frustrating, a couple bad days can ruin a whole two week pay period. Mostly promote from with in which is nice, and management can be helpful. Business has declined with the economy and the fact that corporate is pushing online sales more the in store sales. "
good,Although I did not enjoy retail I enjoyed working for Nordstrom. The managers care about you and your family as well as your work performance/experience. 
good,"A typical day a work will be walk and analyze each department, find what needs to be changed or remerchandised for the day.  This includes if new merchandise arrived, and it needs to be placed.  Change mannequinns to new product.  Check all cosmetic bays see if any promotions are running and need to be changed.  Talk to managers of the departments, see if they have any direction from corporate on any changes.  The hardest part of my job is leaving on time I like to make sure all is finished before I leave for the day.  The most enjoyable part is seeing new trends and fashion."
good,"Nordstrom is very big on customer service. It's fun building personal relationships with customers. It's cool to see a personal customer come in and request to shop especially with me! Pay can really fluctuate, but it's up to you as a salesperson to make your check. A very friendly environment, and though the shoe department can be overwhelming it's not a bad place to work."

good,"A typical day at work includes but not limited to, pulling reports, ordering merchandise, checking employee timesheets, meeting selling cost by managing hours, re merchandising the sales floor. On a daily basis I coach and train employees to exceed expectations and hopefully promoting them onto their next position with the company. Opening up fashion rewards to our customers and offering assiatnce along with suggestive selling. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing repeat customers and helping customers find what they came in the store looking for as well as seeing my employees doing well and recieving recognition."
good,"I enjoyed my time working with Nordstrom. I learned new techniques when working with difficult customers, and even new ways of signing the guests up to the rewards program. The environment overall was a family one. Very comforting and welcoming. The coworkers would help if anyone ever needed assistance with anything. Most of the management team made sure that their employees felt comfortable enough to speak to them about anything. The hardest part of the job would have to be answering and transferring calls, while checking out a customer or signing up a rewards account."
good,Its a job for the long run .most of the worker who work at that branch have worked there for years. The staff is welcoming to everyone. They get you started on 401k and other benifits. they take the time to explain and train you company policies.
good,Nordstrom is a great company who treats their employees well and really does care about your well being.
good,Meet all types of people
good,Helping customers is a joy along with the great structure of Nordstroms values and history-
good,Goal great customer service. Fast paced enviorment. Competitive advantages
good,"When I started a morning day shift in the men's sportswear department it started with doing new stock or replenishing it. I enjoyed straightening and sizing because I know when I am a customer someplace else, I expect things to be in order or I hope they are anyway. I learned working with a diverse crowd, customers and colleagues they we are all basically the same and we all put our pants on the same way,this maybe silly to some."
good,Great company to work for and to buy from. The return policy is amazing.
good,Always aiming to please the clients on a daily basis. Having knowledge of all products and the confidence to sell what was best for them. I learned a great deal about people and how different we all are and how the individual client is special. Management was stern but fair and were all influential leaders. The hardest part of the job was not having the particular item a client needed and having to make them wait for products to be shipped. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a widely diverse client based following.
good,Hours are inconsistent and commission based salary is difficult.
good,The most enjoyable part of the my job was to see the employees I hired succeed and get promoted.
good,"Offers amazing customer service, Busy day to day tasks including: coaching, inventory levels, working side by side with employees, thinking outside the box, etc."

good,"I loved working at Nordstrom because of their benefits and company culture. Work/life balance is hard because it is a retailer, but it was a great place to be."
good,"If your into high end retail, Nordstrom is the place to work. They offer fabulous management training courses, great benefits, a happy work environment, and an overall sense of fulfillment w/in an organization. Although it is retail, the work vs. life balance was pretty evenly matched and the job security is in place. This is a company that stands behind their employees and offers only the best customer service to its customers. Knowing that you had the power (w/in reason of course) to make decisions that had the customers needs before the companies, made it very easy to build and maintain relationships!!"
good,"NORDSTROM take good care for their employee. They give their employee a flu shot free.After 45 days work with the company, they will pay more for their employ."
good,Lots of fun people to work with. Hard to juggle this job and school because they have part-time being 30-35 hours per week which is why I had to quit.
good,"Walking in to work was always fun, you know automatically what your daily task are once you see what department you are scheduled in. In case a special project was needed then manager would let you know."
good,"Typical day includes a little pep rally before store opens to go over store and individual goals, assisting customers with needs, along with greeting and keeping visuals and merchandise organized."
good,"Some manager don’t have a lots of skills but there’s a few are very nice. Good pay, benefits, secured job and room for promotion and relocation. The only cons would be uniform in racks , no need at all"
good,Good pay and benefits good working conditions plenty of advancement opportunities and able to change schedules and departments if wanted to easy to take a day off
good,"Busy and fun place, great people, lots to do, sometimes strenuous with working the truck in receiving. Expect to promote credit card or any promotions."
good,I worked with Nordstrom for 3 years and my main reason for leaving was to move back to my home. One of the best managers and mentors I ever had was the manager I had here.
good,"The experience was great. The floor is very competitive when it comes to customers and commission, other than that the people are great. The often reward employees for a job well done and reaching sales quotas."
good,"Had a great experience working at Nordstrom. Made life time friendships there. My manager was amazing. I would love to work there again. I worked in cosmetics which is totally different from the other sales positions, but working in cosmetics was so much fun."
good,"It was a fun, challenging-at-times, dynamic, inspiring, pleasant place to work and serve both the community of Escondido as well as my fellow Nordstrom family community."
good,I've worked at Nordstrom for more than 2 years and is a very good place to grow. They teach you to identify your resources so you can be proactive. Customers are number one priority.
good,"I loved working for Nordstrom, I enjoyed being in sales my manager was the best! The only downfall was the return policy, you work your butt off only to have some clientele decide to return after wearing the outfit wether it be to a special event or just got tired of it after a week or so and decide something is wrong, like it did not fit correctly etc... I’ve heard all the excuses and with that being said, the sales person works very hard at listening and making sure that’s what the customer wanted only then to have them return it and then you lose that sale and it really effects your paycheck"
good,"Great place to work. Very fast paced back to back calls but over all great company, great benefits and awesome training all from the comfort of your home. One of the best jobs I've had."
good,I love working at Nordstrom. I would say the only downside to the job is the work life balance. you will work without weekends off and typically get split days off.
good,Very energetic workplace. A lot of mature people shop there. Management is pretty friendly. They had a nice cafeteria for employees. They had little advancement opportunity in my opinion.
good,"I liked working at Nordstrom, got to meet new people daily, the brakes were fair and my manger is a great person, very understanding and motivational."
good,"The Nordstrom Cedar Rapids( SW)  facility is a good place to work. I’m presently a seasonal employee and would want to be a permanent employee. The managers and Trainers are always wanting to help you and making sure you are good at all times. It’s a wonderful place to work, not only because of it good pay but pleasant employees and good friends you will make if you the type wanting one."
good,"Working at Nordstrom was a wonderful experience that provided myself with new opportunities and growth.  The working environment allows employees to find like-minded individuals as well as being challenged to grow and reach new goals.  This is a company that truly believes in loyalty and costumer focused service, and rewards their employees through recognition and job advancement."
good,"Nordstrom inc was a company of great integrity, Plenty of room to grow with the company, and management was very hands on with their employees. would highly recommend this company."
good,"Nordstrom Rack is great place to work! Awesome pay, great benefits, long hours of the the day typical 40 hours a week, hour breaks, semi-monthly pay. Always steady during Monday-Friday and Saturdays and Sundays are usually pretty busy. Very fast-paced atmosphere and good friendly employees. The hardest part of the job is keeping shoes organized and heel-toe to heal-toe with out scratching or scuffing. The enjoyable part of the job is assisting customers and sharing the love of fashion, latest deals, upcoming sales events, offering credit cards to customers all around the stores and making the company's daily goals. Work place culture very strong and always busy and clean. Lots of straightening at the end of the shift... Lots of rewards not only for the customers but for employees when opening up credit cards for new customers!!! REWARDS REWARDS REWARDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"The culture is awesome. The management and coworkers are lovely to work with. It is very hard to move up as no one in higher positions is looking to leave their positions. If you're willing to move around the country, it's a little easier to move up in the company. Still, I would highly recommend working here."
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work, with a comfortable environment and good benefits. The people are a pleasure to work with and I enjoyed my time there."
good,I learned all of my customer service and sales skills from this job! I loved the job and the work culture! I miss it so much and i'm still very sad our store closed.
good,"Great atmosphere. Managers were caring and exhibited great leadership skills. A bit hard to move up in the company, but it's possible. I enjoyed the customers and my employees."
good,I was hired during their somewhat busy season. I enjoyed the work I did there as I was hired in the Picking Department. I was trained adequately. I was also paid what I was worth and had plenty of overtime pay.
good,Support back of the house became family at the end of my career here. We helped each other and we continue to keep in touch. I am glad I was able to meet such great people. Always do what you can to ensure our customers have the best shopping experience. Especially cleaning. I take pride in my work. I hope my guests felt that.
good,"Nordstrom preaches ownership of your business and religiously emphasizes RETURN policy.  Unfortunately,  it hurts your sales quotas by overzealous customers. I love the culture but it can be overwhelming the fraudulent returns."
good,"I loved working here because of the fun, upbeat and diverse environment. Everybody was very friendly and welcoming when i first started. I would recommend this company as a first job"
good,"Great for new comers to join team, have to be ready and open to learn new things, staging as well as working the truck and merchandising the sales floor with new items in for the day. What I learned from working at Nordstrom's Rack is the communication with the never ending ideas about trend, so we can make a sale and achieve our comp goals for the hour, day, week, month and year."
good,"Excellent work environment and great customers.  Company has great benefits and has an extremely positive work environment. In addition, management is very responsive to all employee concerns."
good,Great place they really value their employees and family and you could select your house to work and if you missed work could make up the days so your check is not short
good,Nordstrom was a fantastic company to work with. During this time I was able to move up in the company by working hard and showing up on time for work.
good,i eventually went part time and i love it. its faced paced but can be overwhelming if you dont know where to go. i clock in and imediatly started sorting clothes to be placed for sale on the sales floor. interact w customers always friendly. quick check out services. very team oriented which turns  into sales.
good,It’s like a constant hustle nonstop during your shift. It’s almost like once you see a customer you have to be the first one running over to them so you can get that sale an make them your client in order to meet your HIGH sales goal each month.
good,"The Retail Management Internship was a wonderful learning opportunity. While very heavily focussed on sales, I was provided one-on-one mentorship from an experienced Department Manager who gave me an inside look at what it takes to run a high volume department. The workplace culture was high energy and - for the most part - very welcoming! The hardest part of the job is being on your feet for long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the amazing connections made - whether with coworkers or customers."
good,Typical day was watching the general flow of public through the store and help make sure the Nordstrom experience was a safe and fun place for both the shoppers and Employees
good,I enjoy my 15 years at Nordstrom. They promote within so you have a lot of opportunities to grow. They give you all the tools to succeed. You just have tu put the work. The pay is good and the benefits too.

good,Nordstrom provided a welcoming environment and encouraged communication and support between employees. Both customers and other employees were always friendly and I was excited to attend work each day.
good,Enjoyed working here so much. Very pleasant staff fun and helpful. Professional as well. The management was very detail oriented and helpful also. Very clean and committed to guest service.
good,I wold work there again miss all the people there. The discount was nice as well. But you have to be willing to move if you ever want a decent promotion
good,Nordstrom was a great place to work. Management was always encouraging of growth both as an employee and as a person. Benefits were ample and crunch time was present but limited to a manageable amount. I would recommend them as a company to work for.
good,Nordstrom is a fantastic company to work for. I worked several different seasonal positions while working my full time job. I was able to make really good side money during the holidays and throughout a slower summer.
good,Wonderful diverse and relaxed company to work for that take pride in putting their employee at the forefront of the business. One of the best companies I have ever worked for.
good,"Nordstrom has a great return policy, and takes care of its' customers. I really appreciate that as a consumer myself. I loved working in the active wear section!"
good,Managers are always willing to work with you and your schedule. The pay there is pretty good and you get paid time off after a certain amount of hours you’ve worked.
good,I really enjoyed working at Nordstrom. Wonderful co workers. I was sad to leave but hey! The pay was excellent helped get my life back steady.And my discount was Great as well lol!
good,"While retail can generally be stressful, working at Nordstrom does not feel stressful. Management is generally nice. Nice discounts. Fun people. Hours vary based manager."
good,"Loved working for the company, large time commitment required. Full time expected, long hours and difficulty getting time off, great management and HR."
good,"Great place to work, co workers are great, friendly, they're like family. Cafeteria food is tasty and prices are reasonable. Pay is fantasitc but long hours."
good,"I believe that working at Nordstrom provided a friendly working environment.  You get what you put into, therefore if you if you put in the effort into connecting with customers and understanding your deparment's product, you will reap the benefits."
good,"Very nice place to work, good benefits, but it can be stressful too. Get competive place to work. Hours can sometime be long. Most managers are good , a few bad ones but overall a good place to work."
good,"Fun environment, your time is what you make it. "
good,"I would definitely work there again even as a part time manager or sales associate the company culture is organized, trendy and fun loving environment."
good,"Working for the Bistro At Nordstrom was a great experience.  Best part was learning from the Exec, Emmanuel Pose.  Great open kitchen environment, lots of customer interaction, etc."
good,"Overall, I love working for Nordstrom. Although, it does get stressful with constant pressure from upper management and extremely high sales goals I feel great at work. I really appreciate the freedom at work and the ability to run my own little business inside of the store. Benefits like PTO are also great!"
good,It was a good place to work with  good team and mission. The mission drove the company. The hardest part of the job was the under staffing and it made it hard to stay on top of everything.
good,"The staff is wonderful and the perks are great, especially for a seasonal salesperson. The customers are usually very nice as well. It's hard to leave!"
good,This is a perfect job for those who enjoy fast-paced work enviornments. Steady hours and scheduling available. Company provides opportunities for professional growth.
good,Great place to work. Fun and exciting. The employees were great to work with and the management is great at communication most of the time. Over all i recommend working there.
good,"I only worked in the cafe so I am unaware of the other departments.  I made good money serving and their is opportunity for advancement as they have stores across the country and various positions."
good,Helping customers. Merchandising floor. Keeping up with monthly sales goals. Providing customer service. Answering phone calls. Cleaning department. Fulfilling orders.
good,"I loved the job because I consistently a top 3 seller in my department. Associates that didn't want to work for sales hated the job because they didn't make money as it is mostly commission. Management was fine, I worked at two locations and one had far better management than the other. I'd say the Department Manager really sets the tone for the entire department. Its a great job if you're competitive, outspoken and confrontational, and if you aren't a ""sore loser"" as in you don't take it personal when someone steals a customer from you."
good,"management of different depts. through the years with reviews on "
good,Just have to remember this is a place to work and to not get caught up and any work drama.  Nordstrom as far as a company pay there employees very good compare to regular retail stores. Cants really complain about the work you do at the company.
good,"managers did not communicate well with each other, employees we're very confused about who to talk to and questions usually do not get answered. Chill"
good,This job was great for connecting with customers on a more personal level. All walks of life in here. Many opportunities to grow within. Great discounts as well for their employees.
good,Great job if you love talking and working with people! Management gives you the tools to succeed and it's nice having control over your own paycheck!!
good,"Not a wide range for advancement  and flexibility with part time jobs, doesn’t have enough hours, gratuity setup is bad for servers, also lack of long term kitchen consistency and no advertisement for the restaurant which makes reliant repeat customers as shoppers for regulars, limited line of alcohol and no specials or happy hour. No promotion of food in anyway besides occasional food and wine festivals and social media pics uploaded from customer perspectives."
good,Working for this company was a good workplace cultue. Where you have people from all over working together getting a long to completed  a good work day.
good,Great environment to work and sell in. Nordstrom would have been a great career to follow however foot traffic is dying across the nation. This lack of customers in everyday stores has made me find a job elsewhere.
good,"The company had its challenges, but it has equipped me with the skills and knowledge required to be successful within any field. I say this because it has taught me the value of hard work and time management. In addition, what it means to work as a team in a fast paced environment."
good,"By far the best company I've ever worked for and so inclusive. Not only did we have great benefits, but a strong sense of comradery and friendly competition. Knowing that I had career growth opportunities and the chance to really be in control of how successful I was has given me so much drive and passion."
good,"Typical workday consists of checking for merchandise, open and put away. Work on schedule, respond to emails. Always go above and beyond for customer."
good,"Nordstrom is a really great place to work and meet new people and build new friendships and relationships. I wish I would have stay, if I had a do-over, I never would have left; I would have just been honest  with my manager (Chef) and HR about what was really bothering me. I really did love it there."
good,Ok place to work at as long as your self motivated and love money. I learned a lot about fashion. And indeed is really annoying me to write this review.
good,Great work environment! Excellent for working moms. Flexible work days and ability to work remotely if necessary. Technology & trend focused company. Always changing!
good,hardest part of the job is deciding what your schedule is . the hours and times they give you are always good. the best part in how culture and ethnic friendly the job and people are
good,One of the best retailers to work for. Great work environment. Diverse and friendly people. Excellent commission based compensation. Great selection of merchandise.
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I would work for them again, given the opportunity. The hours can sometimes interfere with personal life through, which is why I had to leave the company to attend school."
good,Overall great company to work for as long as you are a positive person with goals and dreams. The company provided great benefits and great 401k. Management tried to motivate staff.
good,Fun working environment while I was in high school and flexible schedule. Always making sure customers are happy. Management is not the next but who knows I haven’t been there in over a year
good,Management was not so great but was different depending on department. Overall good growing experience and helped improve my customer service as well as social skills.
good,"a typical day consisted of  list of tasks and a 30 minute break all to be completed within your scheduled time. "
good,Excellent company with good benefits. It was a great company to work with. I loved my managers most of the time and when you work hard you can achieve great rewards. The only downsides are when you are not supported by your managers from the policies that are supposed to be enforced by the Nordstrom Mission.
good,Nordstrom made the top 100 in Fortune's list of Best Companies to Work for in 2017. This is a family company from its management to its frontline. You will feel at home being part of the Nordstrom family. Great Company to work for.
good,Nordstrom has a long history of quality customer service. I was surrounded by wonderful people who truly care about their customers. Nordstrom empowers every employee act in the best interest of the customer.
good,Good company overall. Lots of work politics. Make sure you boss loves you. To go anywhere in the company you have to be very politically involved doesn’t actually matter what you are doing
good,Learned more inventory skills. Stock Clerk  skills  I learned how to be able to work with different people at different paces and help cowor6if it's needed
good,Nordstrom is a culture and it's based around excellent ch awwt ok mor service. With the commission structure you really have the potential to earn a lot.
good,"I loved this job, day in day out i felt I was apart of a bigger purpose. Leaving everyday feeling accomplished. "
good,"A great place to work with really awesome managers who genuinely feel like friends. Most of the time the work is really fast paced with finding items to be shipped out but often there will be nothing to do, resulting in hours of waiting for something that needs to be found. When it gets busy though it becomes more fun than anything, becoming a sort of advanced hide and seek for clothes. Overall a great place to work with decent pay and friendly coworkers."
good,"I worked here in college and it was great! I made really good money (commission) and made great connections. In interviews now, I still get asked about my experience at Nordstrom. It stands out!"
good,This is an amazing company to work for.  Long hours and a not great work life balance but you are rewarded for hard work and dedication.  Truly give you the opportunity to grow and cultivate your team and your business.  Base salary ranges but you make commission on top of your salary.
good,"If I have to write anything here to submit the rest of my evaluation, all you're going to get is a random sentence explaining why this is a waste of my time. I am done now."
good,Great environment for a retail career. Fair practices and a respectful selling culture. The Nordstrom company treats their employees with respect and give an opportunity to grow within the organization.
good,"Lots of room to grow. Enjoyed holiday season the most, when it came to making sales. Loved the team that I worked with. As long as you make your sales goal, you'll be fine, which is typically like any sales job."
good,"Fast pace accessory and handbags department, I started my day and ended my day busy but fulfilling., never a dull moment at the Point of Service station and happily seeing what our customers purchased."
good,A typical day at work consisted of continuing to build relationships with new and returning clients. I learned to become more flexible and diverse when dealing with certain clients.
good,"everyone was nice to me, there is a lot of memorizing at first! all of the staff were very friendly and the process to being hired at Nordstrom was fun was well."
good,Nordstroms is family-oriented. Everyone knows everyone. Its high spirits during the holidays is what I loved most with the tree decorating. The merchandise is a bigger selection than other department stores.
good,"I enjoyed working for nordstrom, it was one of my most stable times in my life. I enjoyed not only my team, but I enjoyed the customers, & creating a expiernce for everyone!"
good,"Fashion retail, primarily women fashion.  Basic salary with a small commission kicker.  Retail hours in a large store.  Good job security and benefits."
good,"Overall this place was a fun, fast paced environment. The company itself is family driven and working at Nordstrom made me feel like I was a part of a family. I loved working here and being able to help customers and being their personal shopper. It is a fast paced environment and everyone works on commission."
good,"All the staff was helpful and friendly. They helped to teach good working skills and customer relations. You work on a commission based salary, so how much you make depends on you."
good,Overall Nordstrom technology is a great place to work.  There is an infusion of new talent as they've remade the leadership structure and transitioned into a more closely aligned Dev Ops model.
good,Nordstrom was great to me in my early days when I was out of college.  It is a wonderful place to meet people and influential contacts in the retail fashion industry.
good,"This was a seasonal position and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Fast paced, lots of pre-sales, lots of phone calls and delivering merchandise to customers homes, being transferred to other counters to help out when employees didn't show up for work-team selling,"
good,working here was great everyone was helpful and always had positive attitude.
good,"I worked in sales at Nordstrom for both the BP and T.B.D. women’s clothing departments. I learned a lot about the product and helped merchandise the floors to increase sales and maintain new trends. This was a really fun, but competitive job. If you want to make decent paychecks you have to be consistent and willing to provide knowledge and suggest product. It’s more than just a “hello” and getting someone a fitting room."
good,"By being in sales, was very enjoyable. It was a fast paced environment with great management.  a typical day at work would go by very quickly, and the training process was amazing. They would give you time to learn the systems."
good,"I learned a lot from this job and it gave me the skills and knowledge to start my own business. "
good,This was my first job where it was commission based only.  You have to work hard so you can get a bomb pay check! Everyone that i have worked with is very friendly. Make sure you work at a Nordstrom where it is busy so you can get customers and make your day easily. Overall i enjoy working here!
good,"At 6am, sometimes 5am, I would clock in and begin unpacking and stocking all the newly arrived merchandise for every department in the store. No matter how much merchandise we received that day, it would all have to be unpacked, quality checked and ready for sale before the doors open at 10am, It was a fast-paced work environment where I learned how to work under pressure, manage time wisely and re-organize back rooms that made it easier for sales representatives to find what they were looking. The hardest part of the job was some of the heavy lifting while going up the stairs in the stockrooms but the most enjoyable part was helping other department managers' with stock assistance that they were incapable of accomplishing themselves."
good,I learned a lot about sales. It was a great friendly environment to work in. Great management team. I had great hours. The commission and hourly rate was great to work in
good,Nordstrom really is a great place to work. There are so many opportunities available and many different career paths. 
good,"The management is basically decided by who is prettiest and can present themselves as the best ""Nordy Girl."" The sales teams in many departments have been together for decades (literally) and are incredibly hostile to new team members; furthermore they act insanely petulant in regards to ""Floor awareness"" and fighting over customers."
good,"Overall, I'm very grateful for my time at Nordstrom. Like any business, there are employees and management that make you scratch your head. But unlike other companies, you are encouraged to make your own decisions and use your best judgement."
good,Loved working commission you were literally able to build your own paycheck which was awesome! Company really cares about their employees always ways to grow with the company!
good,Walk in work area and be greeted by Supervisor and the group of Employees I worked with. I learn the different ways of the Customer Service Rep. position. What the job took. It was relaxing there.
good,i didnt want to write this review and the website is making me. im very frustrsted with indeed but the work at the rack was fun and i would do it again
good,"I worked for Nordstrom for years and grew up in the company."
good,Every day was a new adventure. Computer knowledge is require in order to complete work demand. Employed`s should have the ability to use good judgement every day.
good,"Loved working for Nordstrom. Some of the managers were a bit special and definitely had their favorites, but aside from them the company itself is a great environment and they do their best to help you succeed in where you want to go."
good,"Fantastic work area"
good,"It is a great place to work. Work atmosphere differs by location because it depends on the management. They do promote from within, but you must be mobile."
good,A very exciting business environment that provides a seamless experience to customers. Direct contact with managers and buyers. Nordstrom is a very special place to work for.
good,"One most rewarding parts about working at Norstrom, was enjoying the diversity in staff, and clients alike. In addition, I really enjoyed the, if you will, upscale, environment. All in all, Nordstrom was an awesome place to work at."
good,"Nordstrom is an amazing place to work and treats its employees well. It does expect a high number of hours for salaried employees, and after awhile the retail hours necessary for this type of business is hard to maintain"
good,"You must work hard to service the customer to the best of your ability if you want to make commission.  You must always have a good attitude, be ready and willing to help each and every customer that walks in the door no matter the reason they have come in to visit the store."
good,"Once you get to work it was time to work. It was mostly fast paced from time to time it got slow but very rare. I learned to be observant of everything around me,"
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working there in every aspect besides how much pressure was put on staff to open rewards cards. Employees who opened more were given special treatment  and sometimes made the work environment uncomfortable.  Besides that, the job was fun and the hours were good."
good,Nordstrom offered a lot f benefits. Also taught me a lot abut dealing with general public. would recommend working here. I started right out of high school through college. Paywas great!
good,"Im so happy that I'm working in Nordstrom,really good environment with organized management,they always track you and help you to improve yourself about sell and customer service."
good,Defiantly a sharky environment at Nordstrom and you have to bend over backwards for the customer at all times... if you can handle that it’s a great place to work and grow. Good experience if not anything else.
good,"Had many opportunities to move up but chose not too. You work and get paid what you work for. Job is easy if you work hard, salary is based on commission. Great place and good benefits. Would definitely work there again."
good,"The Employees were a dream. Fun, Positive, loving people who care about making the customers their number one priority. Each shift has a goal to meet, so we were split into teams to achieve these goals. if achieved, we'd recieve $10"
good,Nordstrom Rack is a great place to work. The managers are very professional and fun. It is a fast-paced environment but not stressful. Everyone is very professional. The break room is clean. Rules are set and clear for all employees to understand and follow.
good,"Nordstrom affords a great entry level opportunity to learn sales.  It is a highly competitive environment that is great for young, energetic, competitive and driven individuals."
good,Liked working there. I had a lot of fun with my co-workers and everyone was very helpful. Sometimes i worked to hard i would finish early and had to help others out around the store.
good,I absolutely loved my time working for Nordstrom! It was a great company and I am always recommending it to family and friends. Everyone from the bottom all the way up to the Nordstrom brothers themselves are wonderful to work with! Terrific company that also supports their community! Absolutely amazing!
good,"It is a great place to work, full of people who are willing to help you achieve your goals. If you enjoy helping people shop and find what they need this is the perfect place."
good,"Being visible on the sales floor and engaging with customers "
good,"If you're competitive and can sell, theres a potential to make a lot of money. Nordstrom has a fun company culture, which makes it really easy to make friends"
good,Great company benefits... Good environment. The comute was a bit of a hassle. The management is a little overwhelming. All together not a bad place to start.
good,"Nordstrom policies encourage empowerment, lots of support from management team. Flexible schedules and friendly environment, lots of opportunities for career growth"
good,My co-workers were fantastic I would have to say they definitely made the job so much easier and entertaining. I learned most of my customer experience here and they have a fantastic course on training people in customer service. This job was all around great.
good,"Open door policy, lots of career advancement, and tons of great benefits. I just wasn't into the retail schedule of weekends and nights. Other than that, I probably would have moved up through the ranks and stayed with the company till I die."
good,Very good experience for up and coming career seeking individuals. Fashion industry environment. Very competitive and fast paced. Great place for networking and getting your brand and name out there.
good,I was only a seasonal worker at Nordstrom before I had to move but overall it was one of the happiest places I have worked. Everyone there was extremely nice and willing to go out of their way to help you. The work was a lot of standing and very repetitive but the environment was great. They even allowed us to listen to music while working so it made the 8 hour shift go by much quicker.
good,Working at the Nordstrom Rack was fulfilling.  I used to meet management's and supervisor's expectation.  I met different types of customers.  The store carries medium to high-end merchandisers.  Challenges with high expectations were compact to each other.
good,"They constantly pushed for success and competition. The goal was to be organized and efficient. If done correctly, you would end up having a successful career. The management was demanding, but also very helpful and caring. Nordstrom is known for their hospitality and customer satisfaction. Working with this company improved my thinking skills on the move, my people skills and helping me to understand that even in the most stress filled environment, success is attainable."
good,"Greeting customers upon arrival, ensuring they have a pleasant shopping experience, managing personal book, booking personal shopping days with clients, following up with customers, inviting them to various Nordstrom events, creating Nordstrom credit card accounts, meeting daily goal, tracking packages, assisting in merchandising, shipment, tracking inventory/ stock, back office management, handling personal customer information Such as  ( credit card information, mailing addresses, phone numbers and email addresses."
good,Money was good but very competitive working in the departments and managers require you to maintain sales goals. The discount is really good 20%. You can advance to assistant manager if you love working here and have what it takes
good,"enjoyable work environment "
good,"Fun place to work, hardworking team that was very supportive. Customer service ""best of best"" consistent. Fast paced, very organized and easy to get the day completed."
good,"I met the best people at nordstorm and, it is an easy place to work if you have a competitive attitude. Everything is commission based so your salary is soley based on you. Nordstrom has its slow pay periods, where customers barely shop but, they busy pay periods make up for it."
good,Nordstrom provides you with the work ethic needed to stay on top of other co workers and show management you are capable of moving up and onward. They provide everything you need you just need to show that you are willing to put in the hours and do the work that is needed for the company.
good,"You receive good benefits, hourly rate is minimum wage.  You also get a discount.  You will also accrue PTO hours.  Hours are great too, normally you will not work past 9 pm."
good,A great place to work and grow your skills. I enjoy working in logistics and helping customers from behind the scenes. My peers are friendly and a typical day goes by fast. My only complaint would be that the store is big and there are a lot of employees and it is easy to get lost in the mix.
good,"Nordstrom Rack is a fast paced environment where employees are constantly completing their tasks, providing amazing customer service, and using the store's mobile devices to help ring up customers to make the line faster. All the workers are so helpful, especially if you're new."
good,"Nordstrom is a fast-paced, fun environment for anyone who loves to sell. They hire managers within the company, so most people have been around the company for some years. The commission is okay, but during the sales you have endless room to sell as much as possible."
good,Job is very complicated once you start but you get used to it. You get to learn all about the credit card industry and you will learn fast that Nordstrom customer service is held to a higher standard industry wide because of how awesome it is.

good,"Great Place to Work always fun and hard at times but people are great, products are great, and the service experience is high, high value to customers"
good,"I worked for Nordstrom for 6 years and was able to grow with the company. In this time, I was promoted multiple times and developed a lot as an individual. Ultimately the retail hours and working through the holidays got old. Otherwise, I would probably still be there. The skills I learned at Nordstrom will continue with me as I advance in my career. I loved the culture, the ""promote from within"" and ""open door policy."""
good,Culture was relaxed. People are great.  Experience was amazing.  I learned a lot.  The company told me a great deal about customer service and customer relationship.  Because of this company I'm better suited to not only talk to customers but to assist them with their needs.

good,"client appointemts "
good,Management was helpful in creating a professional but fun environment. The work may seem dull but with the right attitude can be a lot of fun.
good,"Nordstrom is a family-oriented type of company.  Working there, you are part of a team, and you will not be able to get the job done alone.    Being a team member here has taught me the ins and outs of warehouse procedures and operations. There is a strong management team here who ensures that all employees concisely learn and have what they need to execute their jobs pleasantly and efficiently. My co-workers are all great and assist everyday at work going by smoothly.  There's not really a hard part about the job, as long as you work quickly and remain on task.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to float to different departments to work and learn from all aspects of the board."

good,"Wonderful company, takes pride in its history and employees. Pay is great! "
good,"I loved working here but I no longer feel like it's the right fit for me. The company is great, but the company is growing so fast that the talent pool is shrinking because Nordstrom only promotes from within."
good,I have experienced a culture of customer service and giving at Nordstrom that tries there best to deal with the inevitable problem of the work life balance in retail.
good,Management and co-workers were easy going and great to work with.  Open-door policies made communication with upper management easy and stress free.  The best part of working here was the comradery between the employees.
good,"Reviewed clothes, shoes, gift items etc.  Marked them as told by the system where they needed to be shipped and put them in appropriate totes."
good,"My typical day at Nordstrom is basically do the opening sheets and go to the weekly morning meeting. we start preparing the stocks and displays before the store open. We promotes sale of beauty products, service and promotions. Also, reporting the sales to manager and rep every 5 hours. at the end of the day, we make sure that we meet the sales target. My co-workers are nice, we help each others a lot. the hardest part of the job is counting, ticketing, which I'm not really good at. The most enjoyable part of the job is you get to meet so much people and venders."

Merchandise was great, and sold quite well, It was great to go to work everyday in a T-shirt and jeans and to be able to wear comfortable shoes. I really learned the value of customer service with this company and how to relate and interact with the customers. I also learned a lot about fashion merchandising with this company."
good,"Nordstrom is fast paced work environment allowing employees to think on their feet and to use their best judgement in handling and resolving customer issues. The best part of the role was working with customers and knowing that you had the support of management while learning, and also in decision making when assisting a customer. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Nordstrom. I met different people everyday. I really enjoyed working with the team. Nordstrom does a great job recognizing their employees. However, it was commission based."

good,"A typical day at work includes daily duties and the best customer service, I have learned many tips and tricks to maintaining a balanced work life, my coworkers have been hand picked carefully and the managers are always looking to hire the best talent. The hardest part of the job is time away during holidays, but I expect nothing less, due to it being a retail job. The most enjoyable part of the job are the different guests I meet everyday."

I enjoy the management as they were very helpful when needed. The co-workers were there when needed and help when available. The hardest part of  the job was assuring the customers get what there looking for in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."

good,"Great place to work.  Culture is like no other.  You work hard, but you are compensated for it."
good,"Nordstroms is great except for salary."
good,I worked in the children's shoe dept. years ago. I was a great experience.  Management was great. I would work for this company again.
good,Because of Nordstrom has multiple departments the work environment is always energetic and running at a fast pace. People are eager to help out and devote themselves to their customers needs.
good,Nordstrom's provides a very sophisticated and professional work environment. They treat their employees with respect and have very flexible hours.

good,At Nordstrom I moved around a lot. I started of being a stick associate. Being a stock associate i worked overnights. My nights at work were not what you called easy but manageable. I received shipment and processed shipments so that sales associates had merchandise to replenish the floor with.My co workers were great and my managers were also great. Things got a little rough at times but nobody is perfect and nothing is always perfect. But I maintained.
good,"Responsibilities include managing a team of 15 sales associates. Ensuring all associates are handling each transaction accurately and effectively. Delegating daily tasks including cash drawer assignments, stockroom maintenance and floor merchandising. Running an “Up-list” to ensure proper customer service to each and every customer. Organizing and maintaining shoe floor according to need for the right seasons and trends."
good,Great job to have. Loved the company loved the enviroment great sales and everything great some stores not having great management but great company.
good,"I appreciated my work experience with Nordstrom because I felt I had the most job freedom here. The position was commission based, so the outcome of my paychecks was solely dependent upon my ability to sell and build my client base- I got out what I put in. A typical day consists of an 8-10 hour selling period. I stay on the sales floor seling product to a wide range of customers, using the cash register, maintaining the sales floor and replenishing/restocking the merchandise. My co-workers ranged in ages and walks of life so there were opportunities to learn from the older people I worked with and opportunities to relate to my younger peers. The hardest part of this job was learning to adjust to the change of pace/moneyflow in the slower summer months in retail. I was used to makeing a certain amount of money during the holiday and spring months that the decline in revenue was hard to understand and work with at times. The most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with all the different types of clients that Nordstrom attracts. From that, I was able to learn different ways to build my customer service skills in a way that I had not yet exxperinced in my other jobs."
good,displaying product for the week. I learned to deal with different people and how to sell anything of product. Management and co workers we all got along well.

good,"Excellent work environment, love the corporate culture and co workers.  Great benefits and safe place to work.  Website for employees is easy to navigate"
good,"The team I work on is amazing, unlike any other. We have veterans that have been with the company for 30 plus years and as well as new associates new to Nordstrom. I love the fast pace of commission selling, being able to make your own paycheck is great, but hard at the same time. I've learned so much about products we carry, what individual brand does what for the customer, and also learning how to customer service about 3 to 4 customers at a time."
good,"I worked for Nordstrom's Rack for a year. I really enjoyed my time with the company even though it was some issues with my benefits, I would definitely work for this company again."
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom included many different things, depending on what shift you would work. Displaying new items on the sales floor, rearranging the sales floor, cleaning and tidying of the sales floor, helping customers pick out clothes, shoes, and accessories, creating outfits that suited the customer, and always making sure the customer leaves extremely satisfied with their ""Nordstrom experience"". During my time with Nordstrom I learned a lot of useful information, such as the many different fits of different clothing, working with a customer to build outfits that suit their style or update their style, how to arrange a sales floor that ""flows"" when you are shopping, hard work and dedication of a whole new level, and the importance of honesty with your customer. My co-workers were an amazing, fun group. We always worked with each other to accomplish a task and never though better of one another. My manager especially helped me grow so much in a short time, he is truly a great teacher, and an amazing person. The hardest part but at the same time an enjoyable part of the job was when we had a floor move and had to stay late after closing or come in early before opening and completely rearrange the sales floor. There was a lot of heavy lifting, and running around, but teamwork and laughter made for a good time. But by far the most enjoyable part of the job was working hand and hand with a customer and watching them leave happy and satisfied with their ""Nordstrom experience""."
good,"meeting and greeting people from different parts of the world, meeting you sales goal, maintaining stockroom standards, maintaining personal appearance."
good,"Regional Event Marketing Manager for Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, Arizona and Nevada.

good,"nordstrom is an exceptional company to work for and i have enjoyed my time there"
good,"As the summary stated, Nordstrom taught me how to be genuine and very personal with my customers in a way I had not experienced before. One has almost complete liberty to treat the customer with the service that the customer deserves."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for and if you work hard you can get promoted quickly.  They do a good job at training you and preparing you for any struggles you might encounter.  Long hours, especially during the holiday season!"

good,Arrive at work 5 AM clean entire store in 5 hours. I learned I can do any kind of job. everyone was great to work with. The hardest part was cleaning after someone got sick and not getting sick myself. The best part helping customers as a team.
good,Company stands by creating a work/life balance. Management gives constructive feedback. Lots of opportunity to make money and build career
good,I was extremely busy and active.  Learned alot about mens shoes and fragrances.  Hardest part was running up and down stairs. Our team made it very enjoyable.
good,"Work is always busy, there is always something to do. "
good,"If you are a good salesperson, or willing to relocate several times, you can move up almost indefinitely. If you refuse to relocate any distance, it will be very hard to move up. Nordstrom is very big on switching you between stores, usually in different states. However, if you say yes to everything, ten years with the company will see constant advancement."
good,Great place. Pay is just a little difficult to budget. Hnhggngjdndgjndgjndgjndjndgjndjndgjndgjndgjn
good,Definitely a great place to work as long as you want to work hard and with ethics.
good,"Nordstrom is a very respectable company to work for because they standout in customer service and quality in the process of shopping. Management work in a very fitting team environment and they believe in ""us"" instead of I."
good,I loved my job at Nordstrom West County. I had great department managers and co workers. Our store manager wasn't very personable though which was a little discouraging.
good,When you are in Lingerie and I am a certified fitter it is a very intimate process. You actually change people lives since most people do not know what size they should be wearing in a bra. I have many customers leave crying in happiness. its very rewarding for me. The Nordstrom store I work for is closing in January. I have been told I can have any job at any Nordstrom but I already drive over one hour to get to this job and it would be way farther to work at another Nordstrom. I would not be looking for another job if that were not the case.
good,"•	Promoted from Sales Associate to Personal Stylist due to exceptional performance"
good,I have always had a great experience working with the customers at Nordstrom. My manager is wonderful.
good,"well managed and a good environment to work in. Great benefits! "

good,"*Learned about many different designers and quality of items"
good,Great place to work with great people that help you where you want to go.
good,"I truly enjoyed working for Nordstrom @ the Galleria Dallas. "
good,"My typical day starts with reviewing any new products that arrived on nightly truck, walk the floor for misplaced merchandise, and prepare to greet and help customers find a comfortable and rewarding fashion style.  Through out the day we maintain head set communication with all employees, check out customers on mobile devices, maintain store appearance, open new store accounts, monitor e-mail requests from customers.  When the store is closed, we return all merchandise to its correct locations, check in head sets and mobile devices, and general store clean-up."
good,"Working at Nordstrom was a great experience, mainly because of my co-workers.  They inspired me to become a better sales associate.  A typical day at Nordstrom consisted of talking to customers throughout the entire day, organizing and cleaning up the store, re-stocking items and placing phone orders.

good,"I love working at Nordstrom as a sales associate/ personal stylist. I learned to grow my business and built lasting relationships with customers. I was lucky enough to have a great leader that supported me. She always helped me in what I wanted to do, or move forward with. Nordstrom was a job that I took while in college. I love fashion, and its a great company to work for. I have met great people, and was fortunate enough to help with some events."
good,"The hardest part of the job when I worked for Nordstrom were the hours . We would go in at 2am and get off at 10:30am. You would have to sleep in the day time. The store would open at 10:00am so we would see some customers at that time before we left for the day. I think it was easier the job where no one was in the store yet. So you could do a better job. As far as co-workers they came and went I believe because of the hours. They had one person at store during the evening hours for when customers were there. "
good,Retail is a very tough business and Nordstroms is a very elegant with their service. The level of customer service was always 100% ALL the time.
good,the best thing about Nordstrom is that they make it a priority to make their customer feel welcomed and appreciated
good,"Esay mornings, then lunch and dinner rushes. Experincing and Rewarding."
good,"Nordstrom is a fun place to work and shop at. Incentives such as rallies for employees and sales events for customers.

Learned organization skills, delegation skills and scheduling, Learned sales and merchandising, creative approach toward customer, reports, buyers functions, district manager functions and staffing payroll. A management were sales manager so learned to be very competitive with an overall business approach."
good,"in a environment like Nordstrom i learned that in any given job description, customer service is part of a daily routing. Working in a store, warehouse, or professional setting we always use our customer services skills which is the way we deal or interact with each other from the boss to the lower management."
good,"The sales floor was primarily based on customer service you would greet the customer find out a little about them and take them into the fitting room and find the best merchandise for  their life style. Your rang up their purchases and log them into personal book so you could contact them about new products.  "
good,A nurturing environment that is full of opportunities for advancement!
good,"A typical day at work for me was to show up on time and complete assigned tasks and most of all focusing on the needs of customers and providing them woth the best customer service possible. while in this position I've learned how to deal with different types of customers as well as different situations. I also learned how to above and beyond to satisfy the needs of customers to ensure that they had the best experience while working with me. I learned how to work harder as a team player to meet company and department goals that were expected. The hardest part of my job was learning the facts about hundreds of different products in such a short time, but I continued to study and take notes and eventually things got better for me as I became an expert in that area. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and working with people of all ages and different backgrounds. I enjoyed connecting with my customers and getting to understand and help fulfill their needs and wants. Most importantly I built relationships with my customers and recieved recognition from them for being such a good sales person that they trusted and would love to continue working with."

good,"outstanding place to work and to shop, great management,good benefits."
good,"This company is constantly changing! It is growing by leaps and bounds! It is a large enough company to have benefits and a great 401k plan, but still small enough to reach the Nordstrom's directly. I absolutely enjoyed working here! The thing that is the most exciting about this job is also the hardest. It is constantly changing and updating. It presents new and exciting challenges all of the time! All in all, it is an excellent company to work for!"

good,"Every day is different, management is helpful and deparment co-workers give their best to reach goal. My intire day is challenging yet enjoyable building public relations."
good,It depends some day busy some not bussy. Interacting with diffrent customers. Managment was perfect. Since I used to work in commission and my name was on the board for higest sale the co-workers were not peaceful. The hardest part of the job was fulfilling customers order. Enjoyable part was making your client happy with their needs.
good,"I love working all types of people, Nordstrom taught me how to except everyone for who they are."
good,"Working at Nordstrom was like second family to me. Everyone could work individually or in a team, depending on the event--Half Yearly or Anniversary Sales Event. When working with other co-workers, it has a lot more positive energy than negative. When taking on responsibilities, a person would get the compliments they wanted to hear from management for the hard work you put in."
good,Nordstrom is an amazing company to work for...They are very customer service oriented and have a great culture...if you want to get ahead all you have to do is make it known that you want to move up and they will keep an eye out for you...the harder you work the more money you will make...
good,"The company was great, but as foward as the Managers, they are not ready for their own position."

good,Great company to work for. Best job I ever had. Plenty diversity and great supervisors Wish they would give more meal breaks .they only give two ten minute breaks
good,"Everyday we had to confirm appointments, restock stations, help customer with returns, product orders, and fulfillments of orders. We also had to help clients find any product recommendations while giving stellar customer service."
good,"Daily duties include receiving the truck, unloading, unpacking, preparing all products to be floor ready including price checking and sensors. Filling the floor and back stocking all products."
good,"Nordstrom is still a great place to work, but it is declining as they change to try and stay afloat against online retailers  "

good,Great place to work and learn to talk to people and understand the customers needs. Requires skills in communication sales and problem solving to succeed.
good,"Nordstrom is probably the best place to work retail. The management rewards you being a self starter, and building your own business. I’ve seen some complain that’s its only commission; I think that’s what makes this job great. If you are good at Connecting with people, and have good knowledge of what’s on your sales floor, you will do well. This is a professional selling position, and you are paid based on performance and not just an hourly and for me that is a huge incentive to do better and work harder as much check shows the effort I put in..."

good,I enjoyed my year and a half working in the bistro it was really like a family we all worked together to get the job done and stayed until it was perfect for opening the next day i would gladly go back.
good,Typical day at work was ringing customers up as well as assisting customers in fitting rooms and or on the sales floor. I learned how to handle different types of situations as well as communicating with a diverse clientele.

There is a lot of room for one to be creative, be personable with customers and perform at your best with providing proper support from your superiors and supervisors. Nordstrom is an excellent company to work for and it has outstanding benefits working with the company. And Nordstrom provides it employees with a competitive pay grade."
good,#1 In Customer Service. Company make sure Customers are taken care of they are the store #1 priority. Everyone is a Team player. Management shows concern about their employees.
good,I am still employed with Nordstrom. I have been working for Nordstrom since 2006. I have nothing but great experiences with the company. Nordstrom is a company that will promote within. I have been in Management role for 10 years. Grateful for everything I have learn and achieved with the company.
good,"Its a great job to have but, i wouldnt work here forever. Career advancement is based on hard work rather than tenure, although. It's just not my dream career."
good,"The starting pay is higher than most retail stores. Their benefits are great, when my son was born they just started the paternity leave & I was able to get 3 weeks off with full pay."
good,"Great culture, great people, great company. Everything is organized and you always know what you are doing as you are trained well. Even if you don't know something, it is super easy to learn it. The value saftey, then quality, then quantity."
good,I never come in to work stressed out because I know the people I work with and my managers are going to make my experience there amazing. Nordstrom has an open door policy and is always willing to listen to you and any ideas you may bring to the table. They really do care about their employees and that’s why I love working for them.
good,Great work environment! High pace and positive! I would definitely recommend this job to anyone starting out in the work field. Great for building social and sales skills.
good,An amazing company to work for long term. They have great benefits and great work environment. I didn't have the best department manager but my assistant manager was the best. She was the reason I wanted to stay but the negativity and disrespect my department manager gave to all the employees made me leave. After I left she got fired.
good,Excellent company great staff family and friends is what you get when you work there. Great motivating meetings to start your day. Excellent restaurant to wine and dine after work or on your day off. Great EBar Coffee Shop that makes superb drinks.
good,A typical work day you would come in organize displays and setting up sales signs. Build customer relationships so you have returning customers the hardest thing is keeping up with sales quotas and commission goals.
good,"Dignified retail work environment with commission based pay and very competitive benefits. Income depends on your personal level of motivation as a salesperson, as well as customer foot traffic."
good,Nordstrom was the first job I had that showed me the importance of good customer service.  I learned so much about myself and how to work with others.  I loved to learn new things about the company and all the ins and outs that come with working there.
good,"Working at Nordstrom Rack was one of the best jobs I had. They offer great benefits and I gained many long-lasting relationships with the employees and managers there. However, like most retail jobs I needed a job with hours that didn’t fluctuate so drastically. Of course holidays are the busiest but it was very hard to get at least 30hours a week during the slow months like February-June. They also make employees feel appreciated. They have company “All-Star’s” where each store’s management team nominates an employee to be an All-Star. There’s a ceremony, you get an extra $100 on your paycheck and an increased discount for a year at Nordstrom and the Rack. It was pretty awesome. They also do Employee of the Month."
good,"The mornings were fun with employees doing a rally type thing for all the sales people. For me, in logistics as a stock and web team worker, we were not as much in the limelight at the store. Some of the sales team disliked us because we stole their commission and inventory to ship it out to the online costumer. The work environment was good most employees were helpful and kind, but there were some salespeople who were unwilling to help you out and find store goods to ship out to the customer which was frustrating."
good,"Great place to work, although hours were cut tremendously after holiday due to low sales. Being a returns Inspector you have to be a fast worker and have a good eye to spot any damages to the items."
good,I enjoyed working at Nordstrom and was proud and happy to go to work every day.  The other employees were happy to be there as well.  The salary and benefits and incentives also made it worth the hard work.
good,"Great job if your looking to get a foot in the door with the company. I really enjoyed working there at the corporate office. They have a dining hall onsite with chefs and the food for breakfast, lunch and dinner is affordable."
good,Nordstrom is a cutting edge fashion forward environment. They give you the freeedom to grow your own business and give you the ability to fix whatever is wrong with your customer and make it right. Built on stellar customer service and promoting that in a daily basis throughout each employee
good,"This is a sales culture. If you have an interest in sales, and especially fashion retail, there is no better place to start. The manager training program provides great opportunity for company advancement."
good,"Exciting and inclusive environment, Always evolving and changing. Great fashion and competitive benefits. Great PTO after 5 years of service. Close to home!"
good,"As an employee from Nordstrom I was able to create my own business, meaning, I worked on commission which made me create my own list of clients and worked as hard as I needed to earn my commissions. No work, no good salary."
good,"Replacing shoes on the floor with new inventory, doing product knowledge about the shoes so we are able to answer any questions that customers may have about them"
good,Clocked in and started taking customer calls or emails.  The work culture was great.  Everyone on your team was willing to help if had any kind of questions.
good,Worked there for one summer in the bay area and it was a great experience. The only way you can make a lot of money is through commission. You do have to work a lot of nights and a good amount of hours but its relatively entertaining if you love fashion.
good,"The hardest part of the job is the time of the shift (3 am to 12pm), repetitive. Management was super nice, really welcoming of me even though I had no experience. The workplace culture was diverse and the range of age was great."
good,"Nordstrom has and will always be 1 of the best places to work for, I have advanced in so many way working for Nordstrom, I would truly recommend a friend to work here."
good,"Great pace to work but am ready for a career. Typical day at work is putting out merchandise and assisting customers. I learned how to manage time and that multitasking is key to Management is very supportive and helpful on a day to day basis with anything you need. The Workplace culture is very diverse and edgy. The hardest part of this job is keeping the floor ""runway ready"" during busy times. Sometimes it's too busy to keep the floor spotless. The most enjoyable part of this job would be helping customers find exactly what they need and more. Seeing the gratitude they have for your assistance."
good,They work with your schedule and you have the possibility of going back during high business periods. I learned alot working here and am grateful for the experience.
good,Very fun place to work with a healthy balance of team work and independent work. You need excellent people skills and must be able to balance that with processing store items. Overall though managers can make or break your experience there.
good,"You can do well here if you are a motivated sales person, it is a good environment. They prefer to promote within and like to offer programs to employees. Great company. If you are good at sales you will be good."
good,Great company wish i never left. Had Fun just too much lifting for me being pregnant. If your a hard working individual with strong muscles its the best job to have
good,"Nordstrom is such an amazing company to work for, especially if you are a college student. Working at nordstrom has been such an amazing experience and you always have the ability to grow to become a manager, assistant etc. Nordstrom has one of the best benefits that I've ever been offered and they have such an amazing flexible schedule. They will work with you to adjust your schedule if you want to take more days off because of school or for other reasons. I have nothing but good words to say about nordstrom; It is a super fast paced environment and you have to really pay attention to what you are doing or else if you don't you will fall behind. The co-workers I had were so amazing and friendly. It might seem overwhelming at first but you learn them eventually."
good,"I haven't worked here for more than 20 years so I am sure things have changed considerably since I was there.  At the time, it was a great job with many opportunities to advance your career."
good,In all honest lesson learned at Nordstrom will help you with career advancement anywhere. The autonomy and running your business  along-side your peers will be key for your success.
good,"I absolutely love Nordstrom and their culture - our customers always come first. Fun, ever changing, ever evolving to be the best. Always pushing you to be the best and not to settle for anything less."
good,"The typical day in Office Planning is very busy at the moment with many projects and complexities.  Nordstrom's culture is Customer Satisfaction, Innovation and Opportunity.  I've learned that this organization is very interested and strongly supports taking steps to develop and improve processes. The hardest part of the job is keeping the swirl of decision making from getting out of control.  The most enjoyable part of my job are the people I work with and the autonomy to run my projects."
good,"I learned how to measure customers for alterations, tie bow ties and suggest clothing choices. Management was supportive by encouraging advancement at a pace we felt comfortable with."
good,Fun and engaging job. Hands on with customers. Great way to build a clientele. Open to more opportunities and moving you where you are desired. Welcoming to new employees.
good,"So many pros of working at Nordstrom.. first off the management is almost always fantastic and supportive, and when not so great, HR dept was on top of moving people who were not a good fit and resolving issues. The leaders within the store do an excellent job of promoting internally and spotting leadership potential from pretty much Day 1 during onboarding. Servant leadership is valued and putting the customer first, which creates a great team player environment. For the most part everyone works together to make sure all the customers on the floor are served and leave happy. Benefits offered are excellent and on par with the same benefits packages offered at top professional services companies. Culture is very much fashion-forward so if you already dress great and have a professional attitude, Nordstrom can be a great fit. Genuinely loved the year I worked with my team at Nordstrom and would highly recommend to anyone considering working there."
good,"I have worked at Nordstrom for 5 years. They have given me many opportunities to grow with the company, and push me to get out of my comfort zone. They strive for quality production, and care very deeply about their customers."
good,Very great team and fun to work. Each day was like a game. fast paced environment. very supportive staff to assist you. hardest part was when the item you were looking for wasn't there or in stock.
good,Typical retail environment with micro-managing as appropriate as well as competitive commission which can be aggressive at times depending on your department. Really flexible hours ideal for students as well as fair initial pay and some advancement opportunities.
good,"great management"
good,"Nordstrom is a fun, fast paced, team oriented environment. Great coworkers, resources all around you, and amazing customer service culture. Family company and I have enjoyed working there for years."
good,"Working in stock was my favorite. A typical day goes by pretty quickly when you keep busy. it's a fast pace environment but once you get started you don't realize how time flies. Management is great, they are friendly and caring. I'd say the hardest part is when you start in stock, there's a lot of department numbers to remember and where the boxes go but there's a chart on the wall that helps you out if you forget. The most enjoyable part of working in stock is seeing all the new things that come in throughout the seasons."
good,"The workplace culture had an upbeat, passionate approach to each department. Being in cosmetic sales, it was fun introducing staple products as well as those new to each customer. Practicing and learning new techniques with a new consistency daily helped improve my artistry skills. Management would keep you on track for sales goals throughout the year, and helped with strategies to do so. The hardest part would be interacting with the general public with unrealistic expectations such as free product or service without intention of making a purchase."
good,"Very productive, make sure you work at least 5 days a week and very good management and training. It’s a fun and clean environment. They help you if you don’t understand what you’re doing."
good,"Nordstrom treats their employees very well. I gained a great knowledge on how to provide great customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping individuals find an amazing outfit, and seeing them feel good about themselves."
good,"Over all Nordstrom is a great company to work for sadly they have one bad seed.  A typical day would be checking emails reviewing follow ups, checking your stats from the day before, reviewing your quality to see if you had any calls monitors, reading cstats from customer's, and logging into all of your systems, once you have done all of this you would take calls for the rest of the day.  typical calls are tracking packages for customer's placing orders and helping customer shop for specific items."
good,"A typical day at work began in a clean, inspirational environment. Learning new product by walking the floor each day before the beginning of my shift helped me stay on top of latest trends and find my favorite pieces that I knew I would sell through out the day. I learned a lot about variations of product. Management was fairly inconsistent which ultimately resulted in me leaving the company. Work place culture was very competitive, yet we were all a family which made coming to work every day so enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was the long night shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job was the community in the store not only throughout my team, but the entire store."
good,great place and people work as a team will recommend you for being here in Oceanside later this week and doing well in the household and the best time and Happy Birthday my Sweet
good,"Nordstrom, thus far, has been my favorite retail company to work for. It shows in their everyday communications, activities, benefits, and core values, that the company and the ones who run it, care about their customers AND employees! The advancement opportunities within the company are plentiful and Nordstrom give their employees a chance to prove what they are capable of. This is truly an amazing company!"
good,"Nordstrom is an amazing company to work for, I have an awesome team that constantly pushes me, and my passion and knowledge for sales and styling never stops expanding."
good,Worked with some great people.  Learned some new skills for packing and shipping merchandise using hand held mobile device.  Had a great manager who trusted our work ethic and productivity.
good,Love Nordstroms great place to work! Room for growth and advancement as long as you are willing to relocate. Great training programs there also. I recommended Nordstrom to everyone.
good,"I have loved my time at Nordstrom. It is such a wonderful company/ environment that has made me want to go to work. The support I received from fellow employers and the management there was incredible. It has made my experience in retail enjoyable. I also liked how I had the ability to help customers in their retail experience and use my fashion expertise to my advantage. The hardest part about my job was learning to reticketing, finding lost items and work on stocks in the back, due to limited training in that area. Most days I worked on the floor making it look presentable, and fitting rooms helping customers decide what items to buy. My sales and retail experience along with fashion background were very strong. I loved getting to know and interact with the many different customers and making sure that they had the best experience at Nordstrom. More so than retail my love for fashion is what helped me to succeed at the job."
good,"Nordstrom is a wonderful company to work for. Very busy and fast paced work environment, management is great and so are your co workers. The only downside is you are working retail hours, your schedule will never be set and you will likely be working every weekend."
good,"very busy dept, I learned great customer service and keeping inventory. management was descent. culture was average. The hardest part of the job was our sales because we had to stay till midnight. the most enjoyable part was having your personal customers, they became your friends."
good,Nordstrom was a great job and has taught me so much. Its improved my communication and team building experience a lot. the hardest part about the job was having to find where everything was put.
good,"I worked in the dresses department and had a fantastic department manager. She was young, energetic, chic and upbeat positive. She enhanced my working experience with Nordstrom"
good,"Awesome workplace culture, full-time employees are treated with benefits. "
good,You can really make a lot of money at Nordstrom if you relate well to people and spend your own time learning current trends and body types to wardrobe clients from head to toe.
good,"Fun, Fast paced atmosphere. "
good,"Excellent company to work for with excellent benefit. The company really believes in their employees and promotes a solid work life balance. Company has a very good compensation package such as health insurance, retail discounts and yearly bonus structure."
good,"A lot of pros in the way of the company, benefits, advancement options weighed against the cons of your coworkers and the clientele. There are a lot of departments that work closely together so it is easy to network within the company which in turn makes it easy to transfer departments &/or advance."
good,"I been working for Nordstrom going on 5 years now. I've learned alot dealing with customers on a daily basis. The hardest part is dealing with difficult people. For example, you may deal with a difficult customer who's having a really bad day and just want to take it out on you. So you have to be patient and understanding that they come first. Customer first, task second! The most enjoyable part is being able to build your own clientele. You'll have that one or two customers that only shop with you. It's a great feeling!"
good,"I was only seasonal at Nordstrom, a couple of years in a row. Like any retail job you face a number of customer challenges but your department will have your back and are usually very fair."
good,The thing I enjoyed most working for Nordstrom is working with the customers.  I enjoyed meeting the challenge of helping them find what they were looking for and to have them leave happy.
good,"Working at Nordstrom was one of the best experiences of my life, learning so much about sales and different ways of approach. Coming in to work was never a drag, I would always look forward to seeing what was planned for the day. Very goal oriented, every single day was a new objective to achieve. The management was great but maybe a little bit hard to differentiate professionalism with friendship. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep busy on the down times when there's no sales coming in. The most enjoyable part was working along side the most amazing people I've ever met up until now."
good,"Was hard to get the job at first. Management is hit or miss, may get caught up doing menial stock tasks. Pay is COMMISSION ONLY but usually isn't a problem. If someone wants to move up and makes it known I find that they almost always do"
good,Great growth opportunities and company culture. A day at work at Nordstrom was never boring you were always up on your feet busy doing something and helping guests.
good,"Good company but also there are some biased managers who have some race issues. Race is still playing a huge role in USA!"
good,I love the company. It has a very homey feeling and everyone is so welcoming and nice. They encourage you to be yourself and be true to yourself. Management is supportive. The atmosphere in Nordstrom is relaxed but very motivated to make the day and provide great service.
good,"Great place to work, great structure. Nordstom is a place where you work your own business. They provide the tools and equipment you need to be successful within the store and developer great costumbre connections. It’s a priviliage to work for them."
good,Well structured workplace with a cheerleading squad of managers behind you! Excellent selection of merchandise and creative sales people who were extremely helpful to the stylists.
good,"Great place to work, but it depends on your manager. Some managers play favorites and others are fair. Nordstrom is overall a great company to work for."
good,Inclusive and uplifting workplace. Up to date in the world of fashion. Strong focus on employee satisfaction and attention to detail. Problems handled well.
good,"Work at the rack it FAST. There is never down time. Your day starts with a task and continues through the shift, while aiding guests and maintaining a picked up and merchandised floor. Unfortunately, because the store is always busy, so is the management. You will have to become knowledgeable in your department and with your product on your own. It will come with time. Customers have high standards, because most are used to shopping at Nordstrom. This becomes a problem at times because of policy differences. These guests are entitled and sometimes difficult to handle. In customer service, you will have to have a back bone."
good,This job was a fun reliable job. Although the pay should have been higher based on all the responsibilities. I would have stayed if I was getting compensated for everything i was doing.
good,"Helped me grow, left because the commute was long and it was hard to make enough money through commission when the store was slow. Was continually pushed and became frustrated."
good,Overall professional environment and fun place to work.  Provided health insurance benefits if you work over 30+ hours.  Great management staff that is always willing to train and listen to you if you have questions or concerns.
good,Good work enviroment. Always an event in the store to help drive/promote the company goals. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with people from all ove over the world.
good,communicated with customers learning what they liked to shop for becoming personable open closed became a family team helpful great pay rate hardest part was irate customers keeping your professionalism to try to get through
good,"I learned the ins and out of how the company runs, I was in charge of inventory control in the store. I worked early morning shifts and had the rest of the day off."
good,"I have worked for Nordstrom on and off for the past 6 years.  I was about to grow with the company and became a manager in 2015.  I left the company because I had a child and wanted a standard 9-5, weekdays off working environment, but I always come back! This company has taught me the essentials on customer service, professionalism, marketing and business management.  I enjoy working with customers and being in control of my customer relationships and earning potential,"
good,I loved working here wish there weren’t out to get Certain people for things when everyone does it. Other then that loved the people I worked with made good friends would love to work there again.
good,"Aloha Style Start -Day          "
good,"Nordstrom was the perfect job during college as they were flexible with my schedule and the commission was a good amount. The culture is awesome! I was even able to move into management while still going to school full time. The one drawback is that corporate positions are very competitive and after I graduated I did not want to stay on the sales floor, so I eventually left the company because I could not even land an internship despite being a manager in their stores."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Nordstrom. I loved the structure of management and they offer ways to advance your career in the full-line stores. I'd say that working at Nordstrom Rack is a little different. It's more casual and less competitive. Rack employees aren't commissioned, so the vibe is a bit different. Full-line stores can become competitive amongst employees, for example stealing others' customers or sales. Nevertheless, I enjoyed working there and you will enjoy that 40% discount to Nordstrom branded clothing!"
good,"Responsible to ensure the quality of all aspects pertaining to the Café included but not limited to the following:"
good,"Good pay, competitive but that's sales life. I've always felt that I'm treated with respect. I enjoy the Nordstrom customer and environment. Good curated choices and guest with enough money to actually shop. Excellent benefits and insurance"
good,"a typical work day , Is making maintenance walks along with my assistance, checking and inspecting building systems on a daily basis such as HVAC, plumbing, Vertical transportation Etc; I've learn a lot about Making good judgement, Accountability, Budgeting, Knowing when to delegate Etc; Management was a great experience, a learned a lot. Nordstrom is a very diverse company. The hardest part of my job was budgeting because what you have on paper was out of balance of what you have to do /get repaired or install.  The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving the All-Star award."
good,"Nordstrom made me feel valued as an employee and having an excellent team makes all of the difference. Customers can be difficult at times, but the company supports its employees and provides a framework for success."
good,"A typical day at work, as a stock and fulfillment associate is going to the manager's office and receiving a device that has a scanner at the top. On the device, it showed what customers ordered an item from the store and I had to go to the floor to get the product and prepare it for shipping. Managers were very friendly. My co-workers were very easy to get along with and the work environment is geared to make the customer feel ""right at home"". The hardest part of the job was that the system wasn't always updated constantly so there were errors in the inventory and we were competing with other Nordstroms. The most enjoyable part was the simplicity of the job, even tho I would've liked to get paid a little more and have it changed to get paid weekly (not bi-weekly)."
good,I've learned a great deal here at Nordstrom from selling to management. It's a fun environment and the company is continuously changing which is great.
good,"The only negative here was the work life balance thing. I missed a lot of my children up bringing due to the fact that I couldn't go to school performances during the day and I had to work holidays."
good,The culture of Nordstrom was perfect. Their main focus were on the consumers. I enjoyed the the engagement from all levels of managements and the team effort put out from everyone.
good,"As a phone operator, I was eligible to work either a day shift (including pre-opening hours) or an evening shift (up to last customer departed the premises). I mainly answered and transferred incoming calls, but also oversaw the office supply stock and ordered more when necessary.  I, along with my fellow operators, also coordinated with department managers to fulfill various administrative tasks. I learned a great deal about working with people, directly and indirectly, and which helped to develop my own poise and patience. I regarded the job as a lesson in psychology in itself. I didn't work any managerial position, although as lead operator I was entrusted with the information and morale of my fellow operators. Because I was mainly confined in one area, I rarely had the opportunity to experience any culture, but I assumed it was over-the-top good in nature. The hardest part was dealing with the occasional difficult caller/customer. Such scenarios required poise, patience, and conscientiousness to not aggravate said caller any further.. I love the people I worked with, some of whom I became close friends with, others of which saw me as a bit of a father figure. I felt truly honored and I hope I gave those individuals some sound advice and provided them with heartfelt service."
good,Nordstroms has great pay and great opportunities. I learned how to move quickly and give good service. I enjoyed doing clients makeup the most.  The management there could improve.
good,Good company to work for. Different ways to grow with the company. Long breaks. Management is very helpful in many ways. Straight forward when being trained.
good,"Our mission is to make the day, everyday! I have learned management skills when dealing with my team and customers. We are coustomer obsessed and go over and behond our services. It can be challenging to Book events back to back from week to week. The most enjoyable part of my job is teaching clients to look and feel good."
good,"GREAT company! It's a great place to work. They have great pay with great hours. Staff is friendly and helpful and the job comes with great discounts, benefits and perks."
good,"I have worked seasonally for Nordstrom several times now. Always at the same store, but under different managers and departments. The company is very true to it's brand and mission, and every time I've gone back I have enjoyed the consistency of a company that appreciates its employees."
good,It Has A Great Atmosphere With A Good Staff. I Loved Organizing The Store To Make Everything In Place. If I Could Work There Again I Would. It Was A Calm Atmosphere.
good,I enjoyed my time working as a sales associate. I would organize the back stock and I would work the cash register. I also helped customers who came in. I learned to interact with others and to work in groups. I also learned how to talk to customers. I learned to manage my time. Everyone there was well kind and respectful. It was a commission based environment so there was competition. I liked working with the other employers there and help making the store look good.
good,This was my first job out of high school I was in the women shoes department. The managers were very friendly and helpful. I received training immediately and had a very friendly and exciting staff to work with.
good,Hours are long but rewarding when selling. Company culture is amazing and more relaxed than you'd think and you get to work with your best friends. Plenty of opportunity to move up in the company if you express interest.
good,"Nordstrom is a very fun and exciting place to work."
good,"Set the floor with the newest items or relocated a slow seller to another are for more exposure and sales.  Know the sales goal for department and store."
good,"The company has amazing benefits for employees. When you have great role models to inspire you  into your next role and take constructive criticism well, you will go further than you knew you could."
good,I love everything about Nordstrom. The pay is great as well as the benefits. Everyday is something new and challenging. the possibilities are endless and you learn something daily.
good,"This is a fantastic company to work for, especially when you are just starting out in the real world.  They care about their employees and their futures."
good,Very competitive selling environment with a chance to make more than the hourly rate. Must have very good customer service skills and be able to be on your feet for your whole shift.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Nordstrom's.  Unfortunately for me, I was a seasonal hire and due to the fact two long-time employees relocated with their families from Ohio and NY, they could not keep me on full time in the jewelry department as these Ladies had seniority.  I did not want to leave."
good,"It's a lovely working environment with friendly people and customers. Everyone there strives for perfection and genuinely cares for the customer. More than that, the company itself really cares about it's employers."
good,Nordstrom is a great and exceptional company to work for.With endless ways to make commission.Great environment and amazing people to work with.Also has wonderful benefits.
good,"Very fast paced environment, very detailed oriented to the knowledge of the business."
good,"Typical day at work was pretty fast paced in the women's shoe department. I learned to work with a big team, the hardest part of the job was keeping my personal sales up to where I wanted them to be."
good,"I worked at a smaller store so it felt more relaxed. But this isn't to say that the employees slacked off. It felt like everyone pulled their weight at this store. "
good,Nordstroms is and has been one of the most fun and positive places I have worked in a very Time. The many resources that Nordstrom provide to make my job is and more effective is probably one of my favorite things about working there.
good,I really enjoyed the culture at Nordstrom. Everyone was very welcoming and I learned a lot from my mentors and managers. Highly recommended place to work. Learned a lot there.
good,The one thing I noticed off the bat was how diverse my new hire orientation was with the sea of faces all different shapes and sizes. Nordstrom is a very non-discriminatory employer who treats all employees with respect and gratitude. The Nordstrom family is very involved with their business and it was always refreshing to see their faces frequenting stores throughout the nation.
good,"I was only a seasonal employee for the holidays but it was a great experience! The other employees were great, the discounts were a huge plus! They were great as far as training you!"

good,"Day was filled with objectives and tasks to make sales goals and achieve complete customer satisfaction."
good,"the hardworker who is a natural at sales, he can  shoot straight to the top of this company ladder. if you are shy or dont like a competitive environment this is not the job for you."
good,It was a great place to work and definitely an experience I would recommend. I think its important to work in retail for a period of time to get that type of job under your belt because there is nothing quite like it.
good,The quotas were always first priority not the workers well being. Overall the pay was fine and mamnagent was always very helpful and hands on 5 stars.
good,Managers were excellent and willing to work with my schedule as a part-timer. Benefits were also great. Enjoyable working experience all together. I would go back to work with them for part-time work if my schedule cleared up.
good,"At Nordstrom, you will make what you hustle for. Up-selling is key to maximizing your commission and paychecks. Building personal customers is another benefit  to increasing your paychecks. The environment is fast pace, fun, challenging and a good workplace to improve your communication and sales skills. During my time at Nordstrom I went from having co-workers to close friends who I share life with. I would highly recommend Nordstrom for those looking to get into the fashion and sale industry. It is also a great workplace for those who are in school."
good,"Nordstrom has to be one of the best places to work in the Fashion Retail giants. Hands down. the culture, the ethics and the management style is bar none. Also the quality of the products sold is top notch and they do not take customer service lightly which is a perk in itself. Highly recommend working at Nordstrom."
good,Overall I enjoyed my position at Nordstrom. The hours of operation was a bit hectic to switch to with a family and being a new mom. The culture of the company has always been the best. I miss working there.
good,"Nordstrom is a great company that  I would recommend to anyone. The environment is always positive and upbeat, the management is fair and understanding."
good,"Coffee is as energetic as a business as it is a beverage. High capacity, fast paced, constant attention to detail. Must be able to work as a team player and learn quickly. Attention to quality is of the upmost importance."
good,"Overall, Nordstrom is an amazing company to work for. However, working in a corporate setting can get redundant for certain people. Benefits are great, people can be great (depending on where you work)."
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom starts at 8am for managers. We start every day merchandising, and re-merchandising. We check emails and respond to customers before heading to the sales floor. Managers work side-by side with their employees to ensure their success but also to understand what is happening on the sales floor. Depending on the department, managers spend a significant amount of time putting out fires (customer service issues, product issues, sales associate issue etc) As a designer manager, its less about putting out fires and more about focusing on building customer relationships and ensuring our sales people are too.  Another time is spent in meetings with vendors, management or individual sale associates.  It is a lot of pressure all the time to ensure the high standards are met but its a lot of fun."
good,"Nordstrom takes good care of their employees and if you thrive in a fast paced competitive environment this is the job for you. I struggled with how cut-throat the competition was to achieve commission, and in the end discovered that my personality type was not made to work in that environment."
good,Working at Nordstrom's was a great experience. The high paced environment kept me on my toes and allowed me to better my multitasking skills. I learned to further my communications skills and   further my education on retail sales on a higher scale. Working with my collages in a fun but competitive way thought me to learn how to draw a line between business and personal skills. by allowing me to be interactive and helpful but still make sure i meet my own sales goals.
good,"Good company to work for, great benefits and great for keeping you on your feet. There's always a new daily challenge as well. great incentives and staff is like family"
good,A motivating place to work. Commission inspires you to work harder. You want to make sure that every customer Is happy when they leave. Service sells is the best thing to learn about Nordstrom.
good,"This job started off great my ,manager seemed pretty cool then throughout the weeks she started to change and actually show her true colors so i decided to leave."
good,No experience nessesary. Provides clientele. Advertises for events. Will train you for job. Everyone is very friendmy. Management is very professional.
good,"I truly enjoyed my time working at Nordstrom. This company is a rock star in terms of teaching and implementing top-notch customer service. Hours are similar to most other retail companies, and compensation varies greatly depending on self-motivation to sell, but can be excellent."
good,"An extraordinary place to work and thrive in the retail sector. You build your business as you go and the sky is the limit. I was confident in my tenure there and proud to say that I was able to sell a 3.14 carat canary diamond at $65,000 - by far the most expensive item to ever be sold through that location."
good,"Prepare and serve quality food. Clean as you go attitude made the job easier."
good,If you want a step into the fab life this is a great start. Nordstrom shows you a new way to carry  yourself . Your customers are you life line so be sure to create bomb relationships
good,Nordstrom has culture and has a good vive to work there. I learn that to be a good sales person you must be a great customer service representative first.
good,"managemnt sucked,"
good,Plan out your task before you do it. And customer service is the key to having a great day as a sales representative. You have to be able to move fast and complete the task at hand.
good,"typical day at nordstrom consists of interacting with customers to find out why they came in. Nordstrom is not like most retail stores where you see employees fold clothes all day, or work the cashier. its much more than that."
good,Merchandising specialist is a great introductory role into Nordstrom and an excellent way to learn more about merchandising and merchandising operations.  Once you are there its up to you to explore the company and connect with people - this will make all the difference as you plan your career.
good,"Very fast paced environment, where you need to be a quick learner and motivated to excel, great mangement staff very supportive, building new client relationship is the hardest, but seeing all the new fashion trends daily is awesome"
good,"This job was one of the best jobs I had. I enjoyed the community and the people I work with, a lot of them becoming my friends. Everything about the company itself is fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone. I am a true Nordstrom shopper. The only thing that didn't work for me was the new manager that came to my department. She is a horrible example of what Nordstrom employees stood for and act. She takes advantage of those around her and the system, not doing her job, and she is just not nice period."
good,Expectations were difficult to measure up to. It was impossible to constantly cold call customers in an attempt to drive your own business. The pressure to create business on my own was exhausting. I burned out after 3 years of working on my feet.
good,"Great place to work."
good,"I have been working with Nordstrom since 2011! Nordstrom has been a fun and competitive company to work for. The company surrounds you with a challenging and friendly environment and makes us go above and beyond for customers. The workplace is full of information, competitive employees, interactive management, and lots of customers in need of assistance. The hardest part of my job would be that I push myself to the limit, but not too far. I challenge myself in succeeding in sales goals and giving outstanding customer service. With that said, the most enjoyable part of the job is that I am able to be myself as I serve each guest in our store and make sure that each guest gets what they need!"
good,"A company that values its employees and their input. Compensation for management needs to be better. Company promotes from within, many career opportunities for employees especially if they're mobile."
good,Great work environment and generous perks. Management teams make the work environment friendly and welcome. The company goes above and beyond to show appreciation for all employees.
good,"I loved working for Nordstrom."
good,"Has joined here as a fresher and was able to cop up with the system and process."
good,"Started my day checking emails, getting the department ready and having a group meeting to get on the same page. Learned so much from my direct managers as well as from my employees. The culture of the company is that of customer service and using your best judgment. The company always promotes from within and I enjoyed being part of a great team."
good,"My typical day is to help our sales associates create the best experience for our customers."
good,I loved working at Nordstroms the culture is fun clients are great you can advance your position. I enjoyed employee shop days and our employee discounts.  Beautiful store beautiful work environment and if your good you can make some money
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work, especially as a starter job. They pay very well, and make you feel valuable. If retail is not your long term goal, I do not suggest falling in love with the company or you will find yourself for many years, and wondering where the time went. It is a great job to have while in school because they will work with your schedule regardless of how few hours you wish to work."
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work. You can really advance within the company. Nordstrom has interships for students that are entering the fashion industry.
good,"Nordstrom provides you with many opportunities for advancement.  If you are interested in management, Nordstrom definitely supports you.  Great company overall to work for!"

good,"Cleaning Vacuuming store rugs, offices. Cleaning bathrooms, Kitchens and changing all trash bags, and run floor machine."
good,"Loved working at Nordstrom for the time I was there, you meet so many new and exciting people. I loved the learning experience.. it was always something new everyday. The job, unlike most retail stores, provided a challenge and allowed me to grow as a person!"
good,"This company is full of friendly people who are always looking to help you out when you need it. They're extremely supportive and it really helps you to perform the best that you can. It's also unique that the company promotes it's management from within instead of just bringing in outsiders. All that, coupled with the amazing benefits package for even part time workers, is why I have enjoyed working for this company so much over the past couple of years."
good,It is an excellent company to grow if you are dedicated to your goals and sales. Management depends in which store you are. There is good managers as bad ones. It only depends on the effort you show.
good,"Productive, busy and fun place to work at."
good,Management wants to see you succeed because it reflects positively on them. Sales environment create strong competition if that's your thing then you will enjoy.
good,Nordstrom treats its employees great and love to promote within based merit and ability not tenure. They competitive in their pay wages.
good,"Provide company standard service. Fast pace environment, work with energetic people. Workers were always ready to work and always had a positive attitude."
good,People are very friendly and treat you well. It's a very laid back comfortable work environment. Management never treats you like you are less than and shows the up most respect. The hardest part of the job was probably working third shift and only having two 15 minute breaks.
good,"When I start my day at Nordstrom Rack I first check for the first 30 mintues to find any single shoes for customers that have left their information for that shoe, then when I find it we call all customers for the can""t finds which is call the single shoes to let them know if it was found then.Then I also may have the task for that day to size floor an change signs on floor, ring up customers an open accounts find product for customers. What I learn from management is that a good leader teaches by example. what I mean is that to learn an excel you first learn from your leaders  that teachs you the way, an that all co workers have to work together as a team because as a team we up hold the department even when one of us call out for illness or lost of family member. The hards part of the job is dealing with different types of clients because some times people can come to you upset an want to return something an it has been pass the return police an you have to help them to understand that. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I get a chance to meet all kinds of people."
good,"Fun and fast paced, its an awesome start if you want to work in the retail business."
good,You will advance if you work hard and show initiaive. Great place to start in retail or grow and gain skills. Management will promote you if you want to move throughout the company. Great values as a company as they always take care of their customers. I have enjoyed my time working for the company and I wouldn't trade it for anything.
good,"great customer service and worked in professional environment."
good,"great place to work, friendly management who will help you whenever you need it, looking for any and every opportunity to show that they care"
good,"Every day is a different day and that's what I enjoy about the retail industry. The culture in Nordstrom is amazing. Awesome co-workers, they make it a great day every day."
good,The management is available to handle issues that cannot be resolved otherwise. Lots of flexibility and very awesome coworkers. I had a wonderful experience here.
good,"Nordstrom taught valuable customer service skills. We had weekly checks, updates, and workshops to keep our customer service skills polished and product knowledge kept. We had monetary goals set to motivate us. We had to learn to approach customers in a friendly and appropriate manner. Everyone I had worked with was professional and caring."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for Nordstrom. They do their best to accommodate personal schedules as well as pay attention to people who need the family time.  Best customer service around.
good,"While at nordstroms I learned management and how to handle people and the area that I am working in. The most enjoyable part about the job was the surrounding, good people , lots of laughs and we also worked hard."
good,It was a nice work place come in to work and get right to work. It was always work to be done. The employees and mangement was nice and everybody was friendly.
good,"Gret place to work at and fun, energetic people to work side by side. the Nordstrom Culture is like no other and has created a following og awesome eager shoppers. management is always there to help out and are cheerleaders to their employees."
good,Great company to work for. Always kept you on your toes on selling and increasing numbers with help on how to gain better customer service techniques.
good,"Know yourself so you can learn to know your clients. Make connections and you can be successful, don't think it is easy. Nordstrom is a solid name and a good company to work for."
good,"Excellent place to work, especially for a manager that is up and coming.   Great corporate recipes.  Some freedom to create specials.  Lots of freedom to interact with guests and create great guest experiences.   Reasonable hours, fair compensation, above average benefits.   Corporate level management is poor.   Poorly informed, trained and motivated.   Fortunately they only visit twice per year so they can be worked around.   Great team mentality.  This location is exceptional due to the GM in the cafe being as focused and professional as she is.   Excellent manager.  Great person."
good,"I would recommend this job to anyone who likes to hustle. this job is very competitive because its a commission base job, the payroll doesn't seem to add up to me."
good,You have to make friends with co workers because if not people can get really selfish and steal your sale. Other than that the company alone is a good place to work. You have support from your mangers and hr.
good,"Nordstrom sales is a great job for aggressive, competitive individuals who enjoy interacting with people. I enjoyed working in sales there because of the wide variety of interesting customers, and I loved my coworkers and manager -  they made it fun to show up to work every day. Working in sales at Nordstrom involves being on your feet constantly, and can be physically exhausting due to the many mandatory tasks other than selling such as restocking, cleaning, rearranging displays, answering phones (often customer service related,) and, of course, doing returns. There is no time to stand around idle, but if you work hard, make sales your priority, have a good rapport with customers so as to develop a good personal clientele, and don't get too many returns against you, it is possible to earn anywhere from $15.00 to $30.00+ per hour..  Yes, the returns get frustrating because you are working on a commission basis -  especially if it is one of your own customers. It's hard to lose the commission on a good sale that you invested a lot of time and effort in, but you have to just smile and try to look forward and hope you can make it up on a new sale. During the years I worked there I witnessed almost every salesperson break down in tears at one time or another when they found out about returns against them (hard to pay rent when you don't make money) and promised I would never let it get to me like that ... but it does. So be prepared for some major letdowns due to the notorious company return policy.. but  Nordstrom is a well run company with great benefits and good career opportunities."
good,"Beginning of the shift I would make sure the tables/seats/floor was cleaned. Then setup the napkin with forks/knives. Make sure they're all wash and dry. Afterwards, If I had time, I would help out the waiters/waitress with setting up their work stations."
good,"Great place to work! A typical work day is, I log into my computer, open my emails, check to see any new updates in our system. I then proceed to log into my phone and start taking incoming phone calls. If we are slow I catch up on my follow-ups from the prior work day and check to see if any of my team members need help on follow ups. Throughout the work day, I take phone calls anywhere from someone needing to place a new order to a customers having fraudulent activity on their cards. We have unbelievable supportive management, and its a great job to grow and develop within. The only downfall I personally have had is that its a work from home job. Im a very personal and face to face person and over the phone on a daily basis is nice but I would love the opportunity to grow within a career and I can meet with customer and interact face to face."
good,"Great place to work and engaging with people on a daily basis. The company & the vendors are always sending us to trainings on the new products so we are always up to date with the merchandise knowledge. Sales driven goals, free products & contests allow for us all as employees to be productive and in a fun competitive way. Always learning something new & I always have my managers support which is wonderful."
good,The best place to learn all about top customer service. Great work environment. Fun and rewarding job. If you enjoy what you do and you are good at it you can make very good money.
good,Fantastic place to work and get started in the retail industry. Great opportunity to meet exciting people and network with wide variety of customers. Learned how to be presentable and have self confidence.
good,"A typical day at Nordstrom your on the go from the minute you clock in to the minute you clock out you are always busy doing things such as merchandising, cross merchandising, re-ticketing  merchandise, cleaning the cash wrap, writing thank you cards, calling customers and closing out cash drawers at the end of the night."
good,"A lot of running around is a typical day. Don't stand around and look glassy-eyed, you always need to be working. I learned a lot about the benefits of Nordstrom, both as an employee and as a customer. My co-workers were pleasant and I've made great friends."
good,this is my first time working retail and my co-workers help me with my training to make sure I learn everything. I enjoy the talking with the customers about their final selection on the items they are purchasing.
good,Always good. Learned that customers will return to you if they are satisfied with their purchases.  Management was never overbearing and gave a lot of respect.  Co-workers for a lifetime.
good,"This company is the epitome of a perfect company. Just make sure the actual store is following company standards. If the management team is doing it right, the whole store can feel the Nordstrom energy."
good,"I worked in Shoes so its a pretty high commission rate. Unfortunately that also means you have high returns especially being in Womens. Plus you work with a lot of people and a lot of people are money hungry so they can be quick to steal sales or be fake.  Management is iffy too. Especially in Indianapolis, its like they are all in a bubble and don't understand that this is the real world. Not every one walks around in expensive things."
good,"My plan was to join Nordstrom at the Jewelry counter, but I ended up in the Encore (plus size women's) department. I have to say,  it's so rewarding to help a customer find the perfect outfit. I love my department manager and her assistant, and the two other salespeople in Encore. "
good,"Nordstrom trained me very well in sales and gave me the knowledge to sale merchandise. Management is very helpful and tries to work with you no matter what you need. My co-workers were also helpful. Even though we were is a commission base environment, we constantly worked together as a team. The hardest part about this job was during inventory time, but it was still helpful because you get to see what we have to sale to your customers. The most enjoyable part of this job was to interact with customers, you are constantly meeting new and different people."
good,"I would come to work, and set a sales goal for myself. I would make sure my department looked clean and organized to best appeal to customers. I would check in with my manager to see what needed to be done for the day, and check for new shipments. I normally worked the department by myself. The hardest part of the job was the commission based salary, because regardless of your selling ability, there were still slow days."
good,A typical day at work consists of a great amount of customer interaction and working hands on with other associates. The hardest part about working at the rack is initially keeping up with the fast pace but eventually you get used to it. The best part about working for Nordstrom is the numerous opportunities to grow within the company.
good,I really Loved working here and im hoping they start posting jobs soon because I want to work there again. Started our days with an employee rally that kept us motivated to sell during our shifts.
good,"Overall the company is wonderful to work for. The management we have within really goes above and beyond to accomadate to every employee as well as running a successful business. I am proud to be a part of their team."
good,promoted autonomy - good working environment - a little contradictory on HR decisions - overall had a good time and made some great friends
good,Great Place to work at! The People that work at Nordstrom are amazing and friendly.  There is so many opportunities to move down the pyramid in the company that it is hard to even consider leaving!
good,A typical day at Nordstrom Rack is very fast-paced and busy. It is a fun and welcoming working environment that helps their employees grow within the company. Everyone has a uplifting and joyful spirit which helps the day go by smoothly. The most enjoyable of the job is interacting with customers who love fashion. It shows the importance of the image of the company.
good,Great over all company really enjoyed my time there.  Learn a'lot about myself and how to maintain being responsible and meeting deadlines. Very diverse Culture just real genuine people.
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I wish I did not move so far away from Nordsrom. The management is awesome, they care about their employees. It is a fun environment to work in.  I would still be working for Nordsrom if I had not moved away."
good,"Fun workpace,very enjoyable job,great people,very helpful,support each other"
good,"There are many items about my job that enjoy, one of the greatest is the satisfaction that I have by assisting people in the purchase of a product either for pleasure, a need or a want. "
good,"I love my job. Great culture. Only downside is that no matter who you are, how many degrees you have, or experience....you have to start at the bottom."
good,"A typical day at work includes making sure all of your orders for customers are put through, everyone is being helped with the best possible customer service, calling all of your potential and previous customers with new merchandise news and upcoming events, and most importantly, building your sales with every transaction. The managers in our department are very nice, helpful, and always push you to your capabilities in the best possible way. My co workers are very similar to me and we get along very well. We all have the same goals and work together so that the department reaches it's goals every day. The hardest part of the job is probably getting the customers to open up Nordstrom store credit cards and accounts. A majority of them say no, so it is a challenge to continuously discuss the benefits and advantages. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to share my love of passion with my customers and showing my excitement for every piece that I show them."
good,A typical day at work would be working alongside high fashion customers gaining a rapport with them and leading them to exactly what they are looking for. I learned how to be patient and becoming a better listener. Management was great they allowed you to work under low pressure and were very motivating. The hardest part on the job may have been the competitiveness and the most enjoyable would be making my sales goal and getting the job done.

good,My overall experience here at Nordstrom has been amazing.  The great people that you meet along the line and the promoting from within culture that the company has.  I've learned alot from being here at far as making the best decision and sticking with it.  This company definently gives you freedom to be yourself.

It was with this company that I was able to strengthen my communication with customers and upper management, experience managerial responsibilities, and create a competitive salary that only grew with my determination."

good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work, you can definitely advance in the company but you have to be extremely dedicated to what you do. At Nordstrom, you have to go above and beyond in every aspect into retail. It is 100% commission based so you are in control of your earnings."
good,"Loved, inspired by meeting and working with Francois Nars. Loved color experience and helping to make most successful event in Nars brand event history."
good,I believe that in order to be on top you have to start at the bottom. This is how Nordstrom is all about. They would never put you on top unless you started from the very bottom.
good,"Great Place to work while in school."
good,"Productive and busy. Everyday, invoices have to be filed, orders have to be placed to replenish supplies and product, Some customer issues have to be handled. Working there has really developed my people skills and my computer skills."
good,"best job i have ever had hands down. never worked for a company that cares so much about its employees, they only promote within the company. great motivating managers that made for successful departments and happy employees. definitley makes sense that nordstrom is one of the top companies to work for according to Forbes. I was in shoes and made a ton of money!"
good,"Working at Nordstrom is such a great experience. Every day is something new and something different to experience. Building relationships with customers is a large part of what you do, being around great styles and trends is an added bonus. You always need to be professional and ready to give the best service, even if it's just giving directions."
good,"I would start my day by walking the floor to see if new merchandise came in and where it was. Then I would see if any customers needed assistance with either a fitting room or picking out clothes. I would continue assisting customers by cashing them out, then move on to cleaning up by swifering the floors, folding clothes, cleaning out fitting rooms, and returning the clothes where they belong. I worked with great people and had fun. The management was helpful in teaching us what we needed to know to advance in the workplace. Hardest part was standing for eight hours, but you get used to it. Most enjoyable part was helping the people and seeing your paycheck at the end of the week equal up to all the work you put in."
good,"Mailroom clerk. hipping in store and online orders to customers, answering call in orders,fling and data entry"
good,I worked as a cashier so that required me to know and work 2 stations at the front of the house. Those 2 stations were soups and register. I've learned how to quickly respond to questions regarding the cafe as well as miscellaneous information that the customers needed. Management was very professional and fluid and working processes.The hardest part of the job was memorizing all of  the dishes that the cafe offered. The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting customers and offering my opinion on certain dishes.
good,"Nordstrom gives you the opportunity to run your own business at the store level.  You have the freedom to create a business for yourself that allows you to make a good income if you work hard, build customer relationships, and follow through on commitments.  Most managers inspire you to continue to learn and grow with your business."

good,"Nordstrom was a very fun place to work. It was very motivating and I felt like I was excited to go to work every day. A typical day at work was: I set a goal for myself for the day, and I interacted with customers in all different ways. "
good,Nordstroms is a great company to grow with and offers plenty of opportunity for growth.
good,"I set the new store and was invited to work the GALA/Grand Opening.  The owners were wonderful and store management was great.  Everything was geared to the workers and so positive. I continued on as a sales associate and my department manager was stealing my sales, along with 2 other associates sales. We all left in the same week."
good,"You always know you will be taken care of when you work for Nordstrom, even though they are a big corporation they still have that family feel and being connected and caring for their employees."
good,fun and relaxed work environment but working on commission the pay is VERY unpredictable
good,"Nordstrom is a company based on good values and high standards, i loved that the main focus of my customer service job was actually my customer!! Nordstrom believes the customer is always right and they should always be happy when leaving your store. I can say that I truly felt like I was making a difference in peoples lives by making their shopping experience that much better. "
good,Everyday this job has been interesting.  I learned to help out with the public.  Working with a wonderful team of co workers.  The hardest part of this job was to learn to understand the public.  The most enjoyable part of this job was working with the public.  Everyday was a new adventure.
good,This job requires you to multi-task regularly. It is very fast paced and you must do things quickly and efficiently or you will fall behind. I learned to be task oriented and also provide exceptional customer service to customers. I have enhanced my ability to be people oriented and also work as a team to get the job done.
good,I learned a lot more about my trade as well as learning how to handle retail. Hardest part of the job was simply slow days and standing still. I enjoy face paced work and non stop tasks to keep busy and productive. 
good,"On an average day, an employee would see about thirty different clients. Each of these clients has needs and wants that need to be addressed. It is my job to up-sell while providing excellent customer service.The most valuable lesson I learned was to create relationship with the customers. Earning their trust is crucial to becoming their point man at this location.The management is excellent at motivating employees and creating internal competition. The co-workers are fashion professionals who live up to the definition of their word. They take their career very seriously and are passionate of their profession. The most challenging aspect of the job is not having the merchandise on hand. The most rewarding aspect is the networking  opportunities and friendships developed with customers."
good,"Everyday, I take customer calls dealing with issues, taking orders etc. The hardest part oft he job I would say is not being able to interact face to face with each customer. I love the interactions between me and a customer and like to be hands on. I love all of the very nice and respectful people that I work with everyday. Nordstrom is a great company to work for!"
good,A typical day includes some prep cooking mixed with dishes.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company and many of the employees. I gained allot of knowledge and experience I was able to carry with me in my career and in life.
good,"The entire company is solely centered around customer care, which is fantastic for the customers and allows all the employees to feel less pressured to make people buy something the customers won't actually use, so everyone is extremely helpful, yet friendly about it. There is a lot of room for advancement, as people are constantly being promoted"
good,I loved working here. Everyone was friendly and very helpful.
good,Held to the highest standard of customer service and communication skills. Being the expert and being personable to each client. Treating each client like they are the only client for the day.
good,"to be the best you can be, work hard in any Dept. I learn a lot from my very first manager, that if you put your mine into it you can do anything. always take it to the next level. the hardest part was leaving"
good,"every thing is tactful, organized, great return policy, great products, clean work space, great employee benefits"
good,"This is an overall great company to work for. Every one of your peers start at the sales level and move up based on productivity, customers service, and team work. As a manager you are responsible for not only your employee development but also the merchandise presentation and assortment. The part I enjoy the most about my position is developing strong leaders and growing my business month to month."
good,I have worked here for 10 years. This job taught me a lot on owning your own business to building a customer base. I was lucky to have great manager to guid me and be a better sales person. I worked really hard for my money and it made me a more responsible person. If you love to meet new people and passionate about fashion then this is the place for you. If you are not a people person and very lazy then this is not the place for you.
good,"Working at Nordstrom was a daily joy as well as challenge. Greeting guests and making new business friends was highly enjoyable. I enjoyed the nice atmosphere and ""family"" attitude of the team members. Fundraisers, team support, laughter, and great spirit were all a part of the career at Nordstrom."
good,Great working environment! This job would be ideal for someone who loves fashion and providing excellent customer service. It is commission based so friendly competition does exist.
good,"This is a very good company to work for. Compensation, benefit, life balance, everything is great. The only problem I had there is that I had to deal with some incompetent managers in my department but the company does a great job replacing mangers and ensuring that employees are happy. I will recommend this place; matter fact, I would love to work for this company again in a different department."
good,"I love the company that I work for, and the values that they hold. However, I do not wish to be a sales associate all my life. It can be extremely timely and hard to make time for friends and family. It is not the company's fault - this is simply the way that sales jobs are. Like I said, Nordstrom is amazing and it would be a privilege for anyone to work there."
good,Offers many avenues for those who have the desire to sell merchandise and have a passion for fashion.
good,Managenent

good,"I loved working here. I love the people, and they made it fun for all employees."
good,I worked there for a couple months beacuase i was in highschool. but i loved the atmosphere! the people were great even the customers! i would definitely go back to work there great benefits and you learn something new everyday.
good,"In retail It is not a good match for me. The medical field is where my passion lies, and I miss it tremendously."
good,"Nordstrom was formative for me, as the company taught empowered me to make decisions on my department's business, hiring, staffing, events, and to help people that allowed them to get great service, great products, and an ability to make business happen."

good,I have enjoyed my time at Nordstrom's in Freehold Mall and am grateful for the experienced management and team I work with.  I came on as a Seasonal Sales Associate and am delighted to be staying for the time they gave to me.
good,"It doesn't get much better than a company like Nordstrom. There is a reason why it is so well-know in the fashion community. Overall a great place to work if you are focused and committed on creating value for your clients/customers. A little bit of a slow start especially if there is employees who have been there 10, 15, 20+ years with large clientele books but it is not impossible. The Nordstrom way is the only way and you will soon realize that. Customers are a bit entitled but not hard to please."
good,It was a great company to work for.  I worked alongside many great people and enjoyed my time there very much.  They really worked with you to help you progress your career and work skills.
good,This has been the best company I’ve ever worked for and I cannot stress this enough. This the only company that’s ever recognized me for my work ethic and talents. The people that work here amazing and are always dressed to impress. A lot of customer are always so happy to be here. I’m always so happy to be here. I do feel like the pay could be a little better but honestly for how much enjoyment I get out of working here I do not mind at all.
good,A job that is there to help you succeed! With weekly checks on your scores so you know how you are doing and where you need to improve. Always a helping hand around for questions. Lots of room to grow within the company
good,I received very valuable customer service training that has served me well in my career. The culture is very positive with many training and advancement opportunities.
good,It was a very good experience and it's about your skills and how much you can keep up If they would explain how to do the job then placing you somewhere where you got to look around and figure out on your own it would have been much better
good,Sales are very competive but will somehow figure it out depending on your team. Hardest part of the job is dealing with returns. It will mess with your goal.
good,"It was a relatively fast paced environment that allowed for exciting advancement. Each location, over the nine years and four locations, empowered its employees to service the needs of incoming customers as seamlessly and kindly as possible."
good,I loved the culture there. The legendary belief in customer service is real. I will always treasure my experience there. It was a place where the employee could always feel supported due to the inverted pyramid strategy employed by management.
good,"This company at the time I worked there had a wonderful work atmosphere, department areas were clean and purposeful, excellent customer service. Full participation from Management, always.."
good,Good pay and benefits. Typical retail work environment a little nicer than others. It has flexible hours.  The company is reducing opportunity for growth.
good,It was a fun place to work. They have very high standards and it was hard to meet up with them. They take customer service to a different level. The put their customers on a different playing field.
good,"I have learned a lot about selling and communicating with others. As an engineer it can be intimidating speaking to customer. I have been more assertive and suggestive in selling more items. Also, I learned hoew to listen to customers and keywords to help probe for customer desires and needs. It has been a great experience I ready to return to engineering my passion for new challenges"
good,Nordstrom really cares about their employees. They try their best to accommodate your needs. They take into consideration everyone’s needs and concerns
good,Good place to work.great people and flexible .Great work environment.Like the company good benefits.Good co workers.Great manager good salary.Lot a work.
good,"I loved working at Nordstrom, Oakbrook, IL. The managers were very supportive. All the employees I’ve worked with worked as a team. The work environment was awesome."
good,They love people who are different and stand out. They are all about culture and the latest in trends. They are fast paced and expect you to learn and grow at the same time.
good,"Daily meeting about sales, targets, winning points and opportunities, learn a lot about customer service, problems solving, positive energy, managers"
good,"Love 💕 getting up and going to work!! Work environment is great, good people with great energy and professionalism! Opportunity for advancement and mental and physical growth 💕💯"
good,Nordstrom is a good job to start at if you are just now starting in retail or even if you’re not. There is a chance of growth at the store which most stores for people who only been there a year under don’t really have the chance to progress up but at Nordstrom you do.
good,It is a great place to work if you can understand the culture! For the most part managers are supportive and the people you will work with are amazing.  There are flexible hours and work from home if you work in the corporate offices.
good,"Loved working with this company, the time and effort you put in always showed by the end of the pay period. It was great having control of your paycheck!"
good,"Interview with them isn’t too difficult  "
good,The work culture is great. They care about their employees and the benefits are great. Hard work pays off and there are opportunities for advancement.
good,"fast paste but fun meet people from different culture an ethic , learn some thing new every day from in bound and out bound customers. management is very supportive when you need help. the hardest part of the job is to get the client tell and the most enjoyable part of the job is you get to share  your knowledge to the walk in customer daily."
good,This is one of the best places i have worked. Typical day doesnt feel like a work more like family. Easy going work environment everyone looked out for one another. Motivation by supervising staff. Room for advancement within company.
good,I was a student the whole time working at Nordstrom and all of my managers worked very well around my schedule for college. I had a wonderful time working in sales. I am now ready to work as a manager for Nordstrom or another company!
good,"Meet and assist awesome clients , learned a lot about current trends and styles . Fast- Paced and super fun company to work for . Awesome Co-Workers, and great benefits."
good,You can make decent money if you are in the right department but the politics are terrible and management is the worst... There in no work/life balance and the manager I worked for did not seem to care. It is a very competitive environment and you have to have tought skin to survive
good,Was a good job I didn’t want a third shift it effected my sleep hours and I also had two other jobs but if I was hired on first shift I would have love to stay on first shift
good,"I was a host at Bazille so we did not have a lot of duties. We kept the front of house clean, wiped phones/computer screens down at the end of the day, threw out the small trash cans kept by computers, seat guests, kept the seating chart up to speed for the day and taking down hourly and daily sales. Because I had so much down time, I would also clear off tables, sweep, and help the bartender put away glasses, help with stocking, or help with inventory on Sundays."
good,"As a retail sales associate, they focus on customer service, but also many of the other employees are very competitive because everyone is fighting for customer to meet their commission goals."
good,"It was a very nice place. The managers were all very kind and understanding. The only complaint I had is that we were really busy all the time, and it was hard to balance maintaining the floor and helping customers, but we managed."
good,This company is great! I have worked with them for 15years. Sales are not what they use to as everyone is ordering online. Which has been challenging getting paid only communication
good,"I learned at Nordstrom that you have the ability to control and influence your own job. At Nordstrom, you have the opportunity to make a lot of money and be a great leader for others to look up to.  With being commissioned at Nordstrom, you can make more money than other regular department store associates if you love the department that you are in and love putting the customer first. I will say that it may become difficult to balance life, school, and your position duties at the same time as the shifts can be long and the expectations of assisting the customer to the best of your abilities even outside of work."
good,Great job to work. Very easy and lots of busy work. Nice people and customers. Adaptable work area and fun. The mangers are nice along with the other staff.
good,Needs to add a pinata. Some trainers are pushy and do not give you the chance to focus on your work without continuously interrupting you. Some trainers are wonderful and allow you to work without interruption but are willing to politely and kindly help with any questions.
good,"Flexible and understanding. They create a positive environment, and the employees are really nice too. They care, and management is understanding when things come up."
good,"I had a great time working for Nordstrom and learned a lot and gained a lot of experience. "
good,The rack is a great value  concept. However retailer have a difficult time in retention of productive employees. Should promote more merit raises vs based on hours worked.
good,"Awesome place to work. Especially Twenty years ago. I worked three different locations and although it was the same store, they were all totally different. Work atmosphere always fun and they do promote from within which is fair."
good,"Nordstrom was a good place to work at, I had a lot of fun working there. It was fun working there, I had fun taking breaks and lunch. I had a good setting and I enjoyed my co-workers, and my manager was nice too."
good,"Made you feel like part of the family. I really enjoyed my time there and learned so much. The other staff, who mostly had worked there a long time had lots of experience for me to learn from."
good,"Nordstrom was a great environment, with a competitive atmosphere that helped everyone succeed in their goals. Promoting from within. Great culture. Customer retention."
good,It was a very good job. I loved it but then they relocated to Jacksonville  fl . But they took care of us. I loved the people there .Great food and clothes.
good,"great pleace good time fun cowokers, fashion foward, flexible schedule,good environment, nice people, high end place, high end customer, great managers"
good,"Believes that associates comes first in the company. Great work life balance. Good pay. Good management team. Great training, no blackout vacation days."
good,Great place to work. Good benefits and potential for great pay. Good working environment. Sales goals are easily attainable. Management is very supportive.
good,Great job while I was going to school. Management was very flexible with my schedule. Great atmosphere to work in. Management and employees were great people to work with.
good,"Had a great experience working for Nordstrom. I was hired as seasonal only. If given the opportunity, I would work for Nordstrom again in a heart beat!"
good,"Great company to work for. I worked for the company for 5 years, started as a salesperson, before I left the company I managed my own Dept. Great benefits, paid time off, an abundance of career opportunities, fun atmosphere and the company is open to fashionable expression. The pay, in comparison to most retailers is amazing. I only left due to company restructure, I could not afford to take a different position due to personal reasons. Would definitely want to work with them again!"
good,"There are few things that make Nordstrom a bad place to work and only one of those is direct leadership. Depending on your immediate manager it could be the best place, or the worst, but I've been fortunate in my journey to have a portfolio of successful and encouraging leaders that have developed me into the leader I am today."
good,I learned how to be punctual and manage my time. I worked with sorting and packaging online orders. Sometimes it was hard to find something to do but it was a good challenge and a fun environment.
good,Nordstrom is an extraordinary company that lives up to its reputation. The management at all levels exemplifies a culture of caring professionals determined to empower their people to provide extraordinary service to their customers. Sales and customer service personnel are expected to use their own best judgement when dealing with customers and each other. I am proud to have worked at Nordstrom and experiencing their unique culture.
good,I couldn’t ask to work with a better company. Everyone is so friendly and will take the time to explain things thoroughly. A company that runs smoothly and genuinely cares about their employees.
good,You'll receive daily goals and it is important to reach them but understandable to some degree if you hit close to the number. Management is delightfully helpful.
good,"Loved it! Unfortunately, warehouse was closing and I was offered a job in Dallas with one of Nordstrom stores. I went out to the interview, was offered the job and relocated there."
good,"If you have an opportunity to work for Nordstrom, do so.  They are an amazing employer.  Every company has managers that are challenging to deal with.  The corporate culture at Nordstrom is so overwhelmingly upbeat and constantly upward moving that it will outweigh any individual management issues.  Nordstrom is actually used in HR textbooks as an example of “how to” employee development."
good,"Nordstrom was one of my very first jobs, right after i graduated high school, I was given the opportunity to work for the company back in 2005 and from there I worked for the company on and off over years.  I gained a tremendous amount of knowledge about customer service and working with others. I enjoyed the face paced environment and interacting with all kind of people."
good,This was my first job EVER and I loved it! My manager gave me a shot even though I had no sales experience what so ever. They taught me everything I needed to know whether it came to customer service.
good,"They are a welcoming, engaging environment. At least as far as the ebar is concerned. I know it can be profitable in sales but it can also be quite competative"
good,Nordstrom was a great company focused on training the fundamentals of creating a world-class sales culture.  The company is superb at finding and identifying great talent and putting them in the right places to succeed.
good,"Working at Nordstrom, there are so many opportunities. I learned so much, had great managers, awesome training, Human Resources was always there to help. Even when I wanted to try other departments, my manager helped with the interview and what I should and shouldn't do. I felt such pride working there, and like I really earned my money being commission based. So many great memories working there, and I wouldn't have left if I didn't have personal matters to attend to. I was always helped, and encouraged. Being here of course helped with other positions moving on. If you can make this your first job or your last, I would. Great company and people, and really inspiring. I really didn't have a bad day when working, I wanted to come in all the time."
good,It was my first experience while I was in school. It helped me to communicate more with people. People their are so kind and helpful and they will give you from their time to help you out.
good,Culture and teamwork atmosphere made Nordstrom a great place to work. Managers are flexible with scheduling and company offers merchandise discount and opportunity for advancement.
good,"Only receive two 15 minute breaks during an 8 hour shift which can make it stressful at times. The 15 minute break times were barely enough time to be able to get to your locker and get money for food and eat it, then return your things to your locker. It felt like a constant grind."
good,Nordstrom is an equal opportunity employer with great pay and benefits. So multicultural and diverse and many chances to advance as long as you work efficiently.
good,"Fair company, management was great. would recommend this job to other people. Great work environment, good training, and good working conditions. Enjoyed my time with this company."
good,"Nordstrom is a fun, organized, and enjoyable place to work. It is a fast pace work environment. Main benefits are being able to connect and build long term customers and relationships that will benefit the workplace. Nordstrom is a reliable upbeat company."
good,"If you want to work somewhere, where you have a group of work pals that boost your confidence when you need it and provide an environment that with nourish your career and your soul, then Nordstorm in Chicago is for you! Just be careful not to spend your paycheck at work, the hardest part of retail is temptation and not having many wallet friendly places to eat nearby, so pack a lunch!"
good,Always had a great time working here. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. If you had trouble with something the manager would take her time to show you the right way without becoming inpatient.
good,I enjoyed the experience and will probably give the job another try since I live closer to the building. Great first job to acquire and have on your resume.
good,Right when I got hired into Nordstorm I was very excited to work from the start. I really enjoy helping people by satisfying there needs. I liked when they gave great feedback with there experience shopping with me
good,Being a massage therapist at Nordstrom was certainly an awesome experience for me. I had great clientele and we provided excellent treatments for our guests.
good,"Great place to work. Have worked for the company for several years in management. Great compensation, and plenty of opportunities for advancement. Have been a manager for 5+ years"
good,"Everyone is very sociable. Some get a little too competitive and judgemental. Good standards set for custodial and work is checked pretty well, nothing gets too gross, no problems with bugs or anything like that. The company never drug tests and allows body art to an extent, but I am not sure about all positions. Sales people are very clean cut. Great health, dental, vision. Company matches all contributions to 401K. Regular meetings with your department. Opportunity to work on Thanksgiving to decorate for Christmas with Thanksgiving meal and a pumpkin pie to take home. Company participates in charity work every year and you have the option to volunteer. They aren't that good at recycling and could definitely improve in their environmental impact."
good,It was a really nice work from home job. A raise every 6 months and an annual raise company-wide. Received discounts year round and a slight bump on the first of December.
good,My experience with Nordstrom has always been pleasant. This company helps you advance to your next career goal. And encourages creativity. Nordstrom exceeds at customer service training.
good,Working at Nordstrom awarded me many opportunities to grow and prosper. There were many opportunities to earn additional funds and receive promotions.
good,"Always growth opportunities , great management team. "
good,The work is comfortable and a reasonable pace. The only problem is at times you'll have a disgruntled Employee/Manager that brings your motivation down and makes you rethink your position. Very sad but true.
good,Nordstrom was a great place to work. Management was helpful the workplace culture was awesome. The hardest part of the job was when you get returns from customers. Since it is commission based that was hurtful.
good,Nordstrom is a good company to work for just too many hours need to find something new . Nordstrom has you working 24xhrs . Great customer service company.
good,Nordstrom is good company to work for. Managers are very young but smart and all got promoted from within so they know the real business on the floor. A lot of opportunities to move up if you want to. They give employees the power to make decisions to do business. Good benefit and flexible working hours. You can schedule yourself depends on your business needs. Good benefits like matching 401k every day you work. Overall Nordstrom is one of the best Departments store to work for.
good,"individual growth is at the core of Nordstrom culture. customer service is about going above and beyond, this separates us from other department luxury stores."
good,Nordstrom is a company that really allows you to be yourself and connect with the customers on your own terms.  They really empower you to build your business and your connection with the customer base.  Really fun environment.
good,Typical day at work would be working with high profile customers and assisting them with whatever they are looking for.  Everyones really helpful and inviting.
good,"I was a logistics lead for both the Nordstrom Rack and Nordstrom, I loved my position and folks I worked with. The only downside was to move forward with the company I would need to move and that at the time was not in the family plan. The work pace was great. Walk in early and jump into moving product to departments. Always busy and I love being busy. Then end you day at a calm pace, so no unwind time when you get home because you could relax and reset as you finished up your work."
good,"I had an amazing experience working at Nordstrom as each day I would interact with the great staff and different individuals that allowed me to practice a variety of people skills, great customer service, and high speed services.  I recommend Nordstrom to individuals looking to practice customer service as that is Nordstrom's number one goal."
good,Hands down a company that takes care of their employees. Management was always supportive and interested in developing their employees.  The HR department was always their in case of need with information ready at hand.
good,The associates here are nice but at times it can get competitive. During the holidays it’s very busy. It’s important to stay on top of your customer because you can lose them very quickly.
good,very good company to work for with great benefits and a good pay plan. the commission percentage could be higher and would make living with the salary a little better
good,Great people to work with. Great benefits. Management is good to work with as well. They have rallies on Saturday and recognize hard workers and award them. Con is being a sales associate as you work off commission. Very few hourly jobs. HR works with you to replace you into a diff job role if you’re not succeeding in your role.
good,Just rang up customers all day and joked around with co workers. It was a pretty cool environment. although I didn't make that many friends while there I did always come across a lot of friendly people. I've never met anyone that's worked for Nordstroms that wasn't a good person!
good,Was a great place to work if you are seeking part-time work. I was able to get re-hired for seasonal work and was eligible for re-hire when I wanted to go back in a different state.
good,Nordstrom has a great atmosphere. They offer plenty of routes to move upward in the company. They create a good culture for its employees and make you feel important. You're experience with Nordstrom is what you make of it. They believe in empowering their employees to make their own decisions.
good,Go In after my 9 to 5 job. Sell the most product in a short amount of time. Worked with very nice people. Hardest part was closing the sale but i did it. Most enjoyable was making people happy and feel good.
good,"Great work environment with a great boss! Would recommend. You need to keep up a fast pace and get your work done but as long as you do your job, you will have a pleasant time working here. The only thing is the hours, but that is between you and the boss."
good,"everyone is friendly and they keep the place very clean , they work around the hours you work very understanding.  if you want to move up in the company is a strong chance that you will."
good,"very productive place to work, fast paced and caring coworkers and management. They are very flexible with scheduling and PTO. Very comfortable environment"
good,"They do a great job handling your work/life balance. They promote within the company which is great, you know that you can always grow there.  Management and HR are very fair."
good,"The training was wonderful. Its a whole week of training in the morning. You meet the store manager, HR manager, and other managers in each department. They show you around the store so you know where to direct customers if they are looking for a specific place to go.  Everyone is extremely helpful. this is a company that will help you grow in your career path."
good,"Departments vary with decent management. Work is simple. Can be boring at times. Over all simple and easy money. Pay is decent when you tap out. Benefits are decent as well. They give 10k free life Insurance, which is nice."
good,"Working with Nordstrom was and has been my favorite position thus far. Reason being everyone is always happy there. We did great morning rallies which allowed us to show off our outfits, promote the new trend and get employees to buy what we were selling. You were able to purchase things from your friends which kept everyone happy and you had a sales competitive environment that you and your co worker could have fun outselling each other. It was very fun and hard work. I usually wore heels and ended up changing after the third or forth hour but I figured I looked cute on camera so the pain didn't bother me. I was selling great, looking great on camera and got to see all the amazing shoppers who were ready to spend money. As a prior retail person I love when people are ready to spend money especially with me. The great thing about the sales positions were if you knew what your goal was you were able to work very hard to reach it. Once you reached that number you were able to feel great about yourself because you maximized on your appointments and up selling. Also the salmon and cookies were great during lunch time my favorite past time."
good,Nordstrom is a great company . great career place . I went to work happy and had a great work experience. customers loved to shop there and have and spend a lot .
good,Strongly recommend for retail experience. Management was always helpful and the company recognizes hard workers. Fun and friendly work environment. Learned amazing customer service skills and team work.
good,"Not enough business/customers.  Lots of standing around time.  Needed better advertising. Freebies, guests services.  Boredom caused younger employees to cause drama.  They definitely needed more to do."
good,"Truly a family driven company, that empowers their people to be the best they can be. So many locations make it easy to transfer if necessary. Would definitely suggest working here."
good,"Great company to work for! They love to promote from within. Pay is great and you earn raises every 1000 hours worked. Paid time off, which is earned by the number of hours you work."
good,this company has room for job advancement. This company is known for promoting from within. The Nordstrom team is like a family and they will support anything you decide to do.
good,Be open to thinking outside your box. Customer service is a key point in all decisions and your work is noticed when you truly have drive to grow. A great place to work
good,"It was a fast Paced Environment the works and managers were very friendly. i learned how to operate a clothing processing machine ,Processing at least 1,000 pieces by end of shift; the most enjoyable part was learning something new and interacting with new people. its not to much i disliked about the job."
good,very nice place to work however hours are very long . the pay is very competitive and can be rewarding if your work on a commission basis. management is underpaid for amount of responsibilities.
good,"this company is good, I know that one could grow greatly with this company. A great starter job for those coming into retail sales for the first time."
good,They will have you gangstalked before promoting you though to get the book on your habits and associates. Great place to work overall but a tough environment to manage in.
good,Nordstrom Rack's work place culture was truly wonderful. I learned so much from all of my coworkers and supervisors while I was there and really felt that there was a lot of opportunity for growth.
good,"Lavoro competitivo basato su commissione, tecnologia ed eccellente guida di customer service"
good,"A typical work day is always exciting. It has been fairly busy since I have been hired due to the holiday season and sales. I have learned how to manage my time, especially when I am assigned a certain department for that particular day."
good,If you’re into retail best retail place to work. It’s very competitive but doable being that Commission is the norm with Nordstrom’s. The customers are nice for the most part and having a good team helps in this competitive environment.
good,I moved away from the only Nordstrom location in Alaska but if I move back I will definitely apply and work there again. I loved this store and the people.
good,I work in a very competitive and focus environment! very fast paced and customer obsessed! we are big on coaching in the moment and getting the product out keeping our floor well stocked clean and shopping friendly! we always work together as a team and the pay is excellent as is the opportunity to grow with-in the company.
good,the job was very much a place to network with many different. It was a great way to grow customer service skills and problem solving skills. Customers problems are always solved. This position taught me how to handle problems on my own and basically put out fires with customers without upper management involvement.
good,"Fun work place, meet lots of great people. Management can be difficult. Depending on the department there are high sales goals. Fun place to grow and be challenged."
good,Empresa com ótimos gerentes e relacionamentos entres funcionários e gerentes
good,Loved working for Nordstrom...however there is sometimes a disconnect between regions and national expectations. Pay should be re-evaluated. Benefits are great but pay is less than competitive.
good,"Its's great company to work for, Over the years I work for this company I learned a lot."
good,"Many benefits"
good,Every day at work I had the opportunity to meet new people and make sure they had the best shopping experience in their lives. Nordstrom stands for exceptional Customer service. management at Nordsrtrom is probably the best I've seen because they are hands on and always around to make sure we had everything we needed and as the highest level stylist in the department I was always asked what I thought was selling the most and was what customers requesting mostly and that showed me a different level of concern about customer satisfaction. The hardest part of the job was the part where I would spend a full day working with clients and if they would decide to return all items the commission would be taken away from my paycheck which would make it as if I didn't work so hard to make that sale happen.
good,"This is a great barista job. Much less stressful than any other job in the coffee industry I've had. The managers are great, friendly staff and good benefits."
good,It's a great place for fashion lovers. I enjoyed my time there and it's easy to move up into management for top performers but there is a great deal of pressure to make exceed quotas every month. Slow months are difficult.
good,I only worked a short time for Nordstrom but while I was there I loved helping customers. I'm a breast cancer survivor and I loved the fact that we offered bras for cancer patients needing special customized bras because of loss of their breast do to cancer. I would recommend anyone wanting a career in sales to apply at Nordstrom.
good,"Although, working in a warehouse can sometimes be over whelming for people. This distribution center is full of resourceful people that would like to see you advance and understand the company and the company's culture as a whole"
good,The absolute best company I have ever worked for.  The culture is amazing and compensation is up to you.  Nordstrom does not feel like work.  I would have to say that everyone starts in sales and promotes up.  At Nordstrom your results are your resume.  The thing I love the most is  FNL program that prepares you for leader ship in the company.
good,Working here at nordstrom was a great experience. I dont really have much to say bad about the company however I would suggest prior to applying you have all life issues resolves as its a strict environment.
good,great place to workl with great and understanding management. Very easy going environment with tons of great personalities. The only reason for me leaving was lack of working hours. If I had been able to become full time then I would still be there.
good,"If you love to learn about PK then this is for you! I've learned some much from PK to selling to floor watching. There is endless of stuff to learn, especially with the right managers. I was blessed to have a department manager who was a buyer for Nordstrom previously and who is now a District Manager."
good,"Working at Nordstrom was through a job transition program. We knew ahead of time that it would be limited hours and not make me available for permanent hire. "
good,Loving the job couldn’t ask for a more better location very friendly co workerx because of the good management nice view of downtown Vancouver open and clean place
good,Great place to work with a lot of great perks. Only bad thin is management changed way to often. But if you work hard you will definitely rep. The benefits

good,"The head chef at the Nordstrom Grill was kind enough to take me on with no line cook experience. He made a personal investment in me and trained me very well. It paid off with strong dedication to the company and that work was rewarded with very considerable raises for a line cook position. The kitchen staff was nearly family; a rarity in the professional world. "
good,"Great Place to work, fun people to work with, customers was real special people. Time off for personal and vacations was good. "
good,"Nordstrom is a great place to work.. NOT heavy on the training for management.  "

good,It was a excellent opportunity working at Nordstrom being grounded and learning the true definition of what is customer service in the eyes of all retail and beyond the experience was amazing not only on the job but outside of the work place expanding in my every day life.
good,"Nordstrom has an open door policy, with employees. whatever concerns an employee has is encouraged to talk it out with management in order to find resolution. Our building manager's motto is ""Work hard and be nice"", which i believe is quite appropriate for the kind of business Nordstrom is in which is retail business."
good,I had a great experience working at nordstrom with friendly and fun people. It wasn't what I wanted to do long term so I did not stay very long but i would highly recommend for college students to take on a role like nordstrom.
good,"I can say through my years of working, Nordstrom Rack is DEFINITELY is a job I’ll never forget. They honored me in ways I never imagined, I also connected with some of the co-workers and customers strongly! A big thing for me now is perspective, listening and not taking things personal! I learned from every experience rather is was good or bad. I am now ready to go to the next level of my career with communication being my strongest skill."
good,The day was constantly busy and you were always running back and forth between assisting customers personally and filling/reorganizing fixtures. Management helps you to grow in the things you enjoy and could easily pick out and utilize specific strengths.

good,I love my job and I enjoy what I do. Making my customers happy and creating a positive experience is everything And also having the ability to be creative and build your own business
good,"Nordstrom is a high paced environment and their credit division drives results.  You can be there for a short amount of time and learn a lot. If you are a self-started and motivated to learn, then it's a great place for you."
good,"A typical day at work will be to assess what areas of the store need attention. Once they are identified and taken care of, we open the store and take care of the customers. I have learned how to work with individuals from all backgrounds, developing soft skills, as well as business operation skills."
good,The managers are aways willing to make the job work for you and offer classes that can help in sales. The company focuses on hiring within and the managers are more than willing to help with a vertical move.
good,Awesome transparent company with a great environment. They are eager to promote from within and happy to help you get to where you’re going! Great place to be.
good,"I really enjoy working for Nordstrom. The managers are great, customers are excellent, and the work is fairly easy. There was never a bad day there for me. When I did struggle the managers would notice and ask to solve my problems."
good,"•	Increased 20% of sales in a month and became a top sales performer in 6 months"
good,"The culture that the Nordstrom family has developed for their company is the biggest reason why I enjoyed working for Nordstrom.  This company cares about their employees, and causes their employees to care about their customers.  They have high standards and you are expected to meet those standards, which is what makes this company what it is."
good,"You are given a chance to make a good amount of money since it is commision based and they help you build your client base, however you have to be motivated and willing to put the work in.

good,Life was pretty easy. Great work life balance for college students. Goals were pushed every around big events. My dep manager was obviously stressed about it making work a little annoying at times.
good,"It's a pretty cool environment to work in. I have lots of fun with my employees, but we keep in mind that there is work that needs to be done! Overall its a cool job."
good,I really liked working there and the commission bonus was nice if you sold more during the pay period. The manger and other girls I worked with were very knowledgeable and friendly.
good,"Workplace was flexible when needed time off, supportive co-workers, opportunity for advancement depending on your networking skills, the cost of living did not match the pay at Nordstrom.com"
good,"Great place to work, was taken care of while working there.  Had occasional parties, worked with a diverse group of people.  I felt there was some competition amongst coworkers."
good,Nordstrom is a great place to work! The two managers I had were fantastic and truly took care of their employees. The company is dedicated to making sure their employees succeed and has many incentives to stay. Most people who work for Nordstrom find it hard to leave or never leave. There are endless opportunities within multiple departments. It is easy to remain with the company and do various types of work that helps you find what you're truly looking for.
good,"The pay was decent for seasonal employment and the staff was kind and friendly.  I did not work there long enough to really make an assessment as it was a seasonal only job during the Christmas season, but it seemed like employees were fairly happy and I was never mistreated."
good,"Management wants to help staff succeed, even if not in their own department/store.  Carries great products and stands behind them. "
good,"It was a little stressful to work there but pay was good."
good,"I enjoyed working at Nordstrom Ottawa, they provided us with great one-month training (Fashion trends & customer services) , great work experiences, and also great employee discount."

good,good. most managers suck. it is almost impossible to get fired so sometimes its a good thing and other times its not. benefits are really good. they also have a five days a week policy which is pretty cool.
good,"There was never a day I was not excited to go to work.  The company is flat out amazing with how they treat and develop their employees.  If you are lucky enough to get on board with Nordstrom, do it and stick with them."
good,"This was a great company to work for! I had to leave the company due to family issues that needed to be taken care of, but I would go back in a heartbeat. There is so much to learn here and so many amazing people to meet. Everyone is very welcoming when I started! This company is amazing to work for and they will be good to you."
good,"I LOVED working here! Really I could not recommend it more for anyone interested in retail.  It was a very positive environment and there was passionate management.  It is retail so the hours aren't the best, but that is just the field, not the result of the company. Great about employees advancing from within, which I really loved.  The only thing is that I asked to be full-time but they kept me at around 35-38 hours a week.  I would have preferred a full 40 hours but I could never seem to get it."
good,"On a typical day, your were scheduled to work as a small group to obtain a department sales goal along with an individual goal. You either opened the department in the morning or closed it in the evening. At times you are the only one and during peak times this can be stressful. But management made each day fun and exciting to be working with a great day and employees were recognized daily. It is by far one of the best jobs I've ever had and would recommend for anyone to try it out if given the opportunity."
good,"Very good working experience and looking forward to something more challenge."

The managers were very friendly and easy to communicate with. They were very accommodating with school schedules. New job opportunities were posted daily and Nordstrom promotes from within the company."

good,I learned a lot working at Nordstrom. It was very fast paced. I learned to deal with different types of people. Management there was very motivating .
good,A typical day at work would be busy with a lot of running around. Helping customers look for what they need and making sure the floor is stocked. The hardest part was cleaning up and customers messing it up again.
good,"Nordstrom is a wonderful place for customer service.  It's probably the most customer friendly place I have ever worked.  As an employee I was treated very well and with the utmost respect.  I was paid less than the other places I have worked, but I did receive commission on top of my salary, which evened out somewhat in the end."
good,Nordstrom pays very well for the work if you have a flexible schedule its definitely worth the physical labor. The management changes very frequently so if a constant new manager is a problem for you then you might hate it.
good,I get to work with great people. They are supporting and able to advance into a new role and relocate if I needed to. They have great benefits and discounts.
good,"The job is great, it is relaxed yet professional. The managers help you immensely and everyone is extremely friendly. Working at Nordstrom makes you feel happy and in term you spread that joy to the Nordstrom customers."
good,"I loved the culture working at Nordstrom! My coworkers and management were incredibly supportive and kind. The only problems were what you would experience in any retail job- long hours on your feet, always keeping a smile. But if you’re going to do retail, Nordstrom is the place to go."

good,The culture is very relaxed and fun. Always something to do and you have fun doing it. Shopping discounts are excellent. The company really care for the employees.
good,"I love Nordstrom.  It has been my home for over 10years.  There is lack of advancement because I am not currently willing to move out of state.  They have an open door policy, the work place is comfortable and the discount is amazing."
good,"I loved the management team at the Cherry Creek E-Bar and the store GM. They always ensured a clean & safe store and environment, and also assisted with scheduling needs whenever possible."
good,Nordstrom offers not only the best customer service but they also put their employees top of the list.  I have never worked for a more hands on company thats main mission is both the happiness of their customers but also employees.
good,Working for Nordstrom was not just working for a retail chain.  They taught me so much about personal growth as well as career growth.  What I learned there I took with me and have used in my every day life.
good,"Their open-door policy was as sincere as it was useful. Not only did they communicate well, but they also listened to our observations and suggestions."

good,"Working here was fun, at first you do things slowly, but get better with time. The team members were nice and want to see you working hard too to meet department goals."
good,"Nordstrom is an amazing company to work for and I regret not quitting more appropriately. At the time I was working 2 jobs and I was being scheduled much more than I could handle, on top of the fact that I do not wish to pursue a career in retail, and the environment was more competitive than I desire. Of all the retailers to work for, I would say Nordstrom is the one to work for if you're competitively driven!"
good,This is a fun fast paced environment. The team that you work with are wonderful and the management will always have your back. The customers that we see are usually regulars and are friendly.
good,All colleagues were pretty knowledgeable and it was always fun working with those folks. Lots of stuff to learn under working this organization and they were always fair enough with every employee.
good,"Working at Nordstrom is great. I love the team, management, the benefits, the outside life and work balance, the coaching. Of course, it all depends  with who you work with but so far no huge complaints."
good,"I absolutely love my job at Nordstrom, it is a great company with many opportunities. It is a great place to grow and I've learned a lot.

good,"I was a part-time seasonal cashier. The coworkers there were nice and the manager is ok too. I guess she would be nicer to those full time. When I worked there, it was holiday season so super busy. Very very good employee discount (20%) and good pay ($14/hr)."
good,"Great promote from within company! Great benefits, hard work, but all retail environments are.  If you like to be on your feet in a fast pace retail environment this will be a great place for you."
good,Very relaxed and slow. People are nice and not competitive. It can be boring for someone who is highly skilled. It takes forever to become a manager since most people don't want to leave their positions.
good,"working  and helping customers and enjoying the paid benefits they gave is very rewarding when it comes to the way Nordstrom is so very good to the employees and their customers with great kindness and they gave me a promotion or raise, being their for only seasonal and I felt a lot of support for the way the conduct their business in a good atmosphere of professionalism thank you very much"
good,"Great place to work. Customer service is top notch and the Nordstroms customers a great. A place of excellence in service, product and high expectations for delivery."
good,"Sales can be very fun, yet competitive with the people who have been there for many years.  Pay is not consistent due to work being commission based. PTO hours accrue after 1000 hours."
good,Great place to work.Good benefits. Room for growth within the company. Opportunity to build your own clientele. Opportunity to travel with the comapny.
good,My time at Nordstroms was amazing! I loved the people that i worked with and very much enjoyed coming to work everyday. The work environment was that of a team. Everyone i worked with always went above and beyond for fellow employees and customers alike.
good,"Love working for Nordstrom! I work in the home department, and it is hourly plus commision. I feel like either the base pay or the commission percentage should be more, considering the extra work involved."
good,Fast pace and challenging but no room for advancement.  I loved my manager and associate and customers.  Energy was very positive and we got to know your customers personally so they came back to you for future purchases.
good,"Freedom to make the least or as much money as you want.  You are given the opportunity to create your own schedule, not to mention the discounts are great.  Most importantly, I love the diversity that Nordstrom brings to the workplace."
good,"The sky is the limit at Nordstrom. If you want to advance, work hard, you'll get the results you're looking for! Management was always helpful and uplifting."

good,"Even though my time at Nordstrom was temporary, i learned so much about myself as a sales woman. Prior to this job I had no experience with compensation, after being taught the floor i was quickly able to navigate it myself and became confident making my sales. All of my coworkers were extremely helpful and made long shifts fun. The hardest part of the job is having to tell a customer you don't have what they want in stock, but it is extremely rewarding when you can find something else that they would equally like just as much."
good,Great management and professionalism. Very family oriented resulting in a fun working atmosphere.  There is a huge variety of departments you can work in to see what suits you best. Probably the easiest company to move up the ladder in.
good,I loved working for Nordstrom it was a great company they taught me all about customer service. I would have stayed there forever but i was pregnant and retail sales was difficult with a family especially during the holidays. Management was great! I worked in shoes and eventually worked in customer service which I loved.
good,Nordstrom is a great company that fosters growth through internal advancement of its employees. As a new higher I was quickly introduced to the sales floor and I felt both equipped with training and support from my team.
good,"The Rack(Nordstrom) is the most rewarding, productive, and profitable part-time career in this stage of my life. The benefit package is most rewarding, even as a part-time employee."
good,"Working in a department store like Nordstrom, I received so much love from my coworkers and management team. I gained a lot of knowledge from this job, I learned how to successfully contact customers, communicate between different departments, handle products that are being shipped out, link the reward system between the Canadian and the American system, time management to adjust time to schedule customers for services such as makeover, hand massage and facial. I have also improved my customer service skills by communicating with customers based on the customers' interests.

good,"The people I have  worked with were amazing. The managers were all nice too. Although not everything is perfect, the people at Nordstrom strive to achieve it."
good,Overall my working experience at Nordstrom was an enjoyable one. The diversity in the company was refreshing and the overall camaraderie of the employees from all the departments was welcoming. Only downside was my direct manager and his lack of interest in the company's regulations and making sure that I was full informed of the answers or where to find them. It often made his employees in ur department look bad.
good,"I worked at Nordstrom for one month as I was a Seasonal Employee. But I have to say working at Nordstrom is so much fun as well as a great learning experience anyone can have in Retail Industry."
good,"All in all, I enjoyed my time at Nordstrom. I loved my department that I worked in and my management team was very supportive of me wanting to advance with the company."

good,"Good place to work. Clean, safe environment. Good company ethic's. Fun place to work. Always challenging employees to be their best. Take customer service very seriously. Always leave it better than you found it is Mr. Nordstrom's Moto. They value their employees from distribution to the stores. The company is always on the Fortune 500 list and very proud of it. We have the opportunity to move to other positions within the company. They also have help for anyone needing mental, financial, divorce, adoption help. They have a very good 401k plan."
good,Nordstrom was a great place to work. The other employees were helpful. That was awhile ago it may have changed. I worked the cosmetic counter and we would get free perks all the time. I learned alot.
good,"I would highly recommend working at Nordstrom to anybody.  The atmosphere is as nice as the people you work with.  My manager is very flexible with my class schedule and what is going on in my life.  We make sure we have a great day at work, but at the same time maintain our focus on what needs to get done.  Everyone is also very supportive and will guide you if you are struggling with something."
good,"The environment is very friendly. Management is top notch. There's never a dull moment. The best advice I can give is to be positive and use good judgement. The hardest part of the job is working weekends and closing shifts. It's not particularly hard, but it isn't convenient. The most enjoyable part f the job is the people and the fashion/discount."

good,"A typical day of work would start by clocking in and reviewing previous and current sales goals. From there the manager or assistant manager would walk the floor with you to show you any new merchandise. Next, you would assist customers with services requested. At the end of your shift you would do you daily task of helping your department and calculate your sales to see if you reached your daily goal."
good,"A typical day at work consist of heping multiple customers and assist them with any questions or concerns they might have regarding a product. I was responsible for keeping my department clean, assisting customers promptly, and working in a team. Working at Nordstrom taught me how to work effectively with others and to task my time wisely."
good,"I loved working here the customers are great! The commission is really good. You basically determine your own check... work hard get a good check, slack off you still get a ok check due to the base pay you receive if goal is not met."
good,"Working for this company has been NOTHING but a great experience. I love everyone that I have met from this job and get along great with all of my coworkers. This job allowed me to grow as a person because of the main motto at Nordstrom, which is ""to always use your best judgement"" I have learned to become more patient in all things that I do, as well as dealing with customer issues. I think something that I enjoy the most working for this company is the customers satisfaction after the ends of their transactions."

good,Positive environment in which people are encouraged to preform at their best & provide exceptional service.

good,"I love my customer whom became my friends, my co-worker and the value Nordstrom has a company."
good,"Learned how to manage customers, the job co-workers and customers were very nice and supportive, very productive and I enjoyed my days at work."
good,"working with different hiring managers on meeting hiring needs. collaborated with a team and brought on over 15 interim recruiters in which I trained. I love the culture, the brothers are amazing and do not plan on leaving"
good,"Co-workers were helpful and kind. Made it easy to transition into working there. The hardest part, was building your clientele within a department that already has ""power sellers."""
good,"A typical day for me at work is helping customers with their everyday needs. Such as if they needed help choosing clothing or an opinion on a item, I would give them my advice. I also assist in the fitting room: opening doors, counting items, and putting clothes on the floor that the customers didn't want at the time. I teach customers about our reward program options and try to convince them to get it. I also tell customers about the surveys that they can do to help our store and co-workers."
good,"excellent place to work, dedicated management that are conscious about employee concerns. high energy environment. very friendly employees or co-workers."

good,"I have worked @ many call centers & many customer service positions but nothing like Nordstrom & I mean that In a good way, you barley ever get angry customers , co workers are great , bosses are wonderful even the customers ! Great pay ! It's a long learning experience but worth it , I am so happy I got hired on @ Nordstrom !!! Love it !"
good,"Nordstrom is commission only, so getting to work you have a goal or are negative because of returns.YES, returns counts against you but hey is you can sell your butt off then you are fine."
good,friendly environment to work at and good management. process and procedures are good and easy to follow and understand
good,Great company to work for. It is possible to start a career here. Management is flexible and willing to work with you. I learned more about the retail industry as well as shoes and accessories.
good,The hardest part of the job is dealing with customer returns but the job is very rewarding if you are an excellent seller. The management is good and understanding.
good,"I love my job. It's easy and challenging in different ways - making coffee/specialty drinks has become second nature, same with taking orders and completing tasks. The only difficult part about my job is dealing with rude customers (surprisingly, the majority of nasty customers I deal with are nordstrom employees also - sales associates and even a few department managers). You've really gotta learn to bite your tongue and just smile and nod, give them a refund and tell them to have a great day. That being said, there are so so soooo many more kind, genuine customers that I interact with every single day. Espresso Bar management (at least where I work) is great - my boss is accommodating and always really understanding. My coworkers are great too (but again, maybe it's just luck that we all get along well). Overall a great place to work - you get a raise every 1000 hours you work, and there are plenty of opportunities for moving up."
good,The best part at Nordstrom was the people I worked with. we all made our jobs easier for one another.  Team work! accomplished many things.
good,"Typical day of work required travel/onsite leadership, and equal amount desk/planning time.  I learned how to always be looking forward in business, make each day count.  Passionate and driven team/coworkers.  Hardest: pace of business  Enjoyable: people/culture of company"
good,"hours from 8:00am  to 10:00 pm, awesome!"
good,You learn the true meaning of Customer Service.  You are rewarded by your great service and because you continue to give great service it shows in your sales.  There is always opportunity for growth in this company with the training to help you get there.

good,Work hard and it will pay off since this job is based off commission.I enjoy the department I work in and find it very fun and trendy.
good,The Gucci Boutique in Nordstrom was a great place to work. The commission is great and it is a lot of fun. The most enjoyable part of the job was predicting trends and what was going to sell before the items hit stores.
good,"Nordstrom is a very wholesome company, which I had made my home for the past 5 years. Open door policy and always so much encouragement to pursue other areas of interest."
good,Very fun working environment. Teach you how to make different drinks.The coffee is great. The management is humble and kind. it makes it easier to get things done without pressure.

Love the people, very friendly and helpful when I needed support from my team. My two bosses, are positive on me and giving me a lot of advises that I needed to know, as for the time being, and will take with me in the near future."
good,"Coming from a very specialized ""department,"" I don't feel I truly work in retail. My position at Nordstrom is much more career-oriented and elevated than a typical salesperson. I've learned a lot in my time there, and continue to learn each day. That being said, I believe no matter what department, employees have a true passion for what they do at Nordstrom - much more than other retailers. Nordstrom is great to their employees - with good benefits, understanding management, and the ""open door policy"" very much alive and well. Everyone is there to help you succeed not only in your current role, but with whatever you see in your future as well."
good,"I enjoyed working with nordstroms because everyday I learned something new. I loved the environment, and company I was with."
good,Great environment and helpful associates to work with.  Just be aware that you must push toward your sale goals and stay on top of managment about your schedule.
good,"Learn sales technique - Great motivation from managers and employees alike - Competitive atmosphere grows sales all around - Quality company that truly knows how to treat its employees with respect."
good,"The start to my career at Nordstrom was an excellent expereince with their internship program.  It optimized my knowledge in all aspects within the company.  I worked closely with my department manager, the buyers for various departments, human resource department, loss prevention, visual and management.  I trained all new hires in my department and the two interns following my completion of the internship program.  Along with four other interns, we put together the Fall Fashion Show for the Anniversary Sale; which included recruiting store employees to model the products, hiring a DJ and overall giving every employee knowledge of the pricing and new products that would be available to our customers. Each employee was trained to stand in as a manager and handle all customer and employee issues daily."
good,"I enjoyed working with others, and accomplishing daily goals.  I started as a temp and eventually got hired full time due to my dependability and hard work."
good,"If they only paid more, i would've stayed!!! Great company to work for; they really love seeing people grow and get promoted!! Sometimes a little to much. Great values....but than again, its retail."

good,"After clocking in all employees would receive and opening duty which would be a restocking or cleaning task. "
good,"I have been working at Nordstrom Rack for about six months now. I can't really say I have many complaints. I appreciate the pay, the benefits, and the care and concern from management. I work up front at the Cash Bay as a Service Experience Rep. The job is fairly simple, as long as you are alright at multitasking and dealing with an irate customer here and there. You also need to know how to ""sell"" the rewards program, as you do have a quota on how many applications you process. But, at least you get five dollars for each one you get, even if they get declined! That's gas/lunch money throughout the week."
good,"Working at Nordstrom, i had learned to grow with such an amazing team. Walking into my day, i have planned a goal sheet, with standards i had with myself and my team. Making sure i was staying on top with my personal book and customers. Planning events and going above and beyond creativity."
good,"I was hired on as seasonal member of the logistics team for their anniversary sale and I enjoyed going to work every day. I was a little sad that my contract was coming to an end. They had a few positions open at the end of the contract for new members of the team,unfortunately I didn't make the cut. Nordstrom likes to hire and promote form within, so those open positions went to people who had transferred from other positions. However, the logistics manager left the door open for any other opportunities in the future that may arise. Overall, I enjoyed my time there and opportunity to be a part of the team."
good,It was a great experienced it helped me to be responsible an gave me the skill to be able to work in high volume fast paced operations
good,"Nordstrom was my all time favorite job! You make your own paycheck by the way you sell. I recommend this company to anyone! The managers are amazing, they never make you feel like you are doing things wrong. Nordstrom is all about their employees. "
good,"Typical day for me is pulling reports, communicating product needs to my District Regional Manager and Corporate Buyers. Coaching selling I manage a team of 16 employees some my main focus is the team. I hire/fire, train, coach, develop talent, delegate duties, and control inventory. Being a manager i learned how to delegate. Hardest part of my job is finding the right talent, most enjoyable is helping customers and teaching selling."
good,"Assisting customers with purchases, online or in-store, returns, questions, or issues with products. Co-workers were great, and helped in increasing knowledge on a daily basis. Management was slow to assist at times, but willing to answer any questions regarding work environment, and helped alleviate any work tension, if any."
good,Management extremely fliexible and worked around my schedule. Was a great place to work. i felt heard as an employee and valued
good,"There's plenty of advancement, especially in the Seattle area. It's a great job culture that is consistent throughout all departments."
good,"Stocking,setting up displays working with the mangers and the customers to sell mens clothing.."
good,Nordstrom is a great company to be apart of.  I have been able to learn as little or as much as I want with them.  They do whatever they can to take care of their people while creating a fun and positive work environment.
good,"This company was a fun professional atmosphere.  I enjoyed working for Nordstrom. My only reason for leaving the company is because, I am looking for a career change.  The management was fair and easy to work for.  My co-workers and I always worked as a team.  My favorite part of the job was interacting with people daily."
good,A place where you can get to know your clients as people and truly find what they are looking for with undeniable support from your superiors
good,"I love how goal oriented the company is!  Each day I come in to work with my set sales goals.  I call my customers and follow up with them on purchases.  My managers are great and meet with me once a month to go over goals I had for the month and for the next month.  Hardest part is when the store is slow, it can get discouraging at times."
good,"Learned every aspect of running your business.  In control of what merchandise you carry in your store, hiring your own staff, managing selling cost and budget."
good,Great place to work. Freedom to manage yourself. very motivating. Customer service is a must with this company. Your going to love it if you get hired.
good,everyone there was kind and driven. They were my first peek into the inner workings of a business. My team members were always focused and helpful.
good,I always had fun going into work being able to dress up kids and having fun doing my job. Great place to interact with people through out the day.
good,"Great place to work, they treat you well, can be hard at times to move up. Job performance is expected. Sales driven and difficult clientele"
good,"Great teamwork, commission based environment so the harder you work the more money you make, hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers, especially since Nordstrom has an open return policy"
good,Have a focus on moving best salesman up in the company. Focus heavily on individuals and not so much on the team. A lot of room for advancement if you work hard from the start.
good,Loved my manager. I was able to move up in the company. The benefits and discounts were great. Loved the environment and loved interacting with customers and building my own clientele. Best first experience on a real job.
good,"Loved the job wasnt seasonal"
good,"August 1999-May 2000"
good,"My managers at Nordstrom Rack in Brentwood, TN were amazing. I can't speak about every other store but this one set the tone. Starting the store manager ""J"" to the dept. man. to the employees my time was really GREAT. They allowed my to be me which really worked. They know exactly which dept. to place me and I enjoyed every moment. One of the best parts of the day was the morning rally to get everyone pumped up. If you are looking for a place to excel then look no further. I would like to say this: work is what you put into it and the environment can make a ton of difference. If you enjoy helping people, not complaining, TEAMWORK, and selflessness please speak to the management team. Don't bother worrying about the pay because there are tremendous incentives. Let's put it this way; I will be back there after I finish school."
good,"Working at Nordstrom can be fun. It is a company that highly encourages you to express yourself as well as your creativity, as long as you are confident in who you are. A typical day consists of helping customers find what they want and need; after all, Nordstrom is known for the excellent customer service its' employees provide. As an employee of Nordstrom, it is my number one responsibility to be able to tell a customer yes, in just about any situation. Patience is definitely a virtue needed to work in a position such as this. Nordstrom customers choose to shop with us because they want to be serviced and that is exactly what we do there. My favorite part of my job is the relations and connections I have made with customers. Something valuable I learned at Nordstrom is that following up with customers and learning about them on a personal level is the key to success there. If they enjoyed shopping with you, they will request to shop with you again and again. Customers love it when you remember them; it lets them know that they are valued. Depending on what department you work in, you might be paid on just commission. It is definitely the hardest part of the job and can be quite stressful, but it also is motivating. A little competition can be healthy, but it is also important to work as a team to help one another out. I enjoy my co-workers and we have learned how beneficial it is for everyone to work and communicate well with one another. I have found my experience here to be valuable and beneficial for my future."
good,Great company. Really good company to work for. Nordstrom takes care of their employees and offer excellent benefits.
good,Greeting customer in a timely manner and making sure their needs are being met.
good,Best company to work for and excellent benefits.  Great work and commnuications.

good,changed the way I viewed retail culture for the better. two-day workshop by terri Hawkins changed team morale during stores grand reopening.
good,Nordstrom was a great experience for me. learned a lot about customer service and how to handle each situation with customers and how to help them.
good,Felt like family here. worked the switchboard and loved it.
good,"Working at Nordstrom is fun, rewarding, and productive. You get to meet unique and interesting people from all different backgrounds"
good,"•  Ranked #1 in Midwest Region for sales percentage increase"
good,I like working at Nordstom. The environment is pretty amazing. My co-workers are great dealing with.
good,I learned how to clean a store including restrooms in a short time frame. The hardest part of the job was to make it look spectacular when I was by myself. The most enjoyable part was working with friends. The bosses even learned from me how I did my job. My coworkers supported me when things went wrong and congratulated me when I graduated from college. I would still be working here if my position was not downsized. They help people through United Way.
good,A lot of very tedious work sometimes. But everything had its rhythm. The employees were very friendly
good,"Working at Nordstrom made me the successful, and focused person that I am in the work place."
good,"Fantastic"
good,Nordstrom provides the top of the line learning tools which are quick and effective throughout the work day. With an open door policy you are able to talk to management at any time of the day. This company is striving to always help the customer and make sure at the end of the day they are satisfied and excited to come back.
good,"I enjoyed working for Nordstrom during the 2013 Holiday Season! I only worked for two months. The commissioned pay was excellent. The management was super nice and easy to work with. Some of my co-workers however were very territorial because the pay the commissioned based however I viewed it as friendly competition. "
good,Most of my job was to greet people. All the employees were assigned to stations. It was a fun store to work at.
good,A typical day at work would be shadowing the department manager in meetings and organizing the stockroom for sales as I was part of their management internship program. The hardest part of the day would be the friendly competition for sales in our department. What I enjoyed the most was making the connection with my clients and seeing them come in multiple times to see me.
good,"Working at Nordstrom has always been fun. I came across many enjoyable people as managers, coworkers, and customers.  Although working on solely commission based sales can be very stressful and difficult, it is enjoyable to help people find what they need and want."
good,"This was my first experience with big corporation and it was a learning experience. Working in a kitchen is a team effort, where you learn to lean on each other to get the work done."
good,"A typical day was generally opening up the POS registers and simply making sure your department was ready to be shopped from. Generally from the night before, your department should have been cleaned. If you have new merchandise, prior to the store opening we would try and get it out and work it on the sales floor in an appealing way for our customers. Building customer relationships would probably have been the most difficult part of the job simply because a lot of customers have already built relationships with certain sales associates. Management was a bit iffy at times, though there could be favoritism but they did their due work."
good,"Regional manager job functions include running a multi unit area, specifically 12 stores in the SE.  RM job includes recruiting, hiring, training, and mentoring leaders to grow within the specialty coffee division and company.

good,"open the registers, replenishment, having a lot of fun working on the sales floor, being very satisfied to see how happy and comfortable my clients were when I was helping them"
good,Big company with small company environment. Good work/life. Pay is on the lower side of comparable companies.
good,Usually a typical day at work was helping customers and ringing people up.
good,My favorite part of this job is the happy smiles on the faces of my customers who walk away loving the service i gave them and the products they bought.
good,"Brook Brothers is a 195 year old company. Brooks, has remained true to its time of conception and in a lot of ways remain current with the change of time. "
good,Great job just got layed off for managers not working with my school schedule overall a great retail company to work for.
good,Nordstrom is a wonderful place to work!  The company really values their employees and takes care of them.  They are willing to help you advance and reach your goals within the company and their focus on the customer is what makes the business thrive.
good,"A typical day at work is usually busy, you are always doing something whether it be helping a customer or a fellow team member. Being there you learn something new everyday, you gain lots of patience and the ability to multitask. You have to be able to work on a team and be able to communicate effectively. You are there to work together and give the customer the best experience possible. The hardest part of the job is being able to balance you home life with that of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to meet different people and learning something new."
good,"Being in such a friendly and open environment made me look forward to work everyday. Coming and working with my co-workers, planning events and trying really hard as a team and individual departments to reach our daily goals. Hardest part of the job I would say would be getting people to join our mailing list, not everyone wants to be bothered if they're not regular customers of the company. The most enjoyable part of the day for me would have to be between our store hours and closing. Store hours because I love helping customers and helping them find what they're looking for. Closing because it was good to know we reached our goals at the end of the day."
good,Loss prevention was an awesome experience job field a lot of work is done by loss prevention that people and employees don't know. Loved working here.
good,A typical day at my job involved meeting customers and making their experience enjoyable.  I Learned great selling techniques.  Management was always involved in our productivity.  I had a great team of co-workers.  The hardest part of my job was multitasking and helping many customers at one time.  The best part of my job was seeing a smile on my customers.
good,"Each day we had a sales goal to make.  I learned how t make that goal by using my client file when the store was very slow that day."
good,"Nordstroms was an exceptional company to work for.  Their structure is focused on internal growth, support and customer service excellence.  It showed in the programs offered to its employees as well."
good,"I get to help customers pick items that are fashionable and comfortable. I have learned how to use different software on the computer system, and how to recommend accessories. Management is very supportive and the co-workers are always happy to help. The hardest part of the job is when you just cant find the right item for a customer. I do enjoy being able to help customers with a wide variety of tools."
good,"At the time I started consulting with Nordstrom they were all on traditional cut and paste tables and light tables for photography."
good,"Nordstrom is a great company to work for. I worked for 4 years at the Bellevue, WA location and love the employees I worked with. Regardless of department we all worked very well together and I had a sense that the company, as big as it is, cared about each employee and their opportunity to grow in the company. I handled our paging and phone systems, bringing a 'voice' to the store. The fun challenge of using my voice to create a calm and informative tone to the store was very important. "
good,Provided flexible scheduling. Nordstrom takes care of their employees in all aspects. A fun environment where technology was implemented into interactions with customers.
good,"management was great"
good,Amazing opportunity overall although it is very difficult earning an income strictly on sales (commission).
good,Excellent management and relaxed work environment. Interacting with the customers made my job fulfilling.
good,Nordstrom is a great company to work for with great benefits. The best part about my job is the people I work with and interact with every day. I have met so many amazing life long friends as I have climbed the corporate ladder into management. There are endless job opportunities and Nordstrom really prides itself in promoting from within. The hardest part of the job is the physicality of it and the fact that I am standing on my feet most of the day but this also allows for the opportunity for the day to go by fast because I always have so much to do! I have learned how to build and coach a team of salespeople while analyzing and creating a business plan to exceed sales goals. It is an exciting and diverse company to work for!
good,"While working at Nordstrom I learned a great deal about suggestive selling and building customer relationships. I continued to stay current with product knowledge as well as fashion trends. I was part of a small team of 5 girls, who all worked well together and valued each others work. Customer service is an extremely important part of working at this company and that was an aspect I, personally, valued as well. The hardest part of the job was learning to be confident when selling; it is important to be suggestive and once you come to the realization that the customer is trusting you opinion and knowledge of the product, it is much easier to guide their shopping experience."
good,"I learned a lot about sales. The hardest part of the job was keeping your commision rate above a certain score, despite customers returning products."
good,"• Ensured that each customer received outstanding service by providing a friendly environment, which included greeting and acknowledging every customer, and maintaining solid product knowledge"
good,"plenty of room for advancement, customer service skills and stock work"
good,"customer service, generate business train staff and support them throughout their career"
good,The Most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I have helped each one of customers to my best of my abilities. Getting to work with different people from different world.
good,A typical day at work would be to start looking for the shoes that i ordered from the day before then if they are there start calling my customers after that go on the sales floor and make some new friends. I learned to treat people the same way that i would like to be treated when i shop. Management was very laid back because we all did our job well. My coworkers were ok and very much so dedicated probably because we got paid off of comission. The hardest part of the job was when the slow season started it wasn't for that long but still we did not make much money. The most enjoyable part of the job was giving the customers quality service you just can't put a price on that
good,"Great interactions with customers that you get to know throughout the years. A relax, enjoyable, and compititive workplace created with great co workers. Management was always working project, needed improvement."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Nordstrom. Everyone there is very helpful and never tells you they don't have time to help you.
good,I loved working at Nordstrom. I made friends for life in both customers and co-workers. The opportunity for advancement is great. The culture is great. I spent many happy years there. Corporate chose a different path for Customer Service and my job was eliminated.
good,Nordstrom is a great company that offers good benefits and wide range of advancement opportunities.
good,Good job to start a career still have made more money there than i ever did at the airlines.
good,Treats Employees very well. Great working environment. All coworkers are great and hard working individuals. Great salary if you are willing to work hard and sell well.
good,"i would begin my shift by clocking in then immediatly checking my appts.and reminders for the day. While doing that im also approaching guest to provide them customer service if one if my co workers have not done so . i worked in the lingerie dept. so i learned alot about women body shapes and sizes.this info became very benficial later on when i began working with new guest, One thing that did bother me was the competitiveness. It was a comission based job so it was basically a war over our guest .that had to be the hardest part of the job dealing with the childish antics, stealing sales , and the overall drama that came in working in a all female dept. With all that being said i really did enjoy my time there , providing my guest with the product knowledge of knowing what was right for them and their body types.I was exstatic that i was able to help them."
good,"Typical day at work is interacting and getting to know customers on a daily basis. Management is great, and i have a great team i work with. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the not so nice customers and having to smile and walk away."

good,Amazing work environment with polite employees and beautiful upkeep. Loved working here and interacting with customers and other departments. Did not enjoy the competitiveness of selling against other employees due to commission issues.
good,"Currently I am a personal stylist for Nordstrom, I absolutely love working with people, building relationships, I enjoying helping clients and making them feel good about themselves. I also enjoy working as part of a team for the overrall success of the department and company and I am eager to take on additional responsibilties in management and leadership as they arise. I have learned great sales skills, customer service skills, leadership skills, and desire to use these skills in a larger management capacity. The hardest part of my current job is I work a straight commission position and my income potential is dependent upon the traffic/ volume of people that come into the store each day."
good,A typical day at Nordstrom was greeting my customers with a warm smile and asking if they would like any assistance in finding items they were shopping for. I have never had any issues with co-workers.
good,"I maintain a very well organized and clean floor so that all the merchandise looks presentable. No matter what project I am working on, I immediately stop to help a customer who has walked onto the floor; customers always come first. Greet everyone who passes by no matter if it is a customer or employee. Make a connection with the customer so that they remember who I am. Also to make them remember the experience they had shopping with me so that they will come back again. Always give a helping hand to a fellow employee when they need it."

good,The name brand Nordstrom is and has been synonnimus with quality and the highest degree of excelence in customer service.Every new employee learns the core value of what it takes to succede as if it were their own company. The support of dedicated management insures the greatest confinfidence to provide not just clothing but a lifestyle.The indevidual and even depaartmental competition is an enjoyable challange.
good,the management is fair and willing to work with you for flexible schedule. option for advancement. co-workers are friendly and helpful
good,"Nordstrom will give you what you put in. I have grown exponentially in the five years I have spent there. The upper management truly believes in promote from with in and gives you the tools that you need to do your job. My co-workers were fantastic. The most challenging part of the job was the lack of communication between all computer systems. Most P&L, scheduling, sales reports, ECT. did not communicate so I wasted a lot of time figuring out my numbers long hand. The most enjoyable part of my job was people development. I trained 12 managers and promoted two internals."
good,I love working for nordstrom and the only bad thing Id have to say is after having a family its hard to have a good work life balance cause your schedule.is always changing and since its commission you never know how much you are going to be paid.
good,fantastic way to learn the company
good,"The summary says it all. Nordstrom is an amazing company to work for. Period. If you have the opportunity, definitely take it."
good,I really enjoyed my time with this company. Kind of wish I would have stayed!
good,Great place to grow with the company. They really care about their employees. They also have great benefits.
good,"I had learned valuable skills while working at nordstrom, but one stood out amongst the other skills and that is people skill. Every businesses are searching for this type of skill. That is because any type of business deals with people. People you are working with, and doing business with. We are in a people business world no matter what business are selling or doing. It is the person infront that makes the difference and that is nordtrom."
good,"Loved company"
good,"High energy and great work atmosphere. I learned how to communicate with customers and co-workers more efficiently for better results. Great networking place.  Innovating management with an ""open door"" policy."
good,The company is a great place to work at for people who want to be flexible with schedule and not feel pressured. I recommend this company for anyone that want to grow in retail.
good,"I loved my job at Nordstrom, I learned a lot from my coworkers since I was new to designer retail. I had great customers and had great customer relationships. The hardest part of the job was staying on top of  commission. Some days you might not make your goal so the next day you want to be better. Overall, I loved working for Nordstrom and would go back if they had one where I lived now."
good,I would say be open to multitasking. The work environment is fun and lighthearted but it does tend to get busy in the winter season and occasionally throughout the seasons.
good,"I enjoyed working at Nordstrom. "
good,"I cannot say anything bad about my experience working here.  It was the unfortunate work/life balance that comes with managing in retail (bc of not having a set schedule and constant holidays, nights and weekends) that caught up to me as well as over exhaustion from outside factors.  I really loved serving my employees and my customers.  I always enjoyed being at work."
good,It was faced paced the store I worked at. Management could be better. The hardest part of the job was rude customers. The most enjoyable part were my co-workers in my department.
good,Everyone is more than willing to help you out when it is needed. Everyone is super nice despite the busyness of the environment around you. My dad has worked for the company for over 20 years.
good,"I found the self directed day was an excellent was great. There are tasks to be competed when able. Customers always first, my favorite part was 1hr lunches. This is a very open , non judgemental company, and they really are like a family. Management are wonderful people and very approachable. I have done retail for 40 yrs and this was my favorite work experience. The hardest part was that I had a seasonal position and my last day was Dec 26th."
good,Great people. Fantastic culture with teammates and leaders providing a supportive environment. Managemment is very approachable and responsive to my conerns.
good,A typical work day is easy going. There are challanges that you will over come and get used to as your time there continues. Most enjoyable part is watching the product you prepare for the customers be put out there and sold to them. Knowing how everything works.

good,I was trained how to provide wonderful customer service. The management is involved and on the sales floor with employees which builds a team-oriented environment. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers find outfits that made them feel beautiful and bonding with my co-workers.
good,You have a lot of freedom to do what you need to do in order to satisfy the customer. this helps close sales and seem like a reliable sales person. It is fully commission based so the more work ethic usually results in more pay. It is more difficult to sell product you do not have in store but the company pushes online orders. there is much better stuff online.
