bad,"This company will work you like you will never have a life. It's not supposed to be that way, should be illegal and the union should fight this. Long hours and extra days taking away your weekends from your family is the wrong way to go."
bad,You can have 15 years experience but they will hire a relative or friend that has 0 experience for a highest paying job that you made a bid on. The job sucks.
bad,"this company will let frontline managers get away with some very egregious behavior against employees. the company does not care about employees families. for example, if you walking out the door and going to pick your children up from daycare they will stop you if somebody called in and they will try to make you stay and if you don't then you will be assessed point against your attendance"
bad,"If you want a job working 12 hours 6 days a week then this is the place to be. Only care about numbers, can’t request time off, up to 9 points per year takes a year for points to come off. Mandatory over time. No time to spend with families only time for work. If you’re a young person like I am this job isn’t for you and you could find better, I’ve been here 9 months and only had 2 weeks where I had 2 consecutive days off work."
bad,"Lacks good upper management. You have to kiss up or be a yes man to move up ."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Tell you they are big on saftey, thats a lie. Tell you they are family, that is a lie. You dont have a home life because they are always forcing you to work. No days off & mandatory 12 hour days/nights. I repeat STAY AWAY!! STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!!"
bad,"Patron n'a aucune notion de respect, employés tous à ses pieds, ambiance digne d'un enterrement, méfiez vous du patron, il n'y a que son porte monnaie compte pour lui, vous vous êtes un esclave. Il n'aura aucun scrupule à vous viré si vous ne lui ciré pas bien les chaussures"
bad,Amateur hour at its finest. Trashy ghetto felonious employees. Notzee upper management. Slave labor culture. Safety was a joke. Production driven regardless of danger.
bad,"Cuando vas a la entrevista te ofrecen unas cosas y ya estando dentro te las cambian d bonos muy poco lo que te ofrecen y piden muchas cosas para poder ganárselo, además no pagan ya que renuncias y solo te dan largas con tu finiquito en cual queda una semana de tu trabajo"
bad,"Everyone tries to get someone else to do they job. Lazy union people. They put up with certian lazy people everyone else is fired or disciplined. They want you to work overtime all the time and never let you have a life. HUMAN RESOURCES IS A JOKE. They don't know where to send your paycheck and act mad because you don't get direct deposit. Then your check always ends up ""lost"" happened to almost everyone I knew. Sucks when you dont have gas or food but worked a full two weeks and have nothing 😆😂. Some lazy people have it good there. The bosses and supervisorers are jokes and don't know jack about being on the floor and if you ask  for help with certain machines they don't have a clue. There's just untrained people everywhere messing stuff up then they make you fix it even though it had nothing to do with you. Very stupid and frustrating place to work. Would not recommend. Work you like a dog and even with overtime bi weekly you still only make 1200 bucks. Not worth it. Plus other workers take like hour lunches and breaks. So you won't get yours until way late. Then you probably gonna have to stay a double shift doing some hard hard work. Lol"
bad,I hated this place . management is a gang n tries to write up everyone n make examples or people for no reason . as well as talk down to employees....
bad,"I worked for 15 years in the company Utica NY ,bad managers dont care for safety just pushing for production."
bad,"The culture is very selfish, Management is out for themselves and do nothing but point the finger and blame those of us who bust our rumps to be successful. "
bad,its been several years since i worked at international paper. It was by far the worst job i've ever had. Constant harassment from management to work faster and harder. I wouldn't wish it on my enemys
bad,Very un compassionate high insurance costs way to much overtime due to understaffing Constantly. Management is very rude and expect you to do 2 peoples jobs for the price of one. They preach safety but they constantly tell you to Do unsafe things this is why I left the company.
bad,Management treats employees like garbage. Minimum of 72 hours a week. One day off. Don't care if you're sick. Would not recommend this company to my worst enemy.
bad,Don't work here unless you don't want to live your life at work. Tell you last minute if you gotta work 12 hours and a lot of weeks your working 7 days. Management doesn't care about their employees. They rather just run you down and don't care about your health or safety. My advice don't work here
bad,"Hated everyday I worked there! Was so happy when I finally left, I have yet to run into a single person where I was working at that is still working there or enjoyed working there at all."
bad,"This was by far the worst work environment I've ever encountered in my 16 years of working, they do not care for their employees, it's super hot in the summer but they push and push, the converting supervisor makes the schedule for the whole plant and management works the employees down into the ground, you never see your family, all of upper management are pointing the fingers at each other for problems out of fear if the plant manager who threatens everyone job everyday, if you are single and just want to save money, go for it, but if you have any kind of life please, please, please don't go and work for this company. I'm sure the CEO is not aware of the treatment that the employees receive."
bad,Company has a bunch of paper pushers. Management has no regard for employees. You do not receive recognition for your good deeds. The company will not acknowledge you going above and beyond.
bad,"this place is very racist! They do not like African Americans working up there, every manager and supervisor is racist. Horrible place i wouldn’t recommend it to anyone."
bad,"This was an experience that I never wanna go through again. people come to work and get sent home, seems like they hire anyone. Just not a good place to work in my opinion"
bad,"Management is above retribution and the workers are under appreciated. Not a place to work if u have values. Wouldn't recommend to anyone, not even the desperate."
bad,This company is very employee unfriendly. A very good old boy environment. Very dishonest management and leadership. Ridiculous expectations. Highly political environment.
bad,"when I was there it was hot ,people would pass out a lot due to heat ,the managers were not to friendly it was crowded they had their picks of people that they knew not the ones that did the work"
bad,No one cares old equipment unsafe practices unstable scheduling inexperience people not enough man power do not how to schedule vacations favoritism discrimination its a death trap
bad,I won't to get able to see my daughter and work during the day and have time to spend with my family it hurts me alot to not be able to see my wife and daughter
bad,the boss would not take your word over other people word slit of cry babies  some of the employees would talk behind your back some of the employees would say one thing to you and then go do something totally different
bad,"I been working 6-7 days a week 12hrs a day, it breaks your body down and international papers management don't care if your tired, sick, no family life, they just want you to work and make a perfect box, you are just a number their and they will slave drive you until you quit or fall dead,"
bad,"Bad management decisions such as not wanting to fix machines, then they break, and they end up taking holidays away from employees, making them work. Bad environment. Will tell you plant is making $ but it's a lie. Bait and switch, plant is on its last leg.  Only has a few months to turn around or it will be shut down.  New management is bullying and harassing."
bad,THe facility was poorly managed and a threat of closure eliminated one shift and forcing two shifts to work 12 hour shifts. Upper management did not support middle management and rolled over to union petty grievances out of fear.
bad,"it was an alright place to work if people decided to do there jobs, it was easy work and some of the supervisors dont even know how to do there job either"
bad,"I worked at the mill in Vicksburg Ms for several months. They are racist, there's only one female that works on the paper machine side. They DO NOT care about their employees. They are stuck in time. As a laborer your primary job is basically their do boy. If you're black, you don't stand a chance."
bad,"I was scheduled for an interview at 8am with Mya Fulton. I arrived on time. I don’t know when they were actually start the interview, because after they were over an hour late getting started, I left. If this is how they treat their potential employees, I can only imagine how the workers get treated."
bad,"They live for retaliation.. they threaten the employees in just about every meeting. Don't do this, don't say that, every department is pitted against the other. You have to ""validate"" your existence in financial savings to the company 4 times a year. Managers are encouraged to sacrifice safety and ""BUY CHEAP & REUSE"" to save money. Employees can't get the gear they need to do their job.  Management bonuses are based off of savings. They will sacrifice your life for a higher year end bonus. This is a really evil corp that pretends to be one of the best places to work. It's a really sick joke."
bad,"This is the most racist company I have ever seen.  Management choose who advances depending on if you are their drinking buddy."
bad,"Working for this company for 33 1/2 years.was a big mistake .when they told me that I was getting 470.00 a month for my pension,after 33 1/2 years of hard labor..that is how much they care about their employees...who ever wants to make a career with this company....Do NOT DO IT....IT DOES NOT WORTH IT"
bad,Supervisors would push machines and crews to the limit as each shift races to get more production than the previous shift without  thinking about safety.
bad,Somethings just should not be admissable at work. Unsafe environment with rampant clutter
bad,hot warehouse minimum pay this job just overall sucks if u have to necessarily work there try to get a better position than packing
bad,picking loading orders receiving product inventory cleaning using sap and computer for operation
bad,"all the over time you want, management doesnt care about employees, and the union is a joke. if someone calls in be prepared to stay over. forget about holidays off."
bad,does not care about employees.unsafe working environment and terrible management
bad,Plant closed and left many unemployed. Devastated local economy.
bad,Out if all of the plants the one in Bay Minette is the lowest paid and you have to work 60 plus hours just to make a decent living. 
bad,eu aprendi muita coisa trabalando la.
bad,Too many workers not enough work. Leads are rude and immature. Co-workers were lazy and didn't know what they were doing most of the time. They we're willing to learn and leads didn's care to teach them. Leads let the lazy employees be lazy and gave the good workers all the work. The hardest part of the job for me was doing all the work and seeing others doing nothing or wasting gas driving 20 miles at 11 oclock at night to get to work and there is not enough work to do. There was nothing enjoyable about this job.
bad,"dont know what to expect daily from supervisors,very rude when it comes to ur benifet."
bad,"ambiance négative, supérieur très méchants, pour y avoir travailler de nombreuse années je ne recommande pas du tout cette entreprise, ou si vous voulez finir en Burn Out allez-y !"
bad,The pay is the only benefit here. If I was you I would find another place to work they don't respect anyone or care about family! The Saint JOSEPH plant is a joke and really needs a Union or something to look out for the employees rights!! Beware if you decide to join this organization
bad,"Worked there for 20 years. The pay was not terrible. CEO and Leadership was terrible.  Terrible work life balance, Union  Busters, 12 hour shifts with no lunch. Terrible working environment. Unsafe"
bad,Do not hire permanently not constant lay offs be around 2 to 4 weeks at a time not very good with customer service need to hire associates full time with benefits
bad,"Esta empresa se embarcó en un proyecto de transformación industrial que no supo llevar a cabo. Cerro en falso el proyecto invirtiendo el doble de tiempo y x4 en capital, y haciendo un ejercicio desatroso de organización y dirección."
bad,Absolutely the words place I have ever worked. Management does not care about equipment so they really don't care about you. No work life balance. Work seven days a week points system if you call in.
bad,"The plant is incredibly hot and new hires are forced to wear heavy, non-breathing shirts. Only work here if you have no life, you might get forced to stay over aa you walk out to go home. Management is clueless and there is a complete lack of communication from anyone of worth."
bad,One must read between the lines to work here. The stated policy is not the real work policy. Politics and lack of organization rule the day. Dedication to the company over one's family is a requirement. There are no sick days.Miss 8 days in a year and there is an automatic dismissal. There is a lack of readily available specifications on the machinery. This is an unsafe work environment. The heat exceeds 100 degrees on a regular basis with extremely low air quality. This is the nastiest food grade factory I've ever seen. There are spiders and webs everywhere. I have moved on while I still have my health.
bad,Work your tail off for nothing and watch management judge you becasue you miss one day in a year...as you watch them leave early from there shift daily.  Dont work here...go up the road to IHI
bad,"Come here to work if you don't like yourself or you just don't want personal time. We work constantly, 12 hr shifts 6-7 days a week. There is no chance of advancement here. They will talk to you and treat you like a piece of dog poo. Previous plant manager said how management views the employees, ""I could fire any employee, and replace them with a monkey who could do the job better. You all are doing monkeys work."" This place don't care how they treat you. Be warned, steer clear."
bad,Upper management doesn’t care about subordinates happiness or concerns.Middle management doesn’t feel secure and are always paranoid about if they are going to get let go.very uncomfortable environment.
bad,It’s a bunch of criticism involved you have to be kissing up to the super visors if they don’t like you your gonna get plotted out of the company.....
bad,"If you have a strong work ethic, like to succeed, and hate pay raises; this is the job for you! Worked long hours for the company, and I was eager to learn. The manager always ""promised"" the increased pay, but he never followed through with it. They're big on safety, and making sure everyone is properly certified, but if it saves them money, they'll let anyone do the job."
bad,"My work ethic was always under fire as it was not geared toward QUANTITY. It was geared toward customer needs and expectations being met.  As long as I went along with what other people's decisions were, I was considered a team player.  When I stood up for what was right, I was uncooperative. Was misled from the beginning, as were others. Uncomfortable decision making needs. I have no positives nor do I want to explain my views. They are mine."
bad,If looking for a place to make money and be treated like a slave....then this would be the place. The management have no concern for the employees and will throw them under the bus to save themselves.
bad,"Stressful, behind on workload, understaffed, better workers are forced to work harder to cover for the less skilled, newer coworkers.  Management is inexperienced and is known to make major decisions based on  incomplete information"
bad,I worked there for a short period of time. Wasn't trained properly coworker tell on you over the radio because supervisor can hear everything being said! It probably wouldn't be a bad job if you don’t get hired in as a stacker! Worst job in da place! You do the work of 3 people! The only job that's like that!
bad,"Due to it's southern headquarters culture, there is little to no advancement without paying politics.  Overpaid management and lack of recognition for those who actually do the work."
bad,"I was an i/e tech for them and I felt like I was constantly looking over my shoulder. If you weren't part of the ""click"" you would be singled out very quickly! They preach safety yet there were 2 fatalities in my last 2 years with this company and they are very good at covering things up!"
bad,Need a better staff company.I don't know if there has been improvement with it.I would suggest a better agency tho.I can count on my hands how many times my personal items had been stolen.
bad,Was once a good place to work. Not anymore. Cant keep employees despite good pay. Management does not abide by union contract. Hourly and lower management generally good people.
bad,Not enough time off for family they work everyone to the point of physical and mental health exhaust. They don't care about the employees only about making goals.
bad,There is so much animosity in this maintenance department like you never saw before.  Management doesn't want to give you advancement so don't waste your time or you'll be there for 5 or more years and then still not get just top mechanic rate. Hazleton maintenance department won't be for you trust me!
bad,"Our management team has no backbone to enforce the rules and regulations of the Company. The attitude of half the work force is poor, causing low morale for the entire work force, and the Union is weak to put it nicely. I would not recommend working at I.P. to my worst enemy!!"
bad,Managements on your tail for things that are out of human control! Yes its building boxes but god for bid if your machine breaks or something crazy! They work you like.dogs and treat you like your a number not a person
bad,"Kiss your weekends goodbye! They don't care about their employees and if you know any better you better not make any plans to do anything else , but clock in for work."
bad,A poorly managed company that is prevalent with systemic nepotism. It is a good company for the short term but it is an aging industry. There is a lack of cognitive diversity.
bad,"Unprofessional, very clickish, managers are not trained nor supported by the company, poor training, poor parts support, team work isn't supported long hours,"
bad,Older white people run this company. They are extreme racist. I’ve gotten call out my name on several occasions and the company applaud this type of  racist behavior. If you complain they will find away to defend the kkk and get rid of you. I’m pretty sure they are happy Trump is in office.
bad,"""MAINTENANCE!! MAINTENANCE!!""  If you like to hear this in your ear from the time you walk in the door to the time you leave, 12 + hours later, this is the place for you.  Maintenace Electrician?  no such thing, You will be a Maintenance guy, required to do all, and also Electrical.  The compensation is inadequate for all the work you will have to do here.  The safety policies are rediculous, and excessive. However, if you do not do all the safety as required, you will find yourself without a job rather quickly. The facility is totally rundown, everything has been juryrigged, conveyors are all broken down, and falling appart.  At least you will have job security fixing everything. Work culture is as follows... Everyone is looking for things wrong with the machinery so they can call ""MAINTENANCE MAINTENANCE!!"" and then go for a long break. If I could assign negative stars on this rewiew I would.  I wouldn't wish this job on my worst enemy."
bad,"Treat you like slaves, everone is angry, and job scared."
bad,Good work....good coworkers....good frontline supervisors......horrible upper management.....way too overboard about safety.......will fire you for forgetting the slightest thing
bad,Always felt like a small fish in a huge pond. Too big of a company. Leadership structure is not very good. Virtually no guidance what expectations were. GET MORE ACCOUNTS.
bad,Dependiendo de un hilo cada dia esperando cuando te van a despedir. Muy mal ambiente de trabajo
bad,IP was an unhappy place to work. Long hours and lots of weekend work was required.  Many employees both hourly and management were unhappy and came to work that way. Call outs and the use of heavy FMLA were a frequent often daily occurrence.  You can forget work life balance. Processes and policies were complicated and burdensome. I was unable to make decision's on your own. The job was not enjoyable or exciting for me.
bad,"The pay and benefits for hourly employees is amazing, but the excitement of the pay and benefits wears off quickly as the 6 and 7 day work weeks drag on with no end in sight. As a probationary employee you will most likely work 12 hour days for the majority of your first 90 days of employment. There is very little room for advancement or for raises. You wont be left with much time to further your education and the supervisory/management positions are few. Being a union plant all wages are within about $1 of each other, ranging from $21-22 an hour. Great place to work if you want steady income, but your work/life balance will suffer. Management seems to be trying to fix the issues, but either their hands are tied from above or they just have no idea how to fix the problem. Due to the high turn over, lack of maintenance on equipment and poor production scheduling/ over scheduling it seems this place will continue to work its employees until they quit. Most of the employees are great to work with, but are burnt out and frustrated with a great majority seeking employment elsewhere. This place also lacks proper training and guidance. Nothing is written down! You learn and will have to remember almost everything by doing it. Take a notebook and ask a lot of questions! Lots of experienced people there, but a lot have chosen to step down because the extra few cents they were making wasn't worth the hassle to them."
bad,just all egos.  they love to use a good employee for the worst and dont give credit to where it belongs. the box industries needs robotic supervision to watch employees and management for honest work ethics and true reviews of employees. they love to lie a lot about employees.
bad,"I was judged on my skin color, not my work ethic. A very difficult place to advance and grow at the Prattville Mill. The workplace environment wasn't intended for a person of color."
bad,Not a great place to work at all.Treatment of employees is horrible unless you are a butt kisser.Hr manager and plant gm are married and make hiring and firing decesions.To me that is very unethical.
bad,"Would not recommend to anyone, company only cares about production.  Management  has the good ol boys club going on. There is a union in place, but all they do is collect dues and not much else.  The management only follows the rules when it benefits the company, seriously look  for work somewhere else or you will be sorry."
bad,you must be in the clique to get anywhere. If you arnt chosen by the group to succeed then they will do everything in their power to hold you back and make your life difficult.
bad,"A IP é uma empresa multinacional norte americana que se instalou no Brasil adquirindo uma empresa local,  o problema é que colocou toda a direção e alta gerência de empresas concorrentes, logo, há a cultura de quem já estava, de quem chegou e está chegando e a da própria IP US, ou seja.... uma bagunça!  As pessoas que chegam formam pequenos grupos, quem vai chegando tenta se encaixar num grupo e os processos ficaram morosos, burocráticos, lentos e com muitos sistemas ao mesmo tempo. "
bad,There was absolutely no communication or respect given to employees.  Jobs were not trained and it was expected that someone new already knew the ins and outs of the workplace.
bad,"The worst job I have ever had! Training stinks, management stinks, only reason half the employees have is a job is because they are in the union. How the supervisor have a job is beyond me,old school factory mentality like 20-30 years ago. When a company pays like they do and they can't keep people that is a huge red flag! Rude,obnoxious employees that would be lucky to work at Walmart if that placed closed. "
bad,"Was cut throat if you was not a family member,when there is 5 people from your bosses family working at one place and all in the shop it's bad,work was not hard."
bad,"Dopo due anni in quest’azienda mal organizzata, posso dire che lo stipendio è soddisfacente ma tutto il resto è uno schifo. Ci sono molti capi che fanno preferenze in particolare nel reparto scatolificio. Di conseguenza i dipendenti “lecchini” vanno avanti ed il resto passano i guai. Inoltre promettono senza poi mantenere ciò che dicono all’inizio. Sono falsi e senza rispetto delle persone che ci tengono verso l’azienda."
bad,I see the new hires failing. We get a day off but the have no training manuals to come into and the nepotism is out of control. We have good people coming to us and we are shunning them due their length  of time on previous jobs and their experience. We know these people are doing them wrong some how but we have to keep our mouths shut and turn our heads and apologise when they leave us.Sad.We lost two more today.
bad,"This is not a company where an attractive female trying to support her family need to work. No control and Cover Ups equal Unemployment. "
bad,basically legalized slavery -- not a good place to work at -- money is okay if you're single -- managers come and go but they are all the same. 12 hours shifts are normal along with weekends.
bad,"I dedicated 25 years of my life trying to support and help lead it to be profitable I open my house to retirement partys for employees and a celebration of life to a coworker. I volunteered countless hrs to many programs like Wellness committee, ERT, Newspaper, Safety steering committee ect... I was doing 4 jobs effectively every day for this company and at the end of 25 years of service they stab me in the back and stole my job !!!!!!!!"
bad,"Worst company ever, too much OT, not enough people. Management has no clue. No safety program, what a joke that was, and no training whatsoever, do not hire on, you will be disappointed."
bad,"hourly pay  below industry standard, plant systems and equipment where very neglected and run down. Morale in  production was very low due to forced overtime. high employee turn over in maintenance and production. pre employment exam was long and did not pertain to the job. overall very dissapointed with the company, did not stay very long."
bad,Unfortunately managed horribly Always have to watch  your back.I wish I could give 0 stars for job work/ life balance If they could work you 24/7 they would. Company cares about nothing except making money.   I worked there 18 years and saw so many people come in with such a great can do attitude and then  saw how the company broke all of them.
bad,"Be prepared to work over everyday, every weekend, no holidays unless you use vacation time and that's only if you have enough seniority to be able to use it.  Poor management, terrible benefits, and lowest pay in industry."
bad,It was not really a good place to work because they had the workers doing so much for so little. I did not really get alone with other individuals the workplace was a mess.
bad,The employees will help you all they can but management has issues
bad,"Never enough work for the employees, someone is always being sent home due to over staffing."
bad,"management is very poor, they cant hire good help, they tell people what they wanna hear to their employees, they bend the rules all the time, and they do not care about the employees,ita all about money"
bad,"Work hours are long.  The working environment is very dirty and dangerous.   Family isn't a priority at International Paper.  Word is its going out of business.  Jobs are being transferred to other mills.  Then eventually,  overseas."
bad,This company doesn't care about their people at all. Management sucks from top to bottom. Except one person who I believe would do anything to help you if it was left up to him but the rest of the mgmt team ain't worth 2 dead flies smashed together (period)
bad,I hate this job. Only thing is good money. They are racist to black people and women. They absolutely only care about the people who stay upfront kissing butt. Its worse than high school. So much drama and gossip constantly going on. This is the worst place to ever work for.
bad,I thought IP was a really great opportunity but I learned within my first week there's a reason the turnover is so high. They have the employees train you but the work is so fast paced that you're expected to just pick it up by shadowing because keeping the machine running is priority. It's very stressful and after I left for another job opportunity I found out everyone hired on with me was let go. Good pay but not worth the stress and uncertainty. Would not recommend.
bad,They are union but the union and the company contradict each other so nothing ever gets solved. Mate relief is why people leave. If your guy doesn’t come in that a extra 4 hours so don’t plan anything.
bad,"There are few things that come before family, this place wanted you to give that quality time up, to make the business demands, all the while, machines never kept up for maintenance, always on overtime, yet upper management was never required to be part of that."
bad,"The pay is great for the work they want, but the hours are outrageous for most. The management doesnt seem to know what they are doing whatsoever. The amount of overtime they expect you to work is insane. The training is ridiculous meaning there is no good training. Favoritism is very big there, even though they claim it's not."
bad,there was a lot of overtime they pushed you to the limits but never fixed the equipment properly they . It wasnt really pleasant place to work also employeye and mangment turn around is very high.
bad,New people that make mistakes are fired. People that have been there 20 years that make mistakes are wrote up and fired. Depending on the mistake. No Sick time. Forced overtime. Lots of it. High turnover rate. Point system that is set up is very bad. 8 point and fired. Points do not fall off in a calander year. Very high stress. Production quotas. 12 Hour Shift work. No full weekend off.
bad,I really enjoyed the people that I worked with inside the box plant which includes the Maintenance team and the other operators.
bad,"A typical work day was operating and maintaining paper producing machines.  There was something new to learn every day and very challenging.  A lot of troubleshooting to make equipment run correctly. It is based in a small town and everything was done on a friendship basis, not professional.  The hardest part was not being able to spend time with family.  Only allowed one weekend off  in a month.  The  pay was good."
bad,if you have a family and dont care to see them this is the place for you... All upper management care is all about numbers and bonuses. while they spend time with there family on weekends..
bad,"Horrible place to work, treat employees like they are expendable. There no fault system is a joke as well. Put my 2 weeks in due to family issues where I would of lost my job due to the point system. If I tried to work through it. When I was able to come back, they gave me some ridiculous excuse about not bringing IP employees back due to them changing their name to Graphic Packaging."
bad,"Management very misleading, they overbook and work you 7 days a week. Say they are going to give you family time what a joke. Nothing gets fixed right"
bad,"All of the staff was not open to new employees. Their training was bad and extremely brief (one day) then when you do something wrong (which can happen very easily considering you work with very precise measurements and broken equipment), they get mad and make you feel dumb. And no body cut their own weight over there."
bad,"Worked as temp. Zero to no training provided. You provide your own safety equipment like steel toe boots, goggles and earplugs. You are expected to know what the company policy is when they do not explain it to you. No proper training and instructions provided to you when you start work. You have to work basically almost everyday. Seniority is everything, and you are expected to work overtime if someone did not come in for their shift."
bad,"Modern Day Slavery!! Run Away!! 2 15 minute breaks with an extremely high workload. If you in shipping or corrugated side good luck!! EVERY machine has a problem. Begging maintenance for repair help. Management is a joke. Plenty OT, will not have a life or be there for your kids. Rotating shifts doesn’t make it any better body will never get adjusted. A bunch of shady employees and managers. STAY TO YOURSELF!"
bad,"I applied for a forklift position through a temp agency. Got hired and a month later they took the job from me and gave me a choice of either quitting or take the new position they give me. I took the position so I wouldn’t feel like it was a total waste of time but I expressed to them the importance of me being properly trained on things they saw as critical. Long story short, they only hire people to relieve their “core” employees and every temp that comes in in improperly trained or scheduled until they point out from attendance. Very unprofessional company."
bad,Look else where! You will be disappointed depending on the department you work in. IP has some great aspects but overall disappointing lots of in fighting and finger pointing.  No employee comradery what so ever.
bad,Poor Management and Very Raciest Supervisor. Supervisor was previously fired for calling someone the N word and was hired right back. I wouldn’t advise no one to work for this company. The favoritism is very real.
bad,"Front line supervisors do not care about the employee as a person. They care about disciplining people, though. I've never heard anybody say thank you or good job in the last 2 years here. "
bad,This is favorite at its best I got fired for the same reason they brought a person back. All rules should aply for all but the manager has his favorites. The cleaning lady especilly.
bad,Worst job I ever had. This place is not for a woman. They will harass you and talk down to you. I do not recommend this place. I thought this would be a great place to work but I was disappointed. Worked a full night shift they came and got me that morning and said that they were letting me go.
bad,Very stressful you never know what mood the management is going to be in and if you are the target for the day that they are going to take it out on. Hard to do your job when you are waiting to see the mood of the management.
bad,international paper treats the employees as a number you are only as good as your last day worked they look for reasons to make you look bad instead of trying to help
bad,"Management has changed  alot, turn over rate is high, no employee is happy, its a great place to work if you dont want to see your family. 6 days a week is normal , 12 hour days are normal"
bad,"International Paper Richmond VA location is in dire need of new management. Employees are worn out and beat up over the long hours, demanding workload, upset conditions which could easily be resolved with the proper management. New hires come and go so fast by the time you learn their names they either have quit or pointed out on our unforgiving point system. The overall condition of the plant matches the demeanor of the worn out employees, even the machines are tired."
bad,"Don't work for IP if you have a family. You will never see because you work 8, 12, or 16 hours at a time and rotating shifts. You could work a double anytime."
bad,12 hour days 6 to 7 days a week .. If you have a family or a life this place is not for you... GREED!  DONT CARE ABOUT EMPLOYEES..
bad,"every day here starts at 3:00, either a.m. or p.m. always 12 hours rotating shifts. The management is unappreciative of the hard  work and sacrifices these people make to get their job done. I have been very fortunate to have had many opportunities to learn about mechanics, hydraulics, electric, and much more as time goes. The only really bad thing about working here is that the have no respect for their employees as a person. Many of them are married and have children but the schedule the employees are expected to keep they hardly see them. I guess it is the old adage ""We should work to live, not live to work"". My coworkers are the hardest working people you will ever meet. the best thing at International Paper is the viable experience I have gained there."
bad,it was a ok job to me but it was too much drama and hating going on at that job.
bad,"Good place to work.. takes time to learn the job.. they have newer employees train new hires which doesn’t make sense.."
bad,No personal growth. Management does not listen to suggestions for the reliability of integrity programs improvement. Workplace culture is not good for educated people. No rewards or any appreciation for whatever good work you do for the company.
bad,Company preaches safety safety safety all while forcing maintenance to work 16 hrs a day 4 or 5 days a week and 12 hrs all other. One weekend off a month to spend with your family you know if your family is going to be in bed with you because on your days off you doing nothing but resting. Sure you can make $ 140.000.00 grand a year there as a Millwright but you are going to live there. For real. I know guys that shower there after work and sleep in parking lot because its just that important to get all the sleep you can instead of drive time to and from that location that your family sleeps at.You know... Their home. NOT your home. Your home will be International Paper.
bad,"The place is run on the whims of a MADMAN. A lot of things are done on knee jerk reactions. Nothing is ever planned until the day it happens, they never do the things they talk about and the things they have done never get discussed ahead of time. YOU can get fired for someone else not showing up for work. A bunch of favoritism goes on inside different departments"
bad,Unsafe and know care for human life. They donot appreciate there employees at all. Favorites with friends advance. Positions constantly cycle around. Not friendly at all.
bad,"The company overall is ok. Management was ok for most part. Pay and healthcare are reasonable. The training was a joke from the very beginning. Toxic work environment !! If you like being harassed, insulted, and bullied then this is the job for you. Good luck."
bad,I originally worked for Weyerhaeuser and my plant was bought out by Ip and it’s been an absolute nightmare since it was taken over. It’s a good paying job but that’s it.
bad,"Was hired in as a temp, told 6 months to one year and would be hired on a an IP employee. That time came and gone, it actually doubled with no word of when or if the temps would even get hired. Management continually said it was being worked on, none of us felt that was true. We were not told we would have to re-interview for the position we had been doing so for the past two years or more. We had no sick, vacation, holiday, nor benefits. They gave temps more and more work, while there was full time employees doing nothing."
bad,If u plan on working at IP plan on a 6 day a week job that is a dead end! After you work here for a month you will see why their stock is in the toilet.
bad,"IP pretends to care about its employees , its call in policies are a joke and aren't very flexible when you need time off , it is also incredibly hot in the building"
bad,The pay is great especially for the area. You work 12hr shift Monday to Saturday and they will move your schedule so many times. No work life balance at all and the manager lacks common sense. Poor managing facility
bad,"ho lavorato presso lo stabilimento di Pomezia e ho trovato un ambiente di lavoro pessimo: da subito non mi hanno accettato perché non ero del posto e hanno fatto in modo di allontanarmi."
bad,"Worked too many hours to plan anything else. Insufficient training by co-workers with no patience and nasty negative attitudes. Co-workers who talk about others behind their back and very unfriendly. If they have been there for a long period of time, they act as though they run the place.Everyday had a negative and stressful impact on me. primarily co-workers with their nasty, unfriendly attitude. Not worth the pay."
bad,"I worked 12 hour days. 3 days on, 2 days off then 2 days on and 3 days off. I was packing lids, cleaning up my area, making boxes and creating labels. I was continuously moved to new areas. There are a lot of mandatory safety meetings. Overall, this was not a bad place to work. But, the people there are very unfriendly and competitive. I had to leave because my medical issues prevented me from working and the service they use for FMLA did not accept my Dr's notices of absences."
bad,I liked working in the corrugated industry. I was putting in long hours working 7days a week. Doing what I could for the company and the improvement of the plant. Just felt like it was never enough and it was never good enough.
bad,"Prepare for the worse on any given day there.  You just do not know what you're walking into each and everyday.  I've learned so much while there about the company and the people there.  My opinion, management is a joke not going further with that.  The workplace could be great but you have way too many Union Camp holdovers. The Union Camp holdovers are still carrying historical traits from the past.  They are bringing this company down in a negative way.  The hardest part of this job is not being prepared for whatever negative situation hit you without you knowing.  This job do not want you having a life beyond the company.  If they could they would have you living there 24/7.  Everything sound good and look good when you're in orientation. But once you're in the plant and start working there for awhile, everything they teach in thrown out the window.  The only good thing about this company is the compensation/benenfits and that's it.  Again this company live in the past............"
bad,Es una empresa a nivel mundial pero localmente no tiene los mismos beneficios que en otros paises ni el apoyo para capacitar a los trabajadores pero en general es una muy buena empresa.
bad,Management was horrible. Supervisor didn't know job functions of the departmnet and wouldn't take complaints serious. Other employees were allowed to make decisions for new hires and temp to hire employee's. Turn over rate for customer service department was unreal. Work was easy but training was not properly provided. The rate of pay was good but not worth all the drama that was allowed to take place in a business office.
bad,You basically have no life the pay is good but the work-life stuff does not work out you're expected to be at work all the time you very rarely get weekends off if somebody doesn't show up for work on your next shift you have to stay the four hours if someone takes vacation you have to cover half their hours that they work
bad,"Prepare to get thrown to the wolves. It’s an extremely Hot place to work in. You have to drink plenty of water. The trainer I had, had very poor communication skills.. Attitudes are not the best. Pay and benefits are great. They take safety very serious which was a plus for me. Personally it’s not the job that I thought it would be. There is potential to move up within the company which is good. You have to put numbers and dates on Dye plates, sometime wash them. And have rotary dyes and ink ready for the machine operator. Orders changes constantly so you have to be very alert and aware of that at all times. They’re training people on first shift for 3weeks, then they place the person on 2nd permanently... Which sucks......"
bad,International Paper has great pay & benefits.  There are too many hours per week expected of you.  The atmosphere between the management & hourly employees is very bad.  Inside the plant is also very very hot.
bad,IP bought TempleInland and my position was eliminated. Different culture than privious employers
bad,Good pay. Bad management work 12hr shifts 6 and 7 days a week. They want production when machines are old and wore out need to be fixed but they won't fix nothing just a band aid on things
bad,Accountable  for other people's mistake.Supervisors very rude at times and show favoritism. Needs better trading put in place for people to advance. Safety is excellent  at this company job is very dangerous.
bad,"Went for an interview & sat with 3 managers. Was told I would find back by the end of the week (either way) if I got the job. I heard nothing for an entire week. Sent an email to the recruiter and the manager, totally ignored."
bad,"If you’re not apart of the buddy buddy system then you don’t stand a chance working at international Paper, you work 6-7 days a week, no vacation days until after your first year then after that it’s only 5 days everybody is always telling on everybody it’s a very stressful place to work and you have to worry about if you’ll have a job to return to on a daily basis, I would not recommend working there unless you’re good at kissing butt..."
bad,Management are idiots. They didnt want to spend money to renovate the facility. Didnt care for employee feedback. Dont work here
bad,Work you very hard. Be prepared to work every Saturday.  Extremely hot in the summer. Management sucks.  Extremely noises. Layoffs occur occasionally when production slows down.
bad,"The money as well as the benefits are great.  When you actually have to miss your kids growing up and your wife leaves you because she never sees you.  They don't give a rats butt as long as that paper is going.  It is mandatory for us to stay on over time even when your already fatigued. If no one comes to cover your shift you have to stay 16 hours which usually im fatigued after 12 hours, and on the verge passing out. they say safety but what is safe about a man who can hardly keep his eyes open especially if he is a decent worker even with plenty of rest the night before. Some of the management are completely rude and only speak when they wont to address their authority by treating and talking to good respectful workers like a dog.  Maintenance never really has to do any thing we usually have to fix things ourselves.  If we cant fix it then they call maintenance.  One of the shift managers even told me that maintenance had it way easier than we did. when they are out there 20 of them are watching and 5 are \working. A team is an environment where everyone works together there is no i in team.  I believe that things would run smoother if the worker were happier"
bad,We worked in pairs . A typical day was changing pumps and alingment . I worked with some of the most knowledgeable mechanics around.
bad,"Go in and pack cups for 12 hours and when machines back up and cups fall all over the floor they are to be picked up and packed anyway. Working at IP you are just a number and nothing else. Management were demanding and not understanding. Most people hated their jobs, but stayed because it supported their families. Dealing with unreasonable people who wouldn't do the jobs assigned to them. Best part of this job is clocking out. I can not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"Don't waist your time unless you know someone whom is already working there.  Pay is only good after 90 days; that is ""worked days"" not calender count days.  Upper management continues to hire one or two people every 4 months = not a good sign. If you don't already know someone employed then run away; They might give you an interveiw after passing writen test but pick someone with no forklift certificate even though you have one... major favorites and too many clicks/family conections!"
bad,"helping to run different presses to make boxes.  I learned how corrugated boxes are made from start to finish.  Most of my co-workers were very nice. The hardest part was working 12 hour shifts, 6-7 days a week in the extreme heat."
bad,Not enough work or hours. A lot of favoritism. Horrible working conditions. Need better management. No progression. Lack of workers. Unfair  treatment of workers.
bad,Co-workers were very rude and disrespectful. I did not feel appreciated in my role and when I would take a vacation my work was minimally completed. Which would created major back log and disservice to my customers.
bad,Co-workers are not allowed to talk to one another.  Management is to hard on employees.  No room for error.  No flexibility.  Everything must be perfect.  Human Resources department is not very helpful or supportive of employee needs.
bad,"Some supervisors will make your life Miserable  and talk to you like you’re a toddler, others will guide you in the right direction to stay positive and stay productive. Forced OT daily, the guy on the next shift that does your job calls in, you stay an extra four hours to cover for him. That is a requirement. Poor scheduling as far as manpower and materials as well. Coworkers are alright but anyone in a leadership position is questionable, the plants are union so atleast you have someone in your corner."
bad,Ok company just wasn’t enough work hrs or time to accumulate management poor no tranning no education knowledge of the job or discription but good job to have if you don’t have one at all
bad,Just a job not a career. Old company with old out dated policies and procedures. They are all about safety which is always nice but doesn't make up for the lack of desire to become a better company.
bad,the other workers do not teach or the company does not train at all. it is a very dangerous work place and very noisiness.  it a lot of heavy lifting and a fast pace.
bad,The worse management I have ever experience! Yelling and screaming and threatening was a daily occurrence. I tried my best to stick in there and work as hard and as smart as I could but it was never good enough.
bad,The labor to maintain mill operation and upkeep is essentially contracted out. You are assigned a piece of equipment to operate and notify of any problems to equipment before and during operation.
bad,The union runs the show and are in bed with the company.  You are expected to be your own boss without real leadership.  For the most part it is only as safe as you are.  It is very easy to get hurt there.
bad,"okay company for first job, but after a few months you will start to notice all the bad within the company, they care about pushing product out of the door rather then really focus on the backbone of the company which is the employees."
bad,The work place is a very fun place to work . My co-workers are team players.the mangement is great. The hards part of the job is when new hire comes in & don't want to work that when yiou have to pull their weight.
bad,"They will use you then lay you off in a heartbeat. Absolutely no job security whatsoever. Management is clueless. Most people there are kind of ""shady"". If you need some quick cash for a few weeks, then go for it. If you're looking for something stable, run."
bad,Production problems from the top to the bottom. No accountability. Don't see how this company stays in business. Mistakes mistakes mistakes nobody checks product before it is run. One job ran for two days and two nights before somebody found out it was being run with mistakes. Nobody was held accountable not the operators who ran it who ran the job
bad,Sounds grest till you get there. There is no advancement. You have no home life. Union does not fight for you. Management is always hiding ( literally) trying to catch you doing something to fire you.
bad,Per lavorare bisogna essere raccomandati per loro non conta l'esperienza.
bad,"Lavoro da  interinale, senza raccomandazione non ti fanno lavorare. Scelgono loro chi fare lavorare anche gente senza esperienza pero' essere raccomandati e' la priorita'."
bad,"Poor work/life balance, Managers don't seem to care about the workload. If they see that you can do it, they will consider that the rule and not the exception...even when they KNOW that more people are needed. International Paper is NOT a pay for performance company...let me repeat that...NOT a pay for performance company. Getting a paycheck once a month is a pain."
bad,que le falta mas oportunidad de decisión propia y que no se enfoquen solo al proceso
bad,"It could be great, but the people make it bad, having the right management always works great for a company but that's hard to find. This job will keep you away from your family, so it's up to you. You will get your bills paid though."
bad,"International Paper took over Champion when I was working there. I had a chance to stay on, but the culture was so different.  Little focus on people development."
bad,HR Manager in Georgetown SC Mill works 12 hours a day and expects the same. She makes ALL decisions so no autonomy.  Horrible to work for. If you want all your decisions made by someone else then please work there.
bad,"Working here is challenging at times due to poor planning causing delays,  long hours and weeks. Often they are understaffed for long periods of time."
bad,its very hot and unorganized. they will have you doing more work then you intended on doing for little pay. the managers and coworkers are unprofessional as well.
bad,"Didn't seem that bad of a place to work, employees for the most part were good to work with. Having said that there is a fair share of bad apples here who because are part of the union are protected."
bad,"Overall good people on the floor, but management leaves something to be desired. Machines are hanging on by threads. More down time and waste then needed for a multi billion dollar company."
bad,"what more can I say this job, this company absolutely sucks! they sell you empty dreams and false promises, they can give 2 cents about your life, or your family, they may act like they care in the beginning, but believe me they don't, stay far away from them"
bad,This wasn't a good work place. There was a lot of lifting using your back most of the time. The equipment was very unsafe to work around.
bad,"they push their people beyond what is asked of them. their are days where maintenance doesnt even get breaks.  supervision is poor, the maintenance supervisor has favorites and really abuses others and talks down to them"
bad,In at 7 out at 7. nothing exciting here and management was never around or seemed to care that much abt employees.
bad,Very hostile work atmosphere.Not a professional or moral value standards.Discrimination isuues.of gender as well as position in plant.Have a absentism point system based on union policy;but not union.No team players.
bad,Working here has taught me patience and working cooperatively. The days are long and the breaks are short. Great people to work with. The hardest part of the day is being backed up with orders that can't be filled in a timely manner due to lack of product. Thats why I choose to order product before they run out. The best part of the job is the people. Great people there.
bad,Working 6 out of 7 days of the week with no time off for family and no understanding on helping with their issues on the problems and productivity. The more you produce the more they expect from you. Unsafe working conditions are over looked and working with the seven plant manger
bad,It’s not a bad company for ppl wanting to work at home. For people with bigger goals it’s not good.anyone wanting to work there you’ll do the same thing day in and day out
bad,Management is a joke. They really don't care about you or your family. They don't care if your safe. All they care about is profit. Don't get hurt because it will be your fault no matter what. And they will find a way to fire you for it.
bad,I took this job because it was significantly more money than I had been making in a previous position. I was hired based on previous experience with a wide array of instrumental analysis equipment however when I started I soon realized I would not be using any of the equipment I had previous experience in. In addition to this the training was laughable and employee development was non existent. When it became apparent I was not going to grow or learn anything new and my coworkers were at least 3 decades older than me and would not share knowledge--although to be fair after observing many of their lab practices it was easy to conclude that none of them had really mastered any of the tests and instrumentation either--I was terrified. I was paid well however there was very limited opportunities to move forward and I became depressed and bored. I'm still relieved I don't work there anymore.
bad,"Be prepared to work 12 hours shifts, 6/13 day work weeks with only one day off in between all year long. The pay is decent, but at a huge sacrifice of family time. The summer months are extremely hot, comparable to that of a hot car or garage during the extreme heat. Hourly employees are treated like second class citizens. Being a non union plant, management abuses their authority using intimidation and scare tactics to motivate."
bad,This was a decent job with good benefits. People who work there are excellent and you really build relationship easily. The facilities are a little rough though when its hot and cold
bad,"Southern swing position in an environment most people would consider to be hostile to human life. There were programs and training that was offered but never followed through with management. More lip service than anything else or a ""nice to do""."
bad,"A typical day at work went like this the machine breaks down as soon as you start your shift, you call maintenance they have a attitude because management cussed them out and the supervisors out literally in a meeting so now you got them mad also, that energy is passed down to the employees now everybody is has a attitude. you ask the supervisor a question, they never know so you go ask management they lie to you. Thats everyday.  You can only move up in your line of progression until you stuck in a dead end job. They will schedule Saturday and Sunday on Thursday so now you cant make plans for you, then Saturday come they tell you ""oh we just working four hours"" or call you out or u work Saturday on 3rd shift get off Sunday at 7am then call you out at 10pm Sunday night when the whole time they know if they need you that Saturday night. SMH"
bad,There's no place to grow within the company unless you have a college degree and the management us filled with people who have no idea how to perform the job they are managing. They pay is decent but other places pay more. The company is good to get experience at and then move on to a better place.
bad,"Pro's: Union shop. Good pay & benefits. Safety awareness culture comforting, but practically grinds everything to a halt. "
bad,"Before I was transferred here, I loved my job at the other mill. In the role I have now, I am expected to do the work of a front line leader without the equivalent pay and without having any authority over the team members. It is a very stressful and frustrating job."
bad,they want you to work all of the time. no respect for the employee but they want all of your respect. pay and benefits are good. I am in maintenance and they never have the parts you need to fix the problems correctly but complain when it is rigged to run.
bad,"It's a very rough working environment. Always hot and very loud. Does not cool down in the winter either. Also very demanding, always busy doing something which was pretty nice."
bad,Zero tolerance policy.  You get hurt. And your fired. Your not treated well as a production employee. No respect from management.  Just keep increasing the production.  Don't care about the little guy. Or your life outside of the plant. They try to get rid of senior employees.  So as not to pay so many benefits you worked for.
bad,"Terrible company to work for, with poor upper management, and no time for your life.  No sick days given, you have to work there for 20 years just to get 4 weeks of vacation pay.  Old equipment, a lot of technical issues with the equipment which creates upset conditions."
bad,"I don't hate IP, I H(ELL) HATE IP. If you like long hours, never seeing your family, working with A$$$$ Holes and back stabbers then this is the place for you. The first day I was there I knew I didn't want to be there. The bad thing is, there is nothing else in Georgetown to do. IP is the top. They hire the laziest people I've ever seen. If they don't want to do their job, the oncoming person will have to do it. You cant get fired because of the union which is junk to begin with. Its an all around negative job. Nothing good. NOTHING."
bad,"I worked at the Tolleson Box Plant for two years before I just couldn't do it anymore, I worked in maintenance, your shifts are seven consecutive days but you only get paid straight time because they start your shifts in the middle of a pay period so you only get forty hours. You seldom get the holidays off and the department is a very cronyism based group. The culture is toxic and it's just not a good place to work unless you enjoy super hot summers in a building and very few chances to advance. The floor/production people are great, 1st and 3rd shift leads and supervisors are great."
bad,This company cares nothing for the individual worker just the number of boxes it produces. Employees are forced to work 12 hour days as well as almost all weekends to cover ill or vacationing senior employees. Extremely strict attendance policy and NO sick days. Many employees abuse FMLA to get days off.
bad,Cultura de trabalho e forma de gerir muito incompatível com o meu conceito.
bad,"Customer oriented ,consumer driven. Consistently working on Quality"
bad,"12 hour shifts, nights, not much room to get onto Day shift, hot, noisy, management is always looking for something wrong never something you're doing right, would rather fire anyone for anything at anytime, 1 week vacation after one year, and you HAVE to take it all at once, cant spread it out. Sick days are few and last a year from each day used."
bad,"The money is the only thing good with this place! This location has bad morale. If you are on a machine you work swing shift. If your relief calls out, you are required to stay. When too many people are on vacation or medical leave, you will have 12 hr days constantly. They care nothing about their employees. The rules change on a daily basis."
bad,"Woman move up in the company faster. Since they can spread their legs further. "
bad,"Management is useless.  The good ole' boys phallus sucking club.  You'd get more from a monkey.  Seriously.  Certain jobs could be ran on different machines to speed up production and keep the floor from falling behind on orders.  Management oblivious to this fact.  "
bad,Lots of immoral things take place there. You're just a number not a person. Advancement depends upon if you're in the right click. Seniority does not count for any part of your job. But it's a job.
bad,"I worked on third shift for 5 years and then the moved me to 2cd shift for 2.5 years and I was supposed to go to 1st shift after a year but the kept me on second and put a new employee on first the said they were looking for someone to take my shift before they could move me but it never happened. They wanted me on 2cd shift because I never called 1st shift in for help and even if I did the lead man never answers his phone for emergency. If they dont like you the world try and write you up for any mistake but if 1st shift did it they never got written upon guy on 1st had 3 safety violations and never got fired and I told the maintenance supervisor if that was me you would fire me and he said yes. Supervisors think they can do whatever they want and not get in trouble for it. I will never work there again. Since I left 4 maintenance employees have left and for a pay reduction they just wanted out of there. If you ask for a day off they wont approve it. The last 2 years I was there I think the plant only took 6 weekends off you work 6 days a week and 12 hours days and everytime we got a raise the union took it and you paid the taxes on it you can make 3,800.00 in 2 weeks and only bring home 1900 of it after  50 hours you basically work for free and you work like 60hrs a week. You make 80 to 90k a year and only bring home 50k it's not worth it because you still owe at the end of the year"
bad,"International Paper warehouse is fun place to work, but it's also very stressful place, because of the twelve hours working schuled and ten minutes lunch time."
bad,Working with my friends at work was less stressful but managment is a different story work to many 7days aweek for no reason and everything tear up in the plant
bad,fue una buena empresa pero no da nada de proyeccion profesional y a la larga eso la hace mala
bad,Good place for a specific type of person. Long hours due to a lack a appropriate training method with new hires.  But it you stick it out and enjoy living at wotk for 68 plus hours a week.  Then I would recommend putting in an application.
bad,"Sometimes work 22 days in a row with one day off."
bad,"Bad management and no family time, non set schedule, go in everyday to know your schedule for the next day. Its either u work 8, 10, or 12 hrs usually no weekends off."
bad,"Upper Management positions are a revolving door of ladder climbers, a year or so and they are gone. On to the next one! If you are good at your job you are stuck, if you are poor at it you get promoted to a position were you are not accountable for anything."
bad,"was some time ago that i worked there, but i remember it being very simple. run the machines and go home. wasn't much in terms of quality training, safety culture was terrible, and their maintenance personnel were lacking (minus a couple of them that were quality individuals). management was terrible, probably the worst part about being there. they had tons of questions, no answers, and were completely absent unless things were off, which you were called to their office to address."
bad,Work days are primarily high stress and you MUST be able and willing to deal with these situations. Management of the Company at  a Corporate level is well intended but this hinges greatly on an individuals specific location of employment. At a given location the workplace culture varies greatly dependent on the location's management. The hardest part of the job is the extremely hot temperatures in the summer time and the most enjoyable is when a task is completed.
bad,"The days were long and hot during the summer, management was not very understanding to say the least, people were always looking for someone else to blame, and the honestly the pay is not worth what people go through to work there."
bad,You will make good money working lots of hours but you will hardly see your family. As management is now there is a lot of favoritism and bullying. You also do not want to be a female whatsoever in this warehouse or you face never getting promotions and you'll never work hard enough to be respected.
bad,A typical day at work consisted of a lot of clean up. I had to wash under conveyor belts and the areas around it. I had to shovel wood chips and sawdust for hours at a time. I learned a lot about the paper industry. I learned how to drive a bobcat. The management mostly stayed in their office and didn't really take time out to help. The workplace culture wasn't bad if you got on a shift with good people. The hardest part of the job was not getting proper training. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new people.
bad,"I worked out at IP for 5 years and during that time I heard more negative remarks and poor attitudes from management than I would care to admit. the work isn't too hard, but the environment along with poor air circulation leads to a miserable work environment"
bad,International Paper pays well but doesn't recognize skills that don't fit into their predefined positions. Lots off overtime.
bad,"it's a good paying job lot's of measuring "
bad,"Good people to work with"
bad,The branch I am currently employed at does not consider life outside of the working world.  they force many hours on employees even when they are not needed.  The supervisors manage with their personal feelings rather than business sense.  Overall not a good place to work but it is the only good paying job in our town.
bad,"Was a fun place to work until new manager took over. Had good benefits, Co-workers were great to work with. In 14 years went from bailer operator to back up dispatcher to dispatcher to plant lead. Got rewards for safety each month. New manager kept changing employees hours never knew what shift you would work."
bad,terrible place to work. Nobody speaks English. Extremely hot and management does not care about anything but numbers.
bad,Working for International Papers was a new experience to me. It helps me look more well rounded to be able to do this type of job in the future. I'm cutting open boxes with a box cutter and putting them on built displays. I really enjoyed learning how to build the displays( that you see at your local department stores). I enjoyed interacting with my co. workers and made some good friends.It's hard to work for a company that caters more to Latino/Hispanic needs. They want allow talking and interacting with your co. workers. My opinion is that you must communicate with you co. workers to build a strong team work foundation. I can honestly say I enjoyed meeting new people and interacting with them. I like that it allows me to accomplish one of my goals to want to have a wide range of abilities to do this job in the future.  
bad,It was a good place to work but they sold the company knowing that the new owner was going to shut it down.
bad,The company was very organized. The culture was counter-productive to long-term business success. Printers were a major customer base but printer business was shrinking.
bad,"I would get to work 30 min. Early,Before work to get my paper work ready for the start of the day. I am a flexo operator,there was no one in management that could teach me anything,they came to me for ancers when you have my kind of experience they leave every thing up to you. My asst. operator operates the machine when I'am not there and he makes all most as much as I do. And he has no experience so I have to train a new operator,that takes several years, and i have to do it in a few weeks without any extra help,and it takes two people to run a flexo. It can't be done properly. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting off work,but then you didn't know if you had to work 8,10 or12 hours each day."
bad,"If you are not in above average physical shape I would not even apply all entry jobs are extremely physical constantly, training is almost non existent they throw you in random spots and expect you to figure it out quickly or they will lay you off in first 60 days its very hot lunchs are not paid and expect your shift to change weekly and to stay for double shifts unexpectedly."
bad,"Current management micro style is somewhat overbearing, lack of proper training to be successful in jobs I believe too many pass thru qualifications doesn't fairly give consideration when advancement opportunities"
bad,A very unsafe place to work. Work site upkeep is very poor. A very old plant and it looks like it. Plant needs a lot of TLC. The plant needs a lot of updating.
bad,"One of the worst ,overbearing childish "
bad,"Not the Best place to choose to work,  if you can’t find anything or your background holding you back it’s a starter job but I wouldn’t recommend  it."
bad,"Favoritism is a big factor here. As well as the current plant manager seems to be able to run this plant as he sees fit with no disregard for the union that is in place there. I always felt like ""What do my union dues even go towards?"". I never got the answer to that question.  Job security... nope, I've seen employees let go for reasons that didn't make sense. Every time I was in the office and had a union rep. with me, they never even spoke up in my defense. Maybe it was just me, but I doubt it. Loopholes!!!"
bad,Poor management environment is awful a lot of favoritism low hours the supervisors are somewhat have a bad mood with other people. It’s job I would not reconsider or recommend to anyone hours are awfully easy to low some days you work half a s day some hours are suddenly cut in the middle of the day with no warning
bad,I started out making a good living.A couple of years into it they brought in a general manager who decided to cut overtime. In the meantime we lost customers due to poor service. He ended up getting promoted and they still haven't made any progress.  Management never took a hit in wages and still continue to spend money foolishly.
bad,Management did not do a good job of trying to help people position that were posted. Especially if you would not date him. Glad in the end I didn't receive the job.
bad,"The mill comes first which means you can be placed on the schedule to work on you off days without your knowledge. Your days are 12 - 16 hours, you have to work your position plus anywhere else in the mill which is short. You may be performing jobs which you have never performed before or properly trained to perform."
bad,"The job was good, and paid well. If your young you will not like a shift job, to crazy, and to bust with all the cal ins. Overall the people there are nice."
bad,Plant workers are worked very hard. They work long hours most of the year with not much time off. Union plant. Not much training for new employees. Benefits are good but you don't see your family much.
bad,The Murfreesboro plant talk safety but it's a joke. The once put a fence that prevented the use of a lock out station on the Palletizer what brains. Plus certain areas contain asbestos..and fires on the lines are common.
bad,"I love my job and the people I work with but the management at our facility is horrible. Also, they preach safety but will take risks when it comes to production. Routinely make employees work 10-20 12 hour days in a row and hold them to the same absentee standard as employees that get all their off days. Union leaders make side deals with management and you can rarely get a grievance answered and if you do it will not be a written answer. We have to continuously file the same grievances because our union leadership is pathetic. Top operators have been working their off days for 20 years and the company acts like they weren't aware and it isn't their fault."
bad,"Company does not support educational assistance for graduate degree.  A typical day at work involved at least one crisis, usually due to machine failure."
bad,Work 70+ hours a week in a high fast past work environment. Poor management makes the job difficult. Many workers are leaving with 10+ years of experience.
bad,"IP talks a lot about safety but do nothing about it. Drink alcohol during your lunch break then come back inside and operate a machine. Wear your safety glasses on top of your head....hey man, they're on my body."
bad,The employment was not what I expected with regards to the structure and learning curve  I  was able to incorporate the new format of the work but it was not beneficial for me at this time
bad,1st shift manager would get mad if I asked him how to do something. He would walk over to get the pallet an have an additude about having to show me what to do. So he wasn't a very good boss
bad,"Stay away from this company, no future  here. Upper management has a no care approach, boat loads of overtime but you will get tried out. Harsh working conditions"
bad,"part time job that I needed at the time, close to my home, no one was there when I got there every evening went in did my work and I went home.  wish employees didn't look down on janitors the way they did."
bad,"Pay i's good,  but coworkers and supervisors  are bad."
bad,"leadership was poor, disorganized, and absentminded for the most part. commmunication was poor. almost always worked on weekends and work/family relations were poor. no bonuses for making quotas. recognition for exceptional work was almost non existent. (jimmy johns sandwich)."
bad,It was a normal factory . very fast paced and  shift production was a must. The management lacked insight into what the company needed to stay a float that is why the factory shut down
bad,Was driving for a independent contractor that really Didnt have any work hours and the trucks was not really in good condition dealing with work especially.
bad,"Typical day at work included answering phones, miscellaneous data entry, greeting visitors, maintaining files and reception area."
bad,Processo de avaliação de desemprenho não funciona e pressão por resultados excede limites.
bad,If you work in extruders or warehouse every day is bad. You never see your family your always on 12s and 16hr days. The management is horrible your just a number. They'll work the  out of you every single day. Dont work there its really bad.
bad,A typical day at International Papers was laid back. It was a pleasant environment with very nice people. I learned a lot and sometimes wish I could go back.
bad,Low pay and alot  of work but its a job its for and it not a bus line but you can make the hours if your willing to work  the managers are ok and the diffrent shifts is what make the job ok you have 1st 2nd and 3rd and the pay is based off  the shift you choose
bad,"I'm no stranger to overtime, and I do not fear hard labor, but that was by far the most unstable job I've ever had when considering job security and professionalism."
bad,"Great stable company, but we were acquired by International Paper so the corporate office was closed in Austin, Texas abruptly in 2013"
bad,the management is well in a I cant till the besides then you are.. see? besides...I need to have 20 words
bad,"Management is unorganized they make last minute changes to work schedule and work responsibility they do not have a set of job guide lines they go buy, so they some times single people out and require more job duties from some individuals but not from others with the same job title and pay they work their salary supervisors long hrs some times 14 to 16 hrs they require their skilled labor employs to do jobs that are not related to their skill for instants their maintenance technicians number 2 priority in the plant is to treat the plants waste water"
bad,"It is a tough place to be a new hire or learn a new job. Training is mostly done by putting the new person on 12 hours and working with different people. Nobody does a job the same as the previous person which makes it frustrating to learn. If assigned to the corrugator there are no breaks provided and there is constant chatter on the radio head-set all the time. The culture is a difficult one to become part of. The motivational practices used by managers are mostly threats and intimidation."
bad,"hard working manger and co-works, but expect to much time from you when having a family"
bad,"Excessively hot and dirty. Mandatory overtime, usually last minute, can be a challenge at times"
bad,No support from the principals. Poor safety culture. Low morale.
bad,"Pay is good for the area, benefits are great. Union job, although Union is weak. Management is lacking, they hide on the job injuries and fix them in house so they don't get in trouble with upper management. They do not foster a team environment as each shift manager pits you against other shifts and crews. Maintenance practices are horrible. There is no training it's all done on the job by senior employees."
bad,Your at work more than home. Forced overtime. Some of the workers will take to you any type of way just cause they are above you. Training depending on race you'll train when they feel like it. Great starting out then you'll see the real color of people. Drama and stress
bad,"The only good thing I have to say is that it was a good company before it was bought out. When it was Weyerhaeuser management was good to the employees and after 13 years invested I had suffered an injury to my wrist and it prevented me from doing my job to my full extent. As a result mentally and physically was stressful and it affected my personality.  After seeking assistance I was unsuccessful in healing and my services were no longer required,"
bad,International Paper did not provide policies and procedures for their office employees. There was no onboarding process in place for new employees and overall the work environment was unpleasant and the office employees were overworked for the pay received.
bad,"Upper management is horrible...do not know how to run the company.  Coworkers are great.. its definitely a ""good old boys"" club if you want to move up. If your black you have it made..qualified or not"
bad,No designated lunch break. Hot humid. Little to no family time. Pay is good. Dangerous job. Meet good people. Seniority-based system.  Has a union. Learned how to drive powered industrial trucks
bad,"Management and culutre of IP is terrible.  No work-life balance. Management doesn't help develop you. Meeting are back to back, which causes you to get behind on your work."
bad,They pay awesome. That's it. once you start and have been their they have the I OWN YOU attitude. save yourself the hassle make your family first not them. They will make you stay over and work weekends. good luck getting a holiday off also.
bad,they pay pretty good but you do work a lot. hard to manage your life with the amount of time you spend working. they offer paid lunch you get 2 breaks  not allowed to leave to get lunch so you have to bring your own
bad,I worked hard and was trained on 2 machines. After a year I realized that the job was not what I expected. The pay was good. Too many hours ( 65-70/week avg. ) was the main problem. I moved on.
bad,"I have had jobs with good management and some with bad, this is the worst I have experienced to this point in my life."
bad,"This is the place to work if you thrive on challenges, such as space, the proper equipment and attracting the proper personnel. This was a great opportunity to learn the paper business and the customers expectations and needs, the company allowed opportunities to increase your knowledge and advance if the opportunities presented themselves. The hardest part of  my job was managing in a union environment , I was never able to convince the team to be a team, there was always division and forces to prevent what could have been a great success during my rein. what  I enjoyed was the daily challenge of having to figure out how to make thing happen that day, at the end of the day we  had more wins than losses, it has made me a stronger manager and leader in my new role. I am convinced this was a very good company to work for , however it is so hard to get the managers to convey the same message as what actually comes from corporate, I was able to spend some time at the  corporate office and meet very high level leaders in the company, believe me their message was different from what local management was delivering, this was a big cause of why the union was able to survive as long as it has. I think It's okay to manage a little kinder and a little gentler."
bad,A typical day was fun and easy to get through because of the people that you worked with. everyone is understanding and open minded. good place to work
bad,"The pay is great. But you will have no time to ever spend it. Surprise 16 hour shifts are common. Working entire weeks of twelves with very little time off happens frequently. You can not have a personal life while working here. If you live alone and have no friends and family, then go for it!"
bad,"Long boring, learned how to operate machines i will prob never use again, got fired for the scheduling error they made when i was at 7.5 points on a 8 point system, never produced the schedule until 7 months later when trying to draw unemployment, after almost a year of work with many 72 hr work weeks. So they will figure out how to get rid of you if they choose so. If you are not in the circle of whatever it is they have there they will get rid of you. Even if you are they will still get rid of you. They fire guys after 20 years of service for injury. If you have a family you love, the money is good for everyone, but do not expect to maintain any personal relationships."
bad,"Good foundation specially for fresh graduates. You will learn everyday. Practice camaraderie. Develop your talents and skills. Follow labor rules, salary adjustments and other benefits. With medical benefits and other company benefits."
bad,Good job unless you get assigned to the shipping department. Worse job and worse paid in the mill. Management doesn't manage employees right and training lacks behind also.
bad,There was no room for advancement for Me. I went to work and did my job. their was a lot of favoritism and certain individuals did what they wanted. I just didn't fit their criteria.
bad,Very poor training and onboarding as you're tossed to the wolves to figure it out. It is all about the money and there are very poor business decisions being made to try and stay afloat. Poor communication to pertinent stakeholders. I've decided to take my MBA elsewhere.
bad,The small departments are completely swamped with overtime because of a high turnover rate.   Between that and the vacation days that are mandatory to cover for the missing person there is an absurd amount of overtime.
bad,"There is no typical work day. There is a lot of consistency in that there are purchase orders on a daily basis, however the amount of orders will vary. I'm sure not all locations have the poor management that the location I was at does. The unprofessionalism and negativity of the person who oversees the customer service department is discouraging and downright terrible. I've never worked with someone who goes above and beyond to make sure the ""new person"" is at the bottom of the totem pole. No assistance, no training, no communication. Just an awful environment to be exposed to for a professional setting."
bad,Employess opinions are overlooked. Schedule is the worst ive ever worked...there are other schedules that would be better for the company and employees
bad,"Not enough work training for the position. HR needs to be more helpful during the hiring process. With a few adjustments International Paper would be a nice place to work, the employees are very helpful which helps with the work environment."
bad,"No leeway on leaving for family reasons or personal. Good group of people I worked with but, that's the only good thing I can say. Great for a single person who just wants to make some decent money. Overtime is abundant!"
bad,"Tough company to work for.  Seemed a very negative environment, with tons of hrs worked and little compensation with zero bonuses. Upper management seemed to always want to micromanage their people."
bad,"Working in the P5 machine room is a living nightmare. Management is a joke. The senior techs have a battered wife syndrome and your union reps are in it for themselves. If you are really desperate and have no other options, you may survive out here long enough to find something better, or transfer out of the P5 department. If you are smarter than a 5th grader then for God's sake  find another place of employment. Run from this place."
bad,"International Paper is my first factory experience and the last. I felt like a number and not a person.  In their efforts to create a fair work environment for everyone, they fall through the cracks when someone threatens to sue them.  Their methods and rules need to looked over by a labor board to see if it's even legal.They are afraid of unions for some reason.  The only comfort you have are your peers."
bad,Not much positive to share. Employees are focused more on their job security and not sharing knowledge than the big picture. I was very unhappy ninety percent of my time on the job.
bad,"I find it hard to believe that the rating is as high as it is. There are several people that have been forced into 72 hour work weeks for several months. It's under staffed and moral is at an all time low. Write people up for not meeting unachievable goals and then turn around and five everyone a meal and gift cards for doing so good. If that's not mixed signals I don't know what is...."
bad,was  not a god environment cared more about production then safety or learning how to do the job in a safe correct way.Some co workers were not supportive or helpful.Pay was great and the benefits but work environment was not good.
bad,"great company to work for. fun and stable job with good co-workers."
bad,Gestione del personale lavorativo buona ma con qualche preferenza evidente.
bad,"·· Communicating with Supervisors and Co-Workers, Monitor Processes, Materials and Inspecting. "
bad,could do a lot better training new employees. come in the morning and be told where to go. working in small groups. Working on machines what were outdated and falling apart. Fast pace working environment.
bad,Its has great people to work with and its been hard and speedy work to work as team work which is in good way. Sometimes it can be slow or low productions that still senting people home which we really don't like that about this job. I always enjoy the job there and it help me stay focus on and work hard like I always do that to help pass time by quick also help the quality increase better.
bad,"Shipped and received maintained warehouse and dock areas , did contractor safety management, in charge of landscapers , snow removal. Also did fire suppression systems ."
bad,"Empresa consistente e de oportunidades, porém bastante burocrática e injusta com os seus funcionários, dia de trabalho bastante estressante e sempre em regime de horas extras."
bad,Most work days was a headache. I would come in some days and a certain material may not be in then I would have to go all the way back home. This place was so disorganized. They losted alot of contracts because customers was not receiving their products on time.
bad,Long work days required to get objectives done. Decrease in staff over time. Employees are all very nice people to work with. Some management choices are not well aligned to the business they support.
bad,"This company thrived on breaking unions in the 80's and 90's and have little regard for their employee's families. In the 80's and 90's, it became a ""who will win"" contest and they lost sight of values and ethics."
bad,"Typical day was catching maintenance calls and doing pms. There wasn't a day that something new wasn't learned. Machinery had many moving parts, parts of the machine that weren't obtainable during pms but were accessible in the event of major overhauls. Management wasn't knowledgeable in how the equipment function nor had a true understanding of time involved in making major repairs. My co-worker on the 3rd shift that I worked was one of the best I have worked with even the remaining crews 2nd and 1st were dedicated workers, awesome crew. Hardest part of job worki8ng without available parts. Surpassing all other shifts as far as production demands."
bad,Not a great place to work. Everybody is miserable and old. The actual job is on budmil dr which is off a William st . Make good money but that's literally it. Supervisor is a great guy but besides that job sucks. Dont like going to a job where people aren't friendly at all.
bad,"Certain fellow employees made it very difficult for trained employee's that float from machine to machine, "
bad,"Its a cliquish environment of managers and employees that will half train you to do the job then complain if you make a mistake or misunderstand. You're better off not working here. This is not a career, its a dead-end job that pays a decent wage."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work there. I worked long hours as an salary employee and was not compensated for it. The equipment at the facility is very unreliable and that equals long days and nights.
bad,Company purchased four times over 15 years. Constant changes and new management. Flexible work hours were taken away and raises were non existent. Merging with International Paper was extremely stressful.
bad,"In my opinion there was too much oversight, especially with consideration for the size of the company. Very political company in nature. Those who get along often do better than those who perform well with strong opinions. Opinions are asked for, but seldom valued."
bad,"One would go in and I would fill out the C/O schedule and make copies for the people on the floor and the boss. Then maybe half way thru the night,the boss decides to bring up two more lines. The lead comes to me and ask if we have everything to run. Most of the time we didn't."
bad,"Loud, dirty and repeatative heavy lifting with no advancement opportunities, coworkers are nonhelpful and nonfriendly.They also have lots of forced overtime that could extend for months on end."
bad,"Management is sorry machines break and don't get fixed properly they don't care about their workers, you work 7 days a week while management gets every weekend off"
bad,"I was looking forward to working at International Paper, until I had been there a very short time. There is a ton of forced overtime which leads to people being tired, and stressed. Which I'm sure has lead to the amount of reportable accidents. There is terrible safety regulations that would be part of the accidents too. In all I was there about a month and was glad to find another job and be able to leave."
bad,"Decent pay but far too much mandatory overtime."
bad,"The job is very fulfilling, but you work all the time. Work most Saturdays, and a lot of overtime.  Very good and keeping there employees trained on equipment."
bad,"""all are related"" transferred here from a plant closure they don't tell you who is related very sneaky backstabbing people"
bad,I worked 12 hrs shift for 5 years. Paid pretty good but you earned every dime. Working night shift 7pm-7am was the hardest thing I ever done. Takes a toll on your body !! Most of the jobs required you to stand for 12 hours in one spot. I enjoyed the most was once a month they would have a paper cup sale you could buy very cheap. Managament and supervisor didn't treat personnel very well. They would fire you at drop of a hat.
bad,Company does things with no rhyme or reason. All about building shareholder value and not about their employees.
bad,"Company won't spend money to update equipment... Band-aid equipment back together. Maintenance leadership inexperienced to lead, poor communication.. Company stores old equipment in Warehouse waiting for other equipment to break down.. Amazing to see terrible culture"
bad,Upper management runs the plant with their egos instead of those heads. Lower management has no backbone  and will blame employees for any errors. Don't trust anyone in management. Anything you say will be though out the plant by the next day.
bad,Worked an average of 66 hours a week being the lowest person on the totem pole you end up working 12 hour shift after 12 hour shift with a very high turn over. Only thing I miss is the pay
bad,"Unless your kin or buddies with someone in maintenance good luck.  Perfect attendance, willingness to work OT, and doing your best do not apply here. If your not liked or accepted for who you are you will be plotted against and voted out at end of a very stressful 90day probation. Your skills and previous experience mean nothing because EVERYTHING has to be the IP way period no matter if its saves time, money, or anything. Very stuck in their ways. Some of them are great  to work with while the others treat you as inferior to their high and mighty perfection"
bad,"At international paper they tend to take many shortcuts to run for the now instead of preparing for the future. They do not provide all the tools you need to perform your job in a timely manner. Also the leadership is fairly poor, they do not show concern of their employees in any sense. The good is the benefits and pay. They provide great pay for someone not wanting to go to college while also providing great and affordable benefits."
bad,Not enough supervision to cover the shift. Have a manager for every supervisor which is not needed. Need to hire more leads or supervisors to run the plant so there is not so much overtime 72 hours a week with zero extra pay.
bad,They  work you to death  in the Putnam Connecticut plant . I worked 12's hours for several months and sometimes going over 14 days in a row. I became  exhausted after working all the time. My partner was very hard to work with she don't discuss any part of the job we are running and the boss yelled at me for everything and blamed me for her short  coming .
bad,"not good at scheduling work, your outside life does not matter,but you will make a good living while they are still running the mill"
bad,"Had 5 employee's reporting to me. "
bad,Great people. Bad management group. Voice is not heard and sought out.
bad,Pay was good but I had no life with my family. I could not plan for anything due to the fact they kept on changing my crew and schedule too much..
bad,This company has no respect for the people that work for them . They accired Weyerhaeuser in 2008 which was the greatest place I ever workder for. International Paper expects you to work 7 days a week.
bad,"A fairly standard warehouse/machine job, I have found plenty of opportunity to try and branch my job into a career but often get railroaded by relentless weekend work and twelve hour shifts for months on end. The pay is good and can increase frequently but requires alot of hard work and keeping your nose down to the grindstone. Hard to recommend to anyone that isnt absolutely desperate for employment."
bad,"Pays well but not enough to get over the stuffy office culture. Very quiet. Great campus, good benefits, but not the right culture if you are at all liberal. Very openly talks about religion, etc."
bad,"Worked on paper making and printing machines. This included oil and greasing, and general preventive maintenance inspections. As well as repair of down machines."
bad,"good hours, manager was unfair and hard to get along with. I would recommend this company if you are supervision by a different manager. Thank you and God bless"
bad,"Hot summers with only fans in plant. Long hours, especially if someone calls in sick. Annoying attendance point system that keeps turnover high. No sick leave but now I heard they give 3 sick days a year, if you are sick more, it is unpaid and can hurt your attendance points. Most people are just there until something else comes through. Would not recommend, in and out burger pays more. Mandatory weekends"
bad,"Company has many opportunites for improvement. A typical day at work is stressful. I have learned many new skills from software to working with Microsoft applications. The hardest part of the job, that although a fast learner and self starter, is working to get daily tasks done because the challenges with our staff."
bad,"great pay, but I'm a single parent hours did not agree with me."
bad,"I was in the South. It was very racist. Not towards me, but White employee talking inappropriately behind other Black employees, back. I am white, so I witnessed this, first hand. Buddy-buddy system is through and through there."
bad,Very fast pacing to work in always on your feet. Maintaining environment fair clean and always managing machine with clear view. And others surrounding near job site. Be quick and job will be very easy!
bad,"•	Oversee and perform all aspects of maintenance within a corrugated box / finish facility."
bad,Too many changes of buying and selling of businesses.  Tough market to be in with paper products and loss of revenue to the decline for the need of paper.
bad,The hours of shift and refusal to allow advancement makes it hard to enjoy the work. Looking for a first shift position and even working 10 years with the company they will not even consider it.
bad,"the company was ok to work for just have a lot of ups and downs short breaks, good people at the company money don't match the hours u would work"
bad,"inappropriate office behavior.  There were days when my regular work was halted in order to take care of high priority issues.  However, sometimes these issues were managed with high anxiety and hostility.  Saw a woman get passed over for promotion for a man from outside of the company.  Now the woman is basically doing the work anyway at a much lower salary and has been for years. HR is not willing to reimburse for travel or help with living expenses like interns at other locations were getting. "
bad,Constantly hiring people that are a huge safety risk because they don't properly train employees. Operates like a union plant but isn't.
bad,"At times,some managers skills were poor. Lacked proper communication to employees, but overall decent workplace.Co-workers were close knit and we worked as a team."
bad,This company seems to be on the decline.  There is constant instability as the company tries to figure out its direction.
bad,Working with people to learn new jobs. Assist Maintenance in equipment upkeep.
bad,"Everyday is different, one day I am the supervisor the next I am the maintenance assistant. Learned a lot about the paper recycling business. Also learned about DOT, Dispatch and general office data entry. Management has changed numerous time since I started there in 2010. Four managers later things have not changed. During the month I am on the floor being the floor lead, if there is an audit I am asked to put everything together such as the DOT audit. If maintenance needs help fixing a machine I roll up my sleeves and get greasy. End of month I help enter the remainder of the tickets so our numbers are correct. I wear many hats, so may call that job security, but I call it being Band-Aid."
bad,Performed full-cycle accounting and managed financial projects that affected company’s bottom line.
bad,"No training, No HR on site, No higher management. Manufacturing fiasco."
bad,"International Paper compro la empresa donde laboré (Temple-Inland) quien tenia en la division internacional 7 plantas en Mexico y Puerto Rico. Trabajaré para International Paper hasta fin de Septiembre 2012, ya que mis funciones seran tomadas en el corporativo en Memphis."
bad,working in fast pace load plant to make boxes for various companies. Hardest part to do is stay awake when things are slow.
bad,"If you are single looking to have a good paying job but no time to spend your money then IP is the place for you. You may see two people in the entire plant smile and that's right before they leave for vacation or have no other life rather than to work hours of regular time, overtime, and mate relief. They currently have a different manager which possibly couldn't make you feel anymore uncared about than for whom I worked under. By the way, all the hours you work and you are on a point system of only seven points. Either you will be a lifer and miserable like the rest or make a quick dollar and be free again after a couple years."
bad,IP could be a great place to work if the training you receive matches the job you are hired for. The company may consider on the floor training.  Help
bad,"learned how to run 6 types of presses, repair print plates and cutting dies. fun co-workers...lots of hours available.management can be a drag sometimes.."
bad,Go scan packages make sure they not damaged  enter them into a data base so the customers can track there packages and items that they ordered do things in a timely fashion my co workers .
bad,Good company to work for with a lot of success in employee development.
bad,I enjoyed talking to customer and problem solving to get the resolution they needed to pay the bill. High phone call volume when statement went out that was the hardest part of the job. I had good co-workers we worked well as a team. Management wasn't too good or non-existent at times.
good,Great place to work it just had closed down and  didn't give anyone an warning so we didn't have plans to find another job but overall it was an great place
good,Job was interesting but I went there as a temp. I was promised a permanent position but did not receive one. The job had too many issues and for not just me but all the works it was like revolving doors.
good,They didn't have enough air or fans for certain areas in the plant.  When you got sick or dehydrated they never took into account that it was due to how hot it was. If you had problems or issues with co workers they did not look into the problem.  They had people in positions that they had no idea what they were doing.  They started hiring people that didn't want to due there job they were just there for a check making your job more stressful and harder than it needed to be.
good,"Working at international paper has its ups and downs the union employees are very strong and stick together. And managements people skills are just very poor and lack common sense, because of their position they feel the need to belittle a lot of the members as if there their job title makes them better then the union employees"
good,I would not recommend if you are not willing to work 6 days a week.they have good benefits the people on the floor are good to work with. They work alot of overtime and do not get alot of weekends off.
good,"IP was a very unpredictable Company."
good,"•	Safely and accurately calculated, built and assembled customer orders to prepare them for delivery, inner-yard transfer or customer pick-up.. "
good,I like the job because of the pay and my co workers were very nice.
good,Sad to say that the job I currently work at has turned so bad that I am looking to start over after almost two decades. The work is not the problem lack of respect is.
good,"I work as a millwright. They never let us actually fix anything unless there is no other option. Constant patching to get it running. They will pinch a penny so hard they'd make Lincoln cry on it. Production is always right, maintenance is always wrong. The safety rules are over the top and ridiculous. For a utility knife you're required to wear category 5 cut resistant gloves, AND kevlar sleeves. I've never worked anywhere that went this over the top to try to bubble wrap their employees vs training them properly."
good,"Fast paced environment, customer driven results. Interdepartmental cooperation and teamwork helped improve quality of service and reduce product defects."
good,I was training on B shift when I was supposed to have moved to nights and my supervisors were the pickiest and hardest to work with. Training was inconsistent as I had trained with several different people who each had a different way of doing things which then confused me and slowed me down and therefore made the entire situation worse for me.
good,I'm a hard worker a people person a work ethics good can get along with people​ don't like to waste time also get my work done on time sometimes leave late
good,A typical day for an outside sales representative included managing customer relationships as well as managing internal customer service representatives.  I learned to wear many hats as I had to manage different customer relationships as well as relationships within IP in order to get things accomplished.  The workplace culture was one of what have you done for me lately and nothing was ever good enough for management.  The hardest part of the job was getting caught in the administrative and customer service functions and not being able to sell.  The most enjoyable part of the job was finding solutions to customer issues and capturing orders.
good,"Seguro médico "
good,"International Paper did not seem to care about the well being or family life of its employees. 12 hour work shifts, my family life suffered always working or to tired to feel motivated."
good,it was a decent job  hot in the summer freezing in the winter.  8 hr shifts with alot of overtime if you wanted it.
good,"A typical work day was from 10 to 14 hours, so we had very long hours.  I learned a lot of managerial skills and also leadership skills.  The management there had no idea of how to coexist with the hourly work force.  My co-workers where great and we ran the power house as a team.  The hardest part of the job was trying to stay awake at the 6 to 7 meetings we had a day.  The most enjoyable part of the job was trouble shooting issues."
good,"No hay trabajo en equipo, no se aprovecha el talento del personal,"
good,The amount of stuff that the front office turned a bind eye to should have this plant shut down in a second! They disregarded safety procedures and regulations after claiming to be extremely focused on safety. They do not care one bit about their employees! Not only that but they have a complete moron running the maintenance dept! Literally every “repair” was a bandaid fix to get running again which caused massive issues down the line which they never took responsibility for!
good,Not much room for advancement if you have no experience or college degree or military experience. Training isn't consistent. Work onset time every week.
good,"If you want to work your life away for a manufacture who allows the site manager to treat you like dirt this place is for you. Most supervisors are ok it's the upper management that wants to treat you like dirt. They want to break the union contract when ever the wind blows with no reguard to what they agreed on. Your basically a puppet. Slot of promises but is you want to be advanced don't count on the false promises. Alit of people in Clveveland,Tn. Are looking for other employment due to the management. If not for the employees this plant would have been shut down along time ago. Management does nothing to help the hourly employee. They get their bonus employees get nothing!"
good,The company is felony friendly and gave me an opportunity to learn to operate a forklift. The hiring process was very professional and easy and they were also Union based which was new to me. Only downside was the mandatory rotation of the shifts.
good,"extremely repetitive work, mandatory OT, 6 days a week. lack of appreciation for employees. No time for family or home life. The pay is great, the union helps with job security, the working environment is over all not fun, and very loud."
good,12 hour swing shift plus you have to work days your off if they are short. Not a good job for a family life. Breaks are 15 minutes and one 20 minute. You get 5 through the day. Really hot during the summer and the place is known for being short staffed on the floor.
good,Worked at least 16 hours 3 days a week. The work life balance was not there. Very large plant which you were responsible for maintenance on the whole location with 1 other person that always needed to be trained.
good,Worked there 28yrs suddenly terminated without warning.  Worked many 13 day 1 day off shifts.  No time for planning family time or vacations.  Would only recommend if you have no children or spouse.
good,The company do not care about the employees. Do not show any appreciation for their work. Only care about how much they can get out a day instead of the quaility of the work. Stressful atmosphere. Do not try to solve problems.
good,Do not treat their employees fair.Great pay bad management.Overworked. Never appraised .Bad bad mangement. You are just a number to them.Shelbyville ill are unfair
good,"typical union job.  Miserable and lazy co-workers, poor upper management, bad health benefits. Not much room for advancements.    Easy job, can be very boring, but sometimes very intense."
good,"Worked 19 days in a row before days off."
good,"IP was built in 1947,  It was the biggest papermill at the time and handled clients such as Kraft, Eastman Kodiak, Reanior etc.  Because of miss management, quality issues, and lost time accidents, it was forced to close down in 2003 putting 1850 IP workers out of a job, not counting the vendors, logging outfits and contractors out of business as well.  Being from a small town of less than 8000 people.  It really made my hometown a very bad economic place to stay."
good,"International Paper was a good seasonal job. i dont have anything to say about this job. It was a warehouse job, with no room to advance."
good,"a typical work day is 12 hours shifts, i learned  C.P.R.  How to be a first responder,how to work safe around dangers equipment. the management was ran on the good ol boy system, no matter how hard a person worked,if they wasnt in the click are had some kin folk there,they didnt stand a chance for a future. the co-workes was ok for the most part,it was a dog eat dog work place. hardest part of the job was the swing shifts. there was not anything enjoyable  about the job      "
good,Work with team leaders to pull and pack orders for shipment.
good,Title says it all. Co-workers were great though. Requires alot of physical strenth in the bailer position.
good,It depends on how other employees day goes with their personal life's. A lot of complaining and favoritism. He say she say!! Too much overtime no weekends off!
good,I worked nights at international paper for 4 years as i finished college.  A good work life balance is nearly impossible to have.  You'll likely work about 26 Saturdays a year. On a good week you will be working 8 hour days and off on your scheduled time (usually someone calls in and you'll be asked to stay).  If you don't mind hard work this job pays well enough to keep you there but probably not gonna make you happy.
good,If ur young and no family this is the place I usually work 60 to 70 hrs a week 6 mabe 7 days a week 12 hrs a day Theirs no communication between managemt and staff or between managersA lot of old broken machines and grumpy maintance workers but insurance if great and i usually bring home 2300 bi weekly
good,"Poor management and working six days a week (Mon through Saturday) got old FAST. I would recommend working there to a very young person starting out,but mist people don't stay there in a Maintenance role. There are much better opportunities out there for seasoned professional/experienced persons."
good,"They seem to be shifting from a downfall as a company.."
good,"Awful hours, good money. Just like any place else. You have decent people and you have bad people. The higher up you go the more money you make (in operstions). Decent benefits. Alot of people with a 4 year degree don't make this kind of money."
good,"When there is minimal work( Which is around December to April) , they will begin to schedule work maybe 2-3 a week. You will have to find another income because the work is not secured. The pay just went up to $12.00. Even though it's a warehouse job, the worker's deserve to be paid more income for the amount of labor they request, especially if they have families to provide for."
good,The opportunity for advancement is next to none in shipping. The organization is and management is horrible. The work environment is very dangerous. Supervisors don’t follow S. O. P.s. They control a lot of your out of work time with mandatory random overtime. No sick pay. It takes a year to get vacation and then only on a seniority basis.
good,Really liked the pay and the work. Just did not enjoy working 6 12 hour shifts per week for month after month. Left no time for life or even getting much rest.
good,"International Paper as far as working on the Production Floor is a job. I wouldn't say it's a solid ""career"" move. The hours were long, the pay   decent and the benefits good. Health insurance costs started going up my final couple of years there. Not really the place you want to work at if you have a family and want to spend the weekends with them."
good,"Like any other job/company. You have your positives and negatives. It will all depend on what you need and want. You got to have a lot of tolerance dealing with negativity between co-workers and management. Common work practice is leave it for the next guy. If your relief does not show up for work, you may very well work a double."
good,it was ok. lack of work on some days. so you couldn't get your full hours for the week. but when they was work you was able to get over time and that was good.
good,"International Paper was an ""okay"" experience, long hot warehouse days, poor ventilation but great hours. The turnover rate is exceptionally high due to lose of work contracts, layoffs etc. Over all not a bad place ok work, but if you find something better get out while you can. Basically it is a "" take it or leave it"" position."
good,"Facilities were continually under staffed, requiring leaders to fill multiple roles causing gaps in the ability to manage them effectively.  Limited budgets forced decisions to not maintain equipment as needed."
good,"Job was easy but face paced and inconsistent. Some lines you could barely keep up with, while others were so slow you could walk away for several minutes. Pay was low for work performed at the time, however they have given pay raises since then. Management was horrible in general although there were a few great managers."
good,Check quality have product out on time. Oversee the daily operations of the apostate machine have the orders ready to run have spec sheets ready for review of product
good,Tons of hours to gain income. Not much at home time with family. Plenty of opportunity to increase job position in return that will increase individual pay.
good,"Work hours were very long,no air or heat as well as poor ventilation.Only allowed 10 minute breaks three times a day.Management was very rude to employee's."
good,"They closed the plant down in oswego, with little to no notice. Was a good place to work and the people were the driving force that made international  paper in oswego successful."
good,"Typical work day included long hours.  "
good,The company does not care about work life balance. They expect everyone to be out there when the mill is not running even if you've got nothing to participate in and just twiddle your thumbs. Management makes all type of questionable decisions. Depending on the boss you had it could really affect how you perform. I've had 3 bosses within the span of 2 years.
good,"a day at work was pumped up by supervisors on production efficiency was key to success, I enjoyed the safety courses that were offered and the maintenance team I was able to learn from"
good,International Paper is a very challenging work environment. Your day to day job as a process engineer is constantly changing and you will never have the same day twice.
good,"Spacecraft is a nice employment opportunity if you have a goal to pay off a debt or car loan, or even save for a home. You will get plenty of overtime, often short- noticed. There is no way to advance in this place if you are mind-strong. If you want to advance, you can if you ""go with the flow"". Make a goal, achieve it, and move on."
good,"There was no such thing as a typical work day. The union only protected those who were in - If you were in the clique or you weren't the buddy-buddy type then the jobs could be made hard for you. Management was inadequate. The jobs were do able - but the people  were the issue. It was not a good atmosphere. The people would take advantage of you if they could. They didn't want to train you but would definitely report you if you did wrong. There was no common courtesy, no common respect, no equal treatment among the workers or the management. This is not a place to make friends. Do your job keep your business to yourself and watch your back."
good,"The PS&D department is the worst in the entire company. They are the lowest paid and can't leave the department for a 5 year minimum. The department management is a joke. This department can be operated much more efficiently."
good,"Empresa boa para trabalhar apesar de estar mudando seus valores, no que se diz respeito a plano de carreira, motivação através de investimentos dos funcionários e equipamentos para que assim pudesse estar trazendo condições melhores de trabalho."
good,"Working for international paper in was the same type of work everyday for eight hours a day. The communication between management and hourly personnel was limited. Questions would often go unanswered when asked. It was not uncommon to ask the same question more than once and get different answers. The hardest part of the job was getting passed the confusion. I wasn't afforded the chance to learn anything new. International Paper placed me in what they called a ""safe skill"". I believe that was referring to the fact that I had experience in the warehousing department."
good,"People are awesome, place is OK to work at, needs a changing of the guard to be productive. lacks any training program what so ever. Its kind of like going to school with out having a teacher to teach you anything about the things needed to succeed."
good,"Hardwork Area"
good,"too much overtime, maybe 2 days off per month,"
good,"Trouble shooting on the movement of containers from different ports to mill locations for stuffing, negotiation of ocean freights with different shipping companies/Freight Forwarders.  Achieving the results within the time lines by working as a team."
good,woeked hard feeding a box making machine. Enjoyed my job but little communication between employees and management.
good,"No matter how much right you do the only see the wrong things you do, HR and Management is bad... but I've learned alot in this place not only about myself but how to deal with certain types of people.."
good,"The different jobs at International Paper are easy to learn in my opinion and they do give you plenty of time to train on the jobs.  You are off on Government holidays.  You have opportunity for overtime, as they are shorthanded at a lot of machines at the moment.  Machines run throughout the day and night during the week, so you could be on a graveyard shift."
good,"Poor management and decision making. Cultural divide between salaried and hourly employees. Ok pay, but when compared to other mills of same job suits, low on the pay scale."
good,"Southern swing schedule 7 days of 4, 7 evenings off 1, 7 midnight's off 2. If the next man calls in you have to work his shift so there is a lot if 16 hour days.  But the good part is the people are good and they help you any way that they can."
good,"If you have kids or want a good social life forget about working here. 4 on 4 off they say. 12 hour shifts, days and nights. Ends up being up to 6-12 hour shifts a week possibly more unless you sign the paper saying you don't want too. 1-2 days off in between. If you want to use a vacation day good luck it's like pulling teeth they frown upon that."
good,"Good pay, plenty of overtime. Supervisors are ok. Work pace is fast, and typically work 10 to 12 hours a day 6 days a week. It can be difficult to get a break if you work on the corrugator."
good,Enjoyed the time there and working with the various people that worked there at the company. Wasn't best place at time for me so moved on to pursue other career options
good,Good company to work for if you are under a good management team.  Very structured and organized.  Your job duties are well defined which makes adjusting and excelling in your job easier.
good,You work 12 hrs a day almost everyday. You would work over your regular 8hr shift with a 10 minute notice. It does not matter if you have a scheduled doctors appointment. I reported harassment and was moved from my job within 3 days and fired within 2 weeks of reporting the incident.
good,"Good ole boy system in full effect, IP is good for starters with no experience to get some. Management  plays favortism all day but you make a decent pay, no more than any other plant in my area. 7 day work week 2 days off swinging shifts, so it depends on the person, its quick pace for the new while ole union boys do little to nothing."
good,Overall my time at this job was very good!  I learned how to improve my packing skills and organization. The work is enjoyable  and fast paced but the high turnover rate is a concern.
good,"The summary is putting it delicately. Purely as a business, they do fine. But this is a place where people are not considered people, but tools used solely to complete the orders given. An average of 10 hours a day, six days a week, and you need to use sick time to attend your own wedding or you're penalized. The benefits are great (for the 90s) and pay is pretty good. That's the one Pro, the pay."
good,Hard to get people to work there because of other businesses in that area pays more money starting off. If you like working hard and fast and making ink it is a good job if you like overtime it is a good place to work they have several different shifts and you can volunteer for Saturday or Sunday work if needed
good,"Lideranças complicadas, pouca qualificação, informações confusas."
good,Facility is closed.  Great first job.  Nice learning experience.  Sorry to hear that they had to shut down due to safety concerns.  A lot of people lost their jobs.
good,"Due to the competitive nature of the business, cost cutting was relentless,  especially on the personnel side. Often times, senior employees can be let go in favor of less compensated employees."
good,"Expect to jump into work as you start your day. Machines run 24 hour operations, machine operations continues between shift changes. There are lulls in the operations but keep on your toes, quality can go bad without notice.  Physically it lasts for 5 to 10 minutes otherwise its ensuring the operation continues.  Some jobs are more physical than others but each team controls the pace and breaks. 12 hour shifts are expected when someone calls in sick or scheduled vacations."
good,The company no longer exists in its original form.  They have merged with Unisource to create Veritiv.  That company is now traded on the US stick exchange.
good,Need to be willing to relocate for advancement. Very long hours high expectations. Very safety conscience and doing great on the LIFE program on Life Impacting and Fatality Elimination
good,It was something I had to get me buy the job was horrible not enough hours and the pay a very low manager was never there not enough equipment to do your job with
good,"Work is work, for most men we work an endure all situations and trust God for them to get better. Nothing is guaranteed, working here no consistency of any kind."
good,Cultural changing and not for the better.  Work/life balance does not exist.  Workload continues to increase without pay.  Internal expertise disregarded.
good,I enjoyed the job just think the pay should be raised due to low production and lay offs good breaks just doesn't pay enough for them to keep laying off
good,"I learned a lot from this job. They not only teach you the job but the business side too. The people work as teams as far as the work. "
good,"Hot, long hrs an lots of work weekends, no time for fun or family.. An the machines make it hard to reach your daily goals. The worst management ever,  you'll have work 12 hrs if release don't show,"
good,Dirty work. Poor management and training. Poor work life balance. Good pay. Union job. Safety is important.  Continuously changed managers. New management
good,"Work for  SpaceKraft, International Paper plant.  Squaring vacuum sealed cold storage bags. Very repetitive strain on shoulders and hands. Management psychoanalyzes workers behavior and nothing is done about it.  The job is easier, than dealing w/ the co-workers."
good,Always learning something new. Work was physically and sometimes mentally demanding .The hardest part of the job was trying to read managements mind .Rules changed daily.
good,"Empresa que agrega muito conhecimento,porem é muito dificil de se crescer na empresa e se exige demais do funcionario"
good,"going down hill, union is a joke just takes your money and sends it up north"
good,It's a production environment.  Same thing day after day.  Good pay and benefits.  There is nepotism in the upper management.  One guy got promoted and then promoted all his friends even though they had been demoted by previous managers or grossly under qualified.  Asked to work a lot of overtime with out prior notice.  Missed a lot of my children's activities due to the mismanagement.
good,"Map out loads for drivers."
good,Very un predictable place to work always changing personal and people .
good,"I have worked in the Paper Mill Department throughout my entire career at the International Paper in Franklin, Virginia. I have trained and operated all of the Paper Machines and I have also trained and worked to the top ranked position in my line of progression as a Chemical Additives Operator."
good,The job requirements for the position were too unrealistic and they affected the quality of my life.
good,Helps build your interpersonal skills though technical learning is quite a challenge out here.The hurdle is to overcome and outrage people working.Though systems have been inherited well people management was tough. A great place for building up overall personality skills and development.
good,"Overall it's a job.  It can be dangerous but Safety was always first.  International Paper did close some plants or sold them.  Another company bought the plant at which I worked at before.  If you do get this job, wherever it may be, be prepared for long exhausting hours."
good,"Has it's good and bad sides.  Management need training on dealing with people as a whole.  A lot of favoritism.  Equality does not exist, especially in California."
good,The job is easy but the management here sucks. The schedule is dumb and if you don’t like it the manager told us to look for another job. Team leaders are two faced.
good,"Some people love shift work but I hate it. If you have never worked rotating shifts I would strongly suggest not taking a job like this. It is a very well paying job but rotating from nights to days, days to nights is very stressful especially if you have a spouse/children. The mill I work at was built in the late 60’s and even though they are constantly making attempts to improve things equipment  malfunctions or breaks down quite often making your job even more difficult."
good,"a typical day at IP is listening to how much the Maintenance Department fails"
good,"I believe international paper is a good company to work for, but unfortunately there is a lack in work life balance. It has been a challenging and growing work environment, unfortunately the communication and full disclosure has let a little to be desired."
good,Place was alright. It just wasn’t for me. I wanted something different in life. Forklifting was day in and day out. The place was smelly due to the fact it was a recycling company.
good,Best paying job I ever had.  Highly stressful with cut throat management that only cared about the bottom line.  Very micro managing back then.  High turnover.
good,"Pay, and benefits were good. Job was challenging, they kept up with new technology and provided the tools and knowledge to do your job well. The equipment and facilities are well maintained. Clean work environment. Although, it is extremely hot."
good,I liked that I was always busy.  Doing various job duties at once. Being able to assist employees with issues and knowing the employee would confide in me.  Employees being able to feel comfortable and safe around me.  That I gain their trust.  I did learn a lot about unsafe conditions in the workplace.  How the shift supervisors and myself would work together to make the job a better place to work in.
good,The climate of the job was stressful. Mainly due to the fact the supervisor who was on my shift made threats to workers and intentionally tried to create a hostile environment to work in.
good,Long boring hard work where you have to look like you are working even if the machines are running well. The pay and benefits were good but it was very monotonous.
good,"Unfortunatly International Paper prefers self promotion without company help or guidance, unless you are in the group of old boys club. Good Pay and overtime, very low benefits assistance."
good,They pride themselves on being progressive yet management only values employees that work longer hours. These hours are unnecessary and sometimes are due to lack of competence. Yet that is who management see as assets to the future of this place
good,Working swing shift after so many years in the military is hard on the body.  Good money but have to balance lifestyle with constant worrying about what shift you will be on the next week.
good,The people here are what make this job good. Management is CUT-THROAT. You cannot trust them. The work-life balance here is TERRIBLE. 6 days a week and if management had their way you will be here 7/12hour days
good,your always expected to carry your load and everyone around you. no responsibility for personal work load. meddlesome coworkers and nosey as ever lol.
good,"depends on the department you work in this job is  three shift swig. pay and befits are good. lots of overtime  and time away from home."
good,"Very stressful position requiring abundance of attention to Detail."
good,Great place to work but can be cutthroat. Lot's of room for advancement if you're willing to relocate. Benefits are not bad and the hours can be taxing.
good,International Paper Is a good job if you don't want a life outside of your career. management rarely considers the long term wellbeing of their employees. they also show favoritism towards family members and chosen personnel.
good,"Well established, international company that is very safety conscious. Room to advance in pay but not in positions Employees can make it hard on you bc of the good ""ole"" boy syndrome. I advanced to crane operator quickly & was passing their computer ""job specific"" modules at a fast rate. Supervisor was telling me I was doing great & I asked him if there was more I could do or what job, course, etc I should I do next. My manager was never involved in any of this & I spoke to him Twice in 6 months. VERY LITTLE FAMILY/LIFE BALANCE! I worked 17(12 hour) days in one stretch, then had to work 12 the very next night. The Money was great after a long, stretch like that but they ,hardly ever, gave you time to spend with family & rest up before you were right back at it. I loved the work & pay. I didn't like some of the ""groups"" that always worked against you, which I point to, the lack of leadership from management, to continue to allow it to happen while they were well informed of it going on. They didn't want to ""Rock the Boat""."
good,Has 1st shift (7am-3pm) and 2nd shift (3-11pm). Only 2 20 min breaks. People are always coming and going. If work is available you will be put on a production line.
good,"International Paper pays well and is a stable place to work, however, the atmosphere breeds animosity, and the supervisory teams tends to not only allow it, but encourage it."
good,"Don't know when u will be hired on full time"
good,"The company does not care about your well being, family or safety. it is a very dangerous place to work. environmentally, and all other hazards. the structures are rotting to pieces. Too many people have been killed with IP companies."
good,Great company as far as doing things for employees around holidays and yearly anniversary's. But they have some rules that are over the top and only apply to who they feel like holding accountable for these rules. extremely unfair and malicious management.
good,"For an International Company, that location has horrible morale both in the plant and office.  Management is quick to point fingers and not take ownership.  There is no structured training.....sink or swim, learn by mistake training.  No coaching moments there,"
good,A great place to work and build professional profiles however management made it very difficult to maintain family time because of the demand to work overtime. Even though we were salaried employees demand was even worse.
good,I no longer work at IP. Perhaps things are different now since I have left. IP offers opportunity to make a substantial salary if you do not mind working 12 hrs a day for 5 or 6 days a week. The scheduled work hours are mandatory. You are required to be union member as condition of employment. Not too bad all in all except for the continual 12 hour days.
good,"Not the best place to work, pay is pretty good, hours are long, and management thinks you can produce quantity and quality without spending money on maintaining the equipment. Just doesn't work that way..."
good,"L'objectif était de s'occuper du bon fonctionnement des machines, de palettiser les cartons et de les emballer. Les managers étaient plutôt encourageants, tout comme mes anciens collègues qui m'avaient très bien accueilli. L'aspect le plus difficile de mon poste était la répétition des gestes. Les horaires étaient aussi assez contraignants. L'aspect le plus agréable était le fait que les managers me fassent confiance et me laisse une certaines liberté dans mon travail."
good,"Decent place to work for, not very family friendly, but their trying. The company is growing in the way it treats its employees."
good,"Work there through a temp agency and after being there for about 2 months, I had the misfortune of a skid breaking, the very next day I was shown the door, but just a few days before that another temp person did the very same thing and keep his job...bs!!"
good,"It was an okay job, hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It was a dirty and noisy place, but a safe place to work. Working with co-workers was enjoyable"
good,"empresa de grande porte que estava em fusao devido venda,processo  de manutencao escasso sem muitos recurrsos para troca de equipamentos e pecas tornando assim mais difiicil a manutencao das maquinas"
good,Lousy management and terribly unorganized!  Building is a mess and everyone is not well directed.  Stay away at all costs!
good,"There is no typical day at work.  This type of position requires adjusting to the demands at hand.  I enjoy problem solving for my customers, and the ongoing technology changes which enables me to continually learn."
good,environnement de travail très agréable mais salaire insuffisant
good,Liked the business and calling on the customers but company is having major problems.
good,Go To machines run boxes then be told you have to have a certain amount done be for you leave. this happens every week on the same orders no organization or planning in the plant machines are old and are just falling apart. safety is very big here
good,It's a decent place to work but is hard on anyone who enjoy spending time with family.Away from home a lot and is not always able to make plans due to fact that it is shift work you never know when you will be forced over or called in early.It use to be a family oriented place but now you are just a face or number.Management only cares about production and not your person problems.
good,If you are a hard worker you will tend to work harder then certain people that's been there way longer than you. The line leaders and shift leaders show favoritism toward people who work there the longest and they may not have to really do any work once they see your dedicated. It's a lot of DRAMA working with females and men because everybody worried about who's dating who.
good,"Ensured all orders/quote requests received were entered timely and accurately by the customer service team. Provided the best support and supervision to the customer service team in prioritizing high volume and fast paced workload. Worked closely with corrugator scheduler in determining line-up of orders to be manufactured for on-time delivery. Resolved customer complaints within company guidelines. Worked closely with the sales team, plant manager, accounting and shipping departments to ensure our customers were happy and satisfied customers."
good,"Answer high volume of calls and order entry. Manage strategic accounts. Solve issues with stock and manufacturing orders, pricing, tracking shipments. Works with other departments product line, marketing, transportation, outside sales representatives"
good,going to work wasnt something i looked forward to. Alot of miscommunication. Good people to work with made friends but management has always been a complete joke. climate was the most difficult to deal with. Never knew what hours we were working until 30 minutes before the end of shift. Seeing the next shift walk out onto the floor was the best part of my days. It was that bad
good,International paper is a nice clean safe enviroment motorvative and productive plant they have a nice staff overtime is great if you like working extra hours I loved that part
good,There is a wide range of personalities in a very high stress environment. The job can be extremely stressful. Work/life balance is super difficult to maintain or even establish because this is a 24/7/365 facility. There are lots of opportunities to learn and grow as an engineer.
good,Paid a lot to work a lot. Don’t expect to be treated fair but you will like the check. Best part of working was the check other then that I was harassed and put down.
good,Easy job constantly working but job showed favoritism and had their picks on workers! Pay is good and job was convenient to get to. Towards the end of my time they treated us kind of bad and the breaks was only 15 mins!
good,You learned to how do the job as you go.  It depends on what crew you are on that makes it enjoyable. It is fast paced and very busy. Days are hard to get onto.
good,"If you dont care to much about having a life it's a great place to work. High turnover because of long continuous weeks of working 5, 6 and 7 days a week 12 hours a day."
good,International Paper is a union job but the union doesn’t work for you. In this industry you are paid a lot better from other companies besides IP. It’s faced paced and you have to pay attention to detail constantly.
good,"The work/life balance is good, salary is fairly low but that's partially due to my failure to negotiate effectively enough. Management is fair/poor. Culture at my particular mill is poor. Probably wouldn't recommend working here at least in my position."
good,"the workplace culture emphasis is on team work and six sigma learning.  Although there are teams, one has to ensure self promotion and work life balance."
good,Poor management and no employee input. There are four 12 hour shifts. You are allowed two 20 minutes breaks the whole 12 hours of working. Majority of the operators are old and always complaining.
good,They wait till the last minute to post whether you have to work the weekend. There is no balance of work life for the emoloyee that work in the back but many for the ones up front.
good,"The typical day at International Paper officially began with a conference call through the mill including all the process engineers, the mill manager, and other pertinent individuals. The rest of the day consisted of working on projects. Meetings with whomever was involved in those projects would be scheduled as deemed necessary. I learned a great deal about process engineering in the paper industry. The management was hierarchical, but the even the mill manager made himself accessible on a fairly regular basis and knew all the mill's employees by name. The workplace culture was team-centric, and safety was celebrated through free departmental lunches. The hardest part of the job is the hours, as the paper industry demands a lot from the few people who work at the mill. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is derived from the same factor, knowing you aren't just a small piece in the success of the company, but a great contributor to whatever project on which you worked."
good,I learned a lot but there was no place for advancement. the management was lacking in some areas. the hardest part of the job is to come in and focus on work because instead of trying to worry about the workers and the work they only focused on the negative things
good,"Easy work,good people to work with,pretty good bosses,nice clean well kept boiler to operate,good job with really good benefits, 12 hour shifts were great."
good,"Everyday is different in a day at the mill. Management has high expectations, some times unrealistic. There's always more things to get done than there are hours in the day. The greatest asset of the mill is the people and friendly/welcoming culture."
good,not for everyone good place to work good money good benefits good hours long days long nights work outside in a mill emvoirment railroad hard hat .......
good,"Good place to work ,long drive,lot of overtime,meetings on off days,lot of vacation time,work short handed.Medical and dental is fair high deductible.Paid holidays"
good,This was my first job after attending college and Tech school. The staff in the printing/copy dept. was instructive and supportive. I learned the basics of what is expected to be an employee in a print shop and dealing with a multi-user interface. Management and support was engaged with limited assistance. Joining the Corp. work environment and given the opportunity learn a skill is something I am very appreciative of.
good,"The people within the Finance group are a great bunch of people to work for.  The teamwork is remarkable. The diversity within the group is impressive. The CEO of the company is a people person, he is for family, safety and meeting the employees where they are."
good,"Spent 14 years here, got divested once but came back.  Thought I was going to retire here, but job started to get stale so I started looking outside.  I gave my a buyout, so here I am, available to you."
good,"A typical day at International Paper was stressing always having a supervisor on you just trying to find a reason to get you in trouble , you cant balance out work and family , expect to all ways stay over which is mandatory unless you want a attendance point but the pay makes up for that."
good,Good place to work and learn the trade. Able to use a varied amount of trade skills in any given shift. I liked not knowing what rge day was going to bring.
good,lot of hours no time off if someone does not come in to work you have to work they eight hours too its swing shift its a place where you spend a lot of time you will to come in at 12 for a meeting that does not start until 1
good,"Empresa oferece boas oportunidades de desenvolvimento e crescimento de seus profissionais, e remunera acima dos padrões de mercado. No entanto, possui uma cultura tradicional, conservadora, hierarquica e pouco meritocrática."
good,"the company itself was solid ..solid work solid work atmosphere at least with the shift i was on ..which was second shift ...the foreman i had was a very good one the best in my opinion of all of international papers foreman group at that job site ..we had a very good team in the shipping dept 2nd shift..we worked as a true unit helped each other when one couldnt keep up ..even the said foreman had no problems hopping on a forklift to lend us a hand when things got really hectic and truly earned our respect as a co worker,friend and leader of our group  ..but management there ruined all that was good in working there ..they thought a leaner crew meant more production with less having to pay additional drivers..all that did was over work the already over worked crews from 1st and 3rd shifts as well as the 2nd shift by putting them on 12 hour overlapping shifts ..but the pay made it worth it to some and that facility not having a union the employess had little or no voice to major issues that were going on in the plant ..but over all it was a good place to go to work for me cause we had such a great unit i overlooked the bad and just did what i had to do everyday ..so for the most part the job was enjoyable the pay was really good just production management needed a major over haul and major work to make it all it could be..just my personal opinion"
good,"I really enjoyed the few months that I worked there The hourly workers and floor supervisors were very good to work with. Although office management didn't seem to have a clue from scheduling, to Hr responsibilities to the hourly workforce, to the manager not letting the supervisors manage their departments. Worked a lot of Saturday's and a couple Sunday's. The hourly workforce do a good job doing what they can considering the hand they are dealt."
good,"A typical industrial experience for an operator. The plant typically runs three shifts; morning, afternoon, and night, six days a week. With newer employers typically working the night and afternoon shifts. There is also an ample amount of overtime available. While at international paper I learned the process to convert paper rolls into sheets of corrugated and the basic functions of the conversion equipment."
good,I like working for a large company most of the time but there are some challenges when trying to get a new computer or software.  Lots of policies to that need to be followed.
good,Well working for International Paper... It was definitely a life changing experience to say the least... Most if the Employees were very helpful... Go Team I.P.
good,"This is a place to go and make money and nothing else. You wont eat right, sleep right, or sit right because of the rotating shifts you will work most holidays."
good,"On paper this company is very strong, but it execution it deeply falls short. The company culture is very rigid, allowing managers too much power over career movements for employees. At most levels, you are expected to execute without question if you intend to climb the corporate ladder. With all the other companies headquartered in Memphis in this industry, you can find better pay and fairer treatment elsewhere."
good,"One of the cleanest warehouse facilities I have had the pleasure of working at, the culture was great. The only downfall is that the pay was a little lower than the industry. If pay is not a factor , than this is the place for you."
good,Encourages good work ethic. Provides employees with good pay and benefits. They take good care of their employees. They provide all equipment needed for the job such as prescripted safety glasses and discounts on steel toe boots. They really show their appreciation towards their employees and encourages good work ethic and morale
good,this is has pretty decent pay and benefits. There is a lot of forced overtime and weekend work. There is an issue with employee morale due to the long hours and added weekends.
good,"Journée Typique; 7h30 -19h00 Réunion production, répartition du travail et gestion des priorités. Relation avec les fournisseurs"
good,Work almost all weekends. Spend a decade on off shifts before reaching 1st shift. Machinery not getting proper fixes because of little downtime from mandatory overtime.
good,When I worked there I was consistently afraid to lose my job everyday over very strict requirements that needed to be met. It was very hot in there as well. It had very little air flow running through the building.
good,We work 72 hours a week.  The pay is good and room for advancement but the hours are brutal and I need to spend time with my family.
good,"Ótima empresa para se trabalhar, com varias oportunidades de desenvolvimento de carreira e de aprendizado"
good,"Can't deny that they pay well, but it's for good reason. You work long days, long weeks and weekends due to the facility being 24/7. And the job culture/mentality is usually ""If the mill is down then you should be at work"", so you often end up working many hours where you don't really need to actually be present. Management is mediocre for the most part. Lots of people in management that really shouldn't be there, but the natural progression of moving up in the company is usually requiring to take on management roles, so bad managers end up being everywhere. If you don't mind working the hours and putting up with sub-par management, the pay is good."
good,"Unless you are an engineer do not expect advancment unless you are willing to relocate every couple of years. I have a BS in management and after eight years watching the ""BUDDY SYSTEM"" in full swing I am looking for other employment."
good,"An 8 hour day on concrete, running a high speed machine. Very demanding, dusty, air quality was bad, management didn't care about the people, it was all about speed.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job is when International took over and demanded more out of a person and started working 12 hour days and weekends.  The best part was taking a new job, and trying to make it work, and accomplishing that."
good,Days were long but rewarding.  I worked with a lot of great people.  The hardest part of the job was the continually changing market place (Monthly).
good,"Great pay, lots of overtime. That's where it all ends. Majority of the nights we didn't get all of our breaks. The plant is only concerned with hitting high numbers. I worked 3rd shift so on Saturday when we were supposed to get off at 7 am we were usually made to stay late with no warning, an extra 2-4 hours. They take advantage of that with their employees. The operator 1s usually had bad attitudes and thought they ran the company. They had very poor leadership skills. Supervisors were ok. You really couldn't plan anything for the weekend because if you had mandatory overtime you'd find out Thursday afternoon. Also the training in the beginning is really poor. People just tell you to do things, but don't really tell you how or why you should do it. And have very little patience while they are training you."
good,"Great salary, 12 hour shifts, well balanced benefits, crowded work area."
good,"Extremely fast-paced, detail-oriented daily work environment.  Constant multi-tasking required to stay ahead of the game, but it was enjoyable helping ensure customers received the product needed to move forward in their environment."
good,Struggle to move up the ladder. Heavy workload that is hard to get done some days.
good,This position was only an intern with the Fiber Supply Team.
good,"on the job training not the best, as team members worried about their jobs.co-workers friendly but not a good source imformation.the team meetings was the most enjoyable part of the day, because you get imformation about your job like what problem the other shift had and want was done to fix it or what you need to do to have a good run.the hardest part of the job was rework."
good,"IP is a very profitable company but poorly managed. I'm not trying to be negative, just being honest. The pay was excellent but the management was a real joke. I truly enjoyed my work there and I am very sad that the mill is closing but not completely surprised that it is."
good,"Work load was a lot."
good,"Transportation Clerk: Responsible for generating bills of ladings for product shipped to customers. Handled incoming calls from customers. Interacted with carrier to ensure product's on-time delivery and scheduled delivery appointments. Scheduled appointments for incoming rolls of paper for the plant.  And other clerical duties included but not limited to:  filing, coping and ensuring that the appropriate information was given to the appropriate personnel, Enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was to inform customers (on occasions) that their product would not be delivered on the schedule delivery appointment."
good,"Staff showed favoritism, team work was never displayed, there were ""clicks"" of people that were very rude, very few people at this job actually enjoyed it"
good,"It is a great place to work if you are trying to get a ton of overtime. Pay is good, but you hit your ceiling within the first year. Communication is bad. There has been a lot of turn over among management. There are a lot of mandatory 12 hour shifts and Saturdays. You are made to feel inadequate and disposable. Operators take the blame for absolutely everything."
good,"the scheduling of repairs was extremely tough as the equipment is large with heavy parts that was very time consuming to take apart and re assemble "
good,"There is a maximum effort to recruit, hire, and retain hourly applicants. A typical work day entails posting open positions on Corporate Web Site and Texas Work Force web site. Candidates for hourly positions must pass an aptitude test to obtain an interview with a hiring manager. Additional tasks include employee time and attendance reporting, performing write ups for employee discipline, affirmative action planning"
good,Good opportunity for a great career and good pay. Fast paced work environment need to pay attention to detail. Biggest thing need to be on time because there on a point system.
good,Encountered very discriminating issues. Males seem to have a problem with women working there. Unacceptable training. Unsafe areas. Lack of following SOPs.
good,"This is the type of job you work if you're single with no kids. Great pay and benefits, but the overall work culture really makes you want to leave. From what I've seen most of the people that have 5 years or more with the company are only there for the money and become complacent in their roles with no thought of advancement within the company."
good,Not a bad job lazy drivers paid by the hour and they soak it up with no backlash...hard working timely drivers like me did not fit in...however I was going to stay until the pushed us out by using outside carriers for cheaper freight
good,Always be true to who you are an set a good example. Do 100 percent no matter the job or pay you receive. Be a team player a leader an always do your best
good,The company is ok it would be alot better if there was overtime at my position... very good but expensive healthcare... overall it's not the best job but it's a good job
good,"My job was to work the recovery boilers and power boilers , turbine generator and run chemical test every 4 hours. My job consisted of watching pumps chains motors, iks and oil level . Anything u can think of we have to do"
good,Ran the shredder machine for destruction of personal documents. Was teaching me how to run the front end loaded when i was let go cause company lost contract with county and had to lay off the newest hires
good,Was a great place to work but our division was bought by another company and there has been alot of uncertainty about our jobs. IP pays well and their are lots of opportunities.
good,Pays well however too much overtime with supervisors that should not be in management. Sometimes is too much to bear. Good place to be despite this big issue
good,I never when I or my employees get to go home due to call outs. Work life balance is no good. Plenty of opportunities to advance for the right person if you are willing to relocate.
good,"Overall, the job is great.  You learn extensively how paper is made, regardless of departments you may work.  They pay well but you work long hours.  They exercise the right to hold you 16 hours if needed.  That can become exhausting.  Besides time away and work atmosphere, they pony up the dough."
good,Management is a problem. I was passed over for a management position in favor of a friend of the HR rep with no experience at all in the business.
good,Great company to start.Good hours for morning people. No advancement. Pay above minimum. Be ready to be on your feet for 8 hrs. No permanent hours of work.
good,It's a place that offers job security. You will work plenty of hours at times. Co-workers are fun and easy to work with. There's not much room for advancement but you get a decent wage.
good,"On a typical dayI strap units that comes off the conveyor belt. I assist out in shipping and receiving and drive the forklift as needed."
good,International Paper was a great and productive place to work. Management was considerate and cooperative. Employees were treated extremely well and properly paid.
good,you never know what you will have to run from day to day. The Production Mgr. is always changing the run schedule  hourly most days. The tough thing to do is keep up with the changes.
good,Rotating shifts and work all holidays.  Pay is great and overtime available. Gainsharing also paid. Benefits great when you able to be off to use them. Moral is very poor after you actually begin working.
good,Lots of Drama and lack of good management in the nursing department.  There is no teamwork its everyone for themselves and no one cares if you have a family or children.
good,"I liked working there, because the job was easy I drove a fork lift and kept wood stacked in ware house. I also loaded and unloaded trucks sometimes when it was necessary."
good,manage crew members and machine line ups on a daily bases to assure orders meet delivery times. also work close with customers to make sure we are following   the quality process.
good,Worked too many hours at month when i was in accohnting department...was not the place for me with small children at the time...month end was stressful
good,"Made some great friendships with the employees. Management is always being turned over, new management doesn't care about the employees. Asks you to give them your all but in return they wont give you anything."
good,"Dds , manutenção preventiva ou atendimento de maquina quebrada, nível de supervisão excelente , nível de gerencia regular, equipe de trabalho bem coesa e unida , falta de treinamento na manutenção de equipamentos, tem que aprender sempre na raça essa é também a parte mais difícil do trabalho , aprendi a trabalhar sempre com segurança total e sem improvisação sempre com conhecimento e de forma técnica , parte mais agradável o reconhecimento por parte dos profissionais da produção tanto a nível operacional quanto de supervisão."
good,"I would remove the stacks of graded veneer, after it came out of the dryers, and before it was made into plywood, take it to the warehouse so that it could be used to make plywood."
good,"A good paying job, but absolutely zero regard for your personal life. Just spent 2-1/2 years working 6-7 day weeks and sometimes 7 12s. Lots of rules which are very important on a rotating basis, depending on who is visiting the plant, or what type of safety problem has visited your region. This particular plant, which has been owned by 4 different entities in it's 36 year history, has had 23 general managers. Basically controlled chaos. Maintenance managers seldom hit the 2 year mark, and often not one year. If they ever settle into a discernable pattern of cohesive productivity it will be a boon to everyone employed there. If you are a person who values organization and productivity you will be frustrated."
good,Temporary employment that doesn't hire permanent. Once orders are complete the workers are laid off until further notice.
good,"It is a really nice job but for a girl it is really heavy, more when you have to toasted the trash can when sometime they are really heavy. When you are a temp you don't get benefits as they employees do.You don't get to request days off or get sickly hours. And they don't respect your days off."
good,"No climate control in the summer, meaning working in 105 degree heat in June - August. Supervisors are hit and miss. Union. Will take at least 10 years to get on first shift. Work almost every Saturday as mandatory."
good,"Pay is good but not great. Some of the machines that you will run do not pay enough for the hassle you deal with. The hassle is 30% the machine 70% management. The place is very clique. They play favorites. They have a company handbook but the reason I'm not sure. Office workers seem to not be friendly with the machine operators that work in extreme conditions and make the company money... Big divide between the two. Management is very unorganized. One day told one thing the next something different. No one is on the same page and nothing is ever final. Which causes plenty of mistakes and confusion. "
good,Great pay but no time to spend it. Worked as 1st helper in evol flexo. 12 hrs everyday 6-7 days a week. Management is horrible well changed a little after taking over Temple-inland. Really fast paced work and they will not slow machines down for anything. Really strict on safety but dont repirt injury or you'll get terminated
good,not satisfied some of the management dont do there job correctly alot of favortism goes on and alot of people who are actually hard workers go on unacknowledged
good,Great work environment but management fails to listen to employee concerns and provides very limited opportunities for growth.
good,Great experience in label manufacturing for canned goods.  Good learning experience for myself because it was my initial position in the manufacturing area.  Good people to work with.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to help build the safety culture throughout the mill an see it make a difference..
good,"Pays great but be prepared to work like a dog if You work shift work. Safety is hard core and 1 mistake can get you fired. But I enjoy my occupation, so theres a trade off."
good,"fun, a lot of overtime, insurance wasn't all that good was hard working with staff"
good,It's work and it pays the bills. Days are busy and there is a lot of overtime. Some management is very knowledgeable. Co-workers are enjoyable to work with.
good,"fast paced work place, with production needs a must. good group of people to work with. advancement is possible if you apply yourself. hardest part of the job was managing people who did not want to change. the most enjoyable was getting those same people to want to change"
good,"International Paper, a Fortune 500 company and global leader in paper and packaging products."
good,I start my day by reviewing what I did the previous day and then planning the day ahead. Making sure I follow up with any customers and then hitting the road to meet with existing customers or cold calling new ones.  I work with very hepful co-workers who are always willing to help.  The most enjoyable part of the day is getting out and meeting new people.   The hardest part is just when I feel like I have let a customer down if we have messed up on an order.
good,"I got up at 3am commenced morning routine and left home for 40 minute drive there. I clocked in at 4:53 am and start work at 5am. I laid 8 foot oak sticks every two feet in stacks off lumber totaling 63 layers in preparation for the kilns to dry the wood. We got a 10 minute break at 8am. Lunch break around 11-12. 10 minute break at 2-3pm. Shut down for the day at about 5:30pm depending on supplies. I learned relatively nothing here, it was pretty mind numbing manual labor. There was quite a bit of danger involved with so many moving parts. Management was ok, when they weren't trying to stuff their own pockets with inflated hours. Coworkers were alright, but there was quite a bit of racial slurs used and backstabbing. There was a definite generation gap there. The hardest part of the job was the long hours coupled with the lack of sleep. there were no enjoyable parts of the job aside from the occasional banter between coworkers."
good,"stressfull working with inexperience management with inconsistent decision making which makes for long hours and working weekends."
good,"Days were mostly busy with many orders needing expedited billing. The fact that the job involved calculations and formulas was a great way to ""exercise"" your brain. The fact that the work load was unevenly divided contributed to low morale among the team."
good,"Good work life balance, competitive salary, opportunity to work in different teams and in different verticals, fair people policies,"
good,Good customer service environment. Great place to learn about human resources.
good,"I like both my positions with this company very much, but the way in which this company manged it's employees left a big gap between workers and managment. I feel that the disconnect fom that lead to alot of the problems that accure there in the office as well as the factory floor."
good,IP became my employer after they acquired my company. I'm part of the IT infrastructure there and worked hard with the IP IT staff to integrate the infrastructures. The people with whom I worked were very sharp. Can't offer too much about the company outside of the IT department or what a typical day is like. Sorry.
good,Really the only thing I can say about it is that the pay is great.  Theres really not much work balance.  If you like money this is the place to be.  Also great benefits
good,Great job security but little life work balance.  The company expects a lot of your time and there was very little support in help getting the job done.
good,"The Company values and is a high performer in the areas of sustainability, customer commitment, and leadership development.  The Company is behind the curve on data analytics innovation, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and progressive work policies such as parental leave and remote working.  Many good and talented people work at IP, and it can be a joy to work with them."
good,Jus be ready to sacrifice alot. Dont really have family time. Working from Monday thru Saturday. You will have some Saturday day of mostly a 5 percent chance.
good,"International paper was a fun and exciting place to work at ,"
good,"Travail intéressant pour souder sur de la tuyauterie inox et acier, soudure en hauteur dans environnement un peu pollué,du aux odeurs des produits chimiques, et parfois dans des endroits étroits pour souder, mais bon, sa fait partir du métier et du boulot."
good,Union people are always trying to start some sort of drama .. work is easy people are friendly for most part .. they can mandatory you 12s for as long as they want
good,"It’s a very fast pace job. It can be overwhelming at times. You have to really pay attention to your work space and the box on the line. You must maintain the computer, the line, watching the boxes, running up stairs to maintain line."
good,A typical day at work is coming in to see what we have for the day. I would get my orders together and make sure we have enough stock for the orders. We would run the machine as fast as possible. Management wanted us to run faster than the machine could go.
good,The pay is the only thing good at this job. I think the management and communication with employees could improve drastically. Safety isues need to be fixed in a more timely manner.
good,Engaged in all forms of labor work necessary for the completion of tasks or shift. Cleaned as well as repaired and kept maintenance up to par in my area of work.
good,"This is not the job for people with a family other than that it is a good place to work. Long hours and you can be held back at any time, including right before its time to go home. Causes burnout really fast as well."
good,I was a very invloved employee . So was given multiple opportunities to better myself and took them . I Just cant handle 3rd shift anymore. I have recommended to many people to work here.
good,"Depends on who you are. Slackers are very much ""loved"". "
good,This was a decent local job but didn't pay well. I really tried hard to make things west in the Pacific North west but the culture doesn't  welcome outsiders.
good,"Either you're making boxes, or you're making cardboard displays with a glue gun. Do as many as possible by the time your shift ends. Fun, uptempo, competitive job."
good,"Long ridiculous work hours with little to no training. Many very unhappy employees who treat new hires poorly. They belittle, berate, insult, make fun of and exclude new employees. Was treated ok by supervisors but they ignore the real issues on the floor which causes the high turnover rate. Very unfortunate. Pay is good, but at what cost? If you want to feel unappreciated and worthless then this is the place for you. No amount of money is worth losing your self worth and respect. Don’t be blinded by the dollar signs."
good,"I learned how to operate machines that turned corragated sheets of paper into box containors.I became a certfied clamptruck,forklift operator, I recieved safety awards."
good,"This facility is the best company Bay Minette has right now.  Need to get involved with the non profit organizations in the area, such as setting up Scholarship funds, The Heart walks, Breast Cancer Awareness, and other important interests in the county that largely affect the employees on a daily bases."
good,"Great job if you are looking for good pay and benefits. Plant life sucks though. No windows in work areas and smells bad, chemical all the time. Managers suck. Rotating shifts, say good bye to a sleep pattern."
good,it is a job.  it will be hard work and it pays better than retail or food.  you will be tired but you won't be rich.  you'll work a lot of overtime and be required to do so.
good,"I work closely with the Finance Department, the Purchasing Department & the Finished Goods Management.  I work to keep inventories accurate, to meet production goals, & to meet financial polices and controls."
good,"It is a corrugated cardboard factory. It is located in Byesville, ohio. It has only one shift. I started on third shift. Then third shift was closed down, and i went to first shift."
good,"They had lots of work during peak season although they did layoff in the winter, there was low moral due to bad management, they seemed to pick and choose who they would write up, they had goals that were to high to meet."
good,International Paper was a nice place to work.  One had to be prepared to work at a quick pace as quality production was the main goal. Coworkers were generally friendly towards one another and helped create a positive work enviornment.
good,aprendi trabalhar em outros áreas que não conhecia
good,"Overall environment is layed back, company is flexible with employees regarding time off when unplanned things occur.  If you are looking for advancement opportunities within a company I would not recommend this company.  I was stagnated with no hope for advancement."
good,It’s a good job. It’ll keep you busy and overtime is plentiful. Just be aware that it’s 12 hour shifts everyday and that you have to be very safety conscious. And obviously attendance is a must.
good,"very busy company plenty of work to keep a man busy when I was employed their they always had classes to advance your knowledge from plc training, laser alignment and vibration analysis truly a great company to get training to help production, reliability and greatly improve the knowledge of the maintenance departments"
good,I would work there again if pay is raised..i love the bindery invironment..there was no cafateria..but overall it was a ok place..it was just kinda far from where i lived.
good,"Internaional paper was a fast paced production job. "
good,"I worked in a fast-paced, smart customer service oriented office five days a week and sometimes on Saturdays. It was a casual professional environment."
good,"The two tier pay scale causes the paper mill to become a revolving door, two people doing the same job would have different pay rates because of when they hired in."
good,"good pay and benefits. long hours, questionable management. good local job. good co-workers. good insurance and retirement benefits. not enough communication."
good,"Upper management has no clue.   Immediate manager was one of the better i have worked for.   Usually worked 7 days a week.   All holidays were cut short.   Great job, bad mgmt at that plant"
good,"Enjoyed working and learning at International Paper in Indianapolis. "
good,The pay was great I was only labor grade three and I was making 17 dollars an hour. The problem I had with this company being on night shift working 12s is that I never had tome for anything
good,"poor work life balance- but good money, the swing shift is hard to adjust to. not great communication between departments and outages are very long..."
good,gained alot of close friend and skills. management allowed us to self manage and work at a controlled and challenging pace. All the employees seemed to care.
good,"The pay is outstanding, with long hires. At times you received 1 weekjend a month off at times none if some one was to call in. Would work close to 3 months with out day off because if some calls off during your rotation it would take that long to receive a day off. Pay is good but long hires 12 hour days based upen man power. Never have the employees to cover all shifts."
good,"Reasonable pay and good benefits, but advancement is very slow and you need to be willing to work 2nd or 3rd shift to move forward. if you are a patient and hard worker you will find success."
good,Overall up to this point it has been an enjoyable experience.  I would like to continue with the company however they have decided to consolidate my role.
good,"Hourly wage was great, plant was unionized. Average insurance and benefits. Vacation time was first come/first serve and senority based. Forced overtime if the following shift crew members were no show, or take half a point. Management had favoritism towards rear end kissers."
good,"Empresa dinâmica, alta demanda de trabalho. "
good,"Ran paper folding machines - "
good,"my opinion, not the best company I have worked for. they are fair with compensation and benefits. opportunity for advancement in a huge negative. if your somebody who is wanting to advance up the company/corporate ladder I would tell to look into other places to work."
good,"Hard work but was challenging, I enjoyed that. Management scared of their jobs due to corporate management being terrible. Worked with all employees to change safety culture from terrible to top tier. Changed management/employee relations from non existent to very good. We set world production records and we were the flagship papermill for IP and they shut us down to take production to Brazil for slave labor and hardly any pay."
good,"It's been almost 5 years since I worked there, so things have likely changed. The management has always had good and bad waves and the attitudes of the people generally reflect that. Not just speaking from the viewpoint of someone who worked there for 6 years but from someone who has had multiple family members working there since before the mill started up."
good,"Fast Paced environment, can be stressful if not prepared for work. Good benefits and great place to learn the business. It can be hot so its best to know this before starting"
good,Its was very productive but the work environment was not the type I would like to be around. I did not agree with some other's actions and word choices.
good,"They pay very well and will train new employees.  Management is all new and they are turning IP around. Hardest part of this job is being away from family so much.  Long days, out of town a lot, and only one day off a week."
good,"Nice place to work. Very understanding. Flexible hours, friendly staff/management. Excellent colleagues, Free and trust to complete tasks.  Allows for family life."
good,Long hrs hot in summer cold in winter..awesome place to work great staff & managment...there wasn't any room for growth in my field of interest which is CNC machine work...I set up and operated a j&l post glue machine trouble shoot and did slight maintenance
good,Fast paced and safe place to work. Team effort is strongly encouraged. Lots of opportunity to learn other machines and other parts of operation. Opportunity to go from assistant to operator. Also many opportunities to change shifts.
good,"I enjoyed working there. Their are too many lay-offs. I was a good worker there and was always on time for my job."
good,I do not wish to participate in the review summary process. I would like to complete the application process and continue my job search.  Thank you and enjoy your day
good,"It was a place to make a good living.   For many years it was a good place to work.  However, all things change and it became more profit motivated at the expense of the employee satisfaction."
good,"Prós: A empresa apresenta boa cultura de segurança fabril e oportunidades de carreira para o ambiente administrativo."
good,"Overall Review,Moderate dealing with laminated Cardboard and Presses to form and glue them together to form Boxes, for the type of Product you need them for."
good,Perda de conhecimento técnico ao demitir funcionarios mais antigos
good,Empresa a nivel internacional con operaciones en México
good,"I only worked here for a short time as a temp.  While I was there, it seemed like a nice place to work and the people were friendly.  I was working on specific projects and they allowed me to work independently which was nice."
good,this place no longer exists it was shut down due to the world going digital and the need for paper not being needed as much as it use to be back before computers.
good,A international paper de Paulínia passa por mudanças após joint venture logo sofre com conflitos de agências entretanto possui características satisfatórias impares como custear parte de minha formação.
good,I was a machine operator at IP and was good at what I did. I was able to meet production on almost a daily basis. The job was difficult at times because I was working a 12 hour shift and always scrambling to produce to keep our numbers up for the company.
good,The start of my career at the Mansfield mill was great it started me on the path of growth and opportunity within the company. The management staff at the time did a great job assisting me as I transitioned from an hourly employee to salaried. Great team
good,We come in and wait to be sent to a certain station then from then on we work three to five take a break. Come back same station and finish our work untill its beak time again. the hardest part of this job is standing for a long period of time thats about it. Most enjoyable part of this job is good people nobody acts above anybody.
good,The job doesn't need to be stressful but is made stressful due to poor quality in management. If you work here it's the kind of job you don't get time off you take it. I consider myself a hard worker and have never missed a day of work in my life until I worked here for a coule of years.
good,If you like to work a lot and not have much of a life outside of work this is the place for you. Not hard work not bad work just there a lot.
good,I liked to work for this company. It's a company that you can grow your professional relationship with our partners and clients
good,"In a typical day working within the operational site between the machines and most of the time spent with the blue collars."
good,"Most of my experience in the area is mainly in the maintenance department. Many different types of machines in various states are delivered for fixing, replacing, etc..The management and the co-workers are decent to work with. The hard part of the job is to exploit the problem, resolve and ship it on time. Seeing the machine functions on folding the boxes is always interesting experience."
good,"safety meetings that deal with health work enivorment ."
good,Productive environment with opportunities for growth.  Very diverse.  Plenty opportunities to learn and grow with the company through experience and training.
good,Very strict!! Too much paper work!! Not enough pay for operators. Good co workers. Management is always watching you to do something wrong then they tell you after you did it.
good,I learned how to cook and make there burgers and fries. The management was good my coworker was very nice and respectful.
good,"It's been too long since I left to be able to right a valid review of this company.  I enjoyed by job while I was there, just needed a change from doing the same thing for 10 years."
good,Enjoyed company and co-worker was a very pleasant company to work at.The pay was very low for area.During time i was here supervisor and plant manager were new to there job but they did fine.
good,"I love the job, and it is one of the best I've ever had.  I just can't work 2nd shift or the overtime anymore. I've basically been working 60-70 hours in a week and I don't see my family and friends as much as I'd like."
good,"excelente lugar para trabajar, buen manejo de personal, buenas prestaciones,"
good,The co workers I worked with were great people the management played a lot of favoritism the job paid great and had excellent benefits
good,"Every Monday at work we have a ten to fifteen minute safety meeting. We talk about any injuries that have occur or focus keeping workers safe. You never know what to expect when get to the machine line. If it's quite on the line that's not good. Meaning the machines are not running. The the first thing I do when I get to my machine is communicate with my the operator about the machine. After talking about how the machine ran or any problems, I began to clean up my machine if it's not running. After inspecting the machine, I like to get all my paperwork together. I write down a list of items I may need from the utility guy such as: light or dark oil, ink, tape, water, paperwork, rags, glue etc...... I learn something new everyday working with machines. They are not predictable. Management is tough to deal depending who but for the most part I don't have any problems. If your putting out numbers they are happy and easy to talk to. If your not putting out numbers, you will get that look. Co workers are outgoing, fun, young and helpful. The hardest part of the job is trying to fix the machine, after the last operator wrap the machine up. Sometimes that can knock the machine out of timing. That can take all day to fix. I enjoy keeping my machine running and trying to put up the most numbers for the day. If you get a certain production number, you will get gift card for fred myer."
good,"fast paced"
good,I believe that this is a great company to work for if you are will to be on time and will to work in extreme heat. I have enjoyed working for this company and recommend others.
good,"un dia de trabajo es agradable ya que en esta empresa le dan prioridad a la integridad del trabajador, es diecir primero esta la seguridad del trabajador, y despues las prioridades de la empresa"
good,I like working here but I have little time to spend with family and friends because of all the overtime. The benefits are great though and if you don't mind working all the time it's an overall good job.
good,"I mainly work here cause my days off gave me the chance to go to school and etc. I work securty for this company and mostly I sign in truck drivers and sign them out using the company's data entry software. I work by myself mostly, but have worked with wonderful people from time to time. The most hardest part of the job is staying up all night. As long I had something to do that wasn't an issues. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting drivers from different parts of the states or world. They have stroies to tell you. :)"
good,I was employed here for many years and I enjoyed it.  Got along with most co-workers and management.  I use to love taking my family to the summer event every year but i got laid off and it was over.
good,"El sector se me hizo muy interesante. "
good,"I enjoyed working with everyone, I felt like this was my second home and family. Everyone got along and got the job done. This position was through temp agency."
good,Fast paced work environment. Sometimes too fast  some of the senior operators don't have the time nor patience to train new hires. Alot of the equipment is old and doesn't work properly. So you are pushing and rocking 5-600lbs rolls of paper.
good,good home time poor driver managers and poor equipment. have to hand unload freight every stop. load average pay. fun fun fun
good,"Not enough time in the day to get all the work done.  Everyone is over loaded with work.  If you work hard you can advance.  "
good,"Decent job, and good job security. Downfall is being in Memphis. Salary is average for location of company. People are polite and personable, very relaxed working environment."
good,Staff was easy to work with & everyone was helpful in learning the industry. The internship seemed underappreciated and the tasks given were very vague.
good,The money was great. The work place left a lot to be desired in the treatment of women. This job let me support my family. This indpls  plant was closed in june of 2013.
good,"it was a great place to learn about paper making,I did a lot of different things there,that you could only learn at a papermill great people to work with and to learn from,to bad it shut down"
good,they have the majority of the market and you can learn a lot with the company because they can help you learn.  If your willing to learn about machines or other aspects of this field then they can help.
good,I would say the hardest part of the job is the rotating shifts!  It is hard on the body and it also makes activities outside of work almost impossible unless you take a point!  They also have a tendency to switch which crew your on without concern for what you have going on outside of the job.
good,Good place to work with the right management too many changes and some back stabbing poor attitudes at the plant I worked at This rating is based on the plant I worked at. The company overall is o.k.
good,"Lean organization with big job roles requiring relocation for advancement and a lot of travel.  Very political.  Who you mingle with matters.  If you don't mingle, you don't matter.  Good business practices and general corporate support.  Opportunities are unlimited if you perform and socialize."
good,"Nice place to start and finish your career. Streamline, lean manufacturing. Great co-workers, learned a lot from everyone there....and also a  lot of life lessons."
good,"Did not like the job I started with, but I hung in there until I became a equipment operator, forklift operator, my job was loading lumber on flatbeds trucks."
good,"I.P. Carson has a great safety culture. The management has always"
good,Fortune 500 company that push for money and didn't focus on employees or familes.  Great employees but difficult managers were put in place.
good,"This was a good company to work for.  My typical day was general secretarial duties.  It was somewhat hard to get used to the different paper companies within the company, but I did it."
good,"I was hired right out of school and was very happy to work for one of the best companies in the city. Work is not easy, but a lot depends on your management - he or she can always make even the hardest task feel easy. I think this company has provided a very good foundation for my career and I am thankful for that."
good,Jobs pay is good for out area. The supervisors and management is good. The ninety day training period pay is more than min. wage.
good,"Good experience and opportunity for younger employment seekers. However, I would suggest to those considering working for IP to get in, get experience and move on within a few years."
good,Hard to move up in company due to long term employees. Everyone knows everyone and are friendly.  New job openings are very rare.
good,"My typical day was 8 hours."
good,"Average 8 hour day was typical, employment was like a revolving door coworkers came and went - Supervision was questionable"
good,This workplace is literally revolving doors. Everyday someone is leaving the job or getting fired. Next day whole group of new people.
good,I like my job it just there is now progression for my current position
good,"A typical day is fast paced and challenging. I have learned about the vast, interesting world of college recruiting. IP has introduced this to me and it has allowed me to understand different areas of HR greatly."
good,I liked working there for the most part. I only left because Duro was buying the plant and I was told before hand that everyone was going to be fired and have to go back through the application process. I have a family to support so I couldn't afford to lose any work time.
good,"Ip can be a difficult work place."
good,"Always a few new people coming in every few months ,people you work with are never your true friends, just co-workers. Staying up all night was the hardest part of the job."
good,Kept busy until time to go home. Learned how to operate and repair machinery.
good,"● Picked and sorted shipments received"
good,"I would start the day with basic rounds, talk with operators for any ongoing problems from previous shifts, log onto the computer for any work assignments or work orders to be done make arrangements with shift supervisor to schedule work done on machines, take calls for any emergency repairs etc..."
good,Wasn't there long enough to really put together a competent review of the company.
good,"this job was ok i enjoyed it because it fasted paced, but unconsistant work"
good,"A typical day is taking inbound and outbound calls from customer.  Assisting the customer and sales representatives with products, orders, and billing inquiries."
good,This was a very good place to work. During the time I was there it was a fun workplace. my job was to start my mourning with a daily inspection around my work area .as the day past I sorted orders that were sent to me using my fork truck and my computer. locating and staging each order in its proper bay. I learned about safety in a warehouse with lots of mobile equipment. my leaders were always available on call.co-workers were like family. hardest part of the job was just meeting the demands of our consumers. The  best part was meeting a good group of people to work with.
good,"The employees of International Paper are extremely proud of our achievements. Dedication, teamwork and engagement is what fosters excellence"
good,"Process purchase orders"
good,"I took this position with the expectation of advancement with time to better pay, but there was no opportunity, after a year and a half, to change positions or improve pay opportunity."
good,The workforce was fantastic to work with but upper management could not give a clear direction on how to meet goals in an ever changing business environment.
good,workplace is ok. Short breaks. Management is ok. not much room for advancement. Good supervisor.
good,"Worked with highly skilled coworker, to produce high quality paper in a wworld class setting."
good,"The company may not be a bad company to work for,but the plant i work for is not all that great.I here the mill is much better."
good,benefits and insurance for full-time employees. Retirement plan for full-time employees.
good,"Hard Working people on the production side of the floor."
good,"É uma boa empresa, para o profissional que busca estabilidade em um emprego. Porém peca no reconhecimento de tal."
good,"-company maintaing good policies for everything like maintenance,operation,ISO,"
good,Only there for a couple of months. General cleaning of the work spaces.
good,Its ok I guess. But I know I can do so much better than this place.
good,"if it didnt close down i would still be there, it was a good job to have"
good,I enjoyed the job assignment but wasnt a long term I enjoyed working with the front office and truck drivers.
good,worked as a utility worker in a mill under a supervisor. My job got cut because of the supervisor being a little discriminating.
good,This was a summer job of mine so i was basically going to work just to save up a little money for college.
good,"Typical day was maintaining customer satisfaction with product quality, constant order status w/daily deliveries and logistical and manufacturing schedules. Most time spent in the field (customers within 150 mi radius) and working with numerous buying influences to keep production lines running effectively with our product."
good,"11 hours a typical days work, teamwork and safety makes a great workplace, some good managers and some not so good to work with,very nice co workers,getting product in a timely matter, hearing customers are happy with the product and delivered on time."
good,"The company is too big, sometimes a little bureaucracy。 Used to the biggest paper company in the world. Since the paper industry is going towards to a dead end, in the past few years the company had successfully transformed itself to the biggest packaging company in the world, with exceeded production capacities. In future the performance will tie in how it goes the overall economic recovery progress. When everyone tends to buy more stuffs, the packaging company will be doing good."
good,a typical day at work i tried to make very professional in all job skills and duties.
good,Made sure all trucks/rail cars where loaded properly. Made sure all the customers received the proper paper work.
good,hot work place overall not bad room for improvments worked alot of days straight 12 straight 2 off
good,Infelizmente a International Paper vem passando por situações de contratação no nivel Diretoria que acabaram por prejudicar a empresa em seus resultados.
good,"Safety is top priority, followed by quality and productivity. Continuous improvement initiatives are always evolving. Highest paying employer in the area."
good,"Not a very fun place to work... Hot in summer, and cold in winter. This is my personal opinion, I didn't enjoy working there myself because of all the overtime we had to work."
good,"I loved working in the Construction Field at International Paper Mill.  I was always busy, worked hard everyday, and enjoyed the work I did..I met alot of people whilw working there."
good,"Boxes coming down the conveyer belt, i had to b stack them, in a unique order, make sure stack is secure to be shipped and not flimsy to fall. Once secure shipped down the v line into trucks."
good,"Empresa com crescimento profissional restrito à afinidade da gestão, infelizmente competência é secundário e lidar com o ambiente de panelinha desmotiva permanecer como colaborador. Muitos gestores para poucos subordinados, liderança fraca visando apenas a permanência no cargo. Contudo, oferece certa estabilidade, pagamentos em dia, com salários e benefícios compatíveis à uma empresa de grande porte."
good,Workplace was average. Co workers was great. Management needed a lil improved. It's an old plant but there where making improvements on making it a safe place to work.
good,It's a great place to work if your young with no family and looking to make good money. Although the work schedule can be a little hectic coworkers made it bearable.Overall GOOD MONEY
good,"Very hot temperatures.  required to wear heavy fire resistance jackets year round. That is if you is on boiler operator job.  Paper machine, hot also."
good,International Paper is such a large company that the workers' experience greatly depends on their management and department.  Overall working hours are flexible and the environment is not too fast paced or cut throat.
good,"I experienced some issues with HR in regards to contract obligations, but I enjoyed my day-to-day work and the people I worked with. I was given enough autonomy to learn and grow on my own and enough guidance to stay on track"
good,"This was a great place to work. The only drawback is that some (me included), couldn't juggle ""southern swing"" shift intervals, and a home life. "
good,"IP is a decent place to work. Generally speaking, you need to enter IP at the start of your career; mid-career hires are abnormal and seem to lag behind in promotions. Now, it seems like IP focuses too much on enfranchising new hires, especially engineers. Non-engineers don't have the career opportunities of their engineer peers. Paper Mill life is not for everyone, but it is generally tolerable if you enjoy the outdoors. There is so much potential at IP that remains to be unlocked but silos are left in place where there should be consolidation and reorganization. The culture of the company is a good one, but in mediocre performers are rarely held accountable. Salary is decent after several years, but IP will underpay you until you have over five years in your role."
good,"Expected to be on time and perform repairs quickly, If repairs carry over breaks or shift change expected to finish repairs first / work over,"
good,"I did training, Industrial Engineering, special projects, inventory, floor mapping, quality control, process flow, line setup, etc. There could be improvements in management."
good,"management sees alot of unsafe procedures and dont say anything about it, workers that has been there for years they show alot of favortism, racistism still exist in the paper mill mill, employees are treated differently"
good,"ok to work for .. @ times stressful but still very safety is the # 1 so they say priority Always worried about  the bottom line, still a good place to work for."
good,"Paid holidays, 401k plan, medical insurance. 12 hour shifts. Working in a plant is HOT especially in the summer and you are on your feet all day. Different days off every other week."
good,Working at International Paper was a good experience mainly because of the contact I had with people from different backgrounds and places. The industry of paper is all about the company worldwide.
good,"Lots of overtime opportunities. Very fast paced work"
good,"Busy,  Loud ,dangerous, nasty, an plenty of work to keep busy for years to come . Not a place to start learning the construction life .  More times than not safety isn't the main focus."
good,Company always changing with new owners and alot of downsizing. No real job security  and definitely no room for advancement. I worked there for 5 years and they didn't want to advancement me.
good,"A typical day at work for me was a start of around 7am with a quick overview of production from the night before, to determine if changes need to be made to meet the customers needs."
good,"Instead of putting the right people on the job, they throw people at a problem, creating a poor work/life balance amongst salary employees. It is particulary bad at this mill and because this is a very difficult mill to work at, it is hard to get people internally to come here and it causes the mill not to release people to other mills for different opportunities, forcing good people to leave or want to leave."
good,"It was a good place to work but management could use some improvement. They do nor really take some of the workers concerns and ist hard for the employees, even when they try to do their best"
good,"I enjoyed working here but that job was not for a family man. I worked long, hard hours and swing shift. I got a new job so I would have a work/family balance."
good,"Friendly staff  "
good,Good pay and benefits. Close to home. They offer safety lunches when we hit out goals. They do give heat advisory breaks when it gets really warm out.
good,"good amount of work, i learned how to drive a forklift and operate the clamp attachment. management is tough but fair. hardest part about the day was finding something to do during the downtime to keep yourself occupied. the most enjoyable part of the day is when you clock out."
good,Loved my coworkers. Very hard hours and labor hope u have a good back. And no family or responsibilities outside of work cuz you will be there at least 60hrs a week
good,"i personally moved up in the company pretty fast, i went from a temp to hire in six months and to a operator position in less than two years, the pay is decent but family time is not important to them. you will be on your feet anywhere from 8 to 12 hrs at a time and might not get a break."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is the co-workers. They all stick together and everybody have wonderful stories to tell. The hardest part of the job is the overtime.
good,"Go direct to work station, left alone to perform task as per training. Performed work assigned as to company specifications, working as a team to get production finished. worked for quantity and quality. "
good,"turn overs are high,if you work your shift and the next team mate doesn't show up you get pointed for their absenteeism. work 6/7 days a week. you cant make plans in advance weekend work is posted on thurs after 1.drama non stop but they pay good if all you want to do is work. management does not communicate with employees or other management. It is a union plant."
good,"Typical day at work is boring and of no variety. Ive learned my job and more. Management has changed a couple times and all seem to be positive individuals. Our co-workers are of a variety but easy to work with. Hardest part of the job is the hours we work, working all night is not for everyone and is needed on occasion with some jobs but day in day out will burn you out. Most enjoyable part of my job is knowing there is not a layoff when I go in and the benefits they are providing."
good,I worked shift on one and two paper machine. All equipmentl that needed maintenance on electrical and instrumentation I repaired.
good,A typical day at work consists of grading lumber while it comes down a chain. I learned how to apply many rules within a few seconds in order to grade the lumber accurately. The hardest part was flipping the lumber.
good,The Management team is one like I have never seen before. Micromanagement is an understatement.
good,Getting paid 5.00$ less starting pay then the company's that delivery product to warehouse.  You don't really work for IP
good,Working for International Paper was just another day at work. Managment was very strict and didn't want no part in fixing machines to improve production.
good,"Worked hard everyday to meet or exceed production goals. Always learning somthing new about corrugator. Management was good, but not very often ""a job well done"". Worked well together as a team. Getting production to be right on old machines. Working with my teammates and dinners put on by the company for good safety and production."
good,Lots of over time if you want it. Most of the people you work with will more than willing to pitch in an help you out. Being stuck on 2nd shift just wasn't for me.
good,"Great group of guys I worked with loved working there but, unfortunately I had a hardship very personal which caused me to miss work. Manager and supervisor said it was OK but, turned their backs on me.  Human resource is a joke."
good,Wasn’t a bad job for a summer helper job during summer break off from school. Did come to realize that management was poor and that it is a loud and hot environment during the summer. Easily over 100 inside warehouse during the summer. Other than that the pay was great and there was quite a few good co workers there.
good,There is a lot to learn. Plenty of training to be done. The faster you get your training done the faster you get a raise. You really have to take situations into your own hands to get things done. Dont be afraid to ask if you dont know. WORK SAFE BE SAFE!
good,"A empresa é excelente, mas precisa repensar em seu estilo de liderança. A rotatividade de profissionais está muito alta, causando uma falta de engajamento dos profissionais."
good,If you like long hours working most weekends and faulty equipment then this is the place for you if your a transfer cart driver more power to you I’ve never been so frustrated with a machine in my life between that not working the way it is supposed to and the conveyors not working properly there is a lot of extra unnecessary work on your end
good,"""Expectation to constantly check work email while on vacation or Higherarchical organizational structure that can reward tenure and age over capability and performance.after you leave work did not contribute to a good work/life balance."
good,Decide carefully on where you want work and thouroughly look at the situation for a long-term perspective. Choose a shift that will accomedate your personal life.
good,This job ok lil stressful sometimes due to lack of training on new hires also cant make plans due to calls off they make you stay to cover the empty spot
good,Good people pays real good use to be lots of overtime now they cut the hrs to 40 trying to find something better line Term and better for the family to be happy
good,International Paper is an above average employer in the Texarkana region.  You have opportunities for upward mobility as your qualified for.  Nothing unpleasant to report
good,Will work about 72 hours so a lot of overtime but great pay! Hard labor and little break times caused for exhaustion. Work 6 days a week all days at least 12 hour shifts
good,I believe the job is what you make it... There are good days and bad days. In my particular field it is requisite for us to work long hours with little time off but I accept that as part of the job and certainly there is always room for improvement in all aspect of business operations...
good,As good of benefits as you can get but prepare to have a bad balance of personal life. Hard to get great training because of hearing protection and this job is super hot and humid. The breaks are all paid and break room is nice. High turn over rates make it so you have no regular schedule of 8 hours so prepare to go weeks if 12 hour days. You must be tough to work here.you can move to different departments but you position has to be filled for that to happen and that could take months because people don’t last here.
good,"Nice people, hard fast paced job.  Follow safety rules, show up on time and you will do ok.  Just don't expect any time off especially in first 90 days, and that includes family emergency, miss more that one day and you're toast!  No exceptions"
good,"A typical day at International Paper would be fast-pace to accommodate the workload.  Occasionally we would have some change orders that required a more stressful environment and more hazardous situation."
good,"Admiro o jeito em que a empresa se preocupa com seu profissionais tanto com experiencias carreira e suas seguranças, pois mostra a  todos lá dentro como é importante a empatia de pensar no próximo."
good,"See resume, I worked 12 hour days and there was a lot of opportunity for overtime. The company was sold to a third party and they are reducing our wages. I drive an hour to gt there, so it is not financially solvent for e to stay with the reduced pay."
good,company don t care about employees and no communication what so ever. never know whats going on around the plant and nothing is ever being fixed. everything is fixed by duct tape
good,international paper is decent place to work the wages are good and the over time is in abundance.  allho their do seem to be some flaws in the company itself some people in charge seem to be more prejudice against certain people than they are others. it would seem like some people are treated differently or special for no real reason
good,"Great company and fantastic business model. If you like the corrugated sales division and you enjoy selling boxes to local companies, you will succeed!"
good,Productive but could be better if management treated all employees equal. My job is less stress but can be stressful do to machines going down for weeks so jobs cant be peformed how they are supposed to be ran. Working there i learned quite a bit all through shipping which is a plus cause i can take my skills a step farther in or outside the plant.
good,"I would simply pack cups all day into a box, until about an hour before shift change, in which I would clean the area."
good,its very cold in the winter working with iron an paper its extremely hot in the summer typical 110 120 degrees in the building face pace hardest to learn
good,No withstanding personal needs I would not be looking for other opportunities. My current personal situation requires that I relocate to the greater Memphis area to be part of the family.
good,It's Good pay especially once hired on. A lot of over time weekly. So the checks come out good. But very tiring. Coworkers are okay some help some don't just depends I guess.
good,"good company, good benefits"
good,"Es buena empresa, los directivos son los que en ocasiones hacen pesado el ambiente de trabajo."
good,"The International paper group is a secure and a safety aware group."
good,Southern swing shift does not work for me. Change shift every 7 days. Really good people to work with though. Very professional work environment......
good,"Good company to work for, job security. Good people and good place for advancement. Worked there for 11 years only left for more pay."
good,I work 12 hour shifts I run a machine all day very fast high intense job there is no time for fun we are required to hit 100% everyday to full fill our job duties
good,"Worked as an Administrative Clerk.  Helped customers with their orders on the phone and in person.  Produced the required bill of ladings for the loads and drivers, Enjoyed the customers very much, the office and warehouse fellows were great to work with."
good,"co workers are great work is easy and not tough"
good,Too much fluctuation in past 7 years with acquisitions but things are improving as people learn their roles and software essentials.  If you get a poor boss or negative co-workers it is not an enjoyable situation and unfortunately there is a lot of that in the Memphis HQ.
good,"It's ok if you are desperate, but I don't make a career out of it. Seniority is worthless, it's 100+ degrees in the summer time and will be expected to work 12 hour shifts in it. Breaks are 15 and 20 mins, Takes 3 years to get a 2nd week of vacation time. Management cares about numbers only. The machines are in poor state, very little maintenance is ever done, no matter if it slows the machine down or causes downtime. "
good,"Its a Chemical factory implementing the OSHA Standards for manufacturing paper from pulp,"
good,"Work is great management is poor, and some co-workers lie a lot."
good,Work life balance is rough but your compensated well for it. The  company is great although the type industry in some markets is on a decline but IP has well diversified products so they manage to stay afloat. Even in the most adverse economic woes.
good,Work in WArehouse dreving a clamp truck placing rolls in warehouse. Management focus on safety. We all worked together and made sure we helped each other.
good,"open door policy, laid back environment, awesome co-workers"
good,"Probably the best Corrugated company to work for."
good,"I learned ISO 140001, 5s, value-added manufacturing, and more about using matrix information.  Great place to learn.  More of a Team/family environment.  Good relationship with union too."
good,Good company to work with. Their expansions and mergers created some unrest due to acquisitions and closures. Time spent here was valuable in my development of a well rounded management style.
good,c est un environnement dynamique et stimulant avec des gens passionnés que moi. elle se démarque par la qualité de ses applications.( perfectinnenement professionnel et la promotion interne)
good,I learned a lot co-workers are very inmature
good,"Great benefits / and upper management is great . but company lie and say that you only work Mon - Friday  8 hrs rotation of 3 shifts which is not true you work 6-7 , days a work  12 hrs with no time off when they are behind. I worked 3 mths of 12 hrs shift with no off days."
good,"Easy job and not a lot of problem solving, not hole lot to job and the routine is the same on a daily basis. The job allow you to do a lot, because of the pay."
good,"After clock-in we go straight to the machine winder and start the process of making rolls. It's a non stop process. Busy all day with no down time and working in extreme heat from machines.  The most enjoyable part of my job is all my fellow coworkers and the bond we have.  The hardest part of my job is the danger and extreme atmosphere I am constantly around.  I learned a lot about machine process and operations, and gained a lot of knowledge about the industrial field.  As far as management, I have no problems with the one at International Paper.  I feel they have been fair in situations when problems have come up."
good,"Very Hard work, Hot in summer months, rarely off work and time with family. Does have a union.  You arent fully hired on until you reach 90 days and are in the union."
good,Always have to have your head on a swivel and just stay busy. The jobs themselves aren’t hard it’s the conditions that you have to work in that make the job suck along with the fact that they don’t really seem to care about your being outside of work. As long as you are willing to work it will keep you busy.
good,"Geat place to work "
good,"Te llevas un buen recuerdo de esta empresa, tal vez el salario no sea de lo mejor pero el ambiente laboral es ameno."

good,Had a very strong team. lot of interaction in production and sales. Very safe inviorment. lot of team building. Hardest part of my job was keeping facility safe and setting the standards.
good,"was a good place to work"
good,A Typical day at work is packing boxes inside boxes to ship out. What have I learn how to tell a good box from a bad box. Management was really good but at times that are hard to find when you need to talk to a Manager. The co-workers was nice people will talk just to make the time go by fast and there when you need help. The hardest part of the job was going to and back from brakes when the assembly line was in the back of the factory and the brake room was in the front of the building that will take five minues... The most enjoyable part of the job was having every weekends off.
good,Great company until they decided to outsource functions overseas.
good,"Management is very professional and works with each employee but also follows their policy strictly."
good,"Good pay, bad enviroment. depending on your plant."
good,Making boxes and working with foam easy going but stressful. Being opinionated isn't a good thing. Certain people get favored over others and if you offend others friends you get stick with less favorable jobs.
good,"International Paper is a traditional company with a culture driven by mostly internally promoted engineers with backgrounds in the manufacturing facility environment.  External hires are the exception, not the rule for middle management and above.  Flexible scheduling and working from home are not encouraged, and as a result millennial and Gen X retention is challenging. The company rewards contribution with excellent incentive compensation.  Most training is on the job."
good,"Manufacturing environment, fast paced, and safety is priority. Expect to work a lot, but have potential in advancement. If you enjoy working in industry and don't mind papermaking. IP is for you"
good,ats was one of the best all ways picking up new skill most management was nice to work with.alot of room to grow had family problems with dad pasting a great place to work.
good,Very loud and dirty! People are very nice and helpful! I really liked my job!! Management was ok. I would work there again.

good,"I worked closely with customer service, was in charge of verifying and counts that went to the customer. Proficient with Oracle 11i, would enter sorting data. I loved problem solving, like with counts or jobs that would get missed labeled. I learned the importance of case labels, worked with Pharmacuticals every day. The most enjoyable thing was getting up and knowing you had a good job to go to. I worked there for almost 25 years, made a lot friends. Management for the most part if you did your job there was no problems. The hardest part was saying goodbye to a place that had been there for over 40 years."
good,"Always learning, can be frustrating and stressful at times. Every job has its ups and downs."
good,"I think I would be still working there if I would have got to move around in got out the  warehouse , over all it’s a nice place to make money, I miss it a lot."

good,Long hours never know when you be off could work between 8 and 12 hrs great pay and health insurance. Great place if you want to climb out of a hole or looking to pay off home or car or to simply save up a few thousand
good,"Ensure the production goals were met daily. Organize work schedules by setting hours and where some employees were to work.  Oversee cycle counts along with weekly and monthly inventories. In charge of counseling and discipline as needed. Work with other managers to meet objectives. Use the management team as a support group, worked well together."

good,great company good benefits oppurtuniuty advancements and just overall great people to work with
good,good an fun place to work. management team are easy to work with
good,A typical day at work depending on the department is going in clocking in and than going too you assigned position. You may work with others but if your on machines you will be making sure boxes are printed and are folded correctly.
good,It was a nice experience and if i could i would do it again. Only thing i had a problem with is how they went by situations at the jobsite. But it was a great experience the pay was amazing. The co workers was very open to train the new comers.
good,"The management is poor, and let’s just say they have more money than brains. Other than that great job, but only for people who love to run like a chicken with their head cut off"
good,"typical work day- worked 6am to 2pm "

good,I communicate information verbally and in writing to all employees.  The most difficult part is making sure that my message is conveyed to all employees.  I also have to use various tools to communicate the information.
good,"There is no typical day, it is different from each assignment."
good,"After 23 years at this facility. I am no longer working there due to the fact that management stated I was no longer meeting company expectations. My overall experiance at International Paper was not good at all. This company took over about five years ago from Weyhauser Corp. and made many changes that seemed not to help out our emplyees to advance and job security was not reenforced. Positions were cut off, supervisors were let go, production shifts let go. I was not given the oportunity to change job position."
good,"Expect to be all in. Can almost work as many hours as you want, overtime is expected almost daily..not very good balance of work/family and is reason I am seeking elsewhere"
good,Great job to get started in a wear house they train you on most of the machines everyone is very helpful great team leads and it can get very hot inside
good,The culture at International Paper is diversified and the environement is very fast paced and eye for detail is a must.  Great place to work independantly.
good,"didnt want to move people to different position, management was poor, had us working 2 weeks straight without a day off doing 12 hours every day,it was really understaffed but didnt hire anyone"
good,The company all in all was a great place to work an meet new people but there is always a but the management there would keep you in the dark until the plant closed they came out of the wood work then how sorry they were blah blah blah
good,I have been there for 14 years. It has good days and bad days. I wished it had better work/life balance. Good insurance and good pay. 401k and retirement benefits
good,"we start our day with a meeting "
good,"Working there has been a good experience and I have learned alot of things there are real good benefits and paid days off for vacation and some emergencies that's may come about in your life. There is a point system and tardy penalties,sick pay up to three days and paid holidays."
good,need to be on your toes at all times. need to always ask questions if you need to know something. People that work on the floor work hard when properly trained and shown recognition.
good,"The work is easy and the environment isn't all that bad. Friendly people can be a little too friendly. The work isn't hard, but can be very physical from time to time. Management needs an improve though..."

MAT. files.  Fast paced environment.  Personnel extremely friendly and readily available to assist.  Flexible hours and lunch schedules.  Manufacturing area with (11) large box building machines which create loud noise.  Hard hat, safety glasses and safety shoes are a requirement when in manufacturing area."
good,they do not get in a hurry to hire new people that are needed some employees had to work 12hrs per day 6-7 days a week for up to 18 months straight while I worked there
good,"a typical job  cardboard, weak, poor  getting there, leaving."
good,While I was there I was a general laborer. They would move everyone around to different jobs but I was constantly kept in one job. I was a victim of my own success.
good,Empresa boa com uma gerência medíocre e autoritaria.
good,"Management can be rough to deal with sometimes but what job doesnt have that. Other employees are good to work with. Work pace is very fast, have quotas to meet. Gotta like to work in the heat"
good,Great place to start your career. Pay is good benefits are good as well. Friendly environment. Can move around with the company easily. Tons of activities outside of work.
good,"As long as you do your job and keep good attendance you'll be alright. The pay good money, they have good benefits. Some supervisors are nice to you and work with you but some of them are not nice at all."
good,"Bons relacionamentos, forte no mercado de papel e preocupada com a segurança de seus funcionários."
good,"IP pays good money, but works 6-7 days per week. Management on 3rd shift is ok. Benefits are ok. It takes a whole year to get vacation time so until then you have to be careful using a point system of 7. Jobs are easy & it’s hot in summer, cold in winter. This location is very small so advancement is limited."
good,Pretty good place to work but if you have any job ideas they won't listen they just going to do it there way. Pretty much some people won't work they will do what they won't to do. no great supervision expressly on 2nd shift
good,"Extended hours every week, not much planning and follow thru. Everything seems to be a shoot from the hip kind of decision. Very difficult to continuously do this week after week."
good,This job had everything except it was hard and the  management expected employees to work 70 + hours a week with no days off . People work HARD there .  I felt aged after leaving . Work is swing shift days to nights.
good,This was a nice place to work. Management was helpful. No problems with this employer.Colleagues were also very helpful.
good,Fast paced and challenging. Everyday something new.  Never enough for managment.  No growth or training programs.  No standard operating procedures. Machines old and in constant need of repair.
good,"International paper is a great job. Work a lot but the pay and benefits are amazing. Job is very repetitive, but easy for the most part."
good,Working for International paper is a good place to work as far as job security. The pay is pretty descent. On the flip side of that you have to work 7 day before you can get one day off. 8 hours a day 7 days a week. the rotating shifts are very difficult to get use to. If your relief calls in you are forced to stay and work another 8 hours.
good,"The workday began with tasks, more tasks, tradeshow planning, graphic designs, sales plans, warehouse moves, corrugated designs, testing, etc. Co-workers were great! Management was there and guided us well. The hardest part of the job was stuffing 12 hours into 8. The most enjoyable was the finished product!"
good,"International Paper is a worldwide company that is invovled in ALL apsects of the paper industry. There is not to much room for advancement, although the opportunity for raises is there."
good,"A typical day consists of reviewing customer orders and setting them up precisely to meet their quality specifications. Depending on order quantity, there could be 2 to 5 or more set ups in a shift. This would include color changes, box dimension adjustments, and print plate changes. The hardest part to any day is trouble shooting to get the machine up to speed regardless of any issues that may arise. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I have a machine set up and am able to run it as fast as possible while still making the highest quality product for our customers."
good,Well you start out as a man on the floor stacking cardboard sheets cause that’s what we make and then can get moved to wet end where you hang rolls of paper and then you can make your way to control room where you pretty much are in control of everything that happens and when it happens
good,work days were ok. learned a lot about how a box is made. management were ok. work place culture was decent. hardest part of job was none. your birthday was an holiday
good,IP has a lot of opportunities for advancement if someone is looking for a company with upward mobility. They have a strong international presence if travel is desired.
good,"It’s an excellent company to work for, great benefits, vacation available, and the pay is excellent, but as far the taking time you’re not excused from anything even if it’s a family emergency"
good,Company did not maintain proper stock of replacement parts and planning of maintenance scheduleing was poor .favoritism and discrimination play a big role at this facility
good,The lead was rude and didn't know how to talk or treat employees . The other employees was wonderful helpful and all but y experience was not good I worked 87 days no call off and was let go
good,I would recommend International Paper to anyone seeking experience in refinery operations. International paper is a company willing to train an inexperienced individual with a good work ethic.
good,"Don't waste your time with service masters, Service Masters is the little set of janitorial workers."
good,"fast paced production work environment, nice people. easy work at times but very fast paced. multiple positions held by each person, people rotate shifts and positions here. great for learning and becoming the employee who advances to higher tech level position pays."
good,Average day/night shift with variety of coworkers. I enjoyed the pay the most and hated the hot temps up on the paper machine wet end.Management was always money driven and you were replaceable.
good,"I really enjoyed the hours and the pay was great, however the work was very stressful and management was very demanding. The benefits were great but you could be forced to work a 12 hour with hardly no notice in advance."
good,Great people! Great safety culture and a clean plant fast paced but they were fair in helping all employees. Good HR help and helpful supervisors good teamwork.
good,The company is a good company but they dont know how to balance life with work life. the work schedule wasnt the best they were rquring you to work seven days a week
good,"Era uma empresa ótima para trabalhar, mas com mudanças no topo da administração a politica mudou, pois o quadro de colaboradores muda-se constantemente, e perde-se o vinculo com a empresa, o engajamento, o equilíbrio necessário na equipe de trabalho. No entanto, entendo que muitas necessidades de alteração é advinda do mercado e para manter-se nesse próprio mercado, e ela ainda muita boa para trabalhar."
good,Pay was good because you worked all the time. It is a physically demanding job which allowed you to save money on gym fees. it was very demanding because you were always expected to produce more today than you did yesterday.
good,"This was a very fast paced environment with lots of ball in the air at the same time.  If I learned anything- it was how to manage time and stress. This company is very organized in its protcols, procedures and management of change.  Unfortunately that did not flow all the way down to the manufacturing floor.  They are the most vest company that I know of in the safety realm. They definitely want their employees to be safe."
good,"travel and travel through areas assigned... "
good,"Plus grosse difficulté, le travail en 3x8 continu."
good,"The pay is great but you will work very long hours, there are 2 shifts for this job, 3am till 3pm or 3pm till 3am. monday through Saturday. its union so people have been working there awhile, and the old timers get first dibs on everything and they have absolutely no plans on retiring, seriously like there was a guy working there in he was about 80. the managers do do much work at all, they sit in the office and chat. the pros about this job is the great benefits they provide, and they have great company picnics, you just be so tired at the picnics that you want to go home quickly if you show up."

good,"Great Company, Good Pay, Solid Fundamentals, Can have long hours during summer and holiday periods,  I would recommend International Paper to anyone seeking a manufacturing position"
good,It was good pay. I really liked my job there. Had to relocate so I had to quit. I really reccomend this company of you are looking for a decent job at decent pay
good,Its a hard working job but for the pay and benefits its a key reason why people stay there. I'm currently on a temporary layoff but with a full intent on returning to that job because of work slowing down plant wide and going by seniority. Plus being in good standing with the company.
good,I really enjoyed my time at IP.  It was one of my favorite jobs.  If it weren't for the point system for attendance I would still be there.  I'm hoping I can go back after some time.
good,"Positive atmosphere, needed a little more structure on job site. Their also needs to be more support and incentives  for your first string workers. These are the workers who meet goals and get the job done."

good,got along with others but one and management was good very well organized but no benefits. little job security no benefits fun workplace.hours were ok.
good,"Good place to work but, really repetitive. the lowest you can start off making was 17.50 for the bulk line that's the hardest part in my opinion. The bulk line also requires a lot of team work for a lot of the different boxes. There was also another hard part of the job and that requires a lot of communication."
good,"International Paper is a good place to work, like any other work environment there are ups and downs but its a good place to work.  They offer good benefits and retirement package.  Health insurance and Dental Insurance coverage are also offered."
good,"Pay Is Competitive, Poor Management, Lazy People, They Take Advantage From Who Really Like Work Hard, A Lot Of Safety Regulation But Nobody Follow"

good,High stress environment in the commodity market.  The profit margins are dependent on paper pricing which produces a fast paced environment to maximize profit by reducing conversion costs.  Physically demanding work with a focus on doing it safely and efficiently.
good,"Great Place to work, great place for advancement.  I was promoted to Senior Mechanic on 1st shift and lead Mechanic for PMs on all Flexo Box Machines."
good,"When working at International Paper, you should expect to work long hours. During my time there, there was no set hours. Its a very physical work environment."
good,International Paper is a great place to work that will allow you to make a living to provide for your family. They will provide a reasonable pay scale and plenty of opportunities to increase wages by overtime and job advancement.
good,"Great place to work. Union involvement. Good managers and opportunity for advancement. There is shift work involved. The work can be dirty. There is lifting, pulling, standing, bending and sometimes long hours on your feet."
good,Not a bad place for a young person just starting out. Wouldn't suggest for a family man for the rotating shifts get old real fast for minimal pay. Overall not bad
good,"My  experience as a employee @ International Paper has been very rewarding and challenging, I learned many skills as well as becoming a salary Supervisor, which gave me a opportunity to motivate employees to be open minded when it comes to production, quality and quantity, always give an extra afford when it comes to safety."
good,Foi muito proveitoso Meu trabalho nessa empresa num fez amadurecer mais  aprendi e muito mim fez ser um profissional  melhor.
good,I loved working there for that company. They treat you right and give you the skills you need to advance through the company.
good,"Each phone call or email was a new challenge. Managing a manufacturing facility and making sure that the customer expectations were met was what we were taught. Worked together with a tight team that made that happen.  Hardest part was making it happen when the plant had staffing or mechanical issue."

good,"Da dove abito abito io era distanza ma i chilometri non mi importavano, facevo i turni ma stavo bene, prendevo bene"
good,Long hours with descent pay.  The people I worked with were competent and easy-going.  I learned how to run a transfer machine and how to keep things in good repair.  The hardest part of this job was going between so many different departments and still keeping up with my own position.  The drive was a little more than I could take as this job was located in Leola AR.  the most enjoyable part of the job was constantly being on the go.
good,International Paper is a great place to work; hours are long they have a strick policy on work ethics.  I got alone with co-workers and management.  The hardest part of the job is getting use the cold in the winter and being hot in the summer out on the dock.
good,"A typical day at work for me means that you never know what you might be working on when you arrive, which I like. I have learned a lot since I have been there based on industrial mechanics."
good,place could really use some new management and needs to update alot of equipment. Other than that have greta coworkers.
good,To work for International Paper right out of college is great... It took me 3 years to realize that it is time to go and look for something else.  Upper management does not listen to anybody below them.  Employee development is really slow at this company. They only want you to concentrate on narrow things they think you might be good at for a very long time.  Everyone is very concerned about their job security and most people are going to do what they told just to keep their job because everyone is replaceable.  I cannot say that this company cares about their employees that much...
good,"Era legal."
good,The best thing I like about working here is the people. They are friendly and I always enjoy coming to work. Everybody there is very helpful and considersate.

I work well with my co-workers to maintain family type of atmosphere and to make sure that each person is accountable for their particular job requirement.  The hardest part of the job is having to work 16 hour days when my relief calls out.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when we complete a large order for a customer and knowing that the customer is very satisfied.
good,Its a productive place to work good compensation and benefits
good,"typical day included packaging and stocking, standing for long periods of time."
good,"Developed relationships with loyalty driven customer service which increased client referrals by 30% per year."
good,"Handled Corporate customers and there vendors. I learned a lot about the paper industry.  Management and co-workers were good people to work with.  The hardest part of the job was being remote. The best part was able to work with a customer and make sure they got what they needed to get a project complete on schedule, and on budget."
good,"It was an ok place to work, sometimes deadlines were a little stressful. Not a lot of room for advancement, at least where I was. Good team environment."
good,"I personally worked in every department over the years from machine operative on the bucket machine and blanker to the warehouse department to the slitter machine, Job Work life balance is very low to the fact no-one knows what they are working from week to week and compulsery overtime, which can be hard to plan family life, the management are putting in some very good improvements though in working procedures and health and safety, and the job is very well paid."
good,"Good working environment, hardest part 12 hour days, most enjoyable part lots of overtime"
good,Enjoyed my time working there. Great people. Great environment
good,there are a lot of good people that work for this company and team work is never a problem. the hard part of this job was having to work long hours sometimes
good,You worked Monday - Friday. Job wasn't that hard. Good environment clean.

Additionally, I worked many special projects which I enjoyed. The management was friendly, easily approachable and genuinely concerned about the safety and welfare of personnel."
good,"Go to check in, go to machine, see what other shift left and start working."
good,"Go check in and get to your machine, check what is left over from other shift and start working."
good,fast paced job wasnt bad just people we worked with could get away with anything
good,"I joint IP in very early stage of its development in Poland and rest of CEE region. I had a chance to build the business nearly from the scratch. Lernt a lot on financial acumen, startegic agility and paper and packaging industry. I had a chance to collaborate with great people with large experience on global basis. I accomplished great success in IP. Observing how the busiess developes through own activity and decisions was fantastic. I learn on the fly however the beginning was quite challenging for me. The market was very dynamic and was growing quickly. This was a great tool to gather enough experience in terms of strategic agility."
good,Have a strong safety culture.  Salary and benefits are very good.  Performance driven company where KPI's are established and expected to be accomplished.
good,"- Machine coverage and operations planning."
good,This was a great job everyone worked together to achieve our goal when something happened to the machine everyone stepped to help get it back right this is one job I truly miss

good,"Long  hours decent pay, work was in hot conditions, it was a good job, I learned alot from working there, no real issues, just relocated to greencastle."
good,"buena empresa aveces algunos problemas administrativos, no hay crecimiento laboral, sube el que cae bien"
good,International Paper is a great company to work for. It provide competitive pay and great benefits and 401k plan. The company always treats you like family and always giving to employees. The hardest part about the job is the 12hr swing shift work.
good,a typical day at work at international paper co is unpredictable because when dealing with a manufacturing company you never know from hour to hour what could go wrong
good,"great place to work with very good managment and work place culture , very good paid and clean place to work and easy job to learn it very quicker more safety."
good,"International Paper is a great place to work for an individual looking to gain maximum income. The company is the top paying place to work in this area. However, the quality of life is very low compared to the high pay. Overtime is always there and the shift schedule keeps a person going from days to nights with little time to adjust (24 hour turn arounds happen very often). The environment on the paper machines is also very demanding, as the heat is very extreme and there are no breaks."
good,decent place decent pay.Very stressful enviroment though. People don't helo if you struggle. Benefits are decent at a decent charge. would recommend place to another person.
good,"A great company to work for with job security, however, very few chances for career advancement.  Managers with little experience in the field are placed in leadership positions and must learn as they go, while individuals with great leadership skills and vast knowledge and experienced are often over looked for advancement."
good,IP works lots of overtime and makes it mandatory for new employees. Excellent coworkers and friendly management. Advancement at ip is slow but reasonable.
good,"I was hired as a helper, moved to fork lift operator, then bid on a job as machine operator. Good pay, fast pace. Overtime, but not too much and it was a good learning experience"
good,"IP / IT has been under pressure to reduce costs for several years, and some managers / directors do that in spite of the deliverables or objectives they have, and workers suffer from that.  I understand that corporations have to watch their budgets, but I think some common sense needs to be added to the processes."
good,This place is great with benefits and time off for office workers. ...however it is very cut throat and dog-eat-dog.  People will lie cheat and back stab for advancement. ....and get away with it.
good,"Overall the company is not a bad company however in my opinion, the favoritism shown from certain managers to certain employees is too extreme.  I have enjoyed my job as a Delta Lead because of the physical and mental challenge the position requires while completing tasks.  I have learned to be a complete employee in my position from being able to work on my own as well as with others.  I would say the most difficult part of my job is working through all kinds of different temperatures from extreme heat to quite cool.  One of the most enjoyable parts of my position is meeting the people I have met and getting to genuinely work with people who have become my friends over the course of my employment."
good,I would come to work on day shift 7:70 until 3:00 and the next week I would be on seconds that was 3:00 until 11:00. The plant is very hot and very dirty. The management was ok but there were a lot of good people that worked there.
good,Have to be ready to work hard every day. Great pay and great benefits. You're going to be at work more than at home. Rotating shift work. Great company!
good,"Not all departments are so hard working but the paper machine is very fast pace, very hot, and you work very hard everyday. You earn your pay checks. Work on a 3 man team running a paper Winder. lots of rotating equipment. No FRC required, just pants and a t-shirt. That's a big plus. Everyone starts at the bottom making 15/ hour, after 4 months I was tested up 3 positions making 28/hr."
good,Team oriented environment. Management was empathetic toward employee situations. Work atmosphere was good. Low pressure job until month end and year end closing requirements. Good advancement opportunities.
good,Good starting pay... You can earn a lot of money working here but overtime is mandatory and most saturdays. If you're single with no kids or a life. This is the place for you
good,Oversaw shift of 30 full-time employees. Performed random quality checks for the company on materials used for manufacturing and finished products.
good,Adorava trabalhar la só sai por que estava sentindo muita dor nos braços
good,"Came in at 9 worked as a word processor. Had lunch and went home. Most of my day was spent in front of the word processor."
good,"I have worked or IP for 8 years.  They have provided me with a comfortable life but no quality of life.  The employees have been asking management for years for better shift schedules.  We currently work southern swing shift (8 hours 7 straight days 2 off).  Changing shifts every week.  Bottom line you have no quality of life and no family life.  If none of this applies to you come work for International Paper in Vicksburg, Miss."
good,"great place to work, no opportunity to rise though, very limited income also, especially for the region.  though they do look out for there employee's."
good,"Reparos em equipamentos elétricos, trabalho em equipe, especificação de produtos,"
good,"Tudo começa com um DDS, logo após há distribuição das notas para realizações dos trabalhos no dia que se segue."
good,very dusty and hard place to work at hot in the summer and cold in the winter. But I did learn a lot when it come to shipping and receiving
good,"On a daily basis i oversee all the operations for the second shift. Every day is different from the next, which creates its own challenges and successes."
good,"it is quiet and busy working,I learned we can not walk by forklifts, management checks on us frequently,my co-workers are nice and helpful,the hardest part is working faster to get orders done but I still enjoy working there."
good,". arduo trabajo"
good,"Worked 12 hour shifts."
good,"My typical day at work starts out to monitor all the systems I am in charge of and correct any issues I may find. Also I work service tickets to create new Pi, Proficy, and or Parcview displays for the Orange Mill."
good,"Dynamic, challenging and productive workplace."
good,Pulling orders and getting them ready for shipment. On the forklift most of the day.
good,"Overall good place to work. Union shop. Come in each day and follow production schedule to complete orders as they are requested. I have learned new types of equipment for producing boxes and the different processes that go into making boxes which have been more than I would have thought before my employment began, however I find them interesting. Hardest part of job is trying to stay on schedule with old equipment that has a lot of maintenance issues."
good,"Normalmente os dias de trabalhos são tranquilos, desempenhando as funções de adm, tive um grande aprendizado com os sistemas adotados na empresa (SAP), tenho uma boa interação com os meus superiores, sempre resolvemos os problemas juntos."
good,The nicest part of my day was working with my sales reps. Although this company is no longer in New Jersey it was nice working there
good,"All in all I loved my job with the company, just a few supervisors made it unpleasant at times, but the co-workers kept it moving. I would definitely work there again."
good,"Un trabajo en el que se aprenden cosas diferentes cada dia, con capacitacion constante, en el que los compañeros con experiencia te apoyan continuamente, aunque mucha presion en cuanto a la produccion y exigencias constantes."
good,good people to work with.
good,a typical day in International was hard some days and some was easy some days i would have to move around alot meaning i may have to run the forklift half a shift then other may have todo production work that the most enjoyable part of my job was me laughing and having fun with my co workers and management in a safe way
good,load unload trucks with paper to be made into cardbord boxs.
good,International Paper was a company I could work for and share in profit sharing also. There were excellant incitivites in Safety program
good,"Boa empresa, com bons benefícios, muito relacional."
good,"The company is solid and offers a great deal of OT; work/life balance is difficult with shifts and OT; co-workers are great people. This is a union shop, so it offers good pay and decent benefits, including a pension in addition to 401K."
good,It is a 24/7 operation where safety is a priority. It is best to formulate your own judgement and work experiences. Best wishes. The facility is located in a rural location.
good,The job yielded exactly what it needed to. It provided job security and benefits in exchange for personal life. The job was  always changing and never mundane. However what management expects of you compared to the treatment you get can be very skewed.
good,hot environment but everyone tries to work together and get along and achieve the goal at hand. Good pay and the schedule was nice besides working nights.
good,"In these days and times when u get good workers , sometimes you have to see what's really going on before releasing them.they strictly by the books ,no in between, people love good money but people also want to be appreciated."
good,I P it's like all other companies they have the good parts and practices and bad but I have worked in worse places it's all about what you're looking for out of the job
good,"Hours are between 6-2,2-10,&10-6 ....if overtime is required your working 12 hour days,6-7 days a week during the growing season between March and October."
good,"An outstanding organization with potential to advance.  As always, the difference is in what you bring to the table in terms of experience and daily effort to produce.   The most important aspect of the position is to maintain a focus on safety at all times."
good,"This company is a terrific place to work if you want a lot of responsibility at a very young age.  People that like to work hard like working here.  You'll get assignments and challenges you're proud of, and it will build you up in total capability.  The newest CEO/CFO leadership team seem to be navigating a much more conservative course, and growth of the business is at least a major question.  However, working at this company builds ""management muscle"", and business acumen."
good,The pay is alot higher than most jobs around and you get alot of overtime (50) hours minimum per week but the job is just too bland. All u see is cardboard boxes all day so it's kind of depressing.
good,"Good job, even for a female new to the manufacturing environment. Great opportunity for job advancement.  Good leadership team. Always someone willing to teach you anything required to move up to the next job in line."
good,Good job if you’re young and trying to get ahead in life pay is acceptable and the benefits are good also and you will get plenty of hours so get ready for those 12 hour shifts
good,Not a bad place to work.  Work life balance is bad at times due to short staffing.  E/I group is lean and FLLs and managers have to pitch in on day to day issues.
good,Great company. I have enjoyed my tenure with International Paper. Diversity and safety are a huge focused. Employees are well compensated. Management can do a better job of maximizing the potential of their employees.
good,Good company with many opportunities available in operations or support functions.   Industry focuses on process improvements and cost savings in order to remain competitive.
good,Not the position that I was told it would be.  I like IP the position was just not for me.  I don't want to complain about this position. I had a new boss that had never been a boss before and I took over all her accounts.  I was micro managed to death. I understood but after I left I was told she was demoted back to my position.  I did not get the training that was necessary. My boss was to busy with being a new boss and I took all of her old accounts which was a huge workload and commend her for doing  all she did.  She did not have the time to train me the way she needed to and that was that. I learned a ton and worked very hard.  I thought IP was going company I stayed at forever but It was not meant to be.
good,Not a bad place to work. Basically every job is fairly simple and you receive ample training. Pay is very nice. Only downfall is it's seniority based so plan on waiting years to make it to 1st shift.
good,"very old fashioned company, especially in Hyderabad-India. Bad culture. Management is bad. lot of politics. Pay is good and less work. not a place if you want to learn new things. CEO is good but top management who report to CEO are not real leaders."
good,If you like overtime it's a good place to work. The actual work isn't very hard but it is hot in the summer and cold in some departments in winter. Overall good benefits
good,International Paper was a great company to work for as far as competitive pay and benefits go. The workplace is fast paced so you are usually keeping busy. A lot of overtime hours are offered to the employees. The only downfall this job has is very little regard to personal family matters.
good,"A typical day consists of restocking and reordering supplies, in addition to aiding graphical and structural designers with sample cutting, display assembly and mockups, and CAD table maintenance.  Acquisition of knowledge of Artios AutoCAD software, basic design, and graphical software systems.  Culture is varied, there is a sort of hierarchy which creates some separation a the various levels.  Challenges include interactions with clients and time scheduling.  Benefits are very good, and the company has functions for employees several times a year."
good,International Paper is a nice fasr paced job ! It has a very heated inside from all the machines inside . but times goes by fast and the pay is awesome .
good,Good to work for. Older building needs updating. Interdepartmental support. Fast paced with quick turn times. Learned more to making corrugate than I ever thought.
good,"Working at International I learned a lot about the corrugated business in my 2 years. It is very fast paced , demanding and stressful. If you have the ability to withstand all of this as well as the daily obstacles you may encounter with any job you can succeed."
good,I enjoyed working hard while I was there. However it didn't last long enough. It was only a summer job.  They emphasized that this is a college student or high school student position now.
good,empresa com alto grau de exigência e competitividade
good,"I really enjoyed working for the General Counsel many years ago. The best part of my position was planning the first Annual Legal Conference in Tampa, FL. It was challenging all the while a great learning experience."
good,"Lots of day-to-day execution for supply chain new-hires. Very focused on team collaboration & communication. Strong emphasis on staying ahead of the curve in terms of transportation, customer service and inventory management."
good,"Everything there is fast pace, when a lead notes that you are going too sow, you will not last long there. The company do not have a heater or cooling system besides fans so you if you work there do expect to be hot. The work load is not too difficult because you are basically assembling boxes to be packed or be the packer. Sometimes the product for the customers are heavy and so some days you will feel worn out."
good,"IP was my first job before i went to college to run track on a scholarship, it was a great place to learn from if anything happen to me in made me come back home.. The first 3 weeks I was stacking boxes on a pallet wrapping them up with plastic, then the next the 2 months I started operating the sit down forklift"
good,"The pay is competitive. One of the pros to the job is the five days you will get off per month. Management has their flaws, but overall they are good to work for."
good,"Good place to work with many opportunities to move up, competitive salary. Lots of training. Good benefits. Hardest part of the job is balancing work/life."
good,you get to see new people every day  enjoy supervisor great      people also they let you be your self also receive  frothy hour every week is good to
good,"I learned a lot while I was working here.  Would recommend this company, they always tried to pay everyone fairly.  I had to leave the company because they relocated out of state."
good,"This is a great job, it just isn't for everybody. It's a good paying quick paced job. The heat and the hours just get to people, 12-hour shifts in sometimes 100-degree weather. there's no AC and they tell you to drink water and Gatorade which makes sense but make sure you get a big water bottle and bring water from home bc all you got is sink water at the company. There's illy placed water fountains too but they taste like you licked a steel pipe"
good,honestly when i started working here i loved it but then management changed and became poor and now i dread going in most days. overall its really not a bad place to work. good pay good benefits
good,I worked for this company and it's acquired company for 20 years.  I survived many senior management turnovers and enjoyed with all areas of the organization.
good,Great Company to work for and I really enjoyed my time there. Work Life balance was a struggle because the more you do they just add on additional responsibilities. Compensation is above market average.
good,Good place to work. Be ready to work. Older facility though making good improvements. Very hot during summer months but do well to sustain a safe work environment.
good,"Ótimo lugar para trabalhar, mas as chances de efetivação para aprendizes, é muito pequena."
good,"This really is a great company to work for. They offer some of the best benefits/perks available, and also very good pay. The shifts and scheduling is the worst part. Typically you never know your schedule for the upcoming week, until last minute. You will usually work 12 hour days, and have shift work. (7am to pm) the first week, then (7pm to am) the following week, which rotates days to nights, weekly. This makes it  very difficult to make plans, or have much ""you time"""
good,work 50+ hour week with no week ends.  Learned about end to end corrugated supply chain operations with very strong emphasis on training. Management is very supportive.
good,"Good company. They take care of their people. They offer advancement, training . They keep the employees updated on what is going on with in the company."
good,"International Paper prepares its process engineering interns by assigning them tasks comparable to the demands of their Manufacturing Excellence engineers. Interns go to the morning meeting and finish tasks throughout the rest of the day usually just until they have worked for eight hours but sometimes longer to complete tasks or to see the completion of field days. I learned about the paper making process as it is done at Eastover, augmented my software capabilities (ParcVIEW, Excel, and Outlook), and further developed my presentation skills."
good,This is a good place to work. It has great benefits and vacation. Paid holidays and PTO. It is a constant work day. From the time you walk on the floor to the time you leave you are constantly working. It is very hot or very cold majority of the time. If you are not physically able to constantly be moving then this is not the job for you. Union based company so that is very great. If you can make it past your 90 days then you will succeed if you really want to. If you need a lot of time off this is not the job for you.
good,"IP does believe that the business operations can be managed in a Ethical and Compliant manner irrespective of the country or region it is operating."
good,"My co-workers made my day we truly enjoyed working together. we "
good,"Busy from the beginning of the day to the end of the work day. Revitalize, heighten and strengthening my current skills while learning some new skills.  Overall Management was easy to get along with and were very supportive. Worked independently. The hardest part of the job was forcing employees to work beyond their work schedule during weekends and holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was being constantly engrossed in the day to day operations."
good,"International Paper is a good company to work, but have a strong hierarchy culture, and make difference between the leaders and the regular employees."
good,Enjoyed most cost workers from management team to janitors. Culture of team work and goals in mind. Day to day work might have been rigorous but the company compensated in a variety of ways.
good,"worked on everyday issues and assigned tasks in the shop and the plant, rounds, rebuild pumps, cylinders,etc. assit. operators with issues they may have. adjust strappers in shipping"
good,"Come in. Get my station ready for my shift. Make sure that I'm are stocked up good to begin my shift. I taped boxes and gave them to the packers on the end of the line and they would fill and send the box/case back to me to put on the pallet. when the pallet was full, I would use a pallet jack to move the pallet to the aisle for shipping to pick up. Management was good to work with. The co-workers were sometimes not so good but, we got along and worked together. I always learn a lot no matter what the job is. And I had fun making those cases and putting them on the pallets. The hardest part was when the pallet jack would get stuck under the pallet. Then I had to work to remove it before shipping would arrive to pick it up."
good,"IP offers good benefits and reasonable pay.  The best part of the company is it's people.  The IP team is a hard working, energetic, dedicated group."
good,International Paper is a very diverse company. The team work exceeds expectation of other companies I have worked for. If assistance is required at any level it is not hard to find. The pay is very competitive for the jobs.
good,A good experience but managers need to get actualizations for programs and Technology application in everyday tasks.
good,International Paper was an interesting job. I never knew what all went into making corrugated containerbord.(Cardboard boxes). As long as the machine was running correctly it was a good day.
good,"I would get to work around 6;15am every day,and would have a meeting at 7am.  There would be meetings throughout the day and really wouldn't get my work done till 5pm rolled around.  Typically stayed till 7pm everyday and worked on Saturdays.  I did enjoy this job and felt very productive but was not a good balance for my family.  Coworkers were equally as hard working trying to meet a common goal.  The hardest part of my job were the hours I spent at the office."
good,"Great place to work, however slow with advancement. Learned a lot enjoyed dealing with clients"
good,"La actividad diaria es un reto y crecimiento, hay que atender las necesidades de los usuarios, buscar proveedores que nos puedan apoyar. He aprendido mucho de seguridad y de otros procesos de cultura laboral."
good,"A typical day at work begins early am with a shift turnover. Getting the pertinent information to start/plan my day. quickly review production lineups for any immediate changes that may be required. at shift start, actively engaging employees and communicating issues or pertinent information. manage time and resources , complete administrative tasking, delegate assignments, trouble shoot issues, conduct / attend meetings. manage payroll records and safety activities. communicate with other departments to coordinate activities / maintenance etc.  this company is progressive with its business model and an excellent company to work for. the compensation is competitive. the employees are actively engaged in their work environment. .the hardest part of the job is that there are not enough hours in the day some days. the most enjoyable part of the job is when everything comes together and the goals are accomplished."
good,Learned a lot .Always something new to learn and do. Management    was good kept work moving. Really liked the team aspect of the job. I feel the hardest thing to get use to was the heat in some areas it was extremely hot
good,"I was fortunate to work for Weyerhaeuser Co.before I.P. purchase and ultimate closure of plant"
good,"Running machines, loading materials and fixing minor issues with machines. The Floor supervisors are great people. Fun people to work with. Not very family friendly and if someone gets hurt on the job they eventually get rid of them."
good,Last I heard they were closing the mill. Not a bad place to work
good,Would have liked to finished career there but did not work out.  The job had it's ups and downs but overall was a good experience.  I will be leaving some good friends and have many memories.
good,I enjoy the work and the people it was always interesting each and everyday
good,"It was a good job it always had something to work on, stayed busy."
good,I was the Group Credit/Finance Manager for xpedx which is the distribution arm of International Paper. Great quality company with talented and dedicated co workers.
good,"accounting position dealing with logistics of railroad shipping of merchandise."
good,the esiest part of my job here was that my co workers knew what they were doing and when to do it. my previous job my co workers were lazy and lost on their job proceudres.
good,Management and co-workers were generally easy to work with but the schedule is not for everyone.
good,"Even though I was employed thru Manpower as a Temp, I still enjoyed working for International Paper. Supervisors and management were a great group of people to work for. They really took care of you, to bad they started cutting back. I would have enjoyed retiring from there."
good,Coworkers were easy to work with on team. Gained much knowledge thru all job responsibilities.
good,Everone helped each other an all were conserend about quilaity an production .
good,not bad place to work is hot in summer and cold in winter benefits about the same but just wandering if something better!!!!!!!
good,"I was fortunate enough to have had managers who advanced me quickly and provided me with great development opportunities. The downside to this company is that there is little room for career movement. Through cost cutting initiatives, many middle manager and first line leader roles were eliminated, leaving little room for analysts to advance from an individual contributor role."
good,"Though my experience ended with me leaving, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with International Paper. The people there are very friendly and pleasant to be around. The company offers good benefits and is understanding to people's person situations. Highly recommend if you are qualified."
good,"It was a great job with good employers. There was room to move up in the company. They always paid me on time, and had my hours correct. I would recommend this job to job seekers."
good,"When the equipment is running properly the days go by quickly. Good pay but plan to be there 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. A lot of OT is because machines are not maintained correctly"
good,"Friendly employees. "
good,This company is A great place to work with great benefits. The only concern was no balance between work and personal life. Demanding schedule hindered almost any personal time with family.
good,"International Paper is regularly voted one of the top employers in the Memphis area for a reason. There is a lot of emphasis on leadership development, collaboration, development and safety. Unfortunately, there are a lot of politics involved with advancing and communication from department leaders can be wonky, spotty, non-existent. So, if you can get on a good team, with a good, communicative leader who supports your development and advancement, you can set up a pretty nice career for yourself here."
good,Since i started working at international paper i have developed close work relationships with the good people that are a part of this winning team. I work on the night shift.
good,"Fast pace . Management  is hands on ,ready to help out.  Plenty of overtime daily an weekend. Human  Resources  door always  open to listen to any problems  you may have."
good,"Honestly I wish I never left . I left for the wrong reason and was taking things to personal. GM was a brilliant man , his approach could have been better . I accomplished great things at IP , but still seemed to get road hard and at the time felt like no respect. Part of this is one I was young and in a role I have never been in before . Two I was under alot of pressure but added much more pressure to myself."
good,"Great place to work, great coworkers and management. Most likely will have to work swing shift and you move up positions at your own pace with multiple job options"
good,"I enjoyed working in the IP culture where winning was celebrated and expected from all involved.  I was generally happy with my career and the opportunities that existed within the company, especially for those willing to travel."
good,I worked here for a while and it was challenging but I never actually said I hated my job. A lot of work was put in for an older machines and we got a lot done. I left here to work with another. You do work some long hours but they go by. Guys will work with you though. Good culture and didn't have to walk on egg shells. Was allowed to make your own decisions and grow and learn as a leader. When you would fall you may take some heat from time to time but would learn something in the end. This place was a huge in my development as a leader and knowledge of the industry.
good,"Good company but the shift work is not good for individuals with small children.  Depending on what position you are in and department, the job is dangerous"
good,"El ambiente es bueno en general, mi trabajo fue muy valorado por mis jefes. Reconocen tus resultados."
good,"some areas are ok, I wouldn't recommend the maintenance area. very hot, poor office working environment, very political, often people were only doing the bare minimum."
good,Simply put this job was a lesson to whats really important in an individuals life. The pay was great and the benefits were fair but the work to life ratio was not ideal.
good,Great learning environment with very knowledgeable staff. The employees enjoy what they do for the company and the benefits are great. Lots of company perks.
good,Great place to make money and eat plenty of food.  The scheduling sucks sometimes but you'll be happy on payday. You will have good days and bad days in the concrete jungle.  Hot days are hot and cold days are cold.
good,"hard work, good pay, sometimes not good hours. when you work with good people the job is good. sometimes your boss sucks but do your job and you wont have any problems"
good,the workday starts and ends at the same time every day. The management and staff are good.  Great work life balance if you get a great shift.  Paid lunches great benefits when hired on
good,International Paper was my first job out of College and it gave me the skills necessary to succeed with my job. The Cons was the culture and environment.
good,Not a bad place to wprk except that management only cares about the job and not the employees. They cpuld care less if they fire ypu or not. And your family life is second to the job
good,I really liked the job but it was not the job for me I am looking for employment for beneifits.I want to be able to work 40+ hours. I want to be able to take sick days
good,No meu tempo de aprendiz foi uma empresa que me ensinou muito para seguir minha carreira.

Successfully completed an IP Management top priority project to centralize all IP sites from distributed to run on VM servers at the Memphis IP data center."
good,"Good job but with no opportunity to move into daylight hours.  Management is good, benefits are great.  Lack of consistency in treatment of employees by HR and management though."
good,Good corporation who values their EE's. IP helped me develop as a professional via training and education/tuition coverage. A typical day is very busy with a large amount of volume coming into the plant due to the recent economic boom in commerce. IP does care about their people and strides to keep them safe.
good,International Paper invest heavily in their entry level engineers. The goal is to have an entry level engineer ready for a front line leadership role within the first 3 years.
good,The people you work with are awesome they make you feel like you are part of their own families. The supervisors are extremely nice and understanding and they work with you

good,"At this company, every day there's a challenge."
good,Customer Service takes care of day to day operations. There is a good chemistry in the office. The work environment is business casual. International Paper takes good care of their employees if you become a permanent employee.
good,I really liked working at this plant. The workers were friendly. The hours were great. The only thing was everyone seemed too relaxed. They didn't push themselves to do better.
good,A typical day at work would consist of placing crews in the best positions to get the work done in a safe and timely manner. The hardest part of the job was learning how to deal with many different personalities. The most enjoyable part of the job was watching the growth of the employees and having them come back and tell you thanks for making them better.
good,A very good job to work at. Long hours but pays very well. Benefits are very good as well. Job security is somewhat safe. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay.
good,"Very enjoyable place to work, management expects results but also doesn't micro manage your work. Long hours are put in by many and if you don't you follow suit you may be penalized"
good,"Empresa em constante mudança. Aspecto ""Segurança"" é o ponto forte da empresa. Pega pesado nessa questão. Tem bons benefícios. No geral uma boa empresa para trabalhar."

good,hardest part of job was the changing work hours but the benifits and the pay made up for it.Good supervisor and a friendly work place.
good,Have learned a good deal of troubleshooting it's just that there's no AC in the summertime and if it's cold it can be quite cold inside as well. The company itself I have no qualms about. The work is there and the OT is there as well.
good,"Your day would include picking up recycling and throwing it into a hopper/recycling truck continuously for 3 hours then sitting down doing nothing for just over an hour, it's a great place for active people and oddly enough a great place for people with bad english to get employed"
good,"Forklift, HazMat, loading, and unloading trucks/rail cars with 4ton paper rolls.  Filled in for scales operation.  12 hour shifts all being swing shifts from 6 am to 6 pm or 6 pm to 6 am. Working rotating days including weekends.  The hardest part of the job was the commute.  The most enjoyable part of job was my high productivity and I was very proud of my accomplishments at IP and I also enjoyed being a part of the Associate Emergency Responders."
good,"Great for work/life balance, but not for growth unfortunately. There is an existing issue with college recruits and senior members of teams, where there is no place for workers in the middle to advance."
good,laid back good company to work for. I learn how to operate and run machinery. management was okay. co-workers are friendly and helpful. It was a little loud at times from the machinery.What I enjoyed about the job was the ability for advancement.

good,"A tipical day for me starts at around 7 am."
good,"Required long hours and team work, co-workers with various personalities and backgrounds. Was able to learn from all of the different skills that each person on my team was able to bring. Good mixture of learning the business side and IT aspect and blending them together to produce a product needed to perform a better way of business operation"
good,"worked on sheeter and carton line which were production jobs. We strived on making a quality product, Ip was all about quality. Proud to see the made in USA on every product we shipped. Co workers were easy  to get along with all about teamwork. Management would listen to suggestion from us and if they were good they would implement them.  The hardest part of the job was removing brown paper from rolls and fixing damaged rolls, and on occasion skids were wet and heavy. Most enjoyable part of the job was when we made quota or beyond managements expectations"
good,"-Good management, very supportive"
good,"Managing logistics of the project, tracking time and material budgets. "
good,Pay is sufficient for the workload. Some long hours make family life difficult. Days are mostly busy time goes by quickly.

good,As a supervisor for 10 years i enjoyed my work .I had a good crew and they did thier jobs very good.As a warehouse manager i spent a lot of time on the computer tracking inventory to see what was in route from the finishing room uptown. I also spot checked loads ready to leave the warehouse and called carriers to make sure they were going to be there on time. I worked from 6:am till 6:pm and some times would get called back in if the second shift was having a problem.
good,"As a laborer, the hours can vary day to day.  Some days will be 12-16 hours.  Some days will only be 8-10 hours.  There is almost always an overtime availability.  The pay is high due to the strenuous hours and work life balance.  The benefits are also pretty good.  The work environment is stressful and sometimes hard to deal with.  The managers are pretty decent, but everyone is out for themselves.  "
good,I would push around a cart and give customers change for the slot machines. I worked ten hour days four days a week. I liked meeting all the new people

good,This job is very easy but it takes a lot out of you everyday because of the long hours and the amount of day you do not get off. I worked as a summer employee and only had 1 day off in three months but the money is very good.
good,I think supervisor needs to put more attention on his people and supervisor can try to learn more and like that way he can train new people at the best way
good,"I loved me some GPI, from my trainers to my manager, they all were great, amazing people to work with. I worked D shift as a cups trainer and floater. Quality was always on point, bagger utilities I can say D shift has some of the most amazing bagger utilities in the whole plant. My supervisors were extraordinary and always able to help. The bad thing was the 12 hours and the mandatory overtime. If it wasnt for that GPI is an amazing job to have and they promote from withing so if you are consistent with your job, you learn fast and you show up you can move up quick."

good,This is a stable job that allows opportunity for growth. they have several locations throughout the US that allows you to find great paying jobs at multiple locations

Paid well but at the Putnam, CT location people can be on 12 hour days for weeks to months at a time. 5 days a week at least with 6 days happening quite often at the moment."
good,"keeps you busy from start to finish and helps the day go by fast, could use a lot more communication within the company from new hires to upper management."
good,To many weekend shifts. Overall it's a good place to work. Good benefits. Good pay for this area. It has about 102 employees at full capacity. Hot in the summer and cold in the winter.
good,"As a front end developer, there is no opportunity to gain experiences with processes that didn't exist 15 years ago.  Every bit of energy is being spent on trying to get around SAP's problematic tools instead of trusting software engineers."
good,International paper is a great place to work with really good benefits! They give a lot of overtime from spring to the fall working a lot of saturdays
good,"Nice to work at, love working around people/with people, clean area to work and very nice environment to work at and around. Nothing to complain about"
good,"Good employer, yearly cost of living raise.only problem I see is the fact that they don't enforce their shift policies. Thy will let day shift regulate the order for weekends. If day shift doesn't want to work their overtime  they have second and third shifts cover."

good,"Great company from top to bottom. Great benefits, salary, leadership and products. This is a great place to work and an excellent opportunity for a long term career path."
good,A typical day at work was slow paced and not given enough work to feel productive and constantly felt that the Mill was in a state of re-activeness versus active.
good,IP is a great place to work for. It has its ups and downs but that's every industry. Sometimes upper management can be slow to react. Don't expect to have that much of a work life balance. In my experience you make that balance your own. Don't expect management to tell you to take time off.
good,"The job is everything except time goes by slow. There is always someone to chat with while you work and also the work area is cool, and relaxing. Nice managers"
good,Job varies from day to day. You learn how to operate a large number of pieces of heavy equipment. Proper training is high on their list of priorities. But it is a dangerous job that small slip ups can get someone hurt.
good,"Friendly work environment with nice management.  Generally low stress.  A typical work day is eight hours of working with people, machinery, and other company assets.  Much skill and experience is learned over the long term in relation to product development.  Management is currently working to create an attractive business culture.  The hardest part of the job is creating unfamiliar or unique packaging designs that don't represent an industry standard.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that one gets to see the results of their work...which is rather satisfying."
good,This is a fast paced environment where you must be very detail oriented. Workplace culture is very diverse. There is little or no room for advancement unless you are willing to relocate.
good,"Outstanding company to work for! I'd recommend this job to anyway, the supervisors were great, and so was the job itself. Benefits were great as well."
good,"Company is conscious of work life balance and work place safety.  Typical day is busy and stressful, but generally the company recognizes that work is over after 8 hours and anything except an outright emergency can wait for the next day."
good,safety meeting to began the day. continuous training about operations the management was hard but fair. enjoyed the team culture. the hours were the hardest when nothing was going right. the best part of the job. Payday.
good,"I really did enjoy working for this company, it taught me a lot of different skills. Working for IP showed me that as a woman, I can do as much, if not more than a man could do. I wish I could go back."
good,A nice place to work. Plenty of opportunities for advancement and plenty of available overtime. Great benefits and good wages. A safe work environment and a sharp focus on customer satisfaction.
good,Great place to work with local people while you could move up the position and earn more money as you learned more jobs  up until it got sold to Graphic Packaging all our benefits changed
good,International Paper Co. was my first Major job in my career after graduating college.  It definitely was a learning experience and it provided well for my family.
good,"I would rather not, signed papers stating I would never discuss anything about my job or duties. This was a requirement that you must sign upon being hired. It was in the hiring package."
good,"Good place to work. Very stressful. As a manager, I was caught in between enforcing mill policies on one hand and dealing with the union on the other. Always trying to be fair but tough. Sometimes it was a difficult balancing act. I believe most managers are caught in this dilemma, while some of the more difficult employees understand it is a union environment and try to manipulate it for their benefit. Some of them are masters at it!"
good,"Great place to work and great benefits. Safety is big priority , Job postings available for advancement . Plant shut down and was not offered a chance to relocate"
good,Working at international paper was a great experience. I learned a lot and it financially helped me progress in life. I learned how to multi manage and produce great products.
good,"A typical day in Quality/Waste Water overall is a learning and invigorating experience.  Each day I learn new and interested ways on how to operate the sludge plant.  Also, as a certified paper tester ""B"", I am continuing learning about the different paper testing whenever I am placed into the lab.  Management overall is easily accessible and enjoyable to talk with.  The hardest part of the day sometimes is getting the out dated equipment to operate as a new product. I really enjoy my job, but the (12) hours are really hard for family life."
good,"A typical day at work included balancing reports, researching and correcting why invoices are not processed for payment.  Verifying billing is balanced and correct.  Processed any miscellaneous payroll and if needed, corrections to paychecks."
good,"Some old equipment could be changed for new,  and some new items could be obtained...company offers itself as safety focused, and we all have room for improvement...excellent culture of ""teamwork"", in general- daily..."
good,Las presión es bastante pero con el  equipo de trabajo se puede logran las metas.
good,Better than being unemployed and homeless. No time to really enjoy the days off but I was homeless & unemployed before I started working here. IP saved & changed my life. IP is a blessing from God regardless of the cons I could come up with.
good,"Normal plant operations. Convayor systems, labore force, heating presses and lots of paper. stay alert and safety is paramont. Choice of 5 different departments to work, and weekends off."
good,"This organization is very successful throughout the United States; and is known for its excellent management skills, morale, technical support and professional employees."
good,A solid company with good pay and benefits.  Salary personnel such as myself typically work an 11.5 hour workday and are on call 24-7 if there is an accident or environmental incident.  The safety culture is strong and always being promoted.  The location of the mill I worked in is remote with very little services.  By far the most challenging job I have had to date.
good,When I first started I was lead to be believe I was going to be hired after 90 days. After 90 days me and three others were all fired. And all we were told is that they didn't need us anymore.
good,I like working at international papers because it's fast paced. You get Saturday and Sunday off. They pay was 10.35 if you haven't missed a day that week or came late.
good,"Typical day started at 6:00am, and was go, go, go as soon as my run was completed I was done for the day. I had a couple maps that I could fit in one truck load and could complete those days usually by 12:30pm. I enjoyed driving and picking up recycling, I was responsible for 2 jobs and worked my hardest everyday, during plus 50 with the humidex and minus 50 with the windchill."
good,"There was an ability to grow and learn new things.  In my group, a team environment existed and there was no hierarchal egos to undermine progress.   Everyone had the potential to be a contributor."
good,"Do walk through in and outside of buildings"
good,"As a person that started off as a temporary employee for manpower I can really say that I started at the bottom and went straight up. After being hired on permanently, I started off as a stacker on a die cutter machine, from there I went to the corrugated side of the plant and operated the roll grab. Later on I moved to the shipping department as a clerk loader which eventually moved me to the role of shipping coordinator. After a year and a couple of months I was moved back to the corrugated side of the plant as a double backer for several months until the dry end operator resigned and I was placed as the dry end operator, I can truly say I learned a lot and was an all around asset."
good,"Empresa com uma boa gestão, preservação no meio ambiente."
good,"Ekip çalışması ön planda"
good,Looked over orders in process to see if anything was running late or any issues so I could let customer know. Keyed orders as customers sent them in. Processed and send order confirmations back. Kept up with tooling report and did PO receiving.
good,You were always learning or training for the next job up.  Most employees got along with each other and worked together for years.  More like family. To bad I retired.
good,Great place to learn new skills. Very good place to meet nice and outgoing positive people. Also very great workforce. Also they pay their employees what they deserve.
good,Great place to work. Great schedules. Could use some work with management more closely at shift managers and attitudes.  Overall good money great job.
good,Typical workday could go from slow to wide open. Coworkers are good to work with. Workdays are 12 hr. swing shifts. Wages are competitive to above average.
good,good place to work. a friendly and helpful atmosphere and management is willing to work with you to help solve problems. best place I have ever worked.
good,"Really fast pace environment. As an intern you will have around 20 projects running parallel. Really teaches you to be more organize, time management and improves your communication skills."
good,great people to work with. IP provides a great training program and great support from management. I would of stayed if the pay were higher
good,This was a very nice place to work  play was excellent. The only bad thing about this job was the surprisingly closure of plant. no warning at all.
good,Had slot of fun with the people there ! Good management and just an overall good place to work ! Benefits were good and vacation was good !
good,I work with a great group that allows me to lead without a lot of drama.  My leadership team is fantastic and supports the decisions that I make.  The hardest part of my job are the long hours.
good,I really enjoyed the job. We got plenty of hours and got really dirty. It was a pleasant and productive working environment and management was good.
good,Le problème c'est les horaire car ces en 6/8. Sa fais depuis les 27 juin que je suis au sein de cette usine en tant qu'interimair jusqu'à aujourd'hui le 17 novembre
good,"The forestry products industry is traditional and conservative by nature, so it can be expected that International Paper is the same way.  That said, I had great managers who cared about my development and advancement, and I was never expected to work more than 40 hours/week.  If you are looking for a safe, stable job, working with friendly people, this is a great place."
good,"Ainda é difícil comentar sobre a empresa International Paper da unidade de Suzano, pois esta foi incorporada e está em fase de adaptação a nova cultura organizacional, porém, é possível observar que o trabalho em equipe e o bom relacionamento interpessoal é valorizado pelos funcionários e líderes da unidade pois todos estão juntos em busca de bons resultados para a empresa."

good,"Good pay for the job you do. Plant gets very hot in the summer time. Good benefits, health, dental, 401k. Seniority based jobs, if you want to move up you have to put in the time"
good,Not a team  atmosphere shifts don't work together they want to make the other shift look bad information isn't shared to improve production with inexperienced crews. Upper  management  does not look at the problem just some one to blame
good,"With this company, you can really grow and advance.  The people was good to work with as long as everyone is working together as a team to meet production."

good,"The internship was great. The benefits overall were great. You'll learn a lot, but the employees from the corporate head office can be very cutthroat. Don't believe you'll keep your job just because people who worked with you gave you great reviews. If you are not liked by executives in the corporate office, then you'll get fired, or they won't have any intention of keeping you around for too long. Also, I've noticed in the corporate office they'll hire and keep around idiots who cannot even give proper directions to others regarding work. Those idiots sometimes get very ahead in their career in IP as long as the executives in IP's corporate office like them."

I was able to move to what is considered an advanced position within two weeks and training is available to those who would like to receive it.  Non of the work is hard at all.  The only gripe I have is that the employees are very immature and seem to come to work for all the wrong reasons which makes for a very long day. Other than that it's a great place to work."
good,"good place to work, but the Courtland mill closed due to decline in paper demands. but overall it was a nice place to work and met a lot of life long friends there"

good,I gained a great deal of experience and learned a lot from my co workers and managers. I was very disappointed when I was laid off after such a short time. 
good,"This is a great company tol work for. Although I was just an intern, I was able to learn a lot in my short time there. The company works off trust which means they expect there employers to be independent- honest workers. "

good,"Honestly one of the easiest jobs I've ever had. Paid really well. Gets really slow and boring however. Biggest downside is thier point system used to track calling in, getting sick missing days, etc. At 6 points you can get fired. Most of it makes sense, however, you can still get points for things such as going to the hospital."
good,"I loved International Paper. The pay was great and the work was not too hard. The worst part about it was the heat but other than that, it was a great place to work."

good,"Working at IP is a different kind of experience. I've seen good and bad while I was there. I thought it seemed pretty safe for the most part, although I definitely wasn't trained enough for my job. I got about a days worth of training, and my trainer would take longer breaks than we were given. I'm just glad the people working near me helped me whenever I was struggling to keep up."
good,I loved being here. Just need to grow as far as knowledge goes.  Would stay here if I could see more growth as education goes and if they gave more time off.

good,I really like it there. The work is hard but you are well compensated. If you work hard then they will move you up. Most of the management is knowledgeable.

I was very fast and organized. If you do not like a very fast-paced job then this job is not for you. I loved it they gave great overtime so I personally don't have anything negative to say about this warehouse.

good,"es una empresa con ambiente agradable, un poco desorganizada en lo administrativo (ventas) lo cual provocaba un caos en las entregas con cada uno de sus clientes.ya que aveces se les olvidaba pasar su reporte de entrega y querían que se entregaran al día siguiente lo cual hacia que el costo de entrega aumentara por la distancia y costo de producto, aprendí a tener mas contacto con cada uno de los vendedores para evitar lo antes mencionado y adelantarme a las entregas de los clientes grandes (preparación del material) esto con el fin de únicamente esperar fecha de entrega para solicitar la (s) unidades para dicha entrega, con la dirección hice varias propuestas para una mejora en cuestión de recibo y embarque del producto esto con el fin de entregar en forma y tiempo lo cual fue bueno para todos, con el personal tuve buena relación laboral y me permitieron aprender y aplicar mis conocimientos los cuales fueron buenas para todos, lo que me gusta de este trabajo es la facilidad que tengo para hacer equipo de trabajo y que tengamos siempre el sentido de urgencia para la entrega o recibo del material."

Nevertheless, IP lived up to their emphasis on Customers, Productivity and People as the mainstays of their business. They are marked by a commitment of the necessary resources to get a job done, and their culture is definitely structured and consistent regardless of the business. I recommend IP to those who value and appreciate structure and excellence."
good,"International Paper was a great place to work. I spent 16 years there. Over that time I had many career growth opportunities. I began at an entry level job and finished as the Communications Manager. Toward the end, the hours were very long (12-14 hours/day) but the work was rewarding. I had a great team of managers working with me, and we worked as a team to make the mill in Franklin, VA one of the best in the country. The best part of the job was crafting a positive image for the company. The hardest part of the job was informing 1,100 employees that the mill, which had been open since the 1800's, was closing down. Had the mill remained open, I would have surely been there until retirement."

good,"A typical work day becomes routine. After you grasp the concept of your job description, either you swiftly meet the qualifications or you don't. Management is pretty much there to observe because you are in control almost completely. Once you have received your task, you will know what is expected and what you have to do to achieve it. The atmosphere is competitive, it was created to get great results. The hardest part of the job is troubleshooting until you become familiar with your day to day functions. The best part about the job is that you are receiving the appropriate pay for the workload."

In this position, I helped create and taught a training program for people to conduct hazard recognition audits mill wide. I really liked this job."

I got as much overtime as I wanted and no matter what you would always work 48 hours a week so you would automatically get overtime every week. This job is not for people who are lazy though. This is labor intensive work but not to bad to where it could make you so tired that you don't want to come back to work.
