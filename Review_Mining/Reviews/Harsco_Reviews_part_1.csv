bad,The Harsco way is who you know and who you blow. Horrible place to work PPE is always a hassle to get because foreman are lazy yet complain when you don’t have it. Treated unfairly one slip up and your hated by all lead people. They don’t care that about your outside life or if your sick. They claim family is everything but yet make you work ungodly hours. Favorites are chosen and will get treated better. No matter how hard you work you will NEVER get a thank you. If you have a family don’t work here. This company expects typu to me robots that don’t have feeling don’t get sick and can work in extreme heat and extreme cold would talking any breaks
bad,Do Not Waste Your Time Horrible Management and managers with Mental Problems that is causing this job to be always posted. They will let you go for no reason and you will have wasted your effort. They let people with personality defects run this company.
bad,They get you way out there to get you to be a helper. To pick up trash sweep mop and do janitor work not a welder position and the worst thing is the pay 15
bad,The job itself is challenging and exciting. The management is by far the worse I have ever experienced. They work their hot end employees to their breaking points causing them to quit and find other jobs. Will not hire anyone ahead of time to fill the spots causing schedules of all the hot end employees to be screwed up. They call you every day your off to try and get you to come in and help out. They will never let you know ahead of time. Certain employees get special treatment and get to play the system with no consequences also causing all of the other employees to get screwed over. I would not recommend working for harsco of blytheville unless you feel like being screwed over time and time again and would like to work 7 days a week with phone calls of being asked to come in on your days off. Also every piece of equipment at the blytheville site is junk. Maintenance will not fix the issues just put bandaids on everything which in time is going to cause someone to get hurt.
bad,"No performance culture - Double Standards,  no formal reward policy, No performance based pay, No transparency. Top management is confused."
bad,"The business is under severe economic stress due to the global steel and energy trends.  "
bad,"Union employees are payed well. Actually make more than the supervisors or superintendent. Benefits are crude at best. In three years working there, i saw two district managers, two superintendents, a maintenance supervisor, and two production supervisors go through the door."
bad,"Micromanaging, morale killing sweatshop. zero teamwork. Unmanageable expectations, you need to take care of safety on your own hands because they will try to make you work in unsafe conditions"
bad,Une très grande responsabilité pour ce poste   mais  2 heures de trajet aller-retour à faire par jour.
bad,"I worked in a company with old machinery, my job was to fix/maintain machinery working. I had to climb ladders and fix issues in high or tight areas, used multiple equipment/tools."
bad,They will fire you if you have an medical problem and don’t bring a doctors note  I was in the hospital and was not coherent when I left so I could not get a doctors note I had to have someone drive me home and my admission papers were not enough to save my job.
bad,harso is a good contractor with a lot of talented people the project I  was on was over a year in when I got their an spent most of my time finishing projects that were mostly completed witch made my job realy easy and upper management treated me very well all an all it was a good experence
bad,Currently struggling in a difficult economy.  Largest division of the company is for sale.  Other two divisions are doing fairly well.
bad,Other than good pay and benefits.  This was not a good company to work for.  Threatened with holding back pay when you tried to leave the company.  Was cussed by email and phone/text by management.
bad,Company was great to work for before they change management. Management tell lies and will walk right by you and won't speak.
bad,"pas de vision à court terme ni même à long terme, incroyable"
bad,"I loved it here at first, but the mandatory overtime began to wear on me. I mainly enjoyed getting my hands on so many different welding applications."
bad,"Harsco seemed to be a company that didn't really value it's hard workers and instead passed benefits onto people who lacked drive, who did minimal amounts of work and who enjoyed giving as little effort as possible while still keeping their position in the company. This goes the same with all recent takeovers of Harsco since then too including Brand Energy and Infrastructure Services UK Ltd and Lyndon SGB By BrandSafway."
good,"Start the day with safety meeting, work on break"
good,"12 hours work,no regular day off."
good,There is no advancement for job placement and the managers are corrupt
good,"Muito boa empresa, muitos benefícios, porem pouca chance de fazer carreira."
good,"learned how to load trucks and package item properly, management was good and friendly. co-workers were doing their jobs nice and properly, it was pretty fun getting along with employees"
good,"Companhia onde os estagiários tem a oportunidade de crescer e aprender, além de adquirir uma bagagem profissional imensa."
good,"One of the cleanest shops I've ever worked in quality was good managers and supervisors and leads were great, the work hours are great. All in all a good company to work for."
good,"Fast paced workplace, outside in the element very dirty and alot of walking ...suggest having a good pair of steel toe boots. Potential to learn a lot"
good,dit is goed te noemen bij harsco verder geen opmerkingen
good,"There are much better companies to work for. If monotonous work is the only thing, you are looking for, then Harsco is the place for you to be"

good,"Étant de poste je commençait le travail soit a 6h, 10h ou14h"
good,"Esta empresa é muito boa dá muitas oportuidades, aprendi muito com ela e os funcioarios."
good,"My group here was great to work with and my two immediate managers were beyond great. However, the GM makes very poor choices and knows very little about how his company is ran."
good,"I have to say I learned a lot working at Harsco. Unloading large equipment that were loading by what seemed to be amatuers most of the time, so safety was practiced all day everyday. I enjoyed my team and co workers, everyone got along except when temp workers were hired and most of the time would only last a day or so because of very poor work ethic. The hardest part of working there was sorting through large steel and aluminium equipment in the Vegas heat during the summer and having to work through the winter down pours of rain and even snow."
good,"Good work ethic goes a long way, moving up definitely takes time though. Leads are understanding and are willing to hear your views on the job or assignment. Supervisors are everything they are expected to be but can lack understanding an employee's personal life issues."
good,Harsco was a good company to work for never had problems. I always enjoyed my work and i appreciuate he experience that Harsco Metals has gave me.
good,"I enjoyed working here, every day we would all laugh and joke around threw out the day but we would also get work done. the only thing i didnt like was we only worked eight hour days and i didnt make much money at all."
good,ok company to work for if you want to be around a steel mill and make half what the mill employees do. I wouldn't care to ever go back to this company.

good,"Managing all maintenance and production."
good,Having worked at harsco for 38 years it was a good place to work with a lot of on the job training. Management worked with you for advancement with job permototions
good,One of the best companies I've ever worked for. Knew what my work assignments were and was left alone to do them. Worked my way up to three weeks vacation and was able to take them when I wanted due to my union seniority.
good,Not bad company to work for has its ups and downs. Benifits start day you start. You get paid vacations and company has great 401k plan. Medical plans are not costly either.
good,"I learned how to multi task my work, my coworkers look out for each other,and  working in a safe and clean environment... there is really no hardest part of the job,  the most enjoyable part of the job is we will get rewarded by doing a job or task well done.."
good,Awesome work place would like to go back and work there again but I got layed off.The hardest part was the walkie talkies and no one communicating.
good,"Harsco represents a typical diversified manufacturers company.  With its multiple manufacturing facilities, Harsco provides plenty of opportunity to grow with the company."
good,I learned more in operating Oracle System and IMS-Internal Auditing Procedures. The hardest part of the job is when you are receiving customer complaints against delivery schedule and when they do not agree for damage return materials to be invoiced.
good,it has good benfits i learned alot it was a fun place to work.mangement was not all that good they had here picks.
good,Forte culture d'entreprise d'un groupe implanté en France depuis de nombreuses années.
good,"Harsco is een bedrijf waar ze open staan voor leerlingen,"
good,Great place to work  for the pay and benefits but there is a lot of layoffs which causes a lot of new hires. You feel like you are always training someone.
good,"Talk to the shift before about what has and has not been done so that you can plan your shift. Complete a pre-start check sheet, keep in contact with your dumper driver so that you can move as much debris as possible. i enjoyed driving the shovel and seeing the work you have done once you and the dumper had removed the debris."
good,Fantastic people.  Let me be creative.   Management offered challenges which was great.   Long hours.   Miss my staff.   Management offered plenty of flexability.

good,"- long hours but great compensation"
good,I had the best time with all of the people who worked there. The typical day work was easy. management is absoutly great no fault with the management there. The hardest bit about the job was getting the right thing in the the order. The most enjoyable part of the job was that is learning the basics .
good,I worked with scaffolding. I put it up and took it done for the steel works in Scunthorpe. It was hard work and alot of hand balling. I enjoyed the job and the pay was good.
