bad,"the little guys are the ones hit the hardest and fecal matter rolls down hill "
bad,"the company's majority workforce is on strike because upper management wants to eliminate retirement health care and life insurance, make drastic changes to overtime compensation, nearly eliminate 401k contributions after already eliminating pension and hike up health care cost. Momentive doesn't care about its employees, go here at your own risk. you have been warned."
bad,"Wow, now that is what i call getting more bang for the buck. In 22 years in the chemical business I have never seen a QC Tech loaded down with so much responsibility. Basically they want him/her to be a bulk material handler, material handler, production worker, warehouse worker, and then somehow to actually find time to be a QC Tech. I bet they want this person to do all these jobs for the wage of one. Unbelievable. As a current R&D Lab Tech I pity the fool who would agree to do all that without making at least $50,000 a year, thank goodness for SC."
bad,Used to be a good place to work. Don’t have to worry about management trying to fire you over issues that should’ve never seen the light of day. Power plays from insecure people.
bad,"No advancement, poor management, unprofessional, treats employees terrible"
bad,"The plant manager is a tyrant and a bold faced liar. Operations supervisor wasn't any better. Refused to move people up the scale even with 4+yrs at the facility and all positive evaluations recommending movement. Management knowingly put operators safety at risk with no remorse. The two previously mentions managers would lie to the ehs lady about what they were going to have ops do, then have ops do blatantly dangerous jobs on the weekend when ehs wasn't around. When reported they denied any knowledge even though operators were working off there orders."
bad,Do not waste you time with this company.  Keep looking for your sanity.
bad,"Worked at the lab in Charlotte, NC.  Typical routine rubber physical property testing.  Was promised advancement opportunities and management never offered any until the day I turned in my 2 weeks notice.  Even at that point HR informed me I probably couldn't trust my manager to actually do what he was promising at that time."
bad,Bend over backwards for a company that will only take advantage of you every chance that it gets.  You are never rewarded for going above and beyond what is asked of you and if you receive a raise its the same raise that is given out to all other employees.
bad,The work environment is harsh many chemicals and now there taking 401k $ away and forcing us into horrible health care provider
bad,"First off, they literally throw you to the wolves with essentially no support and set new hires up for failure. I was hired in as a customer account specialist and the functions of the job were clearly misinformed by the hiring manager. The hiring manager actually was extremely negative during the interview and stated all the terrible things that were going on in the business such as plant closings and lack of material and very stressful environment. A typical day was processing purchase orders that customer faxed or emailed in for new material. I learned in this environment and especially my department that favoritism was at the forefront of the group. My manager was highly unprofessional and had decided early on that they did not want me apart of that organization and provided no support, structure or game plan where I might be successful. The manager was very rude and inconsistent with expectations early on that it would take several months to the better part of the year to become comfortable as told by the trainers and other personnel and demanded that I get everything almost immediately after training. My co-workers for the most part were unprofessional and regularly used foul language on the floor with no consequences or repercussions from the manager. My co-workers were unsupportive and equally rude when I required training to learn the ropes of the job and be successful. The most difficult part of my job was the overall lack of support and encouragement. My co-workers and team could care less if I was successful and did nothing at all to assist in my learning and development."
bad,"If you work in the right areas (most dangerous), there is great money to be made. But, the hours are long and weekends are mandatory.And the dangers are real. Mostly great people to work with. Every contract with the union, the company wants to take more benefits away. Going downhill fast."
bad,The work week is Monday through Saturday 8 hour shifts. The quality of training is poor. The supervisors are the laziest people in the company. Its a hot place to work. The company provides uniforms. To get into this company you go through a temp staffing agency and its difficult to get hired in. It has a high turn over rate.
bad,"Hard to maintain a healthy lifestyle with the schedules and hours worked."
bad,"Each employee should have opportunities to grow- not just managers favorites. Offer more projects ( Six Sigma and such) to all employees, not just chosen favorites. Listen to employees suggestions and ideas. SOPs should be the standard for all customers no matter the tier. Help Account Managers grow even the lowest tier customer accounts.  "
bad,"good paying job with questionable health and safety practices. An, us versus them, mentality between work force and management. Constant game playing."
bad,The facility I worked at was in poor condition and very unsafe. The appropriate amount of resources were not provided for proper upkeep. The corporation was not profitable and went into bankruptcy protection. The work life balance was bad because people had to work more than one job.
bad,I learned a lot from my fellow employees great bunch of people to work with. joined the fire brigade and got more great training. The company changed hands 9 years ago and the work environment has not been the same.
bad,"Overall great place to work wages are good and the people I work with are helpful, changes are coming and I don't know what the future holds for Momentive."
bad,"The worst part of working for Momentive is the bureaucracy.  So much red tape to get just the simplest things done.  Meetings, meetings, meetings.... Meetings about upcoming meetings.  Not sure how anything ever gets done. Claim to be customer centric yet all actions are opposite of that with the exception of a few people."
bad,"Fist off, there are a few good things about the company.  There are several great people working here.  Operators are very knowledgeable about their process and are generally willing to help out when you help them understand what you're asking of them; however, the great people who work there are always overshadowed by the lack of vision, and path forward by the upper management.  Not only do they not give promotions (only 1 in the 4 years I was there in my group), but when they say you are performing everything above your grade, but you just need to prove it (why do I need to prove what you just said I'm doing?), it shows the lack of support from managers is ""outstanding"".  They like to keep hiring 'replacement' managers to manage the work of the people, but they don't replace anybody who leaves and continue to expect their employees to pick up the slack without getting anything for it in return.  Instead, you get higher health premiums, no increase in vacation, lower 401K matching, a pause in raises for a quarter in order to make the fiscal year balance out (poor executive management if you ask me) and more work.  "
bad,"There’s a high turn over due to aging plants and labor disputes. I wouldn’t recommend a long term plan here, however this company is a great place to learn about the chemical industry."
bad,Company not very supported of their employees. Management and Sales personnel did not work as a team with support staff.  Made for a stressful environment.
bad,"Currently recovering from a strike. Challenging environment to get things done. Need to drive significant cultural change but very difficult. Comp is good, work-life balance is good."
bad,"The corporate plan is largely hidden from all below executive level.  The plant level, at the plant I work at, is very inexperienced, they have trouble making decisions."
bad,"GE was a great place to work! Was developed and provided opportunities to learn."
bad,"The  work environment has changed since the days of GE. Investment, Management and culture are totally different. More attention on leverage the growth."
bad,"Union job which has become very stressful due to constant cuts to pay, benefits, vacation and 401K plan. Shiftwork is very hard on me personally and also on my family. Nights, weekends, holidays."
bad,Works on a multitude of projects ranging from battery electrolytes to ion exchange recovery to Aspen modeling of distillation trains.
good,"I found that the balance between work and personal life here, is extremely unbalanced and very difficult to adapt to."
good,Punch in suit up. Tool box talk. Read production logs Assume control of systems. Work safe. Hardest part of the job is never seeing family and the best is paying my bills.
good,"It was a typical summer landscaping job, weed-eating, mowing, and painting. Learned how to operate small and large mowing equipment, and how to work in extremely hot, and humid conditions."
good,Company is driven by financials. Emphasis is on safety buy very little money to spend on safety related items. Very slow advancement of Operators and no clear patch for advancements.
good,"Momentive is organized into two operating companies, Momentive Specialty Chemicals Inc. and Momentive Performance Materials Inc., which maintain separate capital structures and publicly report their results. The company serves its customers through three operating divisions:"
good,"Company is stuck in their old habits of when they were part of GE.  Too many GE workers still there for it to really advance."
good,It's a great job. Just can't do swing shift any more. I worked hard for this company. Even went thru a long 3 month strike and still remained. It's just the time for me to make a new path in my life
good,"This could be a great place to work, but needs new management and workforce. Career advancement seems to be more about who you know than what you know."
good,"Fundamental good products, but a mountain of debt.  Best GE Talent left and financials aren't there to continue the culture.  Relatively stagnant room for advancement.   Built for big volume but market only supports small wins.  Small wins take time and investment, and funds are short."
good,"As a Sap HCM consultant,have learned so many things from this organisation,with the help of very supportive co-workers."
good,"Started off on a great foot at Momentive, but it became clear that management was not all on the same page.  Maintenance of the R&D building was terrible as exhibited by leaky roofs and other problems.  Eventually drive out by trouble with the culture (although this was mostly related to my specific sub-group)."
good,I do not with to review this organization.  The business is great and the employees as well.  I enjoyed my time there and learned a ton from my colleagues.
good,8 to 12 hour shifts depending on the section of the plant you are working in.  Go to supervisor and get jobs to be done for the day.  Set the departments up to run by delivery material to and from the warehouse.  Uniforms are supplied and maintained by the plant.  Vacation is accrued as well as sick days and personal days.  This is a Union Plant and Health Benefits are provided.
good,"•	Managed order management & customer support activities across plants"
good,"Management is not really focused on new growth markets as it has to streamline operations and remove outdated technologies - 50 year old lumbering technology is not to say the least cannot survive well in a fast and aggressive market seeking for top notch technology,  This company is barely making its head above the waters."
good,"Knowledgeable site leader with strong six sigma/ lean manufacturing background. "
good,"Up until November of 2016, the union had worked with the company to establish a very fair wage and benefits for employees.  The continuous shift work schedule is rough on the body, soul, and family, but the pay made the job worthwhile.  Unfortunately, the company, in an effort to cut costs, is refusing to maintain the standards of pay and benefits while aiming to reduce overtime."
good,"Being the inventory control for the largest building in the plant was challenging. I learned about the importance of daily routines and improvements. Management was not an issue and co-workers were, for the most part, very nice. The hardest part of the job was the annual inventory, which was also the most enjoyable when the inventory was a success."
good,"Great company to work for. I wished that they hadnt moved away to North Carolina, because I would've stayed with the company. I love my Manager. My co-worker was easy to get along with."
good,Everyone at Momentive is friendly and cheerful. Most have been with the company for a long time and you understand how deeply they care for Momentive after only a few days working there. They are collectively trying to do great things around silicone chemistry and it's a joy working with them.
good,I am paid well for my position of chemical operator. The only problem I have is the working hours which are swing shift. Other than that it is not a bad job at all.
good,"They pay well and the work is fair. Overall a very good job. Flexible hours including 8 and 12 hour shifts, first, second, or third shifts as well. Management is fair."
good,"I work as a Contract Engineer through Planet Forward.  I have working at the Momentive Site for two months.  So far, working for Planet Forward has been enjoyable."
good,IT WAS A FABULOUS COMPANY.Well versed in all types of work permit system.physcically checking of jerry cans drums for cleanliness and loading of product as per the instruction of control room.
good,"Boa. Permite grande aprendizado."
good,"I come in every morning do my job and if I have issues more than most helpful in showing me how it is done. Loves the atmospher and the people and everything the taught me as I was there. "
good,"Good work life balance, but very behind in technology"
good,"A Momentive é uma multinacional com ambiente agradável de trabalho, em que os colegas de trabalho se ajudam mutuamente em prol dos valores da empresa."
good,"Working on   “SYNTHESIS OF HOMOGENEOUS CATALYSTS”"
good,"une journée de travail typique : "
good,"I wear many hats.  I do from clerical work to packaging and managing inventory.  Work daily on our system we use SAP.  I love helping others and enjoy learning more and more on SAP,  The culture is pretty laid back most people have been there from 10-30 yrs.  The hardest part of my job is to move up in the company.  I miss being a CSR working one on one with the customer.  Although I do many customer related service such as putting waivers in Vault and maintaining all machining and inspection reports.  Overall i love my job as i said i do so many different things my days go by fast."
good,"As an intern, I was given minimal oversight which allowed the creation of projects to prosper. Management was always there to help and assist. I was given enough responsibility to really feel part of the team."
good,"Working within the team enviornment, with the exception of one or two people, has been wonderful.  The manager, generally, does a great job of keeping things going well and he/she does not micro-manage.  The freedom to schedule life events such as Dr. appointments, etc. is a welcome bonus working within the team.  Feedback is given when asked for, both career wise, and also when talking about projects, or research.  The down-side or 'con' about this company is it seems like they don't know where they are going.  They have difficulty retaining employees not only due to a lack of job advancement, and benefits offered (christmas bonus, vacation, etc) but also due to some employees degrading the culture of the work enviornment."
good,Momentive has a culture or safety and productivity yet nearly everyone manages their work with a little bit of time for fun and games. My managers have always placed some weight on my development and have done what they can to ensure I stay focused on improving myself and adding value to our team.
good,"No geral a empresa é um ótimo ambiente para se trabalhar. Possui ótimo salário e benefícios. Só deixa a desejar no plano de carreira para os funcionários, o qual não existe, ao menos na planta do Brasil. A cultura de Segurança é inigualável, pois já trabalhei em várias multinacionais e nenhuma foi semelhante. "
good,Momentive is a company that believes in a team effort. I work with my team and we collaborate with other departments and teams to figure out issues and streamline business processes.
good,Its a very good company. fast growing and production materials are in quality.  i was worked as a filed operator. have tpo maintain batch process with quality. we are doing products are fully satisfied with customer. safety is very important on production area and over all plant.
good,"I would recommend working there for a young man or woman just starting out in life. The shifts are varied. Some are rotating, others are continuous 7 day a week and then time off. Alternate weekends off."

good,"It was an internship while I was doing my graduate course work. For the first time, I was able to use my classroom knowledge into real-world. The most interesting part of the job was to analyses the various data using SAS and other economic software."
good,Very good place to work.  The Chemists and engineers I work with are extremely knowledgeable and easy to work with.  The technology management team is good as well.  My only complaints are there is much labor unrest for the past 8 years.  The unrest creates an uneasy and sometimes unproductive environment.  I don't have a lot of faith in our upper management due to the fact that we have declared bankruptcy in the past and I don't see a clear path on how to reach their visionary plan.
good,"I loved working at Momentive. I would love to be given a second chance.I have  twelve years of distribtion, QC lab, EP Lab and Spec lab experience plus experience with the prduction units."

good,Momentive Performance Materials is offers a unique work environment. The Highly diverse community of professionals enhances the experience. They provide great opportunities for entry level professionals as well
good,Hexion or once momentive is a great place to work.  Management is a great group of guys that are laid back.  Safety is a big topic at Hexion.  They strive for this.  Benefits are so so.  The work is challenging and fun.
good,"Ambiente de trabalho bom, tenho contato com muitas pessoas, muitas pessoas gostam do meu trabalho da minha competência."

good,Momentive offers a clean work environment. The pay and benefits are well above the norm in the area. Coworkers are friendly and we worked well together as a team. Management(engineers) were hands on and offered a lot of support.
good,"I only worked at Momentive for a summer, but in that short amount of time I learned a lot. I spent most of my time in a lab in the R&D building at the Waterford location. I had to learn to use the equipment and about the chemistry behind what I was doing.I designed my own experiments and was given almost free range to do what experiments I deemed necessary. The culture is one with a huge focus on safety, and everyone is willing to help each other out, leading to a very enjoyable place to work. The management was very open about what was going on within the company, and where they see the company going in the future. The hardest part of the job was the learning curve in order to figure out what materials you are working with and how they work."
good,"O dia de trabalho é muito corrido, mas sempre dando suporte a todos que precisam. O aprendizado foi muito bom, temos a oportunidade de aprender muito com várias áreas, ambiente de trabalho agradável."
