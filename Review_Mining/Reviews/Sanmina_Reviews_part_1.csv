rating,review
bad,"make sure you ask for job clarification, was never told what was expected and never received one on one training, trainer was too busy to do one-on-one"
bad,If you want to work around incompetent management with low pay then this is the company for you. Management and HR are unprofessional and will make up stories and lie. Worst employer ever due to the manager and HR at the time. When i got hired i should have ran like people told me but instead i learned the hard way.
bad,Worked for 8 months as A temporary employee solderer and was promised a full time position and never happened. I had to find some stability so had to leave.
bad,"This place does not appreciate hard working, dedicated workers. Get sick and hospitalized because you have health issues and they get rid of you because you should still be at work even though your in the ICU for a week and are medically excused. Poor management poor pay long hours short breaks place isnt a good environment."
bad,"Recursos Humanos es deficiente, Gerencia es pésima, es una empresa que no aprecia a sus empleados te.desechan en un abrir cerrar de ojos como si fuesces desechable pero muestras estas ahí te exigen como indispensable, no recomiendo trabajar ahí, mil veces Jabil"
bad,Too much politics and many old-timers that are resisting to new idea for improvement. Not much of support from management in running an assigned project.
bad,"Ten years there and no raise, they make you take 20 days off unpaid so far this year. And I'm way underpaid! Hate it. I don't recommend it to anyone. Had my expectations high and got let down, had an injured eye on the job and there taking there time paying me, beating around the bush, it's been 4 months and still nothing"
bad,If you want to work for a company for 5 years+ without a pay raise then by all means apply with Sanmina. If you want to work in an environment where there is nothing but gossip and stress by all means apply with Sanmina. If you want to work for supervisors that have zero managerial experience by all means apply with Sanmina. Don't make the mistake of being stuck in a dead in job.
bad,"Management does not care about their employees."
bad,"Sanmina was solely about making OTD and would purposely sho bad product knowing it would be returned. Quality was last a over safety. Quality was a reactive department, no process improvements."
bad,Una empresa con muy poco apoyo al trabajador y son bastantes malos
bad,Pocas posibilidades de crecimiento laboral y bajo sueldo
bad,"I was excited to work for Sanmina at first but quickly realized that this is not a company I wanted to work for, and I honestly don't like having their name on my resume. Many time I have had hiring managers in interviews say negative things about them which puts me in an a awkward situation trying not to agree.  "
bad,"After completing the lengthy job application online for an assembler position, the last page of this process informed me I was not qualified.  "
bad,Es pesado por que la gente simpre te esta molestando sin motivos y los gefes no asen nada ante la accion
bad,"I didn't like the people cause they were so many people  favorism each other and  many them had  attitude     and  no vacations ,make u  work hard and  faster make sure all the work is done. they dont care if you are sick or not they make u work"
bad,"This is the first place i have ever worked where it was standard practice to shout and scream at coworkers. Very unprofessional..."
bad,It is a job that pays my bills. It was a fun place to work. But does not fit my life anymore. Need to move on and branch out with new experiences. Has become a place that I don't enjoy going to anymore.
bad,"Management don’t care, people get away with doing nothing, sleeping, missing work, poor quality, a lot of mismanagement, some people can do whatever they want and others get yelled at for anything"
bad,"High expectations for job performance and no compensation for personal above standard job performance.  High stress, high volume, and ever changing standards result in more time at work.  No raises given for any reason.  Health insurance, etc., not good coverage and very expensive."
bad,"I do not like to work there , the people are not  friendly. But I need job security and benefits. Its a place to work until to fine some thing better."
bad,"Not a good place to, no raises, no bonus, 401k dont match any. People are not really nice to work with. People are quitting and management are sucks"
bad,Horrible place to work no raises opertunities are offered to feiends of management rather than long time employees often you are put in an unsafe work enviroment and you will need your own supplies on most of the jobs
bad,Kevés fűzetés. Úgy beszélnek az emberel mint a kutyával.
bad,Company was constantly causing distention. To much unnecessary OT. Had to make up holidays if you took them off. No raises in over 10 years. No advancement incentives.
bad,"Every violation imaginable in work ethics and professionalism. /uneducated leaders who simply learn as they go and snowball through experience but no fundamental knowledge of business operations, human resourcing, management or Corporate standards. Hoodwinking customers is protocol."
bad,"lwt go after working 5 days with no explanation"
bad,Nothing good to say working at Sanmina. People there were friendly but General Manager needs to go. People are let go and laid off because of lack of understanding..
bad,"I would not recommend Sanmina to anyone unless you are extremely desperate for a job.  They tend to higher older, end of career type people. The work load is excessive especially considering their pay for a buyer is at minimum 10K too low.  Management is hovering constantly and do not like new ideas or processes."
bad,"dangerous work conditons,   profits and successes are not shared with the employees.  Hadco was outstanding, but the culture did not translate over when they were purchased."
bad,"work place culture, there is non, new managers doesn't get to know their team and understands what has worked and what doesn't in the past. This company is not for the employees,"
bad,"this company is a sinking ship. Do not work here unless you cannot find a job. "
bad,"The overtime alone was grueling, but add in the fact that the pay was terrible. Management changed so much I never knew who was my actually my boss. I never really had a chance to spend time with my family because of the constant overtime."
bad,"I never had a good work day where i came to work happy and left happy, team leaders and management are very uncooperative with the needs of the employee, always hires outsource so they dont pay anything when they release an employee with or without cause."
bad,Sci的组长都是变态的。做对或错都要被骂。希望上头先培训她们怎样尊重别人的感受。员工出出进进的多了。然到你们不知道什么因素吗？还是当不知道。
bad,"Low pay - Long mandatory overtime hours with a high chance of lay-offs for the temps that they only hire these days. Worked there for roughly 3 years and was laid off twice. No real promise of becoming a full time employee due to lay offs, and call backs with your time starting over."
bad,This company does not care for the well being if it's employees. If there is a health hazard they don't care and don't bother to get the problem fixed. Supervisors are immature and unprofessional. There is favoritism and human resource does not bother in helping the employees and very unprofessional. The president of costa mesa plant even yells and uses profanity at the employees.
bad,"This is one of the WORST companies that I have ever worked for. The HR rep is terrible. She acts as is she is a manager. She is unfair. They have people that act like they are in high school and start a bunch of drama that NEVER gets rectified! People have been let go from their unfairly. YOU GET NO RAISE whatsoever. I worked their for a year with no raise or didn't become permanent! None of the permanent employees ever got a raise as well. They give you all of this responsibility and no money to go along with it."
bad,"worked there for almost 3 years never made me company!"
bad,"uma boa empresa, adquiri algumas experiencias na area de produção."
bad,"No considera ni respeta a los operadores, algunos supervisores insultan a estas personas"
bad,"I had worked myself to death at this place for a little over a year and got a new supervisor who hated me from day one and tried everything she could to get me fired and eventually got me for missed punches and allegedly being over on smt when i wasn't supposed to be except i was TRAINING. All the management cares about are numbers, the employees are really, really bad about drama. It's like being back in high school again, except you're getting paid for it and it's way worse."
bad,"Hated working here, management was horrible with communications and everyone thinks they are above another. alot of gossiping and complaining and if you choose to stay quiet they target you."
bad,"Supervisors and bosses were the worst!! I was there for 25 years. 86-2011 no raises for my last 12 years....401k match eliminated.....quarterly bonuses stopped after Hadco sold out to Sanmina.....Soooooo much MANDATORY overtime....you were not allowed to have a life....horrible raises unless you are a man...about 25 cents a year......when they used to give them....and that was if you went above and beyond! When you worked the OT, you usually were sent to another dept. because you had no work in your area....but you still had OT!!!  So many extremely LAZY people that did not understand what ""HOT JOB"" meant. Supervisors that walked around talking about fishing and hunting as if that was important...NOT TO ME....NOT IN THE WORKPLACE!!! I stayed because there wasn't much else out there at the time. I have many friends still there, however, so I hear about how nasty it still is.... I am making more money, and SOOOOOO much happier NOT being in that miserable company."
bad,"Terrible place to work. Terrible pay, no opportunity for advancement, terrible management, not to mention the actual ""job"" part of this job is so screwy and inefficient that you'll be pulling hairs by day 5. If you're happy being sad and cool with being paid just-above minimum wage without opportunity for full-time status with benefits or raises for over 6 months, then work here. But if you're like me and everyone else who is actually sane and has common sense, look elsewhere."
bad,"this place is so bad, the chairs that people sit on to eat are so dirty any human wouldn't want to sit on them. They pay people who fix circuit boards close to minimum wage; technician level skill."
bad,I hated this job the pay is terrible you have to  work long hours even overtime. no promotions after 6 months of being a temp say low pay
bad,"no respeta el valor del presonal,el servicio que ofrece de cafeteria,el transpote no son los correctos."
bad,checked for circuit board malfunction. run circuit board line and checked for mistakes in circuit sheet
bad,Not a great place to work at no advancement opportunities and no raises even if you've been there 10 yrs probably not making more then 11-12 dollars same as someone new that would start at 10 dollars. they don't appreciate their employees or give anything back. they love to push them for numbers when they need to get jobs moved but as soon as there's no work they start laying off I've been there 5 yrs started at 10.50 in swing shift and now 5 yrs later im only making 11.50 i have only received one raise in 5 yrs that speaks for itself! and i'am a great worker this place sucks and they have meeting all the time saying we need to improve but we area great team and every time raises are questioned they don't have anything to say ..don't recommend this place at all I've been looking for a new job..
bad,You work like crazy and only make 7.25 an hour not the best place to work you can not get a raise there.
bad,"This may only be for Owego's plant but the managers are always shipping people to inner-layer from around the entire plant every night. Inner-layer is doing 20hrs of mandatory overtime with the rest of the plant doing at least 12hrs and there is not all that much work in the plant, and what work we do have is all for 3-4 months from now for due dates. They have not given out a raise on over 5 years, and are not planning on it anytime soon. This is a good place to work if u need money but i wouldn't stay there to long as there is no motivation to do so of any kind."
bad,A busy day everthin was good.
bad,Substantial Inegration Issues
bad,"This company has moved to Mexico, after 40 years in Denton. The job consisted of running injection molding presses. The material handler was responsible for keeping the presses filled with raw plastic."
bad,You work a lot even on weekends and never get fairly rewarded.
bad,"A good place for newcomer and new worker to start , but career advancement is rarely happened and management is poor ."
bad,"The pay is poor, and the working conditions are subpar, but if you need a job, this might be an option. Beware when they start sending people home early, though. When they run out of work for you, that's it. They'll try very hard to find you something to do, even if that means cleaning everything in sight, but there's only so long they can get away with allowing you to do that. If you are a temp (Randstad/Coast/whatever, not direct-hire), you have no way to avoid losing those hours from your check whenever they have to send you home. If you make it to ""full time"" status - meaning you get hired on directly by Sanmina - you can accrue vacation time, but you'll have to use it to cover the days they send you home if you don't want a short check, so try not to use it unless it's absolutely necessary. I do not recommend this for anyone who needs steady income, particularly if you have children, for this reason."
bad,Horrible management with very little room for advancement.  There were no raises for 10 years and all the temps got laid off at Thanksgiving. Every year.
bad,"El trabajo no es dificil lo dificil es el personal "
bad,"Any job performed was over stressful due to pour management."
bad,"I’ve never seen so much turn over at a company. It’s crazy. At one point, they hired a program manager who quit a month later. Don’t know the whole story though."
bad,Nothing further not sure what say learned a lot of how to avoid certain bureaucracy but other than not a place to retire from..............................................
bad,You are made to take 10-12 days mandatory time off without pay every quarter.  Management yell at employees all the time.  They only hire their family or friends and promote them.  HR only sit in their offices ordering food for management and never help the floor people.  NC Fab supervisor date every young girl that is hired.   The culture is very depressing you cannot speak up or be the first person they lay off.
bad,"I moved to FortMill after the parent company sold this division to Sanmina. It was a big mistake.  No advancement, No raises in 3 years."
bad,"They really need to take some courses on motivating their employees, because continuously threating all of your employees just causes stress and unhappiness."
bad,"un trabajo donde no puedes explotar tus habilidades ya que nadie te toma en cuenta solo trabajas, cero tolerancia cero permisos"
bad,This company enjoys having dog and pony shows. When our one and only customer comes in to visit the company puts on a good show. Afterwards its back to underhandedness and doing their best to make work harder than it should be. Management is only concern for their pockets and not doing the right thing.
bad,"Poor managers, no pay raises, oh you ll get a raise every year. Coworker worked for 9 years only 2 raises. Sometimes no work, so sitting there for hours. They do not want you on cell phones but some sit and play games and watch movies. Others sit with feet kicked on tables and sleep. GM is worthless to try to talk to about problems in plant. Suppose to be an itar regulated business. Place SUCKS"
bad,Typically most of the people were easy to work with but they had favoritism going on to the ones that aren't through a temp agency. Management is seriously lacking in any kind of human decency and the HR dept wont listen to anything you have to say unless your above her. They need to bring back the other HR lady and get rid of this one. She is driving people away. Management needs to go back to school on how to be a manager and how to deal with people. When the president is swearing at other management in front of people that is not a good sign.
bad,A fizetések nagyon alacsonyak. A alap megélhetést sem fedezik. Ezzel ellentétben viszont elvárják a maximális munkát.
bad,"Es una empresa en la cual tiene muchos defectos, generan demasiadas fallas y solo les importa mostras un número de rate establecido para mantener contentos a los clientes, los jefes no saben dirigirse a los operadores."
bad,"Sanmina west valley city is horrible "
bad,No hay aumentos mal servicio de cafetería mal administración
bad,"muy mala organizacion no hay crecimiento a corto y a mediano plazo ni buenos sueldos aparte te contratan por proyecto, y la mayoria de los empleados son contratados por agencia y obviamente no tienes los mismos beneficios  ni prestaciones que los demas que no son de agencia, no otorgan plantas¡ utilizan demasiadas normas que nadie sigue ¡"
bad,"meat grinder/sweat shop, IT guy was great, the only good thing that I can say, Oracle system was okay, management was the worst I have ever seen., idiotic policies, bloated bureaucracy, no loyalty between sections"
bad,Management has favorites and is unfair! Management and the HR department are in an alliance with each other and seems to get raises. The most enjoyable part of this job was clocking out at the end of the day! The place is filled with people who like to start unnecessary drama. They keep those people working there and don't do anything to rectify the issues! They won't give you a raise BUT will put more tasks onto your job description that didn't exist before! This place is TERRIBLE!
bad,"Sanmina is a place where good employees go to die.  They have no foresight  and or vision.  Everyone in the AR Dept with the exception  of a few are there to cut you down and keep you from getting no further than what they are.  They do not want to pay what they think they should pay until they are finding out that you are leaving the company. "
bad,This sorry company is laying people off and hiring contractors to fill their positions.  The contractors they are hiring already work for the company.  No need to apply for any of the positions they advertise.
bad,"Supervisors and managers always look to blame production for their unorganized and poor planning ideas. The floor is full of people who talk badly about your performance and then complain about the effects it has on theirs. It is always a revolving door where there is no stability in the work place because they belittle the new workers, when the problem starts at the top of this corporation. If you do a great job supervisors and management take the credit and give employees a pat on the back. End of quarters are chaos and alot of tension is built up leaving room to be mistreated and great work going unnoticed. They have a ""fake it until you make it"" policy that is not written or set in stone but is used in secrecy between leaders."
bad,"Um dia típico- chegando ao posto de trabalho,consultava os E-MAIL'S para saber se tinha algum faturamento ou coleta pendente,depois inventariava alguns setores,ajustava algumas pendências no sistema (ORACLE),e logo em seguida fazia encerramento de alguns produtos a serem faturados."
bad,"A typical day is spent in meeting after meeting. The culture is under staff and over work the people who stay. Management does not support long term retention of quality employees. The only real benefit left is medical/dental and visual. Now, with a $3,000 deductible. $500 annual contribution to 401k. No match."
bad,"Es una empresa de calidad pero con malos gerentes supervisores se hacen, no desarrollan bien su trabajo, no cumplen con los clientes el sistema de operación no es el correcto, siempre hay fallas más de las esperadas, se tienen que pedir muchas firmas para alguna autorización sobre ingreso de algún producto y por lo general nadie está en su oficina."
bad,"Was getting paid the same for about a year and a half while i was there , one day got my check and the pay rate had been lowered by $1.00 nobody told me about this til i brought it to their attention. "
bad,"I am not a review writing type. I was recently approached by someone who was considering working for Sanmina. He recommended that I write a review so others can be cautioned. "
bad,I feel the upper management was responsible for the plant closure. I worked over the last ten years with no raise at all. If you treat your workers like that it creates bad feelings.
bad,Working at Sanmina was unlike anywhere else I have ever worked before. There were people that had been working there for over 18years that had not seen a raise since they started there.
bad,"I move from one system to another to test and repair 40-50 different units and get them returned to customers. There is very little management or guidance for my work, and I simply try to move the most units i can, every week."
bad,A typical day at work can sometimes be stressful. I have learned a lot while working there. Management could be better. The hardest part of the job is showing up. The part I enjoy most about the job is that I get to see my friends and coworkers.
bad,"Seemed like they continually took money away from employees.  First made us clock out for lunch, lowered shjft premiums."
bad,"Job advertised as full time, and did not state full time contract, so it was assumed it came with benefits;however, when they made the offer was the first time it was know it was contract.  It didn't leave a good impression on how the company operated."
bad,Management  does not listen to floor workers to keep the flow of work going properly.Doesn't have proper materials and chemicals to get job done.
bad,I was surprised and dismayed to learn that the majority of permanent hires were both Asian & Bosnian (who were pretty much all related) but very nice.  Surprised me for a global corp.  The rest were temps.  Felt I didn't have a chance.  Two other people I currently work with all share the same point of view.
bad,"This contract manufacturer has historically been poorly and unethically managed. Many of the staff in management positions only care about product delivery or the security of their own positions, with complete disregard for product quality and customer satisfaction. I've known management staff to perform unethical (and illegal?) actions to make deliveries and meet quotas, or to make their own respective areas look ""clean"", while the customers suffer, and worse yet, subordinates take the blame."
bad,This IS NOT  a good company to work for. There is alot of favoritism alot of management has been there 10 plus years and they dnt care about their employees they allow employees to be sexually harassed and h.r. does NOTHING. Management talks to employees unprofessionally and likes to embarrass their employees
bad,The pay is not up to par and there is little to no opportunity to advance or promote up from your current role in the company. I would not recommend this company.
bad,"I worked here for three months, great attendance and production rate, and it seemed the harder people worked the worse they were treated, I have never been nit picked so bad at a job before, I ended up walking out, and I seen this happen to numerous co workers."
bad,company shut down after purchasing from EMS Solutions and went to China 90 days after puirchase
bad,"Workplace culture  "
bad,They will lie to your face and say theres no layoffs! When I started I never missed a single day and always got good reviews from my supervisor even moved up to painting in the time I was there less then a year no lie atleast 6 layoffs! You are definitely a number and if your a temp it's a negative one.
bad,Generally it is a good place to work but very low paid system. You barely have enough to secure your life but management is good and friendly. It is recommended to work here
bad,"Poor Management, Traumatic Environment, Low Pay, Favoritism, No Room For Advancement, High Insurance, Takes A While To Get Hired On. Wouldn't Recommend To Anyone."
bad,"This is a cheap Contact Mfg'ing Company.  Product quality is awful. "
bad,"Just another job. No Room For Advancement.Favortism Is OVER"
bad,Nice place to work. Staff and Management all work together to meet clients needs and commitments. Employees all have a fair moral. Visitors are able to meet in El Paso and Cd Juarez MX
bad,Sanmina acquired our company and ran us into the ground during their first year.  Then they wanted to hire me back for 25% less and told me that I was overpaid.  I walked out and got another job for even more money easily.  This company totally underpays everyone for what they do.
bad,"Lot of working hours, management does not keep their promise. If you shows management you can do something new that will be yours, more work keep added up.  Sometime you get yell at for doing or saying something wrong to customer."
bad,Stay a way. I have been working a year with the staffing company and Sanmina hasn't hire me on yet. The process to be hire on take over a year. The pay such and you will never get a raise.
bad,"I gave them 3 years and was passed over for promotion 3 times, never got a raise and people there told me that they have not had a raise in 8 years.It's really gone downhill since Sanmina bought out SCI, I worked in the SCI side."
bad,"The Owego Sanmina site is closed."
bad,"Financial analysis and reporting"
bad,I enjoyed the company. The employees where very friendly and helping at times. The supervisor was very understanding when it came to personal life issues if I need to take off but not if consistant.
bad,"I learned alot when I worked at Sanmina, they did take the time to train. There is no job security. There were no pay raises the whole time I worked there."
bad,"Llegaba a capturar devoluciones, en las horas de comida cubria los puestos de recepcion, embarques, altas y bajas de mercancia,si no habia surtidores me ponian a mi y si habia material perdido me mandaban a buscarlo"
bad,"need an job you might work 3 days or 7 days an week and 3 week later be laid-off co-worker are great, The hardest part is knowing if you are going to work next week"
bad,"No real training. Sneaky management. No inclusivity. Nepotism.No raises given. High turn over rate. I was never given a real, formal SOP to perform my job.  I relied on someone to train me or find out the information on my own. I do like a small few of my co-workers, but the others I do not trust at all, and that includes management.  Most people have to threaten to leave or actually leave the company and then come back to get a raise. I have learned a great deal here and met some nice people. But I see no growth here and with no raises, it makes no sense to stay or plan to retire here. I feel like all management is fake and will tell you what you want to hear in your face and dog you out behind your back. Unprofessional."
bad,I was there a year and a half and we went thru 3 GM's. All of upper management was wiped out. Some guys were there for over 8 years with no raises. No cost of living increase. They don't care about their people on the bottom making it happen.
bad,The company went bankrupt last year from financial burdens due to a high turn-around rate. They had very poor management and as a result were constantly having to hire new people due to people quitting.
bad,"The company does it's hiring through staffing agencies and, the chances you'll be hired permanently are very slim. Many of the people I worked with were never hired and had worked through the staffing agency for, in some cases, a year or more. However, should you be hired into the company the pay increase isn't very much and, you still won't have benefits as the company only allows you to work 37.5 hours a week (under 40 hours, no benefits.)"
bad,Been an electronic assemblier at Sanmina for 19 years. Management could need some improvement in communicating with their employees.......not always on the same page. Very rarely give raises.
bad,"The MNC Company is the one of the leading manufacturing in CARS"
bad,"llegar temprano a recibir turno saludar a los amigos despues ir a la junta que nos hace el supervisor para saber en que producto trabajaremos llenar papeleria checar que las maquinas esten en buenas condicciones para iniciar el turno "
bad,"Lack of leadership at plant and corporate levels, forced to take time off in order to make P&L look better"
bad,Too many dead weight hired here because  of connections. Good people always end up leaving cause management do not have corrective actions towards employees who are not competence. Benefits are horrible.
bad,"As far as I'm concerned, it simply wasn't an incredibly memorable experience and every day seems just incredibly punishing for what we're asked to do. On top of everything the management and overall atmosphere doesn't contribute to the very tame work environment."
bad,"As a blue collar worker, I watched as mgmt chipped away at bonuses, shift premiums, and all other perks for hourly workers.  When one dept was forced to work mandatory overtime and complained about it, they put the entire plant on mandatory 20 per week overtime. I once worked 17.5 hrs OT one week, leaving early one day due to having the flu, and got written up for missing 2.5 hrs OT. "
bad,"Having worked at Sanmina SCI for almost two years I can say that it is not a great place to work, but it is a good place to start in a manufacturing environment. "
bad,They bought the corporation and ran it into the ground. The greed of upper level management was a major problem. The benefits declined annually. Annual raises dissappeared.
bad,"I worked at Sanmina for almost 10 years. The benefits got worse year after year. Management was not supportive of the staff. I was promised multiple opportunities, none of which came to fruition. The work environment was toxic. There were multiple problems at the plant and management was never held responsible despite the fact that revenue and profit was down repeatedly for four straight years. The moral is extremely low and there is no support or encouragement from management. Salaries are much lower compared to salaries in comparable positions at other companies."
bad,"aprendi muchas cosas una de ellas que las personas solo friegan cuando ven que puedes llegar a ser mejor que los demas y que te ponen cada traba para que no avances, y si logras avanzar el ambiente se torna mas dificil cada dia."
bad,"Product above employees. Some people are great, but too much old boys club."
bad,"A super toxic atmosphere. Everyone is miserable. Bad local management, corporate is worse. STAY AWAY,"
bad,"Very bad work environment.  Management was not receptive to autonomous decision making.  Under the PM manager the workplace was very hostile and negative.  Program managers were unable to think independently and outside the box.  The PM Manager expected projects to be ran according to the way the manager ran projects.  No autonomy to run projects according to what was more efficient for the actual PM in charge of the project.  Facilities filthy and dirty, including multiple mouse traps and roach traps in common break room areas.  Broken benches and dirty water dispensers in break rooms as well.  Break rooms not kept cleaned and refrigerators were old dingy and run down.  Cubicles filthy and in disrepair and company provided laptops were outdated and broken."
bad,"El trabajo en Sanmina está bien, el ambiente laboral es bueno, se aprenden cosas nuevas, pero las prestaciones son malas, la cafetería y el servicio de transporte son un asco. 🤮"
bad,It used to be a great company until it became sanmina - the management as a whole is horrible. They cut jobs and cut out all the talent they had. Even customers wanted to pull their work.
bad,The pay is insanely sub par. The work culture is absolutely horrible. If you aren't clicked in somewhere with someone you will be harassed until you end up leaving.
bad,"In the Enclosures division, it wasn't a positive environment."
bad,Would reccommend to someone in need of a work. Would return at a later time. Good benefits if hired into the company. Good management at this company.
bad,"Work multiple stations by yourself, management doesn't care, no advancement, everyone is underpaid, 30 minute lunch with no food places nearby, high expectations."
bad,Co-workers were good people. plant management was okay but corporate management did not know how to keep the facility profitable. Now the plant in Owego NY is closing.
bad,"Good place to work,but no room for advancement.No yearly raises given.Need to be more generous to entry level employees.Need to give better benefits.There was plenty of overtime which was good."
bad,"I liked my job as a Quality Inspector.  But their structure and foundation is not good. When the Plant Manager tells everybody in the meeting the same thing, you know there's problems.   Hardest part of the job was having to give out OBA's and people talk to you any kind of way and you really can't say much about it.   There's way to  much favoritism and that causes a lot of problems between  the employees. We have not had a Supervisor since March 2017. The one that just started is the 6th one.  We can't keep Quality people in"
bad,"Overall sanmina is a good company to work for but a certain lead tech over the synopsis test area is a very bad micro manager and has a very rude and mr know it all attitude that is why I quit, management will not do anything because they are so hard up for people, you are on your feet all day long bending up and down."
bad,"Sannmina Corporation in India does not have a good management. The work life balance does not exist there."
bad,Worked 20-30 mins a day on a daily basis. Management is lazy. Very old school style of managing at least in the facilities department. I learned how to kill time doing nothing. Hardest part of the job is getting along with other lazy co-workers. No push or drive.
bad,Good clean working environment.  That is about all I can say.  No drug testing or policy enforcement.  Management needs to follow the rules and enforce them.
bad,i have to work like that slave with out vacation because i was temporary. just it. every day i had to stay in my feed more than 10 hours
bad,"Mucho trabajo, los jefes o supervisores son unos inutiles y no saben hacer bien el trabajo"
bad,Prepared and clean machined parts to be packaged. I learned how to use a micrometer and operate a few machines. The management wasn't very good they keep all of our bonuses. People from all over worked there and we still found common ground. Working the 12 hour shifts. When we had potluck and all ate together.
bad,"company moved out of state, management didn't communicate with work force during the transition."
bad,"An amazing education in how NOT to run a business. There have been several names over the door in my 18 years at this location, but Sanmina is definitely the worst. They do not communicate AT ALL. Nobody has any idea what is going on, including Site management, because Sanmina is running the place from a remote location. We are currently going through a layoff/site transfer process, and they still are not telling anyone what is going on. When Sanmina management does come to visit, they hide in their office all day."
bad,"Good place to work."
bad,"pues bien el ambiente de trabajo,aunque muy bajo el sueldo y muchas horas,mucho trabajo,aprendi diferentes cosas aunque el supervisor no me dejaba,aprendi muchas cosas.."
bad,"Not a diverse company at all, and not enough pay for the work performed. Overall the job is ok so but definitely not good for a career move. I would not recommend this job to others."
bad,"The typical day at work is usually slow, and boring. I have a lot of down time... The workplace culture is very secluded. My first day my manager introduced me to the people closest to my cubicle, but no one else."
bad,Not a place to work at if you want a career.  No room for advancement.  Going above and beyond gets you no where for this company.  I do not recommend working here.
bad,el nivel academico no importa se te asigna cualquier puesto
bad,This place has a poor way of taking care of there skilled labor force.  I was hired in as a temp that exceeded 6 months of time.  Every employee that was there less than a year were all temp and at one point they walked out 3/4's of the temps in one day.  They also drastically underpay there employees.
bad,"I have been working here for almost a year. I work third shift and I have worked first shift. You basically get no life and all you do is work, sleep, eat and use the bathroom. First shift is always great because you start early and leave at a decent time to be able to enjoy life. But not third shift you spend most of your days sleeping and getting up to go to work. NO LIFE..."
bad,"sok munka, nincs elismerés, saját karrierrel törödő fönökök,"
bad,"My Supervisor was a idiot. He would harass you every day for no reason, the HR person would do nothing about it. had to finally quit. Sanmina did not care about their people."
bad,I loved most of the employees and worked hard to prove myself. Management is very political and employees are not paid fairly as I had access  to confidential files. Not a place to grow your career and internal processes are very out dated. Not much training and long hours. High level positions are great but others are underpaid and overworked.
bad,If your young or in college it is a good place to get training and get out. Good and hard working people go anywhere from 8-15 years without raises. Plant vp says 70% of people in shift meeting got raises last year. He is out of touch with reality. It's all about politics and who you know.
bad,No opportunity for growth. Sweat shop type work. Very routine assembly line type work. Pay is not good and management could care less about the employees.
bad,I did thoroughly enjoy my position within Sanmina/SCI as a Human Resources Employment Representative but the leadership in most areas of the plant is lacking and many of their processes are not up to par. Zero job security.
bad,Long days. Most of the people are not happy with management or working conditions. Benefits were being cut every year. Hard to be happy when management is not happy.
bad,"Normal working environment, equal hiring opportunity"
bad,Training is limited to on line videos and company has a high lay off rate. Skeleton crew of long timers remain after lay offs. Shady practices and record keeping
bad,Some days you would be busy and other days there would be nothing to do. At times they would hire people like crazy and then 6 months later they would lay people off
bad,"Enjoyed friendships with co-workers. In over ten years, had one new plant manager that called a plant meeting and said he knew nothing about what was being manufactured, that he had been a manager in a brush factory in his former career, and he was going to need everyone's help. He was the best manager I saw in this a high-tech electronic contract manufacturing factory. The other managers had no comprehension of anything more complicated than a flashlight."
bad,"Un dia comun,"
bad,"es la empresa a la cual me dio el medio para desembolverme y madurar en mi caracter,aprender y tener la experiencia de  "
bad,"Work is fast-paced. They have periodic layoffs.  "
bad,This company leads you to believe everything I'd going well before you're hired.  The division is failing and hasn't made profit in years. No raises for hourly employees in the last 6 years.  And it doesn't matter how hard you work.  It's who you know. Poor employee morale and even worst management. Would not work here unless it's your only option
bad,Not a hard job at all just the way business is done is not too great.
bad,"it was ok to work there. the management was understandable , effective communication. the pay was not good but pays the bills and livable. the benefit was not good."
bad,Company is not process driven so sales activities are always different from deal to deal.  The lack of consistent process flow which makes selling arduous task.
bad,The Job is a good bou you do not get pay for all the things you really have to do to process your part and there's Nothing for you to look for in benefits or raises or Bonus I feel that it's all about upper management and not workers.
bad,muy buen comedor facil acceso y buen ambiente de trabajo
bad,Good company for learn . Poor salary and poor Process . The people don’t have the knowledge for the Position.  Great process to learn and move out on the future
bad,Great place for all the technology but awful managers trying to run it. The managers will jump on you for no reason just to put on a show they have issues and take it out on the employees.
bad,Buena empresa para trabajar un tiempo. Estable pero algo tedioso
bad,"1. Work and life balance is good"
bad,Poor training. Bad maintenance. Very low wages. Too little Breaks.
bad,This is inappropriate to require the review of a former employer to be able to post a resume. This has no bearing on my looking for a job. Please do not make this a requirement.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend Sanmina if you are looking for a stable job. They have massive lay offs all the time. Some of the upper management crew was very rude. I don't want to say that my experience was all bad, as there are some great people at this company."
bad,The culture is far worse than any company I have ever worked for. They do not support Management who try to enforce Policies/procedures/discipline. Inmates run the asylum!
bad,"Typical of Contract Manufacturing, people are working in a very lean environment with long work hours. There appears to be significant turn-over and a lack of training for new hires. ."
bad,Es pesima opcion para laborar ya que no hay aumentos de salario.
bad,"Mala administración, poca consciencia de calidad, salarios bajos sin aumentos anuales."
bad,I did not receive a raise in 10 yrs! I liked the work I did and I worked with good people that I will miss. It was poorly managed. I saw many lay-offs and know they are shutting the doors for good.
bad,"Most of my professional knowledge i got it in Sanmina i appreciate, how ever being in a high position as BUM for 7 years and not got a salary increase is ridiculus."
bad,The was my very first job and it paid like it. The people are sneaky and the management was as well. Didn't like the atmosphere there at all. The pay was competitive and in the worse way.
bad,"Despite my ratings of this company I enjoyed working here. Its complicated. Its not for the average worker. If youre not motivated or willing to learn, this company is not for you."
bad,"Expect to do the same things everyday. Start off learning the typical day then learn a few things here and there. But just because you get better at your job and learn new skills doesn't mean you will be compensated. Like most places, there are people here who are nice and welcoming, and people who are snotty and arrogant."
bad,Low income with high benefits. Stressful work environment with alot of mandatory overtime. Did not show signs of advancement. Most of the people I worked with were 20+ years or temporary (even temp for 3 years)
bad,Medical Device Production. Low Income job with horrible insurance and horrible hours. No room for advancement and no raises. Poor communication between management and employers
bad,"Interesting place to work at least to say. Most of operators and workers are stuck in this ""whatever"" culture almost I don't care. Reason for this can be found in low pay and 10 years no raise and no recognition at all for anybody. So work hard and care is same as perform at minimum requirements and get by. How ever there is group of employees and low level management who really cares about production but any success or progress they made is quickly swept by upper management to show of to their bosses. More care is taken to keep facility main isle shinny for show then keep machinery and equipment in decent shape. If you look deeper you will see lack of ownership. One of customer comments are ""Wannabe manufacturing""     "
bad,"La empresa es buena, se trabaja cómodamente, con excepción de los descansos que suelen ser entre semana y es muy difícil obtener uno para realizar alguna actividad personal."
bad,A global company with thousands of employees that is run by a small clique of people.  The work environment was very challenging as they did not value work/life balance
bad,Just another pay check no advancement no pay raises bad management did not care about employees well being at all no future
bad,"Sanmina was a great company to work for , it was clean the environment was very nice, I enjoyed working with my coworkers and the managers and supervisors were very nice supportive and helpful and I could ask them anything or go to them with any questions without feeling bad . I also enjoyed what the company did"
bad,"las oportunidades de crecimiento son pocas.. casi nulas."
bad,"While I definitely enjoyed the experience of learning a new position and getting to develop healthy relationships with my coworkers , i also saw a complete lack of experience from my leads and supervisors. There was never any proper training done for any of the new employees such as myself at the time and there was little to no support from supervisors. There was a definite sink or swim mentality there which caused turmoil and unrest within my assigned department leading to lack of communication and a total lack of team work."
bad,"Was a creat experiance working for them,"
bad,"Terrible communication"
bad,Division financial management not willing to take on challenges and more interested in shirking training and orienting employees to function as a team.
bad,SANMINA has gone down hill....this company doesn't know which way they are going. They treat people like disposable razors...use them until no longer usable...toss them out!!  it gets busy...bring them back...then again toss them out!!
bad,pues buena fabrica pero tiene mala seguridad no ai ESP y pues como no m ofresen planta no es un trabajo muy estable 
bad,"hard work, not good money, Ins was only good thing, worked 7 days a week for over a year a no raise, they would not give raises because they were not making money but they bought new places all over the world"
bad,The job is seriously not worth the aggrevation and stress. Other companies are willing to pay more with a lot less stress and less of a hectic work environment.
bad,"Behind on the times. Old machines working towards new ones. Just going to the scientific molding side of things. Upper management, tool room and maintenance need to go to class and understand scientific molding"
bad,There is a huge lack of communication and very poor management. The pay is horrible and there is no chance of ever getting a raise so there is nothing to work towards.
bad,2102 when i started we had 20hrs overtime that they told us was mandatory. we were also told that the more we learned and certified in different areas we would get raises . never happened ! But being said i loved what i did and enjoyed my co-workers and majority of my managers and supervisors. very sad the owego plant had to close.
bad,"no real support from management they want you to do more with less and is very difficult to add headcount even when its a valid request, management does not have a firm hold on the facility issue are brushed off will try harder next time mentality"
bad,"My role kept changing and shifting; the message/direction of my work kept changing and shifting.  My first manager was amazing and was the reason why I accepted the job. When he left, my role changed significantly.  While I was there I had three other managers -- that's how much difficulty they had in retaining management.  My last manager had never managed before and CLEARLY had never been given any instruction.  He tried to build personal  i.e. being your friend, rather than professional relationships and I had zero respect for him."
bad,"The job I perform is a great job. I truly enjoy and excel at doing it. However, I hate doing it for this company. Although my reviews are great, my attendance is excellent, I receive more and more responsibility every year, I have not advanced on paper. This company asks for your loyalty, yet the do nothing to earn it. Management knows nothing about integrity. Personal greed is their only motivation."
bad,"Worked on all electronics.  Worked  injection molding equipment, die cast machines, and sonic welders.  Also worked on temperature control, and robots."
bad,"its manufacturing so it to be expected fast pace & repetitive, Very easy work but you must be very detailed oriented. My boss is good but the company itself will not give you promises, it only gives you an open end contract so you will never know when your last day is, no benefits, only 2 week vacation, no sick days, no raises, there might be other job opportunities but still no raises just a different job or task"
bad,Typical work day is about 10 hours.
bad,"Fue una muy enriquecedora experiencia, sin embargo ser ingeniero de piso implica mucho desgaste físico y emocional"
bad,"Pues la comida y el ambiente era tranquilo algo que me agradó de SANMINA. Aprendí muchas cosas más tales como identificar fallas de diferentes índoles y más que encontrar la falla es, conocer también cómo funciona los circuitos para entender el por qué y no buscar al azar. buen ambiente de trabajo con mis compañeros, solo faltó que hubiese más oportunidad de crecimiento para con el esfuerzo crecer como trabajador como todos los grandes de una empresa. De ahí todo esta excelente y es la rama que mejor sé hacer y más disfruto . Adentro Había una cultura de respeto y trabajo en equipo,la parte más difícil era las metas laborales que no siempre eran fáciles pero los retos son pruebas de superación personal."
bad,"Acceptable working conditions.  Very low pay.  Minimal training.  Very little opportunity for advancement.  The working environment was fairly low-key, as long as quotas were met.  Most, but not all, levels of management were of a good nature, however, some were patronizing to their favorites, sometimes at the expense of other employees."
bad,This is a low margin industry and so there were not a lot of frills.  It is fast paced and you need to be flexible in order to cover a lot of areas.  It was fun.
bad,"The work is easy enough, and the people are decent.  Overall, it's a clean, pleasant environment.  However, the pay is low, and there are people who haven't received a raise in ten years.  That, and they call and tell you to stay home one or two days a week due to there not being enough work for everyone."
bad,"I am very disappointed with the news that I was fired today.  Over the past thirteen years I have been a loyal and dedicated employee.  I was almost never late and had no disciplinary violations.  In addition, my managers all gave me many nice words of praise--  saying that I was a good employee and a hard worker.  "
bad,This job is very easy and easy to do. I feel the the management does not know what they are doing. The co workers i have met are great people alot of retired people.
bad,"Competition to win/retain customers force sales/management to over commit. Constant changes of management and direction. Constant efforts to satisfy customers at any cost drives constant changes in plans."
bad,"El ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno, los procesos están muy bien definitidos (están certificados en ISO 9001) y en general el balance vida privada/laboral es muy bueno (es raro que se trabaje los fines de semana)."
bad,"I mean its a job.  Not one that was liked but it was fairly stable if you stayed on the good side of management.  It got me through my first two years in texas, not very well but i appreciate that i guess."
bad,They change management several times each time you felt less and less important to Sanmina.Also they had people in supervisors roles who talked bad about the employees to other employees who were part of their click.So many good people got laid off for know good reason and they never replaced the people they laid off only put more and more work on the people who were there.The head guy use to tell us during plant meetings that we should be grateful that we still had a job.Intimadation
bad,"Work hard with no raise in 12 years , miss manged , the people were great and liked the job I had as far as the company it self and management not a good company"
bad,"Overall Sanmina is a relaxed environment with nice people.  Once you learn what you need to know, which will not take long, your days will be predictable and low-stress.  Flexible hours, below-market pay with little opportunity for advancement with poor benefits is the major down-point."
bad,"Best supervisor I ever had."
bad,Overall poorly ran company with few benifits for hourly employees. Base level employee kept in temporary status for extended periods up to 2 years
bad,This company very rarely hires full time employees  There are a few perks from time to time to keep the employees at bay so to speak. This is just a place to work if you need employment.
bad,"In the beginning the job wasn't bad, just more work than hours in the day. After the first restructuring, my new boss didn't know how to perform the functions of the job and I knew more than they did. I didn't agree with some of the policies with how they treated customers at quarter end to improve their own bottom line. Just glad I am not there anymore, hope they've gotten their act together."
bad,"Es estresante la presion que se recibe diario por la urgencia de los productos con alta demanda,pero mas lo es tratar con compañeros negativos y grilleros, ademas de que no se tiene futuro solo que te rebajes demaciado con tus superiores o que tengas parientes o camaradas en puestos mejor pagados."
bad,"Entrada a las 7:00 y salida a las 14:00, Aprendi a manejar personal maquinaria y equipo, El gerente se regia por normas y no daba oportunidad a negociar, Excelente comunicacion con mis compañeros, Cuando bajaba la produccion te regresaban y no te pagaban el dia, El ambiente de trabajo."
bad,It was stressful to work because Management hoovered behind people and you felt like you were always being watched. The people were the best to work with.  Management did not care about the employees. The only thing they cared about was getting the product out the door. Quality was not even important to them.The management took too many shortcuts that put the plant in jeopardy No raises for the last 8+ years..
bad,"I really enjoy my job as a process technician, but very often I have to stop doing my job to help out on the floor because they don't have enough QC's. They have been trained a lot of QC's but they don't stayed. The company needs a lot of new people, but people comes and go all the time, they don't stay. This is a big problem at Sanmina."
bad,"El clima es algo pesado, hay buenos trabajadores pero nadie sigue reglas ni estándares."
bad,I loved the shift I worked. I would have liked to come in later. My Co-workers were nice for the most part and I learned new things. When I worked overtime I made great money. People are getting way under paid and not becoming full time employees fast enough.
bad,"cuidar maquina de siplace, empatando componentes para la producción de tarjetas electrónicas, trabajo en equipo,"
bad,"Typical day requires you to clean out machine before starting shift. Fill machine with product and fix any issues that arise within the machine."
bad,"empresa muito boa de trabalho, mas sem chance de efetiva. acho que deveria dar mais oportunidade"
bad,"great people to work with"
bad,"As a PCB Designer i have acquired knowlege with respect to the interaction with Plant team on various aspects of PCB Design from Stackup definition, till Gerber generation and fabrication.As we have fabrication facility in house,it adds more advantage to speak to them at the earlier stage of the design."
bad,"tengo los conocimientos basicos en el area de mantenimiento:"
bad,"•Provide support in capacity analysis and dimensional analysis.  "
bad,The company is very organized and the co-workers I had were easy to work with.
bad,doc control .. updating all the changes in the new doc and preparing new doc..
bad,"Uma rotina legal que voçe aprende novas coisas , a direção te ajuda os colegas também se comprometem a ajudar e o salário otimo."
bad,"Sanmina in Turtle Lake is average at best. I enjoyed the people I worked with especially on my shift. However there is high chaos and you never know if you'll be sent home due to lack of work or if you'll be expected to do the work of 2 people because they're shorthanded."
bad,"Although I enjoyed the 22  years I worked at Sanmina, The last couple of years have been stressful.Constant changing of management, and layoffs with little or no warning made it difficult to work. Now with no prior warning we were informed that our plant is closing and everyone will be out of a job!"
good,Nesecita abrirse más a subir puesto
good,Fastpaced and in a warehouse. Co-workers are extremely friendly and don't mind helping in daily tasks. Very progressive company as well. Leading edge technology in the industry.
good,"un dia normal en el trabajo al llegar, checar , acomodarte tu equipo de trabajo e iniciar el día laboral."
good,"Employees at Sanmina are great, management has a way of dismissing any sort of loyalty and or compassion towards the work force they have under them."
good,"Management lacks the ability to Own it's Products and Procedures and Utilize and Value it's employees Strengths and Contributions. There have been No Raises in over 7 years... I enjoyed the type of Work and Variety of work I performed. The problem was being Stifled by Out dated Processes, SOP's and  System Duplication or Redundancy."
good,"Sus palabras son nadie es indispensable, y solo te usan por beneficios"
good,"El giro laboral de la empresa era de reparación de tablillas, se reparaban aproximadamente 1200 tablillas por turno."
good,Very interesting if you have never done this type of work.  Long work days and weeks. Overtime for months out of the year. Poor management. Interesting place to work
good,"benefits are practically non-existent, good workers go10 or more years without raises, if you tell on co-workers or are in tight with bosses you might get a raise and favoritism is worse than any place I have ever worked. good for training and nothing else."
good,"El 99% del personal operativo está subcontratado y se hacen mensos para no darte planta aunque tengas record perfecto de asistencia. Para obtenerla necesitas esperar hasta más de 2 AÑOS! recibiendo únicamente sueldo, ah y en turno nocturno te obligan a trabajar 6 días no 5 como marca la ley si no vas los 6 días te ponen una falta. Que se vayan al diablo!"
good,"I loved the people I actually worked with. The job itself was mentally boring but did supply the needed routine and income. I learned a lot of things about exposing circuit boards and working with a wide variety of different types of people. I was very knowledgeable when they decided to let me go. I think the hardest part of the job was being bored because of the repetitiveness of it. There really wasn't a ""normal work day"", some days would be slow and methodical and other days were totally wild with very hot jobs going through the plant and lots of them (this was the most challenging and most enjoyable days for me)."
good,"Inicio de turno dar flujo a los pendientes, ubicar material en almacen, recibir material. Aprendí a saber leer documentos como: facturas, pedimentos, carta porte; a manejar distintos tipos de montacargas a saber llevar la presion de trabajo. La direccion o administracion hace lo que se le antoja en cuanto dias de descanso, dias festivos, no dan a conocer las ganancias reales de la empresa, manejo de outsoursing (subcontratacion) todo gracias esto a que el sindicato es fantasma, no conozco nadie que este inscrito a el. Mis compañeros con la mayoría me llevo bien, trabajo en equipo ,un buen ambiente, que en ocasiones lo entorpecen los jefes. Lo mas dificil es soportar a los jefes que te traen de un lado a otro quieren que sepas de todo, todo por el mismo sueldo y ascender de puesto pues casi imposible; al menos que seas barbero, conocido o cumplas con un curriculum demasiado exigente para un sueldo que no es remunerativo."
good,Empresa com varios clientes. Grande diversidade de produtos eletroncos
good,"Es bueno el ambiente de trabajo, es fácil el trabajo, solo que para poder subir, debes ser muy amigo de los jefes, las nivelaciones son muy malas por no decir que no tienen"
good,"Empresa que tiene muchos cambios y mejores salarios solo para el personal de nuevo ingreso, ya que para los que tienen tiempo laborando en esta empresa es muy dificil continuar con algun tipo de crecimiento laboral"
good,"El trabajo es bueno y el hambiente igual pero es muy poco valorado "
good,"After 20 years I am quite cynical. Management treats manufacturing personnel poorly. Used to be advancement opportunities now its bottom line driven. Attitudes of patronizing condescension towards front line worker hangs over the company like an oppressive fog. Morale and wages are low, requiring many people to have two jobs. Younger workers are fleeing and older workers are worn out and retiring early if possible. If I were a potential customer I would look elsewhere as quality is sacrificed for volume. The whip cracks hard."
good,poor managment no communication at all conflicts between supervisors lead poor production bad management especially after shifted from atlanta
good,"demasiadas normas en cuanto cinco eses y poco seguimiento a las mismas, falta mucho por desarrollar la cultura del respeto."
good,Horarios comodos apoyo con transporte incconforme con el tienpo que tardan en darte la oportunidad de planta de la empresa
good,"Ok....many good years....due to management the last several years were difficult to say the least."
good,"poco respeto"
good,Although I enjoy the majority of people I work with (supervisors included) Sanmina does not  pay accordingly compared to other employers in the area. The take or leave attitude expressed from upper management is degrading. (Promises and lip service doesn’t pay the bills nor does nepotism). Good experience for an individual to gain knowledge in order to progress into a satisfactory employer .
good,"Fast pace, clean room environment, skill development place ."
good,"When I stareted here, it was, I thought, a nice place to work. The other hourly employees are nice, but management has no clue how to run a business. They've been in the red for so many years that theyare finally shutting the doors a little later this year!"
good,"I was working for Sanmina almost 5 years. Within those five (5) YEARS, I did not a penny pay increase.  The managers wanted their employees working harder, faster to meet their demands.  But not willing to give employees a pay increase."
good,"It is a typical job with quotas and deadlines. You'll be able to learn skills that won't be needed in daily life. Management is horrible. Coworkers are your family, they will look out for you if you allow them to."
good,"limited motion/ constant alertness , troubleshooting capabilities,etc. the job is ideal for someone presuing to improve there soldering skills and have a love for electronics , however the growth in the company is limited"
good,"To work here, you need lots of patience and understanding. Work culture here requires us to flexible as at times we are required to forgo your personal time after office hours."
good,Estuve trabajando el turno de la noche llegaba a las 10 checaba entrada a piso y regularmente revisaba mi carrito de tarjetas buscaba fallas mediante lo equipos de pruebas funcionales y de pines y tambien mediante inspecciones visuales.
good,"Centrally controlled from San Jose, CA with local focused management team. My management team was made up of great individuals. Managed multiple shifts which required a lot of overtime and being at work weekends and nights at time."
good,estabilidad un poco baja al igual que el salario poco compañerismo y falta de comunicacion falta de herramienta para trabajo
good,"La empresa es realmente agobiante, practicamente todos los niveles se trabaja hasta cuando deberias descansar. Lo rescatable es que mucha gente ha sido capaz de crear una carrera larga dentro de su compañia."
good,"Management done as they wanted. They did not go by the handbook. If it didn't benefit them, it was a no. The only good thing about working here was I got paid."
good,"Es una buena empresa para empezar a trabajar y adquirir experiencia, sin embargo los sueldos son bajos ya que no corresponden a las actividades que desempeñas y las promociones no van de la mano del incremento salarial."
good,"Foi um aprendizado muito significativo embora, as pessoas muito educadas e agradáveis de se trabalhar;"
good,El trabajo enpesaba a las 7am salida a comer era a las 11am de lunes a viernes. Se tenia un horario de entrada mas no uno de salida ya k siempre abia mucha carga de trabajo y por ende mucho tiempo extra
good,I currently work for this company they only start you off 7.50 an hour. They over work you for little to nothing pay. Employees that's has been there 10+ years is barley making ten dollars a hour if that. The only advice I would give is only go there if it's your last result they hire felonies and all out there. There is no room for advancement at all the hold the good positions for people they no. It's a good schedule Monday through Thursday but from 5:30 am till 4:00  pm is no joke.
good,"good company. good people.. but I am moving back to Dallas, Tx"
good,Good hard working people. No personal  life when working with Sanmina. I worked for them for over 19 years. 
good,"Buen inicio de vida laboral, pero poca facilidad de promocion por trabajo."
good,Hard working every day at work. Fun to work with co-works. My duty is to test new production built pc boards and debug the failed tested board to component level.
good,-Perform debug system failure and down to component levels
good,"I was very pleased working with production personnel, however, management did not support the needs of the people. As a result, quality suffered and we began to lose several customers who expressed their displeasure with the workmanship of our products. Getting the work out at the nth hour always seem to be their priority rather than addressing the root cause and making whatever corrective actions were necessary. Many of us felt that the potential to achieve defined goals was always there, it just that no goals were ever communicated effectively or made visable. Planning and proper scheduling were factors that were missing."
good,La verdad la gente es muy envidiosa es un ambiente muy pesado y estresante
good,"It was busy when I started working there in January, 2019. Few weeks later it got really slow. Not much to be done, employees in my department sat around, waiting on machines to work on. The training process is average."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo era malo con los compañeros, pero el personal administrativo si apoya."
good,"Pay tends to be lower, benefits are average. I did get the freedom to make improvements, assisted in getting lean manufacturing techniques through green belt and black belt program"
good,"Easy company to work for. Enjoyed doing my work at sanmina, The hardest thing is to come on time, due to traffic workers can't predict their time exactly where GM want exact minute to come."
good,"Se pasa el día rápido."
good,Depending on many variables job can be very trying. Job can be very physical. Accuracy is critical in maintaining inventory's. Data input knowledge key critical.
good,"The supervisors are great but thats about it. There are engineers working here without a degree, everyone is getting paid almost nothing, and all the money they save from labour goes directly top tier people. And there is no job security."
good,"Operate waste water treatment"
good,"In retrospect, this was a very comfortable job. I started the day looking through shipment records from the delivery services we used to confirm I was receiving the parts I needed for the day, checked on the process of my projects on the line and quoted parts for new customers. It was a simple job. Good people worked there and the atmosphere was bustling. I would go back."

good,"I am extremely thankful to have worked for Sanmina.  I learned many very valuable lessons that are not taught in a class room.  Depending on the quarter, contract, and date of the month, hours could be extremely grueling on staff, but there were always opportunities for more work and cross training.  I learned how to work as a team, and how to handle conflict with others.  I made life long friends with some of the hardest, and smartest, working people you'll ever meet.  The thing I enjoyed most about my job was having some autonomy after spending a few years on the assembly line.  I have respect for the people involved in that industry; although, it is not so forgiving to many."

good,Inspecting circuit boards and fixing the issues by soldering or shutting down the line. I learned that i can solder and that i enjoy sitting at a desk. Management was awesome there cause there were not many QA's. My co workers helped a lot by teaching me tricks for soldering.The hardest part was when i worked 5am-5pm six days a week. Then they took away our 30 min lunch. The most enjoyable part was the money to be honest.

good,"I enjoyed my time at Sanmina but due to the economy they were not hiring full time, only contract. The salary was good.  The plant was very nice and the work was challenging."
good,"Al principio trabajé solo, manejando el área de plásticos y otros proyectos metalmecánicos de manera simultánea, sin personal a cargo. Inciando el 2014 por un crecimiento rápido del área de plásticos, me hice cargo sólo de esta área, contrataron personal nuevo a todos los niveles y el rampeo fue retador, me tocó formar el grupo de calidad, entevistando y seleccionando al personal, luego su formación en los 3 roles para cubrir las necesidades de la parte de calidad (auditor de procesos, OBA y técnico de calidad)."
good,"This is a good work place for the young, just starting out in their careers. The departments are small so each member will get to handle multiple functions. A lot of processes are manual, but because of that you really learn a lot about what you are doing and why. It is a great place to gain experience to move on to bigger, better positions. This is what a lot of people have done in the three years I have been here."
good,"En este tipo de empresas todo urge, siempre hay demasiada presion por atender las quejas y necesidades de los clientes, y por la constante rotacion de personal nunca terminas de capacitar al personal que trabaja en tus lineas de produccion, y el equipo de trabajo que te asignan para trabajar termina por desgastarse y como es dificil que otorguen plantas, terminan por renunciar"
good,"Sanmina-SCI is a very diverse organization, it is also a very strenuous and stressful place to work. If a person is ready to buckle down, work extremely hard and long hours, and learn a lot about the company and the environment, then Sanmina-SCI is definitely a wonderful place to work. I had the priviledge of working there for 3 years and learned so very much about the workings of a manufacturing plant. I received knowledge that cannot be obtained in a book...knowledge that I am very happy to have gained."
good,"Circumstances may have since changed as I was employed before, during, and after the merger of Sanmina and SCI. No raises for 2 years, blamed merger for that. Gave a quarter raise after the hiatus. Promised not to outsource production lines then shipped 2 to China and 3 to Mexico. Zero chance for advancement."
good,The project I am working on is challenging but also very rewarding. My supervisor is great but upper management seldom encourages people on the manufacturing floor.
good,"Esta de senté dentro de lo que cabe un buen empleo, hay gente que le cuesta mucho subir de puesto, otra no tanto, es desesperante que tus nivelaciones cuando subes de puesto tardan más de 1 año, los encargados de los distintos departamentos no pueden dejar a un lado sus diferencias para poder enfocarse en el trabajo y eso afecta la productividad de muchos"
good,"Un ambiente relajado, y en veces acelerado. Tienen una paga decente."

good,"This is a great starting job for anyone who wishes to gain experience in the manufacturing industry.  It is pretty much bootcamp because they will overwork you.  Once you've gained enough experience, get out."
good,"Sanmina was a good company to cut my teeth on and the $ was decent, however to meet their numbers each quarter, they would lay people off, then in several cases, hire them back at later dates.  Perhaps that was the nature of the industry, but always struck me as unethical."
good,"Poco entrenamiento"
good,"Empresa noble donde cada dia es un problema distinto y se buscan formas para resolverlo de forma definitiva, la mayoria de mi experiencia la logre ahi con compañeros que creci junto con ellos y aprendi mucho de ellos para ser la persona que soy hoy en dia."
good,"-Se aprende a trabajar bajo presión"
good,This job is a great stepping stone in life but as for a career building company(unless you have a degree) it is not the greatest place to work. The pay is very low considering what you are doing.
good,"Job is easy but the communication level to employees is terrible. Took WAY longer than 3 months to be hired on and when they promised me something as a worker, they never came through."
good,"It was fun at times, the issue I had was working on Sunday's being Mormon, this was a huge issue.  I felt neglected.  I worked for this company for over ten years, enjoy my time."

good,"Its a good place to ""start"" but the company does not respect the time schedule, its only work, work and more work."
good,Upper management doesn't seem too concerned about the little people working the manufacturing floor.  There have been no raises or merit increases in 5+ years.  Employees are increasingly asked to take on more responsibilities without compensation.
good,"Dear Sir / Madam"
good,"A empresa é boa, com benefícios compatíveis com o mercado, porém como não tem produto próprio, depende da demanda dos clientes, criando muita instabilidade para todos."
good,I have a lot of fun make a lot friends over there and good personal people over there because they move don't last long
good,"Use to be a VERY good place to work . Before Sanmina bought out Hadco we got pay raises , had bennifits worth having , The company use to treat there employees as if they mattered , now we have gone over 9 years with no raises and no supplies to do our jobs with , maintenance has no parts to fix anything ."
good,Sanmina was a fast pace work environment.Great co workers a real team driven dept will to help each other. I would say the hardest part of the job was getting complicated board designs to the manufacturing floor in a timely manor just due to there data size and number of edits. The most enjoyable part of my job was easily the people I worked with.
good,"Una empresa muy bien cimentada, tiene demasiada rotacion de personal por falta de promociones y buenos sueldos."
good,The electronic technicians thought me a lot about troubleshooting.
good,Wonderful lower level employees.  Overpaid micro-managing upper level employees.
good,"Working with this company I learned that how a contract manufacturing works. I have no issues with the management but in my opinion the company needs to reconsider how they treat their employees.  Perhaps I am new to contract manufacturing and that could be the reason I have a different opinion than some of the other people already working in contract manufacturing. I think contract manufacturing places are good for the new graduates.  Regarding the Co-workers, they are very co-operative and helpful.  The most gratifying part is that my work schedule allows me to balance my work and the family."
good,Interacted with customers and internal departments while simultaneously reporting any deviations in original agreement needing to be implemented.  Concisely reviewed and created sales order in customer portal in order to schedule order onto internal system using Intuitive system while monitoring and confirming ship date.

good,"Trabalho focado em teste de computadores na linha de produção."
good,"A typical day would involve getting into the building and having 5 minutes to get prepared to start the days work. In most cases this would involve cable cutting, cable prep, cable manufacture and testing. I learned that meeting deadlines were a team effort which in turn allowed orders to be processed on time or earlier than originally agreed between the client and the company. As with all businesses management dealt with all aspects of the company and orders which we processed in order to meet a customer deadline. My co-workers were great people to work alongside in the factory as well as good friends outside of work. The hardest part of the job was the manufacturing processes as at times the parts did not always fit and we had to find a way to make it possible. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of getting the orders completed by the deadline or earlier."

good,Creo que el trabajo es bueno pero la empresa puede ofrecer sin costos grandes y de mucha ayuda para el trabajador
good,En Sanmina hay buen ambiente de trabajo sin embargo no hay un plan o desarrollo de crecimiento
good,I really enjoy working  Here the only problem is I don't feel they hold any value in their employees. And they do not like to give any raises when they are well deserved
good,Sanmina Corporation offers flexible hours if needed. You can work 4 or 5 days depending on what works best for you and work from home if they need you to or if you have to leave early for weather or plant closures.  The downfall is there are department changes that happen too often causing stress on the department and the employee.
good,This company is a good starting point. The work is very easy and by no means is it a stressful environment. Career advance is unlikely unless you have family in management positions.
good,"Le falta mejorar más el área administrativa de crecimiento laboral interno."
good,Reorganization effort occurred when Sanmina obtained SCI systems. The commerical business practices of Sanmina did not mesh well on their government programs. Critical contractually mandated positions were laid off.
good,"It was an ok job. The only problem was, they were slow alot of times getting the product out. So we had too much down time. My paychecks for some reason never made it overthe $350 mark. Other than that its was ok."
good,My experience at sanmina was fun and educational. I was an SMT operator and machine operator. The work wasn't hard at all. Quiet air conditioned atmosphere. Very friendly coworkers. Overall nice place to work.

good,"Management ok, employees are not so friendly, need to Improve health & safety. Has to be full forty hours work time. I did learn new things but need secure & safe job to be created."
good,It's a great place to work. Just not for me. I need a job that's secure and not going to lay people off. The shifts are great. Co workers are awesome. They explain everything to you in an easy waybto understand. The Supervisors are extremely understanding.
good,"I see a lot of things going on, in ways of trying to cut costs, standardizing some common things that will make a lot of duties easier, in order to spend up turn around time in the building."

good,"Un dia tipico de trabajo es complejo por que siempre hay trabajo y mucho que aprender, aprendi todos los dias que estuve en esa empresa desde los criterios de calidad en cada proyecto hasta como tratar con mis companeros y mis jefes. Las gerencias bien pero deben de estar mas al pendiente del personal que se tiene a cargo del personal porque lo mas dificil de estar ahi es tratar con jefes diferentes todos los dias esto por el cambio de proectos. Me gusto ver que en RH sanmina si te escuchan."
good,El ambiente es agradable aun que hay ciertas áreas que se puede apreciar muchas envidias falta de estructura para promocionarse ya que no cuenta con escuela que te certifique en el área que te desempeñas

good,Job orders came from New York. If no orders came in did not work.

good,Good company to work if you like fast pace. Global operations and driven by quarterly profits.
good,Sanmina was a great employer to work for. The team was great and internal control work was fascinating. The departments clashed a little which slowed progress.
good,Fun place to work. Made a great deal of friends here. High expectations from management to put in long hours regardless if the hours are productive time.
good,"This company is a good paying company with good benefits. The only problem in here is there is too much politics in the organization. It is poorly managed, and it tend to create dishonest employees. Like laxity and non productivity on the job."
good,"A typical day for me would be running reports, processing new sales orders, updating customer data bases, assisting AR department with trouble shooting errors in billing and correcting issues and supporting PM group. I learned a great deal about Oracle 11i and how orders are processed in order to assist my facility with any issues within Oracle. Our management was in the process of changing and being re-arranged. My co-workers within my facility were hard working individuals that worked as a team. The hardest part of my job was dealing with changing management staff as we were in this midst of this and it was not stable as yet. The most enjoyable part of my job was the variety of daily tasks I was responsible for and assisting co-workers, corporate and customers with issues."
good,Great co-workers with great attitudes
good,"my work experience at Sanmina-Sci. was fair. I enjoyed most days at work and i got along with most of my co-workers. I started working at a pretty good wage there but as time whent by they kept giving me more work and more pressure and the wages stayed the same. Also i would be forced sumtimes to work double time and i would get in trouble for doing so and sometimes i would not even get paid my double time. My main shift was mornig but sumtimes i would work alot of times swing shift, but what bummed me out the most was that my job would always get done and i busted my back every day so at the end they took out my 5% differential because i supposely was not working swing shift no more even when i was still doing so at least once or twice a week."
good,Check all equipment that need pm or repair for the day.
good,"Tengo un considerable periodo de tiempo en esta empresa y realmente he aprendido mucho, pero al momento de promociones y nivelacion de salarios es cuando si pesa mucho la desmotivacion."
good,Moved to a diffrent local at that time and had a job there for a little while before I decided to move back home. I have learned that I did not enjoy working there. I didnt have much of a social enviroments with the co worker. The hardest part of the job was to sit down all day. I have done masking which would required to take the electronic boards before they are taken to spray.

good,deberian de dar plantas a sus trabajadores para que se sientan parte de la empresa.
good,"Often playing catch up to provide to one main customer creates stress on employees. But overall the people are great. Sanmina is good at recognizing people who are willing to go above and beyond, however those people will be awarded more responsibility and not be compensated for it."
good,Good Job they will work with you to a point hours is good a person can work weekends and have the week to do what you need to when you are not working
good,"Prestaciones de ley "

good,"Buena oportunidad para aprender, te dan la oportunidad de ensñarte y dar tus primeros pasos como profesional."
good,Working for Sanmina was a great opportunity to work in my field of study. Everyone is very helpful and it was a wonderful working environment. I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,It is an ok place to work but do not try to make a career out of it.  There is a lot of turnover.  The work can be monotonous.  Most of the people were nice.
good,Like any other manufacturing environment long hours and hard work is required. Good and smart people works there and job stability is not an issue. They pay well but there is no time to spend it
good,"Working in a production is quite overwhelming considering that it's a fast-paced environment."
good,"Lack of career advancement"
good,"I worked for Sanmina for over 19 years total,  and most of the people including upper management were helpful and the compensation was good. Hardest part of the job was the different personalities that sometimes clash. Because it's a fast paced working environment, there was never enough time to finish all your work."
good,"Es una buena empresa, volvería en caso de que haya una vacante para ingenieros en sistemas."

good,"Morning meeting held at beginning of shift to discuss any issues from previous day and what needed to be achieved today. I learned people management skills, communication skills and computer skills  (Microsoft office). Management were always there to help when needed and the co-workers were great to work with. I became friends with many of them and still keep in touch. The hardest part of the job was reaching targets everyday consistently. The most enjoyable part of the job was achieving the targets each day and seeing shipment of product on time."

Work and personal life is flexible for short periods of time only. For example, attending a continuing education course where morning attendance is required for longer than 1 month is discouraged. The company does not give Merit Increases and in the time I've worked with this company a salary increase of any type has been small or none at all."

good,"A typical day would be a 12 hour shift on various stations. Filling in paper work in a certain format and checking quality of product. I work with an amazing group of people, who are easy to talk to and extremely helpful. The hardest part of this job would probably be being inside 11 hours of your 12. I love getting to work with the group I'm with and learning new things on a daily basis."
good,Companies use Sanmina to contract out their work.  Nice Place to work.
good,"I would start my day of coming into the lab and looking at the desk for any jobs. Once I find a job, I would go cut out the board and do a stress test then measure the insides of the board to get the specs. Do a report and package it then send it to QC. At the end of the day I would smell like metal (copper)."

good,"It seemed as if the management never shared info. The right hand didn't know what the left was doing.  It was bad for the regular employees. I was lucky because I had a set schedule and routine to follow.  The hardest part of the job was a co-worker with a bad additude and her constant complaining about the company.  The best part was the work schedule, 15 days a month and it was a full time position."

good,"En si, Sanmina es buena empresa, solo hay líderes y supervisores que honestamente dejan mucho que desear, poco apoyo y profesionalismo de su parte. Las prestaciones con Planta son muy buenas. El detalle es que pueden pasar hasta 5 años para que te la puedan otorgar, así de destaques, el favoritismo y la adulación hacía los supervisores ahí es el que te hace crecer."

good,"Sanmina is a very friendly place to work.The people work together to accomplish daily goals,Management does their best to help in resolving any work issues."
good,"Always fast paced, team oriented and sometimes fun; but when the dollar matters employees sometimes don't. You are expected to go the extra mile and most of the time all you get is a thank you when a raise or better employment conditions are more appropriate."
good,"es un trabajo muy agradable, servicios subsidiados muy bien, y es una empresa muy bien pagada"
good,"Empresa prestadora de serviços."
good,"llegar y presentarte a tu lugar para no parar de trabajar."
good,"The day begins with metric reviews, setting up daily production goals to meet on time delivery schedule.  This would be followed by one on one communications with direct reports discussing daily expectations and reviewing any obstacles that may prevent success.  After discussions to learn obstacles, I would put in place solutions that would remove the obstacles to ensure an successful day while keeping employee morale positive.  The solution would include direct reports input."

I enjoy the people coworkers and management. They are like a family to me. I have been there most of my life but I need a dependable and secure job.
good,"Overall good culture, wonderful people. Pay is below market average and there are no raises or bonus, unless you change positions. "
good,"Great team, interesting projects. Laughaubly bad 401k and expensive health insurance. Mandatory annual health check - not disclosed at the interview. Overall meh."

good,"very clean working place "
good,"i've learned some skills at work, specially operating the machine and troubleshooting how to run the machine and computer to scan the pc boards like inner layers, outer layers and via fills. Learned how to read the travelers and how to do the rework the defects on the board using exacto knife. Learned how to set up the program on application program."
good,Es un buen lugar de trabajo con muchas oportunidades de desarrollo
good,Aprendi mucho ya que no siempre realizaba lo mismo.
good,"In the beginning Siemens was a excellent company to work for until it decided to contract the Atlanta Healthcare division with Sanmina of South Carolina. Sanmina did honor the Siemens employees with there current salaries however, the merit increases were non-existent. Management made promises that was not followed up on.The effective operations of the company decreased after the transition and more so after the relocation from one state to another."
good,The team management team there was very fragmented. the workforce however was exceptional and always there to meet the companies and management objectives.
good,"a pesar que el trabajo es pesado se aprende muchisimo en Sanmina, como en todo lugar los equipos de trabajo varian mucho. Afortunadamente empece en un equipo muy bueno pero por desgracia termine en uno de los peores."

good,"Nice production floor."
good,"se trabaja de una forma muy comunicable con tus compañeros de trabajo y supervisor, en ocasiones no habia equipos funcionando para operar tarjetas, "
good,"basically I have only been getting two ten minute breaks each day working at Sanmina. I would very much enjoy having more time on breaks to eat and use the rest room if needed. I work 2nd shift but I would take a first shift job over second shift. I like being able to move around on the job rather than standing in one spot all day but I will take what I can get. A day at work for me would be, taking over the machine I was assigned to by checking the paper on the board. Then getting the turn over from the previous operator and checking all fluids used in running the press and filling them up if needed. Logging into the job on a computer, then filling out necessary paper work and doing any safety checks needed. I then brake off necessary tabs and trim the parts coming off the belt. I then inspect parts and if there good with no defects they are then packed in a basket, tout, boxes stacked on a pallet or stacked on a pallet using ply wood for layers. If the parts were to be bad they are thrown in a hopper with all excess aluminum to be re melted. If the press were to go down I then restart the press if I ran into any trouble I would then find a set up to help get the press up and running. At the end of our shift I will fill out necessary tags for the basket of parts and give a turn over to the next operator."
good,"Given a chance to work for Sanmina-SCI again, I would.  It was enjoyable to wake in the morning looking forward to a day at work."
good,"The company tends to be a little on the cheap side. Always fighting to get the tools needed to do the job correctly. Their entire focus was n the bottom line instead of the customer."
good,"Overall rating "
good,"work hard, balance my day of work with the people in production , work with process enginners, application enginners, sales, account managers, planners and purchasing this was done in the daily basis."
good,it was very laid back my supervisor was funny and understanding i wish i could get back out there.

good,"A typical day consisted mainly of debug concerning electronic circuit boards. Workplace culture was fine. "
good,Sanmina még az egyik jobb cégek közé tartozik. Ha nem lenne ekkora munkaerő hiány sokkal jobb lenne a munkához állás is.
good,This company give good environment to work with work and personal life balance. But salary and benefits is so worst and getting worst...................
good,"Typical day at work - Always have tons of things to do everyday so there is no time to slack."
good,"Es estable para laborar por largo tiempo, sin embargo las prestaciones quedan a deber"
good,En la empresa se tiene un buen horario de trabajo ademas que cuentan con todo lo necesario para poder desarrolarte en tu rama de estudio.
good,se genera un buen ambiente laboral se trabaja de una manera agradable y no se tiene ningun tipo de conflicto con ningun compañero y jefe
good,"The company is too big, relatively loose management, coordination of the various departments is not particularly good. "
good,"Sanmina is a big company with 30+ years experience in design, test, manufacturing and logistics for wireless, wireline and optical communications products. Sanmina integrated manufacturing services include complete systems and component design, industrialization, system integration, logistics and repair. "
good,"Every morning that the operator gets to the machine sometimes the operator has to finish the job that the previous shift didn't or couldn't finish. Sometimes operators don't like to work on hard jobs, and the easy way for them  to continue working so they can do the quantity required they just leave it for the next shift, without their leads concern, the when the supervisor gets to walk around and check that every lot numbers was running on time, and whenever she saw a lot number that was behind she would get mad at my shift, and even if we told her that the grave yard was the one that left it she would still scream and pressure us, and she never asked or try to figure out what was the problem. She just wanted that job out of the department. So I leaned how to finish my job no matter how hard or easy it was, so that way no one would had to have hard times, and also the time I waste on finishing that job, some one else could do more jobs. And at the end of the day everything is running on time and the other shift won't have to be stuck with that job. And the hardest part of finishing the hard job, is trying to figure out the problem, then solving it, as well as finishing it on time. The most enjoyable part is that almost any one that I asked for help was willing to help, and we al stick together until that specific job was dome."
good,"Interactive and productive at the same time. Individual space will be given for each employees. Friendly coworkers as  well. "
good,"Es una buena empresa solo que no dan la planta,tiene buenos Horarios"
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo y trabajo en equipo."
good,De sanmina aprendí la importancia de trabajar en equipo para facilitar y mejorar la calidad y las cifras de producción al día aunque eran cifras muy altas podíamos sacar la producción
good,"Buena empresa para trabajar, muy estable y con buenas prestaciones pero, sus procesos de nivelaciones y promoción de puestos son lentos."
good,Sanmina es una empresa en la cual tienes un gran crecimiento laboral y de innovación para que el usuario y clientes finales tengan un producto final estable y con calidad de servio.
good,"* Working culture is good "
good,Working with Sanmina-SCI gives you lot of experience working with people of different cultures due to the company being world-wide. During my employment with Sanmina-SCI I gained a lot of experience in the AP accounting department. I enjoyed working with all my co-workers as we worked together as a team to ensure the success of the company.
good,El trabajo es bajo presión para lograr cumplir con la producción diaria
good,Typical day come in and receive all day. Learned nothing. Management was poor. Co workers horrible.  Nothing is hard. Nothing enjoyable.
good,los supervisores aveces no saben tratar a las personas y cuando hay vacantes internas para un sueldo mejor a uno en lo personal lo asen aun lado y no se les da la oportunidad
good,"Un ambiente de trabajo bastante malo ya que se usa mucho el favoritismo y dentro de la misma área tenían familiares."
good,"Recibí acoso por parte de mis supervisores al mando a tal punto que ni siquiera al baño me dejaban ir. Tenía asistencia y puntualidad perfecta, apoyaba en tiempos extras y hacía muy bien mi trabajo, sin embargo existe demasiado favoritismo en lugar de ver las buenas cualidades de sus buenos empleados. Al final termine renunciando por parte de todo el acoso recibido."
good,"Good company overall to work for. Hard working co-workers that are dedicated to getting the job done. I enjoy working with the suppliers, my goal is to develop a strong working relationship with them that will yield the best results. The down side of the job is being micro managed to the point of loss time and nonproductive meetings."
good,esta empresa dentro de todo es una buena empresa estricta y mas que nada dedicada lo aprendido en esta empresa es hacer puntual hacer las cosas con delicadeza por otra parte lo mas difícil de esto es que no había una solucion respecto a problemas de transporte
good,"Management was strictly old school. Spent most of my time trying to repair what mgmt allowed production on pushing bad work.  I learned to be self sufficient and teach my team how to control quality efforts through their positions.  We managed to be the number one quality team throughout the division. We finally created a solid quality culture that placed good product ahead of shipments. The hardest part of my job was to deal with the Operations manager and the General manager to continue to meet our quality goals."
good,"There are 4 shifts. There are 2 day shifts and 2 night shifts. The management labels each shift by letters. A and C shifts are both day shifts. B and D are the night shifts. Whichever shift you're on, you work 12 hour days. Usually it's 2 days in a row and then you get the next 2 days off. Every other weekend you'll have to work friday, saturday, and sunday. However the next weekend you'll get off in which the other shift works."
good,"Para mi no es una mala empresa, pues te da muchas herramientas de las que aprendes y sobre todo que puedes proponer mejoras. "
good,Sanmina is a large company. The culture and environment varies wildly within departments and between locations.I was in some amazing groups and I was in some that should have been shut down.
good,"No es buena para primera opcion, Pero decente, para aquellas personas con experiencias en diferentes areas.."
good,"Las jornadas eran interminables a veces agotadoras pero llenas de aprendizajes, algunas áreas sobre todo las de ingenierías hacían muy buena integración. La gerencia fue muy inestable y existieron muchos cambios en la forma de trabajar. Tuve un excelente equipo de trabajo al ingresar a la organización lo que me permitió un gran crecimiento profesional."
good,"poor employee retention, concerns in numerous areas from pay plays to bonus structure along with mfg concerns"

good,"Me gusta mucho lo q hago, mis actividades a realizar, sólo que muchas veces se vuelve monotono, aburrido, siento que puedo realizar más trabajos, dejarme más responsabilidades...."
good,It was a fast paced job and I worked within a group of about 5 people.  We all addressed the jobs as they came up and helped each other out when necessary.  It was swing shift which allowed me the day to take care of personal business.
good,"Flexible timing, good support for girls. Still using lot of manual work no automation/ updated technology.Old team leads not willing to update their knowledge. Not willing to teach freshers on their process fearing their job security."
good,"Empresa boa para se trabalhar , porém não fornecia epis adequada , também não tinha planos de carreira , salário não proporcionais ao trabalho executado."
good,Creo que la empresa no supo administrar su preso puesto y carga de trabajo.
good,It was what I expected for a warehouse production line job. It was a very repetitious job. It is very robotic work with no customer interaction. I learned how to be a more detailed person and I loved that.
good,had a good boss and a great department coworkers.  project deadlines were sometimes unbelievably impossible.  working from home was the only way to get caught up

good,Es una empresa que da oportunidades de crecimiento y contrata muchos jóvenes.
good,Es una empresa que cuenta con buenos servicios como comedor y transporte y el ambiente es favorable.
good,"Yo aprendí muchas cosas aqui.."
good,Working at Sanmina is pretty fast paced. The work-life balance is tough because when there's overtime their is usually a lot of it. On the flip side of that coin when it gets slow you either get laid off or if you're good employee they will try to help you keep your job and move you to another area until things pick up again.
good,"Buena empresa con excelente cultura laboral, en la que se aprende algo nuevo todos los días. Empresa que se preocupa por la capacitación de sus empleados y el bienestar de sus empleados en su área de trabajo."
good,Es buena solo que hay que tener paciencia para las promoción
good,"Me fascino trabajar para esta empresa, buena comida"
good,"Mucho trabajo todos los días, muchas presión, Ahí conocí las maquinas de Fuji, NXT y Aimex. Apoyo por parte de los compañeros. La parte mas difícil, el manejo de personal."
good,Sanmina was a great company for me to begin my manufacturing experience. They are very willing to train you on anything there and further your experience but any salary or position advancement is unheard of.
good,la empresa posee beneficios al empleado como lo son el comedor y el servicio de transporte pero no quita que el ambiente de trabajo sea un poco pesado
good,"I liked working here but due to closeing out the Die Casting and CNC departments, they dont have things worked out to ensure us employees we have a garentee job any more"

good,"Before I started at Sanmina-SCI I did not know much about electronics manufacturing. I took the job to supplement my electronics manufacturing class during the summer. I worked a 12 hour shift Friday though Sunday using bed of nails testing to check that circuit boards worked before final assembly. My typical day involved acquiring necessary paperwork for any circuit boards I planned to test after I found out which boards final assembly would need after my section and would make a priority list ordered to finish all needed boards as quickly as possible. My section had a large work in progress shelf with little specification on FIFO or other schedule to test parts, so I chose parts by nearest due date for that day, then when everything that was needed was finished I switched to shortest process time in order to finish as many boards as possible. I usually finished the backlog of parts from the weekday by sunday morning when I could then work at the speed of the line or would move to another line and help until enough work built up back at my station. The work environment was calm on the weekend shift and everyone was very helpful when I had questions. Management always tried to answers my questions, but more could have been done to let me know what parts were needed each day. Hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting to move the testing devices from storage to the computer. Some testing devices weighed up to 80 pounds. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning how everything was made, and using lean tools from class to improve my process time at my specific station."
